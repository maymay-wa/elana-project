a former law student is a viable suspect in 
the green river slayings the nations worst serial murder case 
according to court documents released thursday 
the green river case involves the deaths of 41 women and the 
disappearance of at least eight others in washington state and 
oregon in 198285 most of the victims were young and almost all 
were linked to prostitution 
former law student william jay stevens ii 38 was named in an 
affidavit made public thursday the affidavit was filed to support a 
search warrant for two of stevens residences in spokane 290 miles 
east of seattle 
the searches wednesday yielded a truckload of crime reports 
maps credit card receipts 1800 videotapes 14 police badges and 
two seattle police uniform shirts other court documents showed 
stevens is serving a oneyear term in the king county jail for 
the burglary of a police equipment supply store in seattle in 1979 
police say stevens walked away from a workrelease program in 
1981 and was not located until last december when he was in his 
final year at the gonzaga university law school in spokane he was 
arrested and returned to jail jan 9 
stevens has not been charged in the green river investigation 
his father william stevens sr when reached by telephone in 
spokane on thursday said ive been advised by my attorney not to 
answer any questions 
the green river case takes its name from the river south of 
seattle where the bodies of the first five victims were found most 
of the bodies were found in the seattle area four were found in 
portland ore 
the tip to stevens whereabouts came in a call from portland 
ore after a television program last december about the green river 
killings police said 
the search warrant for a house rented by stevens and for his 
parents house said there was probable cause to believe that the 
crime of murder has been committed 
green river investigators have long theorized that the victims 
might have been lured into the killers car by someone posing as a 
police officer or otherwise in a position of trust 
one of the things that was speculated the killer could be a 
cop or someone posing as a cop king county police capt bob 
evans commander of the multiagency green river task force said 
thursday 
before stevens was arrested in january spokane police determined 
that he owned a former everett wash police car which had been 
equipped and made to appear like a real police car the affidavit 
said 
the police car had been falsely registered by stevens who had 
represented himself as the police chief of spangle a town 15 miles 
south of spokane 
part of the investigation includes a time line which traces his 
travels from seattle to portland to vancouver british columbia and 
to spokane 
the 405 entries on the 198188 timeline tended to place 
stevens in the area during the time space of a green river victims 
disappearance the affidavit said 
none of the documented contacts telephone records or credit 
card charges served to eliminate stevens as a suspect in any of the 
green river cases the affidavit said 
instead interviews and records have produced the following 
facts that tend to establish that stevens is a viable suspect in the 
green river homicides the document said 
other material taken in the searches included boxes of 1982 
newspapers portland sex crime reports and portland police crime 
synopses from 1983 
the affidavit said task force files contained several tips 
suggesting stevens might have been linked to the killings

a small plane with a stricken pilot flew hundreds of 
miles down the atlantic coast on autopilot shadowed by military jets 
thursday finally running out of gas and spiraling into the ocean 
the pilot then emerged from the wreckage and swam toward his 
startled rescuers authorities said 
thomas root a 36yearold lawyer from alexandria va was 
pulled from bahamian waters by air force parachutists four hours 
after he had first radioed he was in trouble he was first taken to 
nassau and a coast guard helicopter then flew him to florida 
for him to survive a crash like that it just sent us all into 
shock said petty officer veronica cady a coast guard 
spokeswoman we didnt expect this story to have a happy ending 
coast guard capt dr james rahman said root may have passed out 
from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit of his singleengine 
cessna and that water splashing in his face apparently roused him 
root was taken to memorial hospital in hollywood where he 
underwent threehours of exploratory surgery for possible internal 
injuries 
after the operation his condition was upgraded from critical to 
stable said hospital spokeswoman cynthia wine roots family 
requested no information be released on his injuries she said 
roots wife kathy 35 told reporters from the porch of the 
family home that her husband had been awake and talking to doctors 
she said she told hospital officials to send her husband the 
following message root you really did it this time 
the drama began about 830 am when root who had taken off from 
washington national airport about 630 am for rocky mount nc 
radioed air traffic controllers in virginia 
yessir were having a little problem up here root told 
controllers according to a tape of the conversation played by 
washington television station wrctv 
seem to have a little trouble breathing said root who also 
reported chest pain how far am i to rocky mount now 
youre about 17 minutes from rocky mount replied an 
unidentified controller 
uh said the pilot 
niner niner one three yankee do you hear said the 
controller calling the planes number 
there was no further radio contact and military pilots who 
tailed the plane reported he was slumped behind the controls as his 
plane flew south off the coast occasionally getting within 100 
miles of the shore 
military pilots and rescuers trained to parachute into the ocean 
to save ditched pilots could only watch helplessly as their aircraft 
tracked the plane until it ran out of gas 
after more than 3 hours of radio silence the plane spiraled 
into the water and root was rescued 800 miles from his original 
destination in north carolina and 250 miles southeast of miami 
the words you keep hearing are youre kidding said ms 
cady 
the coast guard said the plane went down about 15 miles east of 
the island of eleuthera it spiraled into the water so it didnt 
make the best of all possible landings said chief petty officer 
lou parris 
coast guard lt commander gary poll who was at the scene in a 
jet when root crashed said the plane was at about 7000 feet when 
it began spiraling in like a corkscrew and spinning down at about 
2000 feet per minute 
poll said the nose and left wing hit the water at the same time 
and the plane swiveled on its belly on a 360degree spin he said it 
stayed afloat for several minutes and started to sink 
air force sgt paul hayden one of four air reserve technicians 
who parachuted into the water said root was first spotted swimming 
away from the wreckage dressed only in pants and socks 
root was pulled onto a raft and given first aid said hayden 
based at the 301st aerospace rescue and recovery squadron in 
homestead about 20 miles south of miami 
he told us his abdomen is hurting a lot and we could see he was 
bleeding said hayden it was incredible he had a sense of 
humor about it 
rahman the doctor who treated root in nassau said root was 
alert and could speak well but seemed to be in shock and had 
abdominal injuries and fractured ribs rahman said there was no 
indication of a heart attack and root had no history of heart 
trouble 
its definitely a miracle hes alive hes a little confused by 
it all the doctor said 
after its distress call the plane was intercepted by two marine 
corps fa18 jet fighters when it entered norfolk naval station 
airspace at 845 am said lt cmdr mike john a navy spokesman 
the pilots of the intercepting planes tried unsuccessfully to 
contact the pilot by radio he said 
the cessna 210 centurion can seat four to six people counting 
the pilot and cruises at about 190 mph bill pierman shift 
supervisor in the air traffic control tower at washington national 
told raleigh radio station wptf that the autopilot was set on a 
heading that would have sent the plane toward bahamas 
put an airplane on automatic pilot and its going to continue 
just exactly on the course that the automatic pilot is set for he 
said 
at time of crash root was followed by a c130 cargo plane from 
homestead air force base near miami and an hh3 helicopter from 
patrick air force base also on floridas east coast said lt col 
margaret stanek of homestead a flight surgeon was part of the 
rescue teams she said

the soviet union has hired a british advertising 
company to sell broadcast rights and corporate sponsorships for the 
first britishsoviet space mission scheduled for 1991 a newspaper 
reported thursday 
the new york times said the soviets have hired the saatchi and 
saatchi company the worlds largest advertising and marketing 
conglomerate to exploit the commercial opportunities of the juno 
mission 
the mission which will carry britains first astronaut into 
orbit from a launching pad in the soviet union will be financed 
entirely by the sale of commercial opportunities the newspaper 
said that includes the sale of space aboard the soviets mir space 
station for scientific payloads 
the times reported that more than 10000 men and woman responded 
to an advertisement saatchi placed in several british newspapers in 
late june that carried the headline astronaut wanted no 
experience necessary 
if the soviets are successful in this and other commerical 
ventures a soft drink or cheesburger may be advertised on the side 
of a soviet soyuz rocket while commericals to promote a sneaker as 
the official athletic footwear of the space product the newspaper 
said 
the soviet space agency glavkosmos two weeks ago gave space 
commerce corporation in houston texas the exclusive right to 
market its goods and services in the united states 
glavkosmos has signed commerical agreements with several western 
companies in march a japanese televison network paid the agency 12 
million us dollars for the right to send a correspondent into 
space in 1991 
the national aeronautics and space administration which 
administers the us space program does not accept advertising or 
payment from private citizens for flights 
in the past us space shuttles have carried some projects for a 
fee but that practice was canceled after the challenger explosion 
in 1986 that killed seven astronauts

for nearly a year this was a 
liberated village outlawed plo flags fluttered from light 
poles activists patrolled the streets slogans covered the walls 
and popular committees did the work of city hall 
no longer 
at dawn on july 5 israeli soldiers stormed the village of 5000 
people and reopened armyrun government offices which had been 
attacked and burned by rioters in january 
this is a test case we went in because salfit had been 
portrayed as a main center of the intefadeh or palestinian 
uprising said col udi sagey he referred to palistinian statements 
that the village had been liberated from israeli occupation 
of the 420 villages in the occupied west bank several dozen like 
salfit have declared themselves liberated 
sagey head of the armys civil administration unit in the area 
said he planned to reopen its medical center reconnect the 
telephones restore postal and agricultural extension services and 
resume construction of a new road 
the first goal of the intefadeh leaders has been to cut the 
ties between the israeli authorities and the people he said if 
the economic support to these people is greater maybe they will be 
less radical towards israeli authorities 
he said he hoped if normal life was restored in salfit it would 
have an impact on neighboring villages that depend on salfit for 
services 
since the start of the 19month palestinian uprising salfit was 
largely ignored by the army because it is isolated at the end of a 
singlelane road the village is only 18 miles northwest of 
jerusalem but it is in rocky hills far from main highways and 
jewish settlements 
in january palestinian rioters forced the closure of all 
government offices and activists bedecked salfit with symbols of 
independence red black white and green plo flags and a map of the 
wouldbe palestinian state on a wall in the town center 
popular committees made up of activists aligned with the fatah 
plo faction and communist groups organized underground schools 
medical services street cleaning and agriculture 
in short salfit became a microcosm for the independent state 
that palestinians hope they can achieve if israels 21year 
occupation is ended 
there is no higher voice than the voice of the intefadeh 
declared graffiti freshly painted on a wall where the army had 
covered over previous slogans 
rafaat 29 a blacksmith talking with friends at a shop on the 
villages main gamal abdel nasser street said there has been little 
resistance to the army takeover because about 200 activists fled 
into the countryside to avoid arrest 
we were liberated for a few months but now there is more 
tension because at any moment a soldier can stop you or arrest 
you said rafaat who declined to give his full name for fear of 
reprisal 
the streets still bear the evidence of past protests the remains 
of burned tires and scorched stones blocking part of one entrance to 
the village 
ahmed a 25yearold grocer said soldiers patrol frequently but 
there were some small acts of defiance he said youths had hung 
about 100 flags the previous night 
this was disputed by a soldier standing guard outside the new 
military encampment that sported an israeli flag he said there had 
been only two flags 
the town is so quiet now that we go on patrol with just our 
berets and no helmets he added 
about a dozen palestinians gathered at the civil administration 
offices one man said he wanted an entry permit to the west bank for 
a relative who lives in jordan another said he wanted a travel 
document to return to his job in the arab gulf 
yet another wearing a bandage to cover a head wound he said was 
inflicted by soldiers had come to get his id card that had been 
taken during a searchandarrest raid 
all were kept waiting several hours even though a reporter who 
entered the encampment found two army offices sitting alone in their 
offices let them wait for awhile said the guard with a shrug 
bassam abu maadi a doctor who lives in a spacious villa on the 
edge of town said palestinian activists and the army were watching 
each other carefully to see what would happen next 
it will not stop in salfit as long as the intefadeh continues 
elsewhere in the west bank it will not stop until there is some 
hope offered for the future said abu maadi 37 
during the course of the uprising he said three palestinians 
from salfit had been shot to death and about 50 wounded about 250 
had been detained at one point or another 
abu maadi said arbitrary actions and collective punishments had 
left a feeling of resentment toward israel 
he said that after a jewish settler was killed in the west bank 
in june soldiers came to his house broke the porch lights and 
smashed a front window 
i came downstairs and opened the door an officer hit me in the 
face without warning or comment he then ordered me to go to the 
school where everyone was being rounded up abu maadi said 
if i do something wrong i will accept punishment but this is 
punishing everyone

the soviet navy sought a 
high seas show of glasnost but dense fog obscured much of the 
pacific fleets twoday maneuvers and hampered its planned display 
of firepower 
it invited reporters from the united states japan britain and 
australia who went aboard the antisubmarine vessel tallinn to 
watch the exercises in the sea of japan also on board were 
officials from india malaysia vietnam and indonesia 
the united states rejected an invitation but dispatched the 
frigate uss holt and at least one helicopter to keep an eye on the 
maneuvers soviet officials said 
the fog which rolled in monday evening and remained for the next 
two days made much of the observation of the ships planes and 
helicopters impossible the navy was forced to alter its plans for 
mock battles and conduct a shortrange demonstration of antiship 
missiles depth charges antiaircraft guns and rocketlaunched 
torpedos 
the soviets also arranged a tour of a destroyer at fleet 
headquarters in vladivostok and a launch ride to view the task force 
at anchor they allowed reporters to wander about the ships to which 
they were assigned 
inquiries about specific weapons and plans were ignored however 
and a request to visit the tallinns combat information center the 
nerve center of a modern naval vessel was politely rejected with 
the explanation that the captain was too busy 
observers did see two ships ready for inspection gray paint 
some of it fresh covered most surfaces on the tallinn and the 
destroyer stoiki brass name plates were polished the portraits of 
president mikhail s gorbachev and soviet founder vladimir i lenin 
were in place along the gangways 
in the sailors quarters personal belongings were put away and 
all bunks were made no space was wasted each ordinary sailor 
practically all of whom are drafted gets onethird of the space 
beneath the bottom bunk for uniforms a cubbyhole for toiletries 
and a cabinet large enough to hold about three books for personal 
belongings 
asked how he liked maritime life a 17yearold sailor standing 
watch for the visitors replied with a shrug service is service 
he said 
one officer said only 10 percent of the conscripts reenlist 
after their threeyear stint 
the exercises were designed to demonstrate the soviet navys 
defensive posture and its ability to protect a convoy from attack 
but the traditionally secretive navy also tried to score some 
political points 
the fleet commander adm gennady a khvatov called the tour an 
example of the new political thinking supported by gorbachev 
others emphasized the ethnic diversity of the sailors from a country 
with searing ethnic disputes 
capt viktor v obraztsov head of the communist partys 
political department for the task force said members from 29 of the 
soviet unions more than 100 nationalities make up the tallinns 
321man crew 
western naval specialists say most soviet officers come from the 
slavic republics of the ukraine byelorussia and the russian 
federation 
the united states refused to send observers to watch the 
exercises partly in solidarity with japan which considered them a 
provocation because they were held near islands that the soviets 
seized in the closing days of world war ii 
the soviet union and japan have never signed a peace treaty 
ending the war largely because of the dispute over possession of 
the kuril islands known as the northern territories in japan 
western naval experts speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the united states encouraged its pacific allies to stay away because 
it does not want to feel obligated to invite soviet officers aboard 
ship during annual exercises by the us 3rd fleet

a horse that knows when its safe to cross 
intersections allows a blind former cowboy to keep his independence 
but the city says the man must clean up after the animal or lose the 
privilege 
george bradford 69 who retains about 1 percent of his sight in 
one eye has a year to persuade the city council to let him keep two 
horses blue rocky and buck in his back yard 
when bradford rides blue rocky through town the horse stops at 
intersections and doesnt move until traffic is flowing in the 
direction the horse is supposed to go 
in 1981 the city council granted bradford a lifetime zoning 
variance allowing him to keep the horses in town 
but inspectors reported in 1987 that bradford wasnt cleaning up 
after the horses and was bothering neighbors with the smell the 
variance was revoked and a judge fined bradford 100 the fine was 
thrown out on appeal 
last month a judge gave bradford a year to change the councils 
mind or move the horses 
now hopefully what were doing is right said mayor ernest 
thompson as far as being unfair hes the one whos being unfair 
to his neighbors 
bradford said the neighbor behind the complaints is eddie 
wallace who wanted to sell his house next door but was afraid 
bradfords horses would lower property values 
wallace is not on speaking terms with bradford nor with reporters 
i dont want to say nothing about that crap no bye he 
said hanging up 
bradford who likes to smoke handrolled cigarettes and reminisce 
about the days when he worked as a cowboy in texas and new mexico 
had to stop working in 1964 because of retinitis pigmentosa a 
hereditary degenerative eye disease 
but bradford likes to ride blue rocky the two miles to downtown 
artesia across six intersections with stoplights 
he could see better about 10 years ago when he got blue rocky 
and started leading the horse on his walks into town when bradford 
heard traffic going in the direction he was walking that meant the 
light had turned green and he would cross the intersection 
now the horse decides when its time to cross 
he automatically stops anyhow at any intersection bradford 
said i guarantee you he wont go unless the traffic is going my 
way whether he can read the light is the 64 question 
other times bradford rides his horse into the hills west of his 
house 
you know i can get kind of down and out because i cant work 
and get on that old horse and ride five or six miles and hey i got 
a different outlook on life all of a sudden bradford said im 
completely independent 
he shudders at the thought of losing his horses 
oh i suppose somebody could take me places but you have to go 
back when they want to go back you know youre not independent

laurence olivier is gone will the theater world 
ever see his like again 
said critic bernard levin who wrote in the times after olivier 
died tuesday no one will replace the splendor that he gave his 
native land with his genius 
other critics say that while another olivier may be in the wings 
they feel todays entertainment industry makes it doubtful 
primarily a man of the stage olivier became a superstar in all 
media the sheer quantity of his work is among the most noteworthy 
aspects of a career that ended with his death at age 82 at his 
country home south of london 
but olivier was also the consummate actormanager a passionate 
theater advocate as important behind the scenes as a director and 
organizer as he was on stage as a performer 
few theater observers would dispute that firstrate british 
actors continue to abound derek jacobi vanessa redgrave anthony 
hopkins glenda jackson alan bates maggie smith and ian mckellen 
are just some of the generation after olivier who have been widely 
and often acclaimed 
then theres a still younger generation less known abroad but 
already staring greatness in the eye kenneth branagh antony sher 
juliet stevenson fiona shaw 
and although oliviers death is being called the end of an era 
he is survived by such stalwart knights and dames of stage as john 
gielgud john mills rex harrison alec guinness wendy hiller and 
peggy ashcroft 
but its oliviers level of commitment to the art form he 
cherished that may be in shorter supply 
will anyone ever again go on for so long play so many great 
parts run so many companies asked michael coveney in the 
financial times will they want to enough we must doubt it until 
they do 
milton shulman in the evening standard also feared such 
dedication was dying the likes of olivier nurtured on 
greasepaint the footlights and the effrontery of daring an 
audience to like you are fast becoming an endangered species 
the stage instead he wrote is fast becoming the casting 
kindergarten for film and tv 
the trend is increasing in britain as talented young theater 
actors opt for the greater financial rewards of film and tv 
natasha richardson hugh grant james wilby and amanda donohoe 
are just some of the classically schooled young english talents who 
work mostly on screen 
among the older generation none has matched the initiative of 
olivier who in 1963 realized an old dream of establishing a 
national theater of great britain 
the quality of work we do here is mostly due to him veteran 
actor michael bryant told tuesday nights audience at the nationals 
production of the voysey inheritance 
some feel oliviers death ends a kind of theatrical majesty that 
transcends issues of talent 
in an editorial entitled stage colossus the daily telegraph 
wrote he was the undisputed leader of his profession its 
spokesman and the brightest jewel in its crown we shall not look 
upon his like again 
levin wrote what we have lost with laurence olivier is glory 
you could practically see it growing around him like a nimbus 
denis quilley oliviers costar in a celebrated london 
production of eugene oneills long days journey into night 
said in an interview there are people today like olivier but 
not on the same scale 
wouldbe inheritors most frequently mentioned are men like 
michael pennington and the protean branagh guy pringle in the tv 
series fortunes of war who combine thespian dynamism with a 
team spirit 
both have started theater companies pennington the english 
shakespeare company which finished a world tour in britain this 
spring and branagh the renaissance theater company which had a 
sellout shakespeare season on the west end last fall 
branagh 28 tempted further comparisons to olivier by starring

a briton has claimed a place in the record 
books as the first woman to cross the english channel by hang 
glider making the 21mile trip to france in 22 minutes 
strapped into her frail craft 29yearold judy leden was first 
lifted to 13500 feet over dover by a hot air balloon wednesday 
morning 
the balloons pilot ron griffin then cut the rope on which the 
hang glider was suspended 30 feet below his craft sending the 
glider into a spinning 200foot nose dive before it leveled out and 
began its downward glide 
miss leden came down on a beach at le chatelet midway between the 
french north coast ports of calais and boulogne 
after landing she admitted to being scared at the start of the 
flight it was the highest i had ever been with a hang glider so i 
was going into the unknown 
i am not frightened very easily but i was terrified for a short 
time because of the thinness of the air at 13000 feet i went to at 
least 110 degrees and was rotating very fast which is the way the 
hang glider recovers and begins to fly 
i kept my nerve but once that horrible moment was over i 
had a lovely smooth glide over to france 
preparations for the flight which was sponsored by an auto 
company were dogged by technical problems for a year but miss 
leden said wednesdays crossing was incredibly smooth without any 
serious complications 
miss leden from derbyshire in northern england holds the 
womens world open distance hang gliding record of 14534 miles 
that flight listed in the guinness book of records was between 
nevada and california over owens valley on july 13 1983 
she was honored by queen elizabeth ii this year by being made a 
member of the order of the british empire in recognition of her 
services to the sport 
british news reports said the only other hang glider pilot to fly 
across the english channel was briton ken messenger in 1977 he 
suffered frostbite because of cold at the high altitude from which 
he started 
britains civil aviation authority said in a statement after miss 
ledens crossing wednesday that for safety reasons it will not allow 
any further hang gliding attempts across the english channel 
the skies above the channel are a major commercial air route

britons are witnessing something that has become 
unusual in the past decade of unioncurbing thatcherism a striking 
bluecollar union is enjoying a measure of public sympathy 
wednesday saw the fourth oneday strike in a month of the 
national rail network and london subways yet the union leaders 
while hardly popular national figures appear as people with a real 
grievance 
theyre enjoying a remarkable amount of public support 
considering how hard the public is hit directly said richard 
hope editor of the railway gazette a independent monthly 
he attributes this to a general sense that british rail is 
underpaying its staff as prime minister margaret thatcher cuts the 
stateowned companys subsidies to the lowest in europe 
the goal in line with the freemarket philosophy of mrs 
thatchers conservative party is to make british rail 
selffinancing but what the public mostly sees is higher fares 
demoralized staff and falling service standards 
a gallup poll shows 69 percent of britons favor more subsidies 
not less 
with unfortunate timing british rail announced in the middle of 
the pay dispute that its profits were a record 492 million last 
year largely from real estate sales 
meanwhile the media are focusing on recent hefty pay increases 
for top executives such as the 865 percent raise for lord sharp 
chairman of cable and wireless who now earns 630780 a year 
with overtime train drivers average 24840 a year and they want 
a 10 percent raise to beat the 83 percent inflation rate 
a poll wednesday in the usually prothatcher daily mail showed 
that of 2770 rail passengers questioned only 23 percent placed 
sole blame on the unions it said 33 percent blamed management 20 
percent blamed the government and 14 percent thought all sides were 
guilty ten percent had no opinion 
mrs thatchers last big battle against organized labor ended 
with a crushing defeat for the coal miners in 1985 and widespread 
applause for the prime ministers tough stand 
but jimmy knapp head of the 75000 member national union of 
railwaymen is a benign figure when compared to arthur scargill 
the marxist miners leader who led surging crowds of pickets in 
pitched battles with police 
a gruff man with tufts of snowwhite hair knapp sticks to a 
simple unpolitical message that british rails 7 percent pay raise 
offer is below inflation and that it wants to break up the union 
and weaken its collective bargaining power 
mrs thatcher says the strikers are selfish and dominated by 
leftwing extremists but in the image war knapp puts up a credible 
challenge it has been some time since a british union boss was 
described in print as cuddly 
transport minister paul channons wellpublicized walks to work 
on strike days were dismissed by the conservative sunday telegraph 
as embarrassingly unconvincing 
and british rail apparently miscalculated when instead of 
waiting for the result of an arbitration effort it asked the courts 
to ban the strike 
the courts refused and the publics sense of fair play was 
offended because the union had scrupulously obeyed mrs thatchers 
unioncurbing laws by balloting its members and obtaining the 
necessary 55 percent majority for a strike 
there are no mass pickets at train stations just silence 
columnist alan watkins in the liberal observer newspaper wonders 
what has happened to all those gentlemen usually wearing bowler 
hats who would enliven any railway dispute by assaulting station 
staff with their umbrellas 
the transport strikes are part of a wave of industrial unrest 
also hitting the docks the bbc and local government services 
coupled with resurgent inflation and rising interest rates they 
have pushed mrs thatcher to 10 points behind the socialist labor 
party in opinion polls 
ironically mrs thatchers own success in taming organized labor 
may now be working against her britons elected her in 1979 because 
they wanted a tough response to unions that were perceived as too 
leftwing and powerful that perception has since waned 
a decade ago 80 percent of people thought the trade unions 
were too powerful now its down to three in 10 says bob 
worcester head of market and opinion research international 
a decade ago 53 percent said most trade unions were controlled 
by extremists and militants now its only 20 percent 
in a sense the ballot has given strikes a spurious sense of 
legitimacy said graham mather of the rightwing institute of 
economic affairs he wants the government to implement its threat to 
ban strikes in essential services

entourage of up to 200 including his wives plans to enter the 
cleveland clinic for a physical examination and possible knee 
surgery a hospital spokesman said 
twenty rooms are being refurbished for security reasons and to 
suit the 67yearold monarchs tastes said gary weiland a clinic 
spokesman 
the exam will coincide with fahds official state visit to the 
united states weiland said wednesday night 
fahd is to meet with president bush on july 27 
a spokesman at the saudi arabian embassy in washington would 
neither confirm nor deny fahds visit to cleveland such a trip 
would be announced once he arrived in the united states the 
spokesman said 
weiland said he did not know when the king would arrive 
an advance team scouted hospitals in four us cities and chose 
the clinic because of its expertise in orthopedic surgery and 
because the kings halfbrother khaled had heart surgery there 
twice weiland said khaled who preceded fahd as saudi arabias 
king died in 1982 
extensive remodeling of the clinic center hotel which had been 
scheduled this year has been speeded up in preparation for the

a man climbed into a hot tub with a joke 
and planned to keep up the routine for three days to set a new mark 
for hot tub humor 
its great surfs up john parker said about a halfhour 
into his marathon wednesday he plans to stay there for at least 73 
hours until saturday morning 
he started out with some elephant jokes 
why do elephants have flat feet he asked its obviously 
because they jump out of trees 
most of the jokes are off the top of my head and are jokes ive 
collected from 19 years in the radio business said parker 36 
of course after 27 hours or so you begin to hallucinate so 
fortunately the guinness people allow me to use cue cards 
the 1989 edition of the guinness book of world records lists him 
as the recordholder for time spent telling jokes in a hot tub with 
a 52hour effort but someone in portugal has topped that mark 
the effort to regain the title has its risks 
ive got to keep the temperature of the water between 85 and 90 
degrees parker said any lower than 85 and hypothermia sets in 
without me knowing it i can go numb nod off any higher than 90 
and i can boil myself without knowing it 
wrinkled feet are another hazard said parker who has survived 
four tubjoking marathons he plans to solve the problem by keeping 
his feet out of the water much of the time 
parker has a penchant for spending long periods in odd places 
i once sat in spaghetti for three days he said 
unfortunately guinness lists no record for spaghettisitting

house republicans and democrats are forecasting 
a rocky congressional ride for the stealth bomber despite the air 
force assessment that the halfbilliondollar aircraft is key to 
us strategic forces 
the b2 program is in a lot of trouble rep william 
dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the house armed services 
committee told air force officials who pleaded their case wednesday 
defense secretary dick cheney was to present his argument for the 
bomber today before the house panel 
air force secretary donald rice and chief of staff larry welch 
met with stiff resistance from lawmakers wednesday as they urged 
members at house and senate sessions to continue spending for the 
70 billion program 
rice and welch told the committee that stretching out the b2 
program would increase the cost significantly current estimates put 
the pricetag of a single bomber between 500 million and 750 
million making it the most expensive plane in history 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said extending the program could raise the price of a 
single bomber to 1 billion 
if you make the annual cost acceptable the sticker price 
becomes unacceptable aspin said if you make the sticker price 
acceptable the annual cost becomes unacceptable i dont know how 
to fix it 
moments after aspins comments dickinson put it more bluntly to 
the air force officials 
when the chairman tells you youre not going to get it 
politically you can put it in your pocket and take it to the 
bank dickinson said 
rep herbert h bateman rva added i want to put my head 
down and cry you made a compelling case but i dont know where to 
get the money to pay for it 
two committee republicans reps john rowland of connecticut and 
john kasich of ohio have joined forces with liberal democrat 
ronald dellums of california on an amendment to shut down production 
of the b2 after the manufacturer northrop corp produced 13 
planes 
the amendment which the lawmakers said they will introduce on 
the house floor would allow the 13 planes to be developed and 
tested and then a decision would be made on whether to continue the 
program 
its a reasonable moderate position said rowland who 
believes the coalition can win support from members stunned by the 
cost of the radarevading aircraft 
but the air force argues the b2 outpaces improvements in soviet 
air defenses is important to nuclear deterrence and can be used in 
a conventional role 
despite the sticker shock the b2 comes down as the only 
candidate for some categories of things we want to do rice said

the 1989 wheat crop is turning out better than 
many believe possible a few months ago but it still is far short in 
many areas where last years drought lingered on 
new agriculture department estimates put the harvest at 212 
billion bushels a 17 percent increase from last years 181 billion 
bushels and the most since 1985 when farmers produced 243 billion 
bushels 
for the first time this season the usda estimates issued 
wednesday included durum and other springplanted wheat in 
addition to winter wheat planted last fall 
reggie wyckoff president of the national association of wheat 
growers said the usda estimate was a little higher than he had 
expected and that there will be adequate supplies through the 
198990 marketing year if the current projections are correct 
but it also shows evidence that there is disaster in many 
areas where wheat yields have tumbled wyckoff said in a telephone 
interview its pretty rough in hard red winter wheat areas 
the departments agricultural statistics board said the average 
yield based on indications as of july 1 was estimated at 334 
bushels per acre down from 341 bushels last year 
but farmers are expected to have about 635 million acres of 
wheat for harvest this year up from 532 million in 1988 the board 
said in its report 
the usdas first official estimate of 1989 production of corn 
soybeans and some other major springplanted crops will be issued on 
aug 10 along with revised figures for wheat 
however the july report did show new figures for 1989 plantings 
of major crops corn plantings were estimated at 658 million acres 
for harvest up from 582 million acres in 1988 and soybeans 602 
million acres up from 574 million 
cotton plantings were estimated at 105 million acres down 16 
percent from 1988 that was also 5 percent below a preliminary 
forecast in march 
winter wheat production was estimated at 146 billion bushels 
down 6 percent from 1988 reduced sharply in kansas and some other 
parts of the great plains by lingering effects of last years 
drought it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production 
the kansas wheat crop estimate however was boosted slightly to 
2112 million bushels from the june forecast of 2024 million even 
so it was down by more than a third from last year 
winter wheat fared better in 1988 because most was harvested or 
had matured before the full impact of heat and drought was felt 
durum wheat production was estimated at 1113 million bushels up 
from 448 million in 1988 and other spring wheat was indicated 
at 5441 million bushels compared with 2055 million last year 
department economists say the decline in wheat supplies since 
last years reduced harvest is having only slight effect on consumer 
food prices which are expected to rise an average of 4 percent to 7 
percent compared with a 41 percent gain in 1988 
a related supplyanddemand report showed that us wheat 
inventories may total 592 million bushels by the end of the current 
marketing year next may 31 down from 694 million bushels this june 
1 
last month when the crop was thought to be smaller analysts 
projected inventories could decline to 500 million bushels next 
spring 
the report showed wheat prices could average 375 to 410 per 
bushel in 198990 down from the range of 380 to 420 projected 
in june but still above the 372 average for last season 
wheat exports were projected at around 123 billion bushels down 
from 144 billion bushels in 198889 
corn production based on past trends and the current outlook 
was projected at 745 billion bushels up from last years 
droughtshriveled 492 billion bushels 
but the july corn outlook was down from junes projection of 785 
billion bushels due partly to late plantings in the eastern corn 
belt and continued limited moisture conditions in the west 
the soybean crop was projected at 195 billion bushels unchanged 
from the june forecast and up sharply from 1988 output of 154 
billion bushels the price outlook also was unchanged at 475 to 
625 per bushel compared with an average of 735 in 198889

the united states has proposed a technical 
measure designed to speed the reduction of barriers to trade in farm 
products 
us trade representative carla hills says the bush 
administration wants other nations to convert nontariff import 
barriers such as quotas and restrictive licenses to tariffs 
by converting to tariffs barriers would be more transparent 
and uniform making it easier to negotiate worldwide reductions in 
agriculture support and protection she said wednesday in a 
statement 
the proposal was made in geneva in trade negotiations with 100 
other nations under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade gatt which regulates world trade treaties and settles 
commerce disputes the current series of talks known as the uruguay 
round began in 1986 and are scheduled to run through next year 
in april gatt negotiators achieved a breakthrough in the talks 
which had been deadlocked since december reaching broad agreement 
in four key areas including a compromise on a us demand to do 
away with all tradedistorting agricultural subsidies the talks 
since then have been aimed at nailing down specifics of how to 
achieve the goals of the larger compromise 
hills said the us tariffication proposal must be part of a 
more comprehensive package including fundamental reforms in domestic 
farm subsidies export subsidies and sanitary rules

the pentagon disagrees with american scientists 
who say their visit to a longsecret soviet laser research center 
convinces them the facility is not a threat to us satellites 
a defense department official said wednesday that videotape taken 
by the scientists of the saryshagan laser facility in soviet 
central asia only firms up the departments view that the laser 
facility is capable of incapacitating us satellites 
the scientists however said wednesday their inspection of the 
facility last week convinced them it poses no military threat they 
said the pentagon had greatly exaggerated the facilitys importance 
this facility really hasnt had large resources devoted to it 
since the 1970s said frank von hippel of princeton university 
one of the scientists who visited the site as part of a broader 
inspection program sanctioned by the soviet government 
the scientists showed the videotapes at a news conference 
wednesday 
no us government officials were included in the visit 
the pentagon official who asked that he not be identified said 
the pentagon still believes that while the saryshagan laser center 
may be unable to knock a satellite out of space it can do enough 
damage to negate our satellite capabilities 
john pike of the federation of american scientists told reporters 
the saryshagan laser is not powerful enough to shoot down 
satellites or ballistic missiles 
he said it was 100 to 1000 times less powerful than an american 
power laser at white sands nm that he called only marginally 
capable of shooting down satellites 
pike was not on the tour but described for reporters his analysis 
of the photographic and other evidence gathered by the tour group 
which also visited a soviet nuclear weapons production center and 
conducted radiation experiments on a nucleararmed soviet navy 
cruiser in the black sea 
he noted the pentagon beginning in 1984 had described the laser 
center as the heart of an ominous soviet antisatellite program with 
groundbased lasers that could shoot down satellites and in the 
future might be able to destroy ballistic missiles 
it is clear that the threat posed by this facility has been 
wildly exaggerated over the last several years pike said adding 
the us claims represented either a major intelligence failure or a 
deliberate effort to mislead the american public 
thomas cochran a staff scientist with the natural resources 
defense council and a member of the tour group said bush 
administration officials were invited to go along but declined 
rep bob carr dmich who participated in the tour said soviet 
willingness to allow americans to inspect the previously secret 
laser facility and other military installations was clear evidence 
of extraordinary steps being taken by soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev to promote the arms control process 
carr said soviet officials told him during the tour that 
legislation was being prepared to permit more public disclosures 
about soviet nuclear weapons production

food for africa a pet charity of a former top 
official at the department of housing and urban development has 
raised thousands of dollars without proper registration in several 
states according to records 
a check by the associated press of the offices of state attorneys 
general and other agencies regulating charities found food is not 
registered in new york pennsylvania louisiana the district of 
columbia colorado california massachusetts or its home state of 
michigan 
the organization raised at least 580000 from 1986 to 1988 much 
of it in those states and half of that came from individuals or 
firms known to be involved with hud programs according to an 
internal agency report released in april 
i was told we didnt have to have a license vasilios 
damavolites foods treasurer said in an interview from novi 
mich where the organization is headquartered 
damavolites who is president of dial construction corp and goes 
by the anglicized name of bill damas said contributions have been 
difficult to raise since the release of a hud report that touched on 
the organization and its links to former agency official thomas t 
demery 
we dont want to operate illegally damas said were not 
going to do anything else until we receive the proper license 
despite lacking appropriate state registration food holds 
federal tax exempt status from the internal revenue service meaning 
that donations are tax deductible 
damas said information about state licenses is kept by peter 
pretorius who runs foods relief operations from his home in south 
africa pretorius could not be reached for comment his secretary in 
south africa said tuesday that pretorius and his wife ann were 
attending an evangelical conference in manila philippines 
food for africa was an obscure relief organization delivering 
food and clothing to war refugees in mozambique until the release of 
a hud audit in april the report probed possible connections between 
donations to food by real estate developers and contracts awarded 
under huds moderate rehabilitation program 
the hud rehabilitation program which gave rent subsidies to 
developers to renovate housing for lowincome residents was 
suspended after the audits release because of charges of favoritism 
in the awarding of contracts 
hud secretary jack kemp said tuesday he had instituted new 
controls and restarted the program 
demerys links to food date to 1985 when he helped establish the 
charity he quit his position as director after he moved to hud as 
assistant secretary for housing according to the report 
the report said demery continued to work for the charity 
attending at least eight fundraisers in the 20 months after he 
became assistant secretary a check of demerys phone logs obtained 
under the freedom of information act revealed that demery often 
spoke to food officials during working hours 
after the investigation hud inspector general paul adams 
concluded that demery may have violated the departments standards 
of conduct which prohibit employees from directly or indirectly 
soliciting anything of value from anyone with interests that may 
substantially be affected by hud 
demery says the conclusions were based on circumstantial 
evidence and says he never asked for contributions from any hud 
developer 
food for africa at one time held a license to solicit 
contributions in its home state of michigan but allowed it to lapse 
in september 1987 according to documents obtained from the michigan 
attorney general a reapplication made this year has been delayed 
until food can provide notarized signatures of two officers the 
documents show 
yet food held two fundraisers in michigan in 1988 and 1989 the 
organizations treasurer said in a telephone interview this week 
food also held at least 10 fundraising events in six other states 
and the district of columbia in 1987 and 1988 according to the hud 
audit 
food also filed papers with the michigan attorney general in june 
saying that it had pending applications in other states for 
licenses although damas said he did not know which states

television is sending one message to the 
nations most impressionable viewers says a senator buy buy 
buy 
witnesses urged congress at a hearing wednesday to restore 
restrictions on childrens tv programs and join other nations that 
use television to enlighten rather than exploit the young 
they said that since 1984 when the federal communications 
commission weakened time limits on advertising for childrens shows 
the only messages american kids have been getting from us 
broadcasters are sales pitches 
the barbs at the broadcast industry came at a hearing by the 
senate commerce science and transportation subcommittee on 
communications on two bills that would restore the restrictions and 
give the federal government new authority over childrens fare 
instead of inspiring children to learn broadcasters are 
pushing them to buy buy buy sen howard metzenbaum dohio an 
author of one of the bills testified 
metzenbaum said commercials in childrens shows have increased 
since 1984 and some programs urge young viewers to dial 900 
telephone numbers to hear taped messages from cartoon characters 
unsuspecting parents then get hit with huge telephone bills 
dr francis palumbo representing the american academy of 
pediatrics contrasted us television with australia japan and 
great britain where up to six hours of instructional programming 
for children is offered each day 
in the united states our commercial networks may offer one 
hour each week palumbo said he did not include figures for 
public television stations 
sen timothy wirth dcolo who is sponsoring a bill that goes 
further than metzenbaums testified that in the wake of the 
deregulation frenzy of the reagan years broadcasters seem to 
have abandoned educational childrens programs altogether 
he said congress must pressure broadcasters to transform 
childrens television from a vast wasteland to a source of 
intellectual stimulation and enrichment for american children 
wirths bill includes provisions to 
impose tougher limits on advertising time in childrens tv 
shows currently those limits are 95 minutes of commercials per 
hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays 
require tv stations as part of the fcc license renewal process 
to show they are providing programming specifically designed to 
serve the educational and informational needs of preschool and 
schoolaged children 
require broadcasters to give advance public notice of programs 
designed specifically to educate and inform children 
the bill by metzenbaum and sen frank lautenberg dnj is 
identical to a measure that passed congress last year only to be 
pocketvetoed by president ronald reagan a similar measure is 
before the house 
the metzenbaum bill would hold commercials on childrens shows to 
105 minutes per hour weekends and 12 minutes weekdays and require 
stations to demonstrate to the fcc they are serving the educational 
and information needs of children through their overall 
programming 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said his group supported the metzenbaum bill which he 
called a fair and reasonable compromise 
he complained that broadcasters are losing young audiences to 
cable tv and vcrs while production costs for childrens shows are 
increasing 
further restrictions and more stringent programming 
requirements run the risk of knocking the childrens television 
marketplace even further out of balance fritts told the 
subcommittee 
dewitt helm president of the association of national 
advertisers opposed both bills he called the restrictions 
unconstitutional and said they dont protect children 
helm said there was no evidence children are any more susceptible 
to five minutes of commercials than to 15 minutes of ads

congress is speeding up work on an assortment 
of deficitcutting and spending bills with the start of the 1990 
fiscal year looming closer 
the house passed the second of 13 annual appropriations 
wednesday an 11 billion measure for the interior department and 
cultural programs on a 37449 vote the senate has yet to approve 
any appropriations measures which provide money for federal 
agencies 
the house ways and means committee gave preliminary voice vote 
approval to a measure raising 53 billion in new tax receipts 
mainly by boosting a series of levies on businesses the panel 
rejected 2211 president bushs pet tax proposal a cut in the 
capital gains tax that democrats say benefits only the rich 
but a deficitslashing measure ran into problems in the house 
energy and commerce committee the legislation would raise 50 
million by increasing fees the securities and exchange commission 
charges investors and another 300 million by boosting nuclear 
regulatory commission fees imposed on utilities 
it would also expand the medicaid program an estimated 5 billion 
to 13 billion over five years that brought objections from rep 
william dannemeyer rcalif who called the measure an example of 
the insidious practice of how we expand the liberal welfare 
state 
lawmakers returned this week from their fourth of july recess to 
eight weeks of work left until the oct 1 start of the next fiscal 
year they take a fourweek break in august 
they must keep the federal deficit to the grammrudman 
deficitreduction laws limit of 100 billion for 1990 out of a 
117 trillion budget to prevent automatic acrosstheboard cuts 
two house appropriations subcommittees meeting behind closed 
doors tried to finish spending bills for transportation programs 
and for labor health and education initiatives 
across the capitol the senate appropriations committee divided 
programs worth 658 billion among its 13 subcommittees opening the 
way for those panels to begin writing their own versions of the 
spending bills members of the committee complained that last 
springs budget deal between president bush and congressional 
leaders would not allow increases for programs that need more money 
i wish we could do better but we could only cut the cake so 
many ways said appropriations committee chairman robert byrd 
dwva 
the house committee on post office and civil service voted 230 
for a package that claims 28 billion in savings some 18 billion 
would come from a bookkeeping move shifting the postal service 
offbudget so its losses dont count towards federal red ink 
other claimed savings would come by shifting the date on which 
the postal service reimburses the government 330 million for 
workers compensation payments from fiscal 1991 into fiscal 1990 
another 700 million in savings would be realized by spreading 
federal civilian employees retirement payments over two years 
instead of in one single check

judge alcee l hastings fighting to save his 
seat on the federal bench in a senate impeachment trial says his 
chances of winning are a long way from bright 
the political reality is not good the miami jurist said 
during a break in the impeachment trial wednesday when reporters 
asked how he thinks he will come out in the long run 
i think ill get a fair hearing but i understand politics in 
america hastings added he expressed hope however that there 
will be a surge of grassroots support for him that could improve his 
chances 
hastings 52 the first black federal judge in florida history 
is accused of plotting to receive a 150000 bribe lying to a jury 
that acquitted him of criminal charges in 1983 and improper 
disclosure of information obtained from a federal wiretap 
hastings is accused of plotting with washington attorney william 
borders to get the payoff in exchange for returning 845000 in 
forfeited cash to two convicted racketeers and keeping the two out 
of prison 
hastings was impeached by the house a year ago and now is on 
trial in the senate if convicted he would be removed from the 
bench and deprived of his judicial salary of 89500 a year 
a panel of 12 senators is hearing evidence in the case and will 
report later to the full senate which will make the final decision 
panel members on wednesday donned earphones to monitor tapes made 
by the fbi when undercover agent h paul rico met twice in september 
1981 in miami with borders a friend of hastings 
rico a former agent called out of retirement for the assignment 
was posing as frank romano one of two brothers in the restaurant 
business convicted of racketeering in connection with a teamsters 
pension fund loan and sentenced by hastings to three years in prison 
the real frank romano who has since died did not respond to 
overtures sent by borders through a gobetween according to 
witnesses 
on the tape rico arranged what he and borders called a 
demonstration of borders influence over hastings 
while borders was in las vegas at a boxing match hastings was to 
have dinner at the hotel fontainebleau in miami beach hastings did 
have dinner at the hotel at the appointed time on sept 16 1981 he 
denies it was on borders instructions 
the following saturday however rico met borders at miami 
international airport and is heard to say he is handing the attorney 
25000 in cash in what prosecutors call a down payment on the 
payoff 
borders did not discover that romano was actually rico until 
several weeks later when he was arrested pulling out of a suburban 
virginia parking lot with the undercover agent and a garment bag 
containing 125000 in cash he was subsequently convicted in the 
case and sent to prison 
hastings has said repeatedly that he had nothing to do with the 
bribery scheme and that borders a longtime friend was a 
rainmaker who was playing on their friendship to squeeze 
defendants for money 
house members acting as prosecutors at the trial questioned that 
theory wednesday after an fbi agent and a former justice department 
strike force prosecutor testified that they witnessed two meetings 
between borders and santo trafficante the late kingpin of organized 
crime in florida

this is not another one of those jokes 
about new jersey it is about a museum filled with garbage 
the hackensack meadowlands environment centers museum will 
feature windows tires bottles paper cartons and toys once 
destined for landfills in new jersey which produces 26000 tons of 
trash daily enough to fill nearby giants stadium to the top of the 
scoreboard every 2 weeks 
the fundamental purpose is educational we want to show people 
that garbage doesnt just disappear that its not just by magic 
said robert grant a spokesman for the center 
the plans for the museum come at a time when communities across 
the nation are considering ways to recycle some of their trash a 
third of the countrys 6000 dumps will close during in the next 
five years driving up disposal costs 
the exhibit which will be permanent and will be operated by the 
hackensack meadowlands development commission is under 
construction an official dedication is planned for october 
from the garbagefilled entry visitors will move to viewing 
holes where mirrors show the trash producers themselves 
theres a display showing something that wont decay a glass 
bottle another display will explain disposal options such as 
making a compost pile at home or recycling motor oil and computer 
games on trash are planned 
the purpose is to show the public what is thrown away what 
could be recycled and what their responsibilities and concerns 
should be to reduce the waste said grant 
each american generates an average of 35 pounds of refuse a day 
adding 160 million tons to the nations trash pile each year only 
10 percent is recycled the federal government has set a goal of 25 
percent in four years 
we are trying to change habits that have been with us since man 
first walked upright what society has done is to find a useless 
piece of land and fill it up then find another piece of land 
grant said 
people still think you put it out on tuesdays and thursdays 
and poof it disappears 
the development commission created 20 years ago by the 
legislature is responsible for environmental education overseeing 
garbage disposal has four northern new jersey counties and managing 
surrounding wetlands 
the solid waste museum is one of three planned for the new 
7000squarefoot exhibit area being built mostly with money from 
the new jersey sports and exposition authority which funds the 
environment center the other exhibits will show area history and 
animals and plants found in the wetlands around the center 
the 400000 museum will be geared to children about 1200 
students now visit the center each month 
anne galli the commissions director of environmental 
operations said she hopes children could persuade their parents to 
cut down on what they throw away for example she said school 
lunches could be put in reusable plastic containers instead of paper 
and foil 
we want people to see it as a fun and also a learning 
experience she said during a recent tour of the halffinished 
exhibit while each of us is part of the problem each of us is 
part of the solution 
grant said the exhibit is getting attention from foreign media 
including japanese television stations and an irish radio station 
i think people worldwide are beginning to come to grips with 
the garbage crisis he said a museum of trash has a lot of 
anthropological and archaeological interest 
as visitors leave the exhibit theyll see trash as art 
sculpture and wall hangings made out of garbage 
we wanted to leave them with an upbeat feeling instead of 
depressed and overwhelmed ms galli said they leave thinking 
i can take control of this situation by my own actions

a federal judge has ordered a prescription 
painkiller removed from the marketplace because it never was 
approved by the food and drug administration 
the order was issued monday by us district judge william l 
hungate but was not immediately made public 
the drug esgic with codeine has been distributed nationally 
by forest pharmaceuticals in maryland heights since 1986 it 
contains 50 milligrams of butalbital 30 milligrams of codeine 40 
milligrams of caffeine and 325 milligrams of acetaminophen it is 
described as an analgesic for coping with moderate to severe pain 
ken goodman vice president of finance for forest laboratories 
the parent company in new york refused to answer any questions 
about the drug saying the matter was in litigation 
the company contended that the drug was generally recognized by 
experts as safe and therefore not a new drug requiring approval by 
the fda 
but the fda contended that it was not widely recognized as safe 
because there were no published studies on the drug or any similar 
product 
hungate noted that the company failed to cite any published 
studies to refute the fdas argument and he concluded that where 
there are no published studies there can be no general 
recognition of a drug as safe 
hungates order suspends manufacture and distribution of the drug 
or any similar product unless the fda approves of it he gave the 
agency power to inspect forests facilities to ensure compliance he 
also assessed unspecified costs of the case against the company

president bushs proposed cut in the capital 
gains tax is still alive but the house ways and means committee is 
refusing for now to make it part of a deficitreduction package 
the committee after giving tentative approval to a 53 billion 
revenue increase is putting finishing touches on the package aides 
say the subject of capital gains likely will be raised again before 
the final vote as will an attempt to defer a new tax that finances 
catastrophic health insurance 
the revenueincrease plan a mishmash of mostly technical changes 
affecting corporations was approved by voice vote in a closeddoor 
session wednesday after the committee by a 2211 margin rejected 
bushs call for a capital gains cut 
another voice vote eliminated a proposed oneyear extension of 
the 3 percent tax on telephone service which is due to expire dec 
31 1990 
still left in the bill are increases in taxes on snuff and 
chewing and pipe tobacco imposition of income tax withholding on 
some farm workers who now are exempt a oneyear extension of the 8 
percent airline ticket tax and the 5 percent levy on air freight 
and imposing social security taxes on some deferred compensation 
tentatively approved but still subject to change are the biggest 
revenueraisers in the bill repeal of special dividend and interest 
deductions benefiting lenders and employers for investments in 
employee stockownership plans 
those changes would bring in more than 16 billion of the 53 
billion of revenue increases that the committee is under orders to 
raise for deficit reduction in the budget year that begins oct 1 
the committee attached a provision wiping out most of the 
disputed parts of a 1986 law known as section 89 that requires 
employers to use complex tests to prove their employee healthcare 
plans are not weighted in favor of higherpaid workers 
under the committees action no section 89 provisions would be 
enforced before jan 1 after that date any employerpaid health 
plan would be acceptable if made available to 90 percent of 
employees and the employer paid at least half the premium 
the health premium charged a worker earning under 20000 a year 
could not exceed 1000 for a policy covering only the employee and 
2000 for a policy covering a family 
small businesses would get an additional break the health 
insurance provided by an employer with fewer than 20 workers would 
pass federal muster as long as the company gave coverage to all 
workers and contributed the same premium for all 
section 89 was enacted to encourage expansion of health coverage 
to more workers the committee proposal similar to changes approved 
by the senate does not repeal antidiscrimination requirements 
they simply free employers from complex tests to prove their plans 
are fair 
most of the votes against the cut in capital gains taxes which 
apply to profits from the sale of stock and other assets were cast 
by democrats they are wary of voting a capital gains cut because 
almost all the benefits go to upperincome people 
however aides working for members of both parties say there is a 
chance democrats might change their minds if bush offers to support 
other tax changes that they favor 
the administration proposed the capital gains tax cut as a way to 
raise revenue although there is general agreement that such a 
reduction would boost revenues during the first year by encouraging 
investors to sell some longheld assets congressional economists 
insist a cut would lose money later

a congressman outraged over artworks depicting 
explicit sexuality and religious desecration says the houses 
decision to strip 45000 from the federal arts budget is a slap 
on the wrist 
the house approved the cut in the national endowment for the arts 
budget after attempts to first take away all the agencys money and 
then reduce its budget by 10 percent failed 
im afraid the long and the short of it is that they will get a 
message they can get away with anything and take nothing but a 
modest slap on the wrist said rep richard armey rtexas 
the action wednesday came as an amendment to the 11 billion 
interior department appropriations bill which was eventually 
approved by a 37449 vote the senate has not voted on the interior 
appropriation 
the fight over arts funding heightened by recent controversial 
exhibits that had federal money behind them was debated for five 
hours before the amendment trimming the neas budget was approved 
36165 
the bill earmarked 1442 million for the endowment which 
provides grants to artists writers and art exhibitors 
we were concerned about the way the endowment was moving on 
certain taxpayerfunded projects said rep charles stenholm 
dtexas who proposed the funding cut 
stenholms amendment was an alternative to one offered by rep 
dana rohrabacher rcalif that would have wiped out the neas 
entire appropriation and another by armey that would have cut the 
nea budget by 10 percent 
armey said the vote would do force the arrogant nea to use 
standards of taste decency sensitivity tolerance in its arts 
funding decisions 
but hugh southern acting endowment chairman said the nea takes 
congressional concerns seriously 
we shall continue to work with the congress to assure the 
integrity and effectiveness of the arts endowment processes and to 
maintain the independence of the peer review system and its 
affirmation of diverse aesthetic views and expressions he said 
after the vote 
the fight centered around a photograph by andres serrano of a 
plastic crucifix submerged in a container of the artists urine and 
an exhibition of photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe that 
included depiction of homoeroticism child nudity and sadomasochism 
the nea gave the institute of contemporary art at the university 
of pennsylvania 30000 to display the mapplethorpe works and the 
southeastern center for contemporary art in winstonsalem nc 
70000 from which it awarded serrano a 15000 prize 
the serrano award also included funds from the equitable 
foundation and the rockefeller foundation said josh dare spokesman 
for the nea 
congressional criticism grew after the mapplethorpe photos were 
included in a catalogue for an exhibit at the corcoran gallery of 
art in washington dc the gallery withdrew mapplethorpes work 
from the exhibition 
stenholm said most of the public is not aware of these works but 
my district would be overwhelmingly opposed to them he said 
they are in such poor taste

we dont want to operate illegally damas said were not 
going to do anything else until we receive the proper license 
despite lacking appropriate state registration food holds 
federal tax exempt status from the internal revenue service meaning 
that donations are tax deductible 
damas said information about state licenses is kept by peter 
pretorius who runs foods relief operations from his home in south 
africa pretorius could not be reached for comment his secretary in 
south africa said tuesday that pretorius and his wife ann were 
attending an evangelical conference in manila philippines 
food for africa was an obscure relief organization delivering 
food and clothing to war refugees in mozambique until the release of 
a hud audit in april the report probed possible connections between 
donations to food by real estate developers and contracts awarded 
under huds moderate rehabilitation program 
the hud rehabilitation program which gave rent subsidies to 
developers to renovate housing for lowincome residents was 
suspended after the audits release because of charges of favoritism 
in the awarding of contracts 
hud secretary jack kemp said tuesday he had instituted new 
controls and restarted the program 
demerys links to food date to 1985 when he helped establish the 
charity he quit his position as director after he moved to hud as 
assistant secretary for housing according to the report 
the report said demery continued to work for the charity 
attending at least eight fundraisers in the 20 months after he 
became assistant secretary a check of demerys phone logs obtained 
under the freedom of information act revealed that demery often 
spoke to food officials during working hours 
after the investigation hud inspector general paul adams 
concluded that demery may have violated the departments standards 
of conduct which prohibit employees from directly or indirectly 
soliciting anything of value from anyone with interests that may 
substantially be affected by hud 
demery says the conclusions were based on circumstantial 
evidence and says he never asked for contributions from any hud 
developer 
food for africa at one time held a license to solicit 
contributions in its home state of michigan but allowed it to lapse 
in september 1987 according to documents obtained from the michigan 
attorney general a reapplication made this year has been delayed 
until food can provide notarized signatures of two officers the 
documents show 
yet food held two fundraisers in michigan in 1988 and 1989 the 
organizations treasurer said in a telephone interview this week 
food also held at least 10 fundraising events in six other states 
and the district of columbia in 1987 and 1988 according to the hud 
audit 
food also filed papers with the michigan attorney general in june 
saying that it had pending applications in other states for 
licenses although damas said he did not know which states

a senior us official says there have been 
some unspecified contacts between israel and its longtime enemy the 
palestine liberation organization 
assistant secretary of state john h kelly said wednesday it 
would be an exaggeration to say an official dialogue between the 
two sides is taking place but he added there is classified 
reporting about contacts between the two sides that he would 
discuss only in a closeddoor session 
israeli officials vehemently denied any contacts with the plo 
kellys statement came in an appearance before a congressional 
panel in which he also said hardliners in israel are damaging 
prospects for elections in the occupied territories he denied 
israeli radio reports that the united states is trying to interfere 
in israels affairs 
asked about the sixmonthold diplomatic talks between the plo 
and the us kelly said they have yielded no tangible results and 
that the talks wouldnt go on forever 
in israel avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and danny naveh spokesman for foreign minister moshe arens 
denied to israeli radio that israel had had contacts with the plo 
there are no and there will be no contacts with the plo naveh 
was quoted as saying 
kelly also was asked about plo comments on last weeks attack on 
an israeli bus in which 14 civilians were killed he said us 
ambassador robert pelletreau was instructed last week to bring up 
short bassam abu sharif the plo spokesman who labeled the attack 
a legitimate part of palestinian resistance efforts 
yasser arafat in an interview with hearst news service said 
wednesday he regretted the loss of life and denied any plo 
involvement 
it is painful for me to witness the loss of all these civilian 
lives arafat said in the interview 
kelly testifying before the house foreign affairs subcommittee 
on europe and the middle east denied that next weeks highlevel 
state department mission to israel was aimed at persuading the 
parties in the coalition government to stay together 
he said the delegation whose participants and schedule were not 
yet final would discuss future prospects for israelipalestinian 
negotiations 
rep lee hamilton dind the subcommittee chairman noted news 
reports that the bush administration was signaling israeli leaders 
that it hopes the labor party will not leave the coalition 
government and hamilton said it was rather extraordinary for the 
united states to inject itself into domestic politics 
kelly said he was a little distressed at that interpretation of 
the trip which he said is only for the purpose of having a 
healthy exchange about prospects for peace 
it is not up to us to try to stagemanage domestic politics in 
israel were not going to have a public position on an issue 
like that 
he said the united states still regards israeli policy as 
supporting the concept of elections among the 17 million 
palestinians under israels occupation in the west bank and gaza 
strip that is the operative and legally binding basis for the 
israeli government to proceed he said 
limits that hardliners imposed on the election proposal at a 
likud party conference last week did not advance the process 
kelly said if they became government policy that would make 
it more difficult but we do not believe the final act has been 
played

the soviet union is still hospitalizing 
citizens who are not mentally ill says a team of us health 
experts who recommend additional reforms to prevent confinement of 
political dissidents 
the 26member delegations report released wednesday said broad 
concepts of social dangerousness have contributed to the soviet 
practice of hospitalizing people who are not mentally ill 
in response the soviet side expressed disagreement with some 
aspects of the study but nonetheless called it a valuable and 
useful document 
the delegation visited the soviet union from feb 26 to march 12 
to assess recent changes in soviet psychiatry they examined 15 
patients and 12 former patients who had been released within the 
preceding two years 
among the 12 the us team found no evidence of any past or 
current mental disorder in nine and the remaining three had 
relatively mild symptoms that would not typically warrant 
involuntary hospitalization said delegation member darrel a 
regier director of clinical research at the national institute of 
mental health 
the delegations report said it recommends that additional 
steps be taken to revise the soviet criminal codes to remove all 
prohibitions against expression of political or religious beliefs 
in addition the report said new legislation or regulations 
appear necessary to limit involuntary hospitalizations solely to 
those who are a direct danger to themselves or others 
the report also recommended increased use of defense lawyers to 
guard against abuse of patients and the use of periodic reviews to 
ensure that hospital stays are not excessively long 
according to the report the soviet hosts generally complied with 
the terms of the agreement under which the visit was made although 
there were some significant procedural obstacles that made 
completing the task more difficult 
the preliminary soviet response to the report acknowledged the 
existence of such obstacles but said the problem by no means meant 
that the soviet specialists artificially created difficulties and 
tried to limit access to the necessary information on the patients 
the soviet response said efforts are being made to bring soviet 
laws into conformity with international standards 
in addition it said there has been discussion of the creation 
of an independent commission to examine any and all complaints of 
wrongful acts by employees of the psychiatric service and for 
public monitoring of the activity of psychiatric institutions 
the us team made the visit against a background of allegations 
about misuse of psychiatric treatment in the soviet union one 
report cited 346 cases of alleged psychiatric abuse between 1977 and 
1983 
the perception that the problem was rampant prompted the world 
psychiatric association to condemn moscow in 1977 for the alleged 
practices 
faced with expulsion from the group the soviet allunion society 
of neuropathologists and psychiatrists resigned from the wpa in 1983 
but the american delegation acknowledged there has been progress 
in recent years toward establishing some legal protection for 
patients subject to forced confinement

leaders of the worlds seven major industrial 
democracies gather in paris on friday for their 15th annual economic 
summit surrounded by frances bicentennial hoopla and with a 
comfortable sense of economic selfsatisfaction 
the oil crises inflationary pressures monetary instability and 
other woes that dominated previous summits seem contained giving 
the government leaders time to take an unhurried look at matters 
such as the environment and third world debt 
the surge in the dollar that started in june sending economic 
shivers down the backs of many a government official has been 
cooled after massive intervention by central banks selling dollars 
an optimistic us treasury secretary nicholas brady emphasized 
the western economies are doing well and the coordination process 
among the seven the united states canada japan west germany 
france italy and britain is working there is no need for 
tinkering during the threeday summit beginning friday he said 
the summit is taking place in a period of growth noted 
jacques attali a special adviser to french president francois 
mitterrand the discussions will be on how to manage this growth 
lack of an immediate economic crisis is good news for debtor 
nations and the third world in general while debt is not a new 
subject for the seven this year it will be the priority of 
priorities according to attali 
both mitterrand and brady are pushing plans that involve 
forgiving part of third world debts in exchange for guarantees that 
the rest will be paid nobody opposes the idea but there are 
differences over where to find the money to finance the plan 
mitterrand long has cast himself as the champion of the poor 
underdeveloped and indebted he hopes the summit will end with a 
paris plan for debt reduction in may he announced france will 
forgive 16 billion francs the equivalent of about 25 billion in 
public debt owed by africas 35 poorest countries 
president bush recently said the united states will forgive about 
1 billion in debt owed by 16 subsaharan african nations starting 
oct 1 
bush making his first outing at a big 7 summit on monday 
proposed a 100 million american aid package to help private 
entrepreneurs in poland coupled with debt relief and new loans 
bush said he will be seeking similar funds from the other 
participants at the paris summit 
on wednesday bush announced an aid package for hungary which 
includes plans to ask congress for 25 million in new aid to spur 
that countrys moves toward a freemarket economy 
the french expect washington to make a major debt initiative at 
the summit 
not everybody is enchanted with the idea of holding the summit of 
the worlds richest countries at the same time as the celebration of 
the 200th anniversary of the french revolution that overthrew the 
monarchy some believe the bicentennial celebrations ignore todays 
politically and economically oppressed 
thousands of people demonstrated and tens of thousands attended a 
protest concert saturday organized by the french singer renaud 
leaders of 31 countries are to attend the bicentennial 
celebrations which include a series of lunches dinners 
ceremonies parades and receptions 
as is usual with these summits politics will be the first item 
on the menu french officials stress that the seven leaders will 
talk about anything that interests them but that it is virtually 
certain that the situation in china and poland will be at the top of 
the political list along with the middle east and terrorism 
a joint political statement probably will be issued in addition 
to a final communique 
the themes for the summit are the classic ones economic and 
monetary cooperation trade protectionism and development 
mitterrand also wants a discussion on the laundering of drug money 
but the new topic and the one being emphasized here after the 
question of debt is the environment 
the french in particular want to get into detail on air and 
water pollution and action that can be taken in cases such as the 
alaska oil spill

doctors said he would never smile and would 
be lucky to live more than a few weeks but a boy born without a 
brain is now 5 years old and laughs at disney channel programs says 
his adoptive mother 
andrew just glows said kaye j vandal he laughs he 
giggles he smiles he has an outgoing bubbly personality that 
really draws people to him 
doctors said he would never smile never respond never grow 
ms vandal said all those things have proved to be untrue 
andrew who celebrated his 5th birthday wednesday is in 
excellent health said ms vandal a pediatric nurse who lives in 
wallingford conn 
he had not even had a cold until this past year when he 
developed the flu she said in a telephone interview but he got 
over it in normal fashion and went back to nursery school 
soon after andrew was born in roanoke doctors ran tests that 
showed he had no brain a cyst had formed at the stem of the brain 
and kept the rest of it from forming leaving his skull filled with 
fluid a condition known as hydranencephaly 
he survived because the brain stem contains the nerve center that 
controls breathing and circulation the parts of the brain that 
allow humans to think and coordinate muscular movement the 
cerebrum and cerebellum never formed 
dr robert t leshner a professor of neurology and pediatrics at 
the medical college of virginia said there is no known treatment 
for hydranencephaly and that the prognosis for such patients is poor 
most children with the condition dont make it past the first 
year of life he said the cause of the condition is not known 
andrews biological mother had decided before his birth that she 
would give up her child for adoption 
foster parents took care of the boy for five months while the 
richmondbased childrens home society of virginia a private 
adoption agency searched for prospective parents 
andrew was the hardest adoption i ever did said sharon e 
peterson the societys director of development we decided were 
not putting this kid in an institution were going to place him 
ms vandal sought to adopt andrew after reading a newspaper story 
about him 
andrew who is 3 feet tall weighs 32 pounds and has golden 
curly hair and blue eyes will start his third year of nursery 
school in the fall ms vandal said 
other children treat him wonderfully he participates in all 
activities other children do and is very much a part of 
everything she said 
ms vandal has two girls with conditions similar to andrews one 
is 12 years old the other 3 she said all three will never walk or 
be able to sit or stand unsupported 
andrew is constantly on the move she said he lies on the 
floor on his back and kicks around the floor as soon as we open the 
sliding glass door he heads right out the door and onto the porch 
andrew cannot speak and is cortically blind which means images 
are being seen but not interpreted 
still said ms vandal he laughs when he watches the disney 
channel on tv 
ms vandal a single parent lives with her parents they help 
care for the children 
we let him do what he wants to do she said the more he 
does the more he gains im not sure how long that will go on but 
it hasnt stopped yet were giving him the best quality of life for 
however long he lives

a senate committee has approved a measure by 
sen edward m kennedy to require american employers to provide 
health insurance to all their workers and their workers dependents 
the measure cleared kennedys labor and human resources committee 
on a 97 partyline vote wednesday but its strongly opposed by the 
administration and other powerful groups including many business 
organizations 
the kennedy bill is intended to provide coverage for the 
estimated 37 million americans not now covered by any public or 
private health insurance 
although many of the details have been reworked the bill is 
similar to one that cleared the committee last year but was not 
considered in either the full senate or house 
kennedy noted that the majority of businesses already insure 
their workers yet twothirds of all the americans who lack basic 
health insurance protection are workers or members of working 
families 
labor secretary elizabeth dole argued against the measure in a 
letter to kennedy saying enactment of his bill would result in a 
significant loss of job opportunities impair our nations economic 
competitiveness and interfere with the right of employees and 
employers to determine between themselves the most appropriate 
compensation package to meet their circumstances

networks are increasing the number of major league baseball games 
they carry a cable tv group says 
the national cable television association on wednesday disputed 
claims that cable companies are stealing baseball from free tv 
local broadcast coverage of professional baseball has grown by 
nearly 40 percent over the past 15 years from 1190 games in 1975 
to 1647 games in 1989 the association said 
the number of baseball games televised by both local broadcast 
stations and by regional cable sports networks has increased 7 
percent since 1985 the ncta said 
as a result cables baseball coverage has served to 
supplement rather than reduce the number of games aired by local 
broadcasters the cable association said in a report 
availability of baseball games on broadcast and cable television 
it said some broadcasters have contended that baseball on cable 
has reduced the number of games carried by local television stations

national guardsmen have joined police in 
their battle against violent drugdealing gangs from los angeles 
that have wreaked havoc on portlands north side 
mayor bud clark and state officials said wednesday the first of 
36 national guardsmen reported to work late last week with the 
portland police bureau and the oregon state police 
the rest will join the ranks by the end of this week and eight 
others will be on call said the guards director gen fred rees 
the guardsmen will fill support roles acting as spanish 
interpreters taking telephone tips and doing paperwork that will 
enable police to deploy more officers on the streets 
portland is beset by gang violence with five killings blamed on 
driveby gang shootings since august 
there have been about four dozen gangrelated shootings this 
year including one tuesday night that seriously wounded a 
13yearold boy 
its clearly a problem said gregg kantor governor neil 
goldschmidts spokesman its not as big as los angeles gang 
problem but it is very serious for us and one we dont intend to 
tolerate 
officials have not decided how long the guardsmen will remain in 
portland but the effort has federal financing through october 
its just one more increment one more step robert jackson 
the governors anticrime coordinator said at a news conference 
the gang problem is bigger than this the narcotics problem is 
bigger than this 
driveby gang shootings were unheard of in the pacific northwest 
until last summer when the rival drugdealing crips and bloods 
gangs began expanding from los angeles to portland and other cities 
turf battles ensued and the regions first fatal driveby gang 
shooting occurred last aug 17 
were not going to walk away from this saying 36 or 40 troops 
is enough until we have gotten rid of the drug problem in oregon and 
specifically in portland jackson said 
portland deputy chief dan noelle said the guardsmen will free up 
more officers for street deployments 
in terms of looking at raw numbers its not a big deal 
noelle said but in terms of support work its a real asset 
the state received 474000 from the department of defense to use 
the national guard to fight crime about half that money will be 
used to pay troops in portland through sept 30 rees said 
congress specifically said the national guard could be used only 
for support when it passed an act giving states 300 million for 
antidrug efforts rees said 
the national guard is not supposed to be in the arrest or 
seizure business he said

a grand jury indicted 13 people on charges 
they conspired to defraud a federally subsidized housing program 
that was designed to help lowincome residents become homeowners 
the indictments which followed a twoyear investigation of a 
brookhaven program called saveahouse were handed up wednesday 
two of the 13 charged are former law enforcement officers 
were talking about people that would steal the pennies off a 
dead mans eyes said suffolk county district attorney patrick 
henry 
the charges come at a time of numerous reports of fraud 
corruption and influencepeddling in similar programs funded by the 
us department of housing and urban development across the country 
under the saveahouse program 18 houses were designated to be 
sold to lowincome families for 500 each 
the indictment alleges that 14 of these homes were fraudulently 
obtained for between 500 to 5000 by people representing 
themselves as eligible recipients under the hud guidelines 
these people are devoid of any conscience henry said the 
sad part is that they deprived deserving families of a roof over 
their heads 
a source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that the investigation was proceeding into all 
housing programs in suffolk county that received federal funds 
during the past eight years 
more indictments are expected the source said 
all of the people who allegedly bought the houses fraudulently 
were either close friends or relatives of three of the defendants 
thomas brazier 43 of westhampton a former us bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms agent albert iannuzzi 45 of smithtown a 
former suffolk police officer and garrett story 50 of bellport 
they were charged with grand larceny 
the three defendants still control the houses through their real 
estate companies and rented out the houses for an average of 800 a 
month in some cases to people whose rent is subsidized by welfare 
james orourke defense attorney for brazier and iannuzzi said 
the charges were part of a vendetta against his clients 
they didnt do anything illegal or criminal orourke said 
an opportunity was presented and they took advantage of an 
opportunity 
the 13 each pleaded innocent at arraignments in suffolk county 
court some were released on their own recognizances others had 
bail set from between 5000 to 25000 
only one of the 13 was not a friend or relative of brazier 
iannuzzi or story 
linda spahr the assistant district attorney who led the probe 
said that investigators are still searching for the county employee 
who approved the applications for the houses

an ointment that makes skin grow faster can speed 
up natures healing process and could capture a substantial share of 
the billion dollar market for wound care products researchers 
reported today 
the experimental treatment is based on a natural substance called 
epidermal growth factor that is produced through gene splicing 
in a report on the new england journal of medicine doctors found 
that it could cut more than a day off the healing time of people 
undergoing skin grafts 
it had always been taught in medical school that you could not 
stimulate wounds to heal faster said dr gregory l brown who 
directed the study we set out to show that you could 
the hormone was produced for this experiment by chiron a 
biotechnology firm in emeryville calif 
to the best of our knowledge no one has ever before made a 
claim for a prescription drug on the basis of its favorable effect 
on wound healing according to an editorial in the journal 
the editorial by drs thomas k hunt and frederick b la van of 
the university of california san francisco said the latest 
research appears to be the longawaited first carefully conducted 
study showing that the approach actually works 
the annual market for products used in the care of wounds in 
this country is more than 1 billion and a successful growth 
factorbased product would be expected to capture a substantial 
share of the market they wrote 
brown and colleagues conducted the study on 12 people being 
treated for burns and broken legs at emory and vanderbilt 
universities each patient received separate applications of cream 
on sidebyside wounds where skin had been removed for grafts one 
application contained the growth factor the other did not 
in every patient the wound getting the hormone healed faster 
the healing time varied from person to person but on average the 
wounds getting the growth factor completely healed in about 11 days 
while those without the treatment took 1 days longer 
brown said that while the benefits of the treatment were minor 
for these people the study was a necessary first step to 
demonstrate that the hormone actually spurs healing the way 
scientists had theorized 
the important thing is to show efficacy and then to open 
different areas where is it clinically more important he said 
brown noted that the treatment could help save the lives of 
people who have extensive burns and little skin available for 
grafts doctors must repeatedly harvest skin from the same unburned 
area allowing time for healing in between 
brown also said he has used the treatment on two people with 
burns over 80 percent of their bodies with the growth hormone 
doctors were able to take skin from the same area five times while 
ordinarily they would have only been able to do so three times 
brown said the hormone also may heal chronic wounds bed sores or 
diabetic ulcers he speculated that someday it might even be sold 
over the counter to help clear up minor cuts and burns

the authenticity of 19 superman collages by andy 
warhol has been called into question by two comic book experts who 
say the superman cutouts didnt appear in print until years after 
the date on the artworks 
either they were misdated or somebody has made some work that 
is not what it purports to be said robert miller a new york art 
dealer who owns 18 of the collages 
the discrepancy was detected by comic book experts arlen schumer 
and richard sheinaus during independent visits to a warhol 
retrospective at the museum of modern art in new york which ran 
from feb 6 to may 2 
schumer said in a telephone interview monday he was looking in 
the exhibition catalog at an untitled superman collage dated 
196061 when he recognized the inking style of the artist who did 
the cartoon panel 
i remembered that jack abel did not start inking superman until 
the late 1960s maybe 1969 and i thought hold it something is 
wrong here 
when i met sheinaus a month later he said did you notice 
anything funny about the warhol exhibition schumer said i 
looked him right in the eye and said one has got to be a fraud 
he said you wont believe this but there are about 15 of 
them 
the series of 19 collages has been estimated to be worth about 5 
million each piece was signed twice and dated 196061 the dc 
comics they came from like supermans greatest blunder 1968 
and muto vs the man of tomorrow 1966 sold for 12 cents each 
seven of the collages cutouts from original comic books that 
were pasted on paper and splattered with red or blue paint were on 
display during the moma retrospective six were loaned by miller 
one by an unidentified private collector said jeanne collins a 
museum spokeswoman 
in a statement the museum said works of art are selected for 
exhibitions based on careful research and on the best information 
available at the time 
in any retrospective of an artist there may be questions 
regarding dating however we have no reason whatsoever to doubt the 
authenticity of any of the works included in the andy warhol 
retrospective it said 
edward hayes a lawyer for the warhol estate said that the 
discrepancy in dating was being investigated but that a preliminary 
examination indicated the collages were authentic 
however vincent fremont a director of the estate told the san 
francisco chronicle which reported on the mismatch in dates on 
monday that he didnt recall seeing the collages during the 60s 
and 70s 
ive worked with andy since i was 18 and you didnt see them 
being bought and sold he said you see what i am saying 
gerard malanga who in 1963 became warhols first studio 
assistant said he saw the collages for the first time at the 
exhibition 
i was fascinated because i knew almost everything andy was 
doing at that time and i thought why didnt i know about these 
things 
he said that later when he learned about the discrepancy in 
dates he doubted that the works were warhols 
those pieces require someone to sit down at a kitchen table 
with scissors and glue he said andy would not have taken the 
time to do something like that 
he also noted that during 196162 warhols comic book images 
were paintings not collages warhol quit using comic book images 
after about 1962 when he learned roy lichtenstein was also using 
them 
malanga also noted that warhol often had his assistants sign his 
works for him

the immensely unpopular chief of leningrads 
communist party has been removed from the post president mikhail s 
gorbachev announced calling the move a critical step in the 
democratization of the ruling party 
the official yuri solovyov was rejected by voters in march 
elections for the new congress despite running unopposed it was an 
embarrassing vote of no confidence a majority of voters scratched 
his name off the ballot 
the 60yearold solovyov who had headed the countrys second 
most powerful regional party organization is also likely to lose 
his seat on the partys 20member ruling politburo 
gorbachev had gone to leningrad to oversee the leadership change 
and announced that solvyov was being replaced by boris gidaspov a 
56yearold industrial chemist credited with economic innovation 
voters in leningrad the countrys secondlargest city with 48 
million residents rejected virtually their entire party leadership 
in the historic spring elections for the congress of peoples 
deputies 
solovyov has shared the blame with other leningrad officials for 
pollution in the region and taking a hard line on dissent 
gorbachev said the leningrad party central committees decision 
wednesday to retire solovyov is a critical step in developing the 
process of democratization of the internal life of the entire 
party 
in an extraordinary television interview that included both 
solovyov and gidaspov the soviet leader said the decision to change 
leadership came in response to party dissatisfaction 
the president who had promoted solovyov to the politburo three 
years ago said the party is lagging in its efforts to restructure 
the soviet union 
many things are not being solved in the proper time and this 
is due to the fact that the party itself does not act in time he 
said 
gorbachevs statement followed several days of similar comments 
in the soviet press including the communist party daily pravda 
after the march election defeat of 12 members of the leningrad 
leadership a poll found that 68 percent of the citys residents and 
66 percent of its party members did not believe the current party 
leadership has the ability to radically change the situation in the 
city 
solovyov seated next to gorbachev in the television interview 
said the most important task he leaves for his successor is 
increasing the authority of the party on a democratic basis and 
eliminating its complacency 
in april gorbachev sharply reprimanded solovyov at a kremlin 
meeting for complaining that the party had lost its unity and was 
becoming a discussion club 
gidaspov who was elected to the congress of peoples deputies 
has been touted as a leader in economic experimentation for his work 
as head of an enterprise that runs joint ventures of several 
industries without interference from moscow ministries 
in the television interview gidaspov promised to open discussion 
of the citys problems to a variety of groups including 
environmentalists 
he said 18thcentury central leningrad marked by crumbling 
pastel facades should be restored

trading in tokyo today while stock prices slipped 
the dollar closed at 13905 yen down 145 yen from its finish on 
wednesday after opening lower at 13963 yen the us currency 
ranged between 13882 and 13968 yen 
currency dealers said the market was quiet as players waited for 
the release of us economic figures including producer prices for 
june retail sales and industrial production all due out friday 
there was some profittaking causing the dollars fall said 
masato sanjo a dealer in the tokyo office of manufacturers hanover 
trustbut i dont expect any major movements in the market until 
the release of economic indicators tomorrow 
another dealer said a comment wednesday by the governor of the 
bank of japan also encouraged the dollarselling satoshi sumita 
reportedly told journalists that the us currency was still too 
strong against the yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which shed 4525 points wednesday lost another 
7036 points or 020 percent closing at 3363116 
securities dealers said the recent strong performance of overseas 
stock exchanges was encouraging investors on the tokyo market but 
the low volume of trading reflected investors lack of interest and 
concern over continuing political uncertainties in japan 
the external environment is not too bad but investors find it 
hard to particapate in trading as long as political uncertainties 
persist said ichitaro watanabe a dealer for nikko securities 
the governing liberal democratic partys majority in the upper 
house of the diet japans parliament is widely seen in jeopardy in 
upcoming elections because of the partys involvement in scandals 
and a public uproar over an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax

a killer was spared the electric chair as state 
justices reviewed conflicting laws on executing mentally retarded 
people while federal judges considered the same issue in the case 
of an alabama killer 
the cases followed the us supreme court decision two weeks ago 
that allows states to execute mentally retarded murderers as long as 
sentencing juries or judges have considered the defendants mental 
condition 
the georgia supreme court voted 43 wednesday to delay the 
scheduled execution of son fleming who was sentenced to die for the 
1976 slaying of a georgia police chief the stay came wednesday five 
hours before the 59yearold fleming was to go to the electric chair 
in the second case attorneys for murdererrapist horace franklin 
dunkins jr turned today to the 11th circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta in a bid to halt his execution at 1201 am friday in 
alabama the lawyers claim dunkins is mentally retarded 
a us district judge on wednesday turned down the appeal 
in the fleming case a new georgia law bans executions of the 
mentally retarded but it does not apply retroactively flemings 
death warrant runs for a week and he could be executed at any time 
during that period if the court rules by then court officials said 
the review could take several days 
flemings iq scores range from 64 to 72 a person with an iq of 
70 is considered mentally handicapped 
the execution of the mentally retarded in georgia is cruel and 
unusual punishment said flemings attorney ken shapiro there 
should be no fine line between those who happen to be tried in 1989 
and those who happen to be tried in 1976 thats an arbitrary 
distinction happenstance that should not be applicable 
on tuesday the pardons and paroles board rejected flemings 
appeal for clemency board chairman wayne snow said the decision was 
made on grounds that fleming was aware of the consequences of his 
actions no matter what his iq 
snow said the us supreme court decision also was a factor in 
the boards decision 
fleming of rochelle was convicted along with henry willis iii 
of killing ray city police chief ed giddens in 1976 willis was 
executed may 18 flemings nephew larry fleming is serving a life 
sentence for murder in the case 
dunkins attorneys meanwhile argued his execution should be 
halted on grounds that a jury didnt consider dunkins alleged 
mental deficiency during his 1981 trial in court documents 
dunkins iq was listed at 69 
in wednesdays denial of a stay of execution us district judge 
james hancock said that even if jurors didnt consider dunkins 
mental condition the trial judge did the judge sentenced dunkins 
to die in alabamas electric chair 
alabama has no state law prohibiting the execution of the 
mentally retarded 
a jury convicted dunkins in may 1981 of capital murder in the 
rape and slaying of lynn mccurry a 26yearold mother of four from 
warrior ala

supreme court justice john paul 
stevens said death penalty cases are a very severe burden on the 
judicial system and questioned whether executions deter crime 
stevens speaking wednesday to the annual conference of the 9th 
us circuit court of appeals said states should consider the 
judicial burden when the issue of capital punishment arises 
i would think from time to time when legislators confront 
whether the capital sentencing whole deathpenalty business is 
really worth the cost one of the elements of the costs that ought 
to be factored into the equation is the very severe burden on the 
judicial system both state and federal stevens said 
he cited the supreme courts emergency hearings on requests for 
stays of execution the hearings are often late at night 
as the number of executions is continuing to increase one 
can raise the question whether theyre really doing all that much to 
deter crime stevens said 
asked afterward whether he thought the burdens of the death 
penalty on the legal system outweighed the benefits stevens said 
there is a serious question and declined to comment further 
stevens a 1975 appointee of president ford has voted to allow 
some executions but dissented from the courts recent rulings that 
allowed states to execute 16yearolds and mentally retarded adults 
on another topic stevens said the court wasnt affected by the 
flood of letters before last weeks abortion ruling 
the only problem was sorting that stuff out and throwing it in 
the wastebasket because nobody read any of it said stevens who 
voted against the decision that gave states to more power to 
regulate abortions

scientists said today they have found a 
highaltitude deficit in ozone over the arctic revealing what may 
be an early step toward periodic ozone depletions like those seen 
over antarctica 
arctic depletions would be smaller than those forming the annual 
ozone hole over antarctica said dj hofmann a university of 
wyoming physicist and an author of the study published in the 
british journal nature 
but anytime man can perturb the natural ozone profile in any 
way i think we should be worried he said then were in a 
situation where we can better know exactly how were doing it 
so that we can correct it 
manmade chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons are blamed for 
destroying ozone a form of oxygen found high in the atmosphere 
ozone blocks ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer so scientists 
are concerned by signs of ozone loss 
the antarctic hole is an area in which up to 50 percent of 
atmospheric ozone disappears for a limited time in the arctic 
perhaps 25 percent could disappear under highly unusual worstcase 
circumstances said hofmann who conducted the study with scientists 
from france japan new zealand and the university of houston 
previous studies also have suggested ozone depletions over the 
arctic 
the study does not prove that the observed deficit is an early 
step in ozone depletion but it is very suggestive said james 
friend an atmospheric chemistry professor at drexel university in 
philadelphia 
i think theyre probably right but they have a lot of 
suppositions friend said 
the new observations were made by balloonborne instruments 
launched last january in northern sweden the instruments detected 
the apparent ozone deficit at altitudes between about 14 miles and 
16 miles 
the antarctic ozone hole develops as such highlevel deficits 
spread to lower altitudes where most polar ozone is found hofmann 
said in a telephone interview 
but the arctic atmosphere presents obstacles to that process 
hofmann said 
one is that a funnellike wind pattern needed for the deficits to 
spread tends to break down in the arctic in contrast to its 
stability in the antarctic in fact researchers reported this 
pattern disintegrated soon after the highaltitude ozone deficit was 
discovered 
another barrier is that very low temperatures needed for 
destruction of ozone do not typically appear in the arctic at lower 
altitudes where ozone is depleted in antarctica hofmann said 
but arctic air is cold enough at higher altitudes and if the 
crucial wind pattern remained stable perhaps 25 percent of 
atmospheric ozone could be destroyed over an affected area he said 
that situation is highly unlikely he said 
the deficit which appeared under conditions unusually favorable 
for ozone depletion represents about a 3 percent decline he said

although its said ernest hemingway may 
have felt his hometown was death in the afternoon this chicago 
suburb is planning a moveable feast to honor the writer on what 
would have been his 90th birthday 
he was a failure as a person but as a writer he was the 
greatest morris buske historian of oak parks hemingway 
foundation said wednesday in a telephone interview 
he antagonized people at his death he had few friends he was 
a braggart he was cruel he was basically insecure 
then why honor such a person 
because he was the great writer said buske it appears 
more and more that he was the best american writer of this century 
ernest miller hemingway nobel prizewinning author of death 
in the afternoon a moveable feast the sun also rises 
for whom the bell tolls a farewell to arms and the old 
man and the sea was born july 21 1899 in oak park and lived 
here until he was 18 
every july the foundation marks the occasion with a week of 
events this year a new us postage stamp with papas portrait on 
it will be presented 
the biggest thing is the stamp which will appear first in key 
west on july 17 and in oak park on july 21 said buske 
the post office announced they were issuing the stamp in key 
west his home in later life and when we found about it we 
raised such a fuss they caved in and agreed to let us in on the 
event its unusual for a bureaucracy 
on july 21 hemingways son jack will speak at a ceremony at the 
oak park post office dedicating the stamp 
the weeklong birthday tribute begins friday with a bastille day 
street party at a restaurant 
also scheduled are a hemingway film festival introduced by 
another son patrick tours of the two houses the writertobe lived 
in a gourmet picnic at 40 a person with menu items from 
granddaughter joans cookbook and a family reunion of the burly 
writers two sons and assorted nieces nephews and inlaws 
buske said oak parkers who dont like hemingway are quick to 
quote a line attributed to the bearded writer that the suburb has 
broad lawns and narrow minds 
but buske said he has done extensive research and has never been 
able to confirm hemingway ever said such a thing 
scott schwar chairman of the hemingway foundation said the 
quote gives the impression that he didnt like oak park and that 
isnt true he had a normal happy childhood and he got a good 
education here 
his family was active in community affairs and in photographing 
themselves so we have plenty of photos schwar said 
although hemingway only wrote short stories of his chicagoarea 
roots buske thinks the author who committed suicide while gravely 
ill in 1961 actually was deeply influenced by the suburbs morality 
and hardwork ethic 
he didnt feel right when he wasnt following oak park 
traditions lets take sexual morality he married the girls he went 
with he wasnt content just to sleep with them 
the motto of oak park high school which he attended is 
nothing but the best and that is what ernest sought he was 
always comparing himself with other writers to show that he was the 
world champion writer

a bill repealing a new law that allowed 
police to withhold the names of all felony victims has been sent to 
gov bill clements who will sign it a spokeswoman says 
at the direction of the governor our staff worked with 
sponsors of the bill to make sure the problem was straightened 
out said rossanna salazar deputy gubernatorial press secretary 
the repeal was approved by the house with a 1340 vote after it 
was amended to protect certain crime victims from being contacted by 
companies soliciting business such as those selling home security 
systems 
the senate concurred with the amendment 270 and sent the bill 
to clements 
news organizations decried the confidentiality law after several 
law enforcement agencies began withholding information they 
previously had made public 
the law was passed during the regular session that ended may 29 
some agencies withheld information on missing children and 
accident victims said san antonio light publisher george irish in 
testimony this week to a house committee irish represented texas 
media a first amendment and freedomofinformation coalition of 
seven news organizations in urging repeal 
rep fred blair who sponsored the confidentiality law and the 
bill repealing it said the original measure was being broadly 
applied to accident victims dwis missing children all the kinds 
of things that we want to provide information on 
so we repealed it and were going to take a look at it in the 
future said blair 
blair said the bill sent to the governor accomplishes about 
half of what he wants in order to protect crime victims but that 
he wanted an ample opportunity for full discussion before 
attempting further changes 
the bill in addition to the repeal would prohibit using crime 
victim information obtained from law enforcement agencies to solicit 
business from the victim or a family member of the victim 
the prohibition would apply to victims who were injured in a 
crime or whose home was illegally entered 
the bill would give the attorney general power to sue under the 
deceptive trade practices act to stop such use of the information 
violation of the law would be punishable by civil penalties up to 
10000 plus court costs and attorneys fees 
the repeal would be immediate and the solicitation section would 
take effect jan 1

an infant was killed with a gun her 
6yearold sister found under their parents pillow hours after gov 
bob martinez signed a bill intended to protect children from 
accidental shootings 
tenmonthold enercida suarez was shot late late wednesday and 
died early today at st josephs hospital in tampa police said 
she was the seventh victim of such an accident since june 1 
the 6yearold found the 38caliber revolver laying on their 
parents bed under a pillow and thinking it was a toy and fired 
it one time striking the girl in the head said tampa police 
officer s middleton 
possible charges are pending against the girls parents amancio 
and reina suarez and police are continuing to investigate the 
shooting middleton said 
but the law martinez signed wednesday doesnt take effect until 
october 1 and wont apply in this case he said 
the law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to 
keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out of the hands 
of children age 15 and younger by using trigger locks or keeping the 
weapon in a locked box 
this will assist in protecting our children throughout the 
state martinez said the added public awareness will prompt 
adults to keep guns out of reach 
wednesdays signing ceremony also came one day after a 9yearold 
clearwater boy shot himself in the finger tomy zemko found the 
25caliber pistol after climbing onto a chair to get some potato 
chips from atop the refrigerator in his grandmothers home he was 
treated for a broken finger 
three children died and two were wounded in the earlier 
shootings inspiring lawmakers to push for the firstofits kind 
legislation during a special session last month 
the law provides for adult gun owners to be charged with a 
felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a 5000 fine 
if a child shoots himself or another child because of the owners 
carelessness 
if a minor threatens someone with the gun or displays it in 
public its owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days in 
jail with a 500 fine 
no grieving parent of an injured or fatally wounded child shot by 
another member of the family could be arrested until seven days 
after the shooting 
there are exemptions for hunting and targetshooting accidents 
and those involving guns taken illegally 
the measure also will authorize the development of a gun safety 
program in the states public schools 
the unified sportsmen of florida the state affiliate of the 
national rifle association helped lawmakers write legislation it 
could support after a stronger version it opposed was rejected 
during the legislatures regular 60day session which ended june 3 
the florida law may inspire similar legislation in other states 
said bernard horn state legislative director for washingtonbased 
handgun control inc 
lawmakers from states including california new york illinois 
ohio wisconsin connecticut massachusetts maryland and virginia 
have contacted horns organization about the law he said

a federal judge cited parallels between an 
international money laundering case and the plot of lethal weapon 
2 in forbidding a jury to see the film until after the trial 
none of the jurors in the trial of three men including the 
yugoslavian consul general in chicago had seen the film as of 
tuesday when us district judge jan e dubois issued his order 
he told jurors to avoid seeing the film reading reviews of it 
and talking to anyone who has seen it for the trials duration 
dubois said the order was a small imposition to ensure a fair 
trial which began june 19 it is expected to last into august 
the film which stars mel gibson and opened in philadelphia over 
the weekend is about an international money laundering scheme 
involving a south african diplomat and an eccentric accountant who 
has laundered money for the mob and has decided to cooperate with 
prosecutors 
the trial has a similar theme the key prosecution witness is 
hubert f cole a chemical engineer and tax protester who aspired to 
be a money launderer for the mob 
cole was arrested dec 1 at philadelphia international airport 
and in april pleaded guilty and became the prosecutions key witness 
a spokesman for warner bros said the similar plot lines of movie 
and trial were coincidental lethal weapon 2 began filming in 
november and the script was written months earlier 
michael c goode the attorney for bahrudin bijedic 48 the 
yugoslavian consul general on trial asked dubois for the order he 
said bijedic was deeply depressed after seeing the film goode 
added that he felt the movie could sway a juror against his client 
the others on trial are vinko mir 54 of new york city chairman 
of the board of lbs bank of new york inc vjeskoslov spanjol 31 
of plano texas a naturalized us citizen and the bank itself 
they are charged in a conspiracy to launder 35 million provided

anyone can move a harp but few can do 
it with the charm and wit of hans verbugt and george bruls 
organizers of the usa international harp competition realized 
this when they invited the dutch boys to move harps here during 
the 10day competition 
theyre just really fun to have around said elizabeth 
hainen one of four finalists theyre good for everyones 
spirits 
the two have been known to dance all night and move harps all day 
without losing their charm they take seriously the task of 
entertaining contestants who have been eliminated 
their responsibilities however are not all fun and games 
carrying the harp with its 47 strings and 2000 moving pieces is 
serious business elaborate charts are required to get the right 
harp in the right place at the right moment 
contestants are very nervous normally bruls said to break 
a harp is one thing if you put it down with a bump then they start 
saying oh no the tuning is gone before you break it you can 
really screw up the tuning 
the men also shuffle two piano benches and several special harp 
chairs for contestants 
they want their own chairs verbugt said it has to be in a 
particular position with this side facing out or that one 
everything has to be that way otherwise they cannot get into their 
proper mood 
they take the load off our shoulders said robert g 
campbell president and executive director of the competition 
wed have to hire somebody whod have to be trained how to handle 
harps 
during this competition at indiana university bruls and verbugt 
have moved harps from practice rooms to the stage for 37 
competitors they also have stood on their heads to evoke smiles and 
held a harpist tightly when a painful finger forced her to quit the 
competition 
verbugt a musicologist and bruls a physicist are the last to 
see a harpist before she goes onstage and the first to congratulate 
or console her after the performance 
some need a shoulder to cry on some need someone to laugh 
with bruls said this stupid carrying anyone can do it the

an oily slick several miles long may be from 
residue dissolving in the tanks of the exxon valdez as the damaged 
tanker goes in circles outside san diego bay coast guard officials 
said 
coast guard cmdr jack scarborough said wednesday the residue may 
have dissolved as the ship entered the waters of southern 
california where the valdez is to undergo extensive repairs 
the 987foot ship was damaged in march when it crashed into a 
reef in prince william sound off alaska it spilled nearly 11 
million gallons of oil the worst spill in us history 
officials were awaiting results of samples sent to a coast guard 
laboratory in connecticut to determine the source of this weeks 
leak exxon officials say the material is leaking from the valdez 
but they dont know what it is 
the valdez remained about 50 miles off san diego early today it 
has been barred from entering the bay until it is free of 
environmental and navigational hazards 
scarborough said the difference in the water temperatures may 
have caused the recent leaking that would explain why the folks 
in alaska felt they had a clean ship when she sailed and would 
explain why we have a dirty ship now 
but exxon shipping president frank iarossi said he doubted that 
was the case i dont think temperature is a significant factor 
iarossi said the reason is we operate in 80degree temperatures 
all the time 
alaskan waters were about 35 degrees san diegos are about 60 
degrees 
scarborough said the ship was trailing an oily slick about 11 
miles long wednesday but that the discharges have become 
intermittent and less concentrated 
two longer slicks that formed monday and tuesday were said to be 
dissipating exxon agreed wednesday to hire a cleanup vessel to 
mitigate any environmental damage 
officials said the impact on fish and wildlife was expected to be 
negligible 
once the leakage stops for at least a 24hour period the ship 
will be towed to a sheltered cove probably off navyowned san 
clemente island so divers can remove five pieces of metal hanging 
from the hull to allow the ship to enter the shallow harbor 
after the repairs the ship is to enter the harbor to begin a 25 
million overhaul at national steel and shipbuilding co where it was 
built in 1986

a judge must decide whether a cocaine addict 
whose two children were born with the drug in their bodies should be 
found guilty of delivering drugs to her unborn babies 
a prosecutor said jennifer johnson 23 knew she was feeding her 
daughter cocaine through the umbilical cord 
she knew full well a long time ago that when she took cocaine 
it went to that baby assistant state attorney jeff deen said 
but johnsons lawyer michael sweeting questioned whether her 
addiction justified charges of drug trafficking and child abuse he 
said johnson could not have known that she was committing such a 
crime and should be acquitted 
no matter how egregious my clients behavior was you cannot 
make her criminally responsible for that which was not a crime 
yet sweeting said 
seminole circuit judge oh eaton jr who is hearing the case 
without a jury presided over the first day of testimony wednesday 
and said he may issue a verdict today 
johnson of altamonte springs faces drug delivery charges 
normally reserved for drug pushers her daughter born in january and 
a son born in 1987 were found with traces of the illegal drug in 
their bodies 
her mother testified that johnson admitted to using cocaine 
during the past three years and while pregnant 
the only other woman in the state to face similar charges had her 
case dropped recently on technical grounds 
a grand jury in rockford ill refused to indict a woman for 
manslaughter in may in the cocainelinked death of her 2dayold 
daughter in 1987 a california judge dismissed a charge of failure 
to provide medical care to a child lodged against a woman whose son 
was born damaged and later died prosecutors had accused her of 
ignoring a doctors advice not to abuse drugs 
the johnson case could set a dangerous precedent according to 
the american civil liberties union which sent a representative from 
new york city and a doctor who testified on johnsons behalf 
dr stephen kandall said it could not be proven without a doubt 
that the umbilical cord carried the illegal drug from johnson to her 
babies 
aclu staff counselor marjorie smith the state could better spend 
its time finding ways to treat addicted women and warned that a 
conviction could discourage cocaine users from seeking medical help 
when pregnant out of fear they may wind up in jail 
word travels fast she said 
but deen argued that by holding johnson criminally liable the 
state could take an active role in preventing women from having 
cocaineaddicted babies 
johnson who now lives in an apopka drug treatment center did 
not testify her mother and aunt have custody of her children who 
are healthy

a tiny video camera and cable used in a federal 
investigation of political corruption were uncovered by a busboy at 
a restaurant across from city hall an attorney for the restaurants 
owners says 
the fbi planted the listening devices and they were discovered 
by one of our busboys attorney nicholas m spina was quoted as 
saying in todays editions of the chicago tribune 
george borovilos coowner of the restaurant said he waited 
several days to call the fbi about the equipment because we didnt 
know who it belonged to 
borovilos said that after he talked to the fbi tuesday agents 
removed the camera from the restaurant they left behind the 
connecting wire that ran under a seat cushion through a concrete 
wall and down into the basement of the building he told the tribune 
spina said the sophisticated wideangle camera with a lens the 
size of a little finger was found friday hidden in the base of a 
booth at counselors row restaurant a popular spot for lawmakers 
lawyers government workers and other city hall employees 
he said the camera was pointed at a table often used by alderman 
fred roti democratic ward committeeman john darco and influential 
businessman pat marcy 
the paper quoted unidentified sources as saying the fbi also 
tapped a telephone on a pedestal next to the table

an aide to finance minister shimon peres said 
today that israel was conducting clear official and unequivocal 
negotiations with the plo via intermediaries from the united states 
and other countries 
whoever doesnt admit or recognize this whoever tries to 
ignore it is like a small boy who closes his eyes and thinks the 
world doesnt see him said the aide deputy finance minister 
yossi beilin 
he spoke on army radio after testimony by us assistant 
secretary of state john h kelly raised a storm in israel which has 
officially boycotted the plo calling it a terrorist group bent on 
israels destruction 
kelly replying to a question during a congressional hearing in 
washington on wednesday said it would be an exaggeration to say 
an official dialogue is taking place between israel and the 
palestine liberation organization 
but he said there was classified reporting about contacts 
between the two that he would discuss only in a closeddoor session 
prime minister yitzhak shamir and peres chairman of the 
leftleaning labor party that is a partner in the governing 
coalition deny any israeli talks have taken place with the plo 
its an absolute lie we are not speaking either directly or 
indirectly with that group shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said 
reiterating the premiers remarks in a telephone interview today 
but beilin claimed the denials were only technical 
for 2 months clear official unequivocal negotiations have 
been under way between the israeli government headed by yitzhak 
shamir via the americans beilin said 
other foreign diplomats including egypts minister of foreign 
affairs butros ghali were also involved in these contacts he 
added 
beilin said the entire process was indirect and that israel in 
keeping with its policies had not sent any official messages to plo 
leaders 
we speak to the americans raise proposals the americans go to 
the plo in tunis beilin said they come back to us if they 
tell us they talked to the plo we shut the door if they say they 
spoke to palestinians we open it and listen to what they have to 
say 
beilin also urged the government to recognize and take 
advantage of it the contacts before it will be too late 
he said the government should deal with plo chief yasser arafat 
or would have to face more radical palestinian leaders 
israel has held indirect contacts with the plo in the past most 
notably in 1981 when former us middle east envoy philip c habib 
and un official william callahan helped negotiate a ceasefire 
agreement between the two along the lebanese border 
the pact fell apart a year later when israel invaded lebanon to 
rout guerrilla strongholds in response to attacks on israelis in 
europe by palestinian extremists 
the labor party meanwhile toned down its threats to leave the 
governing coalition after appeals from the bush administration to 
give shamirs peace plan another chance 
labor charges that the plan has been damaged by new hardline 
conditions imposed by shamirs rightwing likud bloc july 5 that 
decrease chances for palestinian acceptance 
but after labor ministers met wednesday night peres said we 
have no aspiration to break up the government the labor party aims 
to work for the advancement of the peace plan 
the easing of labors threat appeared aimed at giving shamir time 
to renew his commitment to the peace initiative 
the plan calls for palestinians in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip to elect representatives for negotiations on limited 
selfrule 
likuds new conditions demand that the 19month palestinian 
uprising end before a vote occurs and specify that the arabs in 
israeliannexed east jerusalem cannot cast ballots a key 
palestinian demand 
meanwhile israeli troops shot and killed a palestinian in the 
gaza strip when a gang of masked youths attacked a patrol with 
knives and axes the army said today 
the victim was identified as riad hashem ali elshakra 18 arab 
reports said he was shot in the chest at the khan yunis refugee 
camp and the army said he died after he was evacuated to soroka 
hospital in southern israel 
the death raised to at least 560 the number of palestinians 
killed since arabs launched their uprising in the west bank and gaza 
against israels 22year occupation thirtyfive israelis also have 
been slain 
five other palestinians were shot and wounded today as protests 
broke out during the moslem holiday of eid aladha or feast of 
sacrifice the climax of the annual pilgrimage to islams holiest 
shrine in mecca saudi arabia 
four of the wounded were in the jabaliya refugee camp in gaza

homicide detectives believe a 22yearold woman 
is the latest victim in a series of 41 killings dating back to 1985 
sheriffs deputies found nicolette jean fryes body monday in a 
ravine in east san diego county the investigation of her death has 
been taken over by a task force looking into the deaths of the other 
women in similar circumstances 
frye had been dead three or four days when her body was found 
lying at the bottom of a steep embankment near la mesa which is 
north of san diego 
her body was fully clothed unlike most of the other victims who 
were left naked or partially clad 
court records show that frye had a history of prostitution and 
drug use as did most of the other victims 
an autopsy on fryes body was inconclusive the cause of death 
will not be known until further tests have been conducted 
metropolitan homicide task force spokesman jim cooke said there 
are no suspects 
fryes boyfriend fernando astorga and others said she was 
trying to put her life back together 
but astorga said fryes problems with drugs were not over and 
that she probably was working as a prostitute on the streets shortly 
before she died 
many of the deaths are similar to an unsolved string of 48 
killings in the seattle area from 1982 through 1984

a man who was accused of spreading rumors after he 
spoke to an american television crew about the military assault on 
tiananmen square was sentenced to 10 years in prison today 
the television news said xiao bin 42 also was deprived of all 
political rights for three years in a decision by a court in dalian 
northeast china 
xiao vice section chief in a rubber factory was charged with 
spreading counterrevolutionary rumors after telling an abc 
television crew that 20000 people were killed when the army fired 
on prodemocracy protesters and their supporters june 34 
during the interview with abc xiao said tiananmen square was 
covered with blood and that tanks had run over people 
china denied anyone was killed in tiananmen square it says about 
200 civilians died when soldiers were forced to fire on rioters who 
blocked their way as they entered tiananmen square chinese sources 
and western diplomats have put the figure as high as 3000 and say 
troops fired randomly into crowds 
china central television apparently intercepted the unedited 
video as abc sent it by satellite to its new york headquarters 
chinas staterun television broadcast the interview and urged 
viewers to help find the man two women reported him within hours 
and he was arrested june 11 
abc said it was deeply distressed over the use of its tape

beijing lower tour prices and mount a public relations campaign 
abroad if it wants to bring back tourists scared by the crackdown 
during a daylong meeting many agents said china should invest in 
overseas tour promotions something it does not normally do 
they want people to come in they have to go outside said 
peter spreadborough of silk route travel in melbourne australia 
our problem is destination credibility we know its safe but 
until there is some sizeable effort from big guns in chinese 
tourism were fighting an uphill battle 
ken chang of pacific delight tours in hong kong said his company 
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material for 
nowcanceled china tours

when 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province of jiangxi today 
local officials gave them a ceremony and welcomed them as the first 
foreign visitors in two months the official xinhua news agency said 
earlier today the foreign ministry denied china has suffered a 
diplomatic loss of face and said most nations support its tough 
measures to eliminate political dissent 
the fact is that there are only a few countries who are 
interfering in chinas internal affairs ministry spokeswoman li 
jinhua said at a weekly briefing the majority of countries have 
expressed their understanding sympathy and even support for us 
most western governments have suspended highlevel official 
contacts and taken other measures to protest the violence and mass 
arrests of protesters some socialist and nonaligned countries 
such as hungary and yugoslavia have joined in criticizing china 
li criticized france for sheltering two fugitives student 
activist wuer kaixi and political theorist yan jiaqi who are 
wanted by chinese police for instigating and organizing protests 
the fact that france allowed them to go to france and to openly 
carry out activities there aimed at subverting the government of the 
peoples republic of china is a flagrant violation of international 
law and the norms governing international relations and it is also 
a gross interference in chinas internal affairs and a serious 
violation of chinas sovereignty she said

a suspended roman catholic priest is rejecting 
a call by the churchs us black bishops that he abandon his 
unsanctioned africanamerican catholic congregation 
the people have spoken the rev george a stallings jr 
said wednesday citing the number of people who attended the first 
two weeks of services at his imani temple 
stallings told the washington post the bishops statement was 
predictable and said they opted for office and position over 
their ability to exercise a prophetic voice in the leadership of 
the 53millionmember american churchs nearly 2 million black 
members 
the priest said he has no intention of abandoning his church 
adding instead that he plans to expand it he has contended that the 
catholic church fails to address the needs of its black parishioners 
the bishops in a statement said stallings possesses the 
vibrancy of our culture and spiritual heritage but should make 
those changes within the church 
we implore him to return to the unity of the church the 
bishops said and to continue to urge reform within the unity 
of the one catholic church 
cardinal james a hickey archbishop of washington said in a 
column published in the post today that the controversy over 
stallings church is not a dispute between those who oppose racism 
and those who support it 
the dispute has more to do with the problems and expectations 
of one individual than broader questions about the adequacy of the 
churchs ministry in the black community hickey said to father 
stallings i say come home 
in a statement distributed by the national conference of catholic 
bishops the 13 bishops said racism exists in the church but that 
the problem must be solved by dialogue between the black community 
and the church leaders 
baltimores auxiliary bishop john ricard said in an interview 
it is the absolute intent of the black bishops to seek some type 
of reconciliation with father stallings in no way do we want to cut 
off dialogue 
the bishops said they had a dual love and devotion to the 
faith of the church and to their black cultural heritage but unlike 
stallings they did not feel the two were in conflict 
stallings suspension means he may not celebrate mass or 
administer any roman catholic sacraments 
an estimated 1000 people have signed up for the imani temple 
and stallings has received more than 39000 in church offerings in 
just two weeks 
stallings has said he wants to see establishment of an 
africanamerican rite within the catholic church earlier this week 
he said he would present a reconciliation plan to the archdiocese of 
washington but only on his terms 
signing the statement were ricard and archbishop eugene marino of 
atlanta bishop joseph howze of biloxi miss and auxiliary bishops 
harold perry of new orleans joseph francis of newark james lyke of 
cleveland emerson moore of new york moses anderson of detroit

somewhere in this central european 
capital there is a tiny elderly woman who will forever treasure 
president bushs visit 
she bears his raincoat as a souvenir given to her by the 
president after he spoke tuesday in a driving rainstorm in kossuth 
square the raincoat it turned out belonged to a secret service 
agent accompanying bush 
but among the vast populace of hungary and poland there was 
little evidence that the people have fallen victim to georgiemania 
to rival the emotion soviet president mikhail s gorbachev stirred 
in his own recent travels to western europe 
still bush was a hit especially in gdansk the baltic seaport 
city that gave birth to the polish trade union movement solidarity 
roughly 25000 people swarmed around the monument to slain workers 
to cheer bush with chants of bush bush bush bush they sang 
the solidarity anthem and flashed the solidarity v for victory 
salute beneath the 80foothigh monument at the shipyard gates 
shouts of stay with us stay with us rang out after bush 
said that if he were a young man he would want to stay to 
participate in polands transformation to a freemarket economy but 
the prediction of steve studdert a white house advance man that 
tens of thousands would turn out for bush in warsaw did not 
materialize 
nor was there an immense turnout in hungary even though bush was 
the first american president to visit the country and he brought 
promises of us aid to budapest as he had to warsaw 
gorbachev by contrast made a tremendous political impact on 
both west germany and france though the turnout in paris at least 
was widely considered to be a disappointment 
the reason may be the soviet leader represented a historic change 
in moscows approach to the eastwest problem 
bush on the other hand also promoted a relaxation of tensions 
but he is a relatively colorless american leader who does not 
approach gorbachevs charisma 
besides for policy reasons bush forswore any intended rivalry 
with gorbachev 
were not trying to make things more difficult for him the 
president said before setting out for europe just as when he goes 
to france and germany i dont think hes trying to make things more 
difficult for the united states 
gorbachev was welcomed last month in bonn by large crowds 
shouting gorby gorby everywhere he went he constantly outranks 
all western leaders in popularity polls in west germany 
during a ceremony at the official residence of west german 
president richard von weizsaecker the soviet leader kissed a high 
school girl the next day the masscirculation bild newspaper ran 
the picture on the front page with a banner headline a kiss for 
annette a kiss for germany 
in paris though gorbachevs public appearance stirred less of a 
public response 
french crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than german 
ones said dominique moisi of the french institute of 
international relations 
but gorbachevs political impact was unquestioned 
french president francois mitterrand in a rare gesture invited 
gorbachev and his wife to dinner at their apartment in the latin 
quarter 
this may have been the first time a soviet leader was invited to 
dine at the home of a western leader and it signaled how important 
gorbachevs visit was taken by the french and yet gorbachev was 
supposed to work the crowd at the place de la bastille but shook 
only a few hands and did not stay long 
on the other hand in kossuth square about 2000 drenched 
hungarians withstood a driving rain to see bush on tuesday 
the president appeared to be touched by their tribute he tore up 
his speech and said he wanted to just speak from the heart 
secretary of state james a baker iii clearly not an impartial 
observer was asked to compare bushs travels with gorbachevs at a 
news conference wednesday 
he said he thought the presidents crowds were pretty good 
pretty terrific as a matter of fact in poland and particularly in 
gdansk 
but baker urged reporters to keep in mind the presidents 
objective active engagement with poland and hungary as they pursue 
fundamental reform efforts 
and thats why were here baker said not out of any idea 
that we need to compete with general secretary gorbachev

an energy department advisory panel says it 
found no convincing evidence that the phenomena attributed to cold 
fusion in university of utah experiments would produce useful 
sources of energy 
the panel recommended wednesday that no new government effort be 
made to verify the experiments that startled the international 
scientific community last march 
evidence for the discovery of a new nuclear process termed cold 
fusion is not persuasive the panels draft report said hence 
no special programs to establish cold fusion research centers or to 
support new efforts to find cold fusion are justified at the present 
time 
the report by 22 nongovernment scientists will go to the energy 
research advisory board which is due to make an official 
recommendation to energy secretary james d watkins by july 31 
the advisory panel said in its report based on eight weeks of 
study that while no new efforts to find cold fusion were justified 
there remain scientifically interesting questions about the utah 
experiments that should be handled by carefully focused and 
cooperative efforts within current programs 
cold fusion is the claim of university of utah scientists that 
the decomposition of water at room temperature into hydrogen and 
oxygen by an electric current passing through a palladium electrode 
leads to the absorption of hydrogen atoms in the electrode which 
then fuse to produce helium and large amounts of heat 
if such a process could work on a large scale it would make 
possible limitless supplies of cheap energy some laboratories have 
duplicated parts of the utah experiment but most that have tried 
have been unable to do so

the city council voted to ban roofs made of 
wood shingles to protect buildings from fire despite objections 
from industry officials who said the shingles are safe 
the proposal approved 111 wednesday would apply to new 
buildings and to roofs requiring repairs to 10 percent or more of 
their surfaces the measure goes to mayor tom bradley who has taken 
no position 
if the proposed ordinance is signed into law and survives a 
possible legal challenge los angeles would become the first major 
american city to ban wood shake shingles 
the measure was strongly opposed by the cedarshingle industry 
which counts on the los angeles area for threequarters of its 50 
million in annual sales of shingles treated with fireretardant 
chemicals 
at stake are hundreds of jobs and millions of investment dollars 
in the pacific northwest and canada where most of the lumber for 
the shingles is harvested and processed 
the industry contends that the treated shingles are as safe as 
those made of asphalt or fiberglas 
but city fire officials said the treated shingles lose their 
effectiveness with time there is not one shred of doubt in my 
mind city fire marshall craig drummond told the council 
if bradley approves the ban the industry will take the matter to 
court said michael m westfall president of the cedar shake and 
shingle bureau

an armenian motorist was shot to death in a 
disputed enclave of azerbaijan and a government official said he 
was probably a victim of the ethnic unrest that has plagued the 
region since early last year 
an interior ministry spokesman alexander timokhin said the 
armenians body was found wednesday on the road to stepanakert the 
main city in the enclave nagornokarabakh the body of artur 
toniyan was left by his car near two villages populated by 
azerbaijanis timokhin said in a telephone interview 
the official said the attack was probably ethnically motivated 
tensions between armenians who are in a majority in 
nagornokarabakh and azerbaijanis have run high since february 1988 
because of a territorial dispute over the tiny fertile region 1200 
miles south of moscow 
armenians who are predominantly christian claim they are 
persecuted by azerbaijanis who are mostly moslem and want 
nagornokarabakh to be placed under the control of the nearby 
republic of armenia 
two azerbaijanis were killed and a third was seriously wounded on 
tuesday near the village of kirkidzhan reports conflicted about the 
circumstances with some saying the men were ambushed by armenians 
and others claiming they died in a car accident or killed each other 
in a dispute 
a 1 am5 am curfew remained in force in nagornokarabakh a 
twomonthold strike was keeping most businesses closed and armored 
personnel carriers patrolled the streets of stepanakert

nasas chief said today a new government ethics 
law that has cost his agency several top managers has created a 
very disturbing situation 
there are people who have left who could have given us three or 
four more years of service and thats a crying shame richard h 
truly told a news conference 
he spoke a day after richard o aller head of nasas office of 
space operations resigned it was the ninth highlevel agency 
resignation this year and aller was the third to say publicly he is 
leaving because of the ethics law 
truly said the law which becomes effective sunday has created 
a very disturbing situation 
we know of a few others who are making their final decisions 
today and tomorrow literally he said 
its not so much the number but the quality and experience of 
these people he said when 10 senior service executive people 
leave you they take with them 250 to 300 years of government 
leadership and experience when they walk out the door 
the resignations and retirements have added to the management 
woes of truly who was sworn in just two weeks ago as administrator 
of the national aeronautics and space administration 
frankly its so vague and undefined that im not aware of 
anybody in government or on capitol hill or in industry that really 
understands its implications aller said of the ethics law after 
his resignation was announced wednesday 
for one that had planned at some point in time to go into 
private industry the law almost insists that you resign before 
the 16th of july he said 
the ethics law aimed at curtailing the revolving door 
personnel relationship between some federal agencies and private 
industry takes effect sunday after having been postponed once 
the rules will bar federal contractors from hiring government 
officials who have supervised their competitors projects 
truly said that despite the losses nasa still will be able to 
manage its programs but its not a good situation and one we need 
to deal with 
another who is quitting saturday is william ballhaus director of 
nasas ames research center in california nasa said ballhaus was 
unhappy with inadequate compensation for senior federal executives 
and vague new postgovernment employment regulations 
my family situation is such that public service in the current 
environment is no longer a viable option for me said ballhaus 
who had been with the agency for 18 years 
aller joined nasa in 1964 and was deeply involved in the apollo 
program which culminated in mans first landing on the moon nasa 
celebrations of that anniversary next week are expected to include a 
call by president bush for a revitalized space program perhaps 
including a goal of landing on mars or colonizing the moon 
nasas announcement said aller accelerated his departure 
because of the vague new postgovernment employee regulations and 
because of many disappointments in the treatment of government 
employees 
among those disappointments aller told a reporter are the pay 
caps that have been imposed for several years on members of the 
senior executive service of which aller is a member president bush 
last week proposed a substantial pay increase for the ses 
john logsdon a space analyst at george washington university in 
washington characterized the law recently as a sledgehammer 
instead of the scalpel it was supposed to be 
nasas no 3 official dr noel hinners resigned effective may 14 
a day before the new law had been expected to go into effect 
citing uncertainty in interpretation of new postemployment laws 
john thomas who was in charge of the effort to redesign the 
space shuttles solid rocket boosters at the marshall space flight 
center resigned and went to work as an executive in the lockheed 
space operations company at the kennedy space center 
the other resignations included e ray tanner deputy director of 
space station operations in june after only five months on the 
job james odom associate administrator for space station in april 
after a year in the post and thomas l moser acting associate 
administrator for space stations for less than a month when he left

eugene shelton iv another former ptl aide and friend of the 
taggarts said he asked david taggart about his money while the two 
were on a trip to florida in 1985 
i believe i was blunt i came out and asked shelton said 
he told me he had received a trust fund from family i believe 
from his parents it was 6 million 3 million each 
last week testimony from the taggarts father henry taggart 
established that the claims of family wealth recalled by their ptl 
coworkers were false 
two women who described themselves as longtime friends of the 
taggarts described being taken on expensive trips to california 
florida and london 
lucinda mclellan and darlene peterson said the trips included 
3000 hotel bills dinners costing 600 each and shopping sprees 
that cost several thousand dollars

for themselves 
television evangelist rex humbard a former ptl board member 
testified that he keeps tight spending controls at his ministry in 
boca raton fla 
nobody in our organization is authorized to spend more than 
10000 outside the budget without authorization from the board of 
directors 
if convicted on the tax evasion charges the taggarts each could 
be sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about 1 
million

the island of teishijima the central meteorological agency reported 
the island is just off the coast of ito city on the izu 
peninsula 60 miles southwest of tokyo the extent of the volcanic 
activity several hundred yards beneath the oceans surface was not 
immediately known the agency said 
there were no immediate reports of injuries and a tsunami or 
seismic wave caused by earthquakes or volcanic activity was not 
expected the agency said however it issued a navigation warning 
to ships operating in the area 
many people in ito a seaside spa known for its many hot springs 
were seen leaving their homes but no evacuation order was issued 
the japan broadcasting corp said hundreds of people called local 
officials asking about the volcano

the soviet union today welcomed a us effort to 
speed up negotiations to reduce conventional forces in europe and 
said a deal might be possible within six months 
we have no intention of delaying this important matter of 
reducing the level of military confrontation said the foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov but he said it might be hard 
to meet a bush administration proposal to make the cuts by 1992 
president bush proposed at a nato summit may 29 that the united 
states and soviet union reduce their troop levels to 275000 each in 
central europe 
according to nato that would mean a reduction of 30000 us 
troops from europe and a cut by the soviet union of more than 10 
times that or 325000 troops 
gerasimov said that in general the nato ideas are viewed by us 
as serious and constructive proposals meeting our own proposals 
halfway 
the soviet spokesman noted that president bush also proposed to 
conclude an agreement on conventional forces during the next six to 
12 months and aim to comply with this agreement in 199192 
the vienna talks given a constructive approach can arrive at 
specific agreements by next year we will do everything to reach 
those agreements within six months 
of course to reduce substantial numbers of personnel and 
material by 1992 is not an easy matter we may suppose that the 
schedule proposed is an unusual one for nato countries and has been 
created mostly by political considerations he said 
gerasimov did not comment on a proposal by secretary of state 
james a baker iii to limit each side to a ceiling of 5700 combat 
aircraft of which 1900 would be helicopters 
the official tass news agency however said the nato proposal 
contained some disturbing points especially the inclusion of 
combat aircraft able to carry out both offensive and defensive 
missions 
it is precisely strike aircraft of frontline tactical 
aviation that constitute an important component of surprise attack 
capability nato has a considerable advantage in this area tass 
commentator vladimir chernyshev said 
gerasimov also noted that soviet and us warships would pay 
reciprocal visits this summer in a program of expanding military 
cooperation 
from july 2125 the cruiser usinov will be among the soviet 
warships visiting visit norfolk va home of the us atlantic 
fleet 
from aug 46 us navy ships will return the visit by stopping 
at sevastapol on the black sea 
the visits will be the first of their kind in 14 years said 
gerasimov

paula r cooper convicted of a murder 
committed when she was 15 cannot be executed the indiana supreme 
court ruled today 
the court unanimously upheld coopers conviction in the 1985 
stabbing death of an elderly bible teacher but said she should be 
sentenced to 60 years in prison 
coopers case has drawn international attention and in 1987 pope 
john paul ii appealed for mercy on her behalf 
the court based its decision on a 1987 change in indiana law 
raising the minimum age for a death penalty defendant from 10 to 16 
and on a 1988 us supreme court decision barring executions of 
juveniles under 16 at the time of the crime 
but the court said although the law was compelling this is a 
difficult conclusion to reach because of the gruesome nature of 
coopers acts 
we won im elated relieved said coopers attorney william 
touchette im very happy for paula im just so relieved that 
this is over it was not an easy case 
cooper pleaded guilty to the stabbing death of ruth e pelke 78 
a retired bible teacher in gary according to court records pelke 
was stabbed 33 times after cooper and three friends broke into her 
home to get money and jewelry 
the three other young women received prison terms ranging from 25 
to 60 years for their roles in the crime 
cooper now 18 is an inmate at the indiana womens prison in 
indianapolis 
roman catholics and some european leftist groups have adopted 
cooper as the figurehead of their campaign against capital 
punishment amnesty international and the american civil liberties 
union have also pleaded on her behalf 
in march an italian group presented a petition with 1 million 
signatures to united nations officials urging clemency for cooper 
and in 1987 the pope wrote to thengov robert d orr to ask for 
mercy for the young woman 
orr and current gov evan bayh have said they didnt want to 
intervene in the cooper case until the appeal was resolved 
in todays opinion the supreme court concluded that executing 
cooper would be unfair because she would be the only person under 16 
ever executed in the state 
the general assembly after much debate in 1987 changed the 
minimum age for a death penalty defendant but made it clear that 
cooper wasnt to be affected by the change but the court said 
exempting cooper from the change is inappropriate 
now that indiana law establishes 16 as the minimum age for the 
imposition of the death penalty paula cooper would be both the 
first and last person ever to be executed in indiana for a crime 
committed at the age of 15 chief justice randall t shepard wrote 
for the court 
this makes her sentence unique and disproportionate to any 
other sentence for the same crime shepard wrote 
the state court also said that last years divided us supreme 
court ruling on an oklahoma case signals that four justices believe 
it is cruel and unusual punishment to execute a juvenile convicted 
of a murder committed before the age of 16 and one justice believes 
it is unconstitutional to executive a juvenile unless the death 
penalty itself identifies a minimum age for the death penalty 
while sparing cooper from the electric chair the supreme court 
said the circumstances surrounding her crime clearly support the 
next most severe penalty under the statute namely the maximum 
sentence of imprisonment 
cooper will be eligible to apply for parole after serving half of 
the 60year sentence

hunting issued a statement urging tougher laws on the possession of 
hunting weapons that would take them away from people under 
medical treatment and away from hunters out of season

president bush today dismissed 
reports that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is unable to meet 
a nato target date for the soviet union to reduce its conventional 
military forces 
the idea that some soviet spokesman yesterday said they cant 
meet these timetables i dont want to believe that thats mr 
gorbachev speaking the president said in an impromptu news 
conference as air force one flew to paris from a twonight stop in 
budapest hungary the second leg of a 10day trip 
lt gen viktor starodubov chief of the disarmament branch of 
the communist partys policymaking central committee said tuesday 
that moscow would not be able to meet the timetable 
the soviet official said that although gorbachev like the 
western nations is seeking an early agreement there are 
realities which cannot be suppressed 
experience shows that even when the principal elements are 
resolved we need a considerably longer period for solving the 
details of the document starodubov said 
in moscow today soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov provided a more tempered response saying his country 
welcomed a us effort to speed up negotiations to reduce 
conventional forces and indicated that a deal might be possible 
within six months 
we have no intention of delaying this important matter of 
reducing the level of military confrontation said gerasimov who 
was questioned about the nato proposal submitted today 
but the soviet official said reductions in substantial numbers 
of personnel and material by 1992 is not an easy matter we may 
suppose that the chedule proposed is an unusual one for nato 
countries and has been created mostly be political considerations 
gerasimov did not comment on starodubovs remarks tuesday 
the nato proposal calls for military cutbacks that would fix the 
same ceiling of 275000 troops in europe for each superpower 
according to nato statistics that would require the united states 
to remove 30000 troops from europe while the soviets would have to 
pull out more than 10 times that or 325000 
the proposal which also includes deep cuts in armaments called 
for reaching agreement in six months to a year and for reductions 
to be carried out by 1992 or 1993 
the nato members seeking an early agreement at talks in vienna 
on conventional disarmament submitted a proposal today that 
specifies the types of combat aircraft it wants covered by an arms 
accord 
bush told reporters that he is convinced that gorbachev knows 
that were serious indeed we have an opportunity now to encourage 
him to move along faster on conventional force reduction 
the president also said his journey to poland and hungary had 
been watched by the people of other eastern european countries and 
hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go the path of 
reform political change economic change 
on the middle east bush said the united states will not overhaul 
its policy on the middle east in response to political turmoil in 
israel a nation he said is having great difficulties 
bush emphasized that israel should go forward with elections 
among palestinians in the occupied territories as a step toward 
peace 
amid charges that the united states is meddling in israeli 
politics bush said the us policy is set i am the president of 
the united states israel is a friend and will remain a friend but 
i have to say what our policy is 
i dont think there is great heartburn here but i just want to 
continue to articulate what we believe he said 
the decision by prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc to 
harden its stand on peace negotiations has strained usisraeli 
relations in washington assistant secretary of state john h kelly 
said hardliners are damaging prospects for palestinian elections in 
the occupied lands 
if anybody can make a case to me that the recent deliberations 
in that likud party will enhance the election process then i 
would say great but i am afraid that other people are looking at

the chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
today urged a house panel to pass quickly his bill to outlaw flag 
burning but other lawmakers said nothing short of a constitutional 
amendment would suffice 
sen joseph biden ddel said regular legislation was the best 
way swiftly and simply to overcome the supreme court ruling last 
month that protected flag burning as a form of free speech 
no matter how we cut it a constitutional amendment is going to 
take some time and leave a gap in the law during which flag 
burning would remain legal biden said a bill could take effect 
almost immediately and if it still didnt meet constitutional 
muster then an amendment could be pursued he said 
lets heal the wound pass the legislation and move on urged 
biden 
bidens testimony came as the house subcommittee on 
constitutional law opened a series of hearings on what to do about 
the supreme court ruling 
house minority leader bob michel rill testified in favor of 
the constitutional amendment supported by president bush 
we believe there is no quick legislative fix on this issue 
said michel who was joined by rep sonny montgomery dmiss 
chairman of the house veterans affairs committee 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he opposed a constitutional 
amendment on flag burning although he conceded most people 
disagreed with him 
it is that very freedom the right to protest even when it is 
offensive that makes us different from the rest of the world he 
said comparing the united states with the current repression 
against protesters in china 
legislative efforts short of an amendment might be impossible he 
said 
im not certain it is possible to draft a constitutionally 
solid statute he said 
subcommittee chairman don edwards dcalif urged his colleagues 
to be cautious 
the flag is sturdy flying proudly through every fierce battle 
of every war and through times of social upheaval he said the 
constitution however is fragile and can be amended by the votes of 
legislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment 
rep jim sensenbrenner of wisconsin the ranking republican on 
the subcommittee said he believed the constitutional amendment 
should be quickly passed and sent to the states for ratification 
because of the uncertainty that a statute would hold 
if we want to heal the wounds of the supreme court decision 
we ought to make sure the patient doesnt have a relapse he 
said

the health gap between white and nonwhite 
americans is widening and closing the disparity will be tough 
secretary of health and human services louis sullivan told the naacp 
today 
sullivan the third member of the bush administration to address 
the civil rights groups national convention spoke a day after vice 
president dan quayle house and urban development secretary jack 
kemp spoke on monday 
there is a large and growing disparity in the health of our 
minority population and the white population sullivan said 
he said the average life expectancy was up to 748 years in 1986 
but the shocking news is that for the second year in a row 
the life expectancy for black americans declined falling to 694 
years having been 695 in 1985 and 697 years in 1984 he said 
those figures and the infantmortality rate that is twice that 
of whites are a national tragedy said sullivan who is black 
sullivan said the bush administration favored a plan to make 
medicaid more available to infants and pregnant women and increase 
funding for demonstration projects on maternity care 
quayle told delegates that president bush was committed to civil 
rights and black economic progress some listeners werent impressed 
his speech lacked any real substance said keith m jones 
president of the new jersey branch of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people this administration vetoed a 
minimum wage bill and there is nothing kinder and gentler about 
that 
the convention closes tonight with a speech by the rev jesse 
jackson 
in his speech to nearly 3000 delegates wednesday quayle did not 
address one of the hotter convention topics recent us supreme 
court decisions that have been interpreted as setbacks for civil 
rights 
the high court struck down contract guarantees for minority firms 
and made it tougher to prove bias in the workplace while making it 
easier for white males to contest affirmative action 
when pressed on the issue later at a news conference quayle 
said the president does not feel that those decisions need to be 
overturned to advance the cause of civil rights 
he said the president might reconsider if the impact of the 
rulings proves discriminatory 
quayle was asked if the president planned to respond to the 
decisions affecting civil rights with a constitutional amendment 
like the one he proposed to counter a ruling that upheld 
constitutional protection for burning the american flag 
he feels very strongly about civil rights hes talking about 
civil rights hes talking about decency quayle said 
earlier quayle told delegates i am committed and president 
bush is committed to fostering good and better relations with the 
civil rights community 
bush has met with civil rights leaders in the white house and 
held ceremonies honoring the rev martin luther kings legacy and 
observing the 25th anniversary of the civil rights act of 1964 
quayle said 
he cited equal opportunity programs including the job training 
partnership act that he cowrote as a senator and educational 
initiatives including establishment of a 60 million fund during the 
next four years to build endowments of historically black colleges 
and universities 
we are the ones who are going to give a person a job quayle 
said 
on the supreme courts decision giving states more power to 
regulate abortions quayle said he and the president wont take part 
in statelevel debates on the issue 
but he added both of our positions are prolife 
quayle also said the administration stands behind its february 
nomination of former wayne county executive william lucas to head 
the us justice departments civil rights division 
groups including the naacp have opposed the black republican 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks said sunday that lucas lacks 
the necessary legal knowledge 
we know of the opposition of the naacp and we have talked to 
them about that but we stand foursquare behind bill lucas quayle 
told reporters

albuquerque nm journal on president bushs plan for federal 
pay raises 
president bush faces a difficult task in selling congress and the 
american people on his broad and generous pay raise plan for federal 
employees 
its not that some relief isnt probably justified overall 
critical for retention of key specialists in a few areas its just 
that the federal government is low on money most taxpayers are too 
and the economy is slowing down to boot 
public sentiment on public salaries was demonstrated unmistakably 
in the congressional pay raise bloodbath earlier this year bush is 
proposing hikes of from 8 to 25 percent for some 7900 top 
government employees plus 100000plus salaries for a few hundred 
specialists with critical skills administration spokesmen said they 
had had many qualified government service candidates who couldnt 
afford the pay cut to accept government service 
congress and the voters should educate themselves on this 
situation before rejecting bushs proposal out of hand

the clarionledger jackson miss on bushs pay plan 
president bushs proposal last week to give 7900 federal 
executives pay raises of 8 to 25 percent is both prudent and timely 
congressional action authorizing the increase is merited 
equally worthy of approval is the presidents additional proposal 
to ban congressional honoraria though he would delay it for 18 
months honoraria should go immediately 
the raise for senior government officials should have been 
proposed first and separately from the proposed 51 percent 
congressional pay raise that sank after an angry public outcry early 
this year 
the pay of these officials has eroded significantly in comparison 
to comparable jobs in the private sector and as a result the 
administration says about 40 potential executives turned down 
government appointments

seattle postintelligencer on arms reduction 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev continues to make dramatic 
proposals and declarations that are ratcheting down the historic 
tensions between the soviet union and the united states and its west 
european allies 
in france last week at a meeting of the council of europe 
gorbachev once again commanded world headlines by in effect 
nullifying what has come to be known as the brezhnev doctrine that 
was a seemingly bedrock philosophy that the soviet union was 
justified in using force to keep communistbloc nations of eastern 
europe within the fold 
gorbachevs talk in france also sought to spur negotiations on 
reductions of tactical nuclear weapons which have represented the 
cornerstone of us and nato deterrence to warsaw pact forces in 
europe 
bush is right to insist on a ussoviet agreement on 
conventional force reductions prior to talks on tactical weapons 
which also is the adopted policy of nato 
as welcome as gorbachevs tensionreducing overtures are the 
west must not be stampeded into risky arms agreements it might come 
to regret

the bulletin bend ore on racial quotas 
some minorities especially asianamericans are discovering that 
ethnic and racial quotas can cut both ways and that neither way is 
very good for american society 
the latest quota controversy stems from reports that many of the 
nations finest colleges and universities are explicitly limiting 
admissions of asianamericans at the university of california at 
berkeley for example officials admitted that their policies in 
effect imposed a quota on the number of asianamericans accepted to 
their school 
congress is in an uproar over the reports and 23 members of the 
house have cosponsored a bill that would put congress on record 
against college admission ceilings based on racial or ethnic 
origins the bill shouldnt be necessary the civil rights act of 
1964 prohibits discrimination based on race or ethnicity in any 
institution that receives federal funding 
all quotas erode the ability of employers or college recruiters 
to hire or accept the best most qualified people

the honolulu advertiser on the sentencing of oliver north 
oliver norths nojail sentence is surprisingly light it will do 
little to remind the nation of the serious wrongs of the irancontra 
affair or to deter other gungho government officials from breaking 
the law in the name of following orders 
the mild sentence is also a break for president bush it will 
both reduce rightwing pressure for a north pardon and further 
eclipse bids to find out what role bush really had in the 
irancontra dealings he can continue stonewalling 
few felt the former national security council aide should have 
gotten the 10year maximum sentence but some time in custody would 
have dramatized the seriousness of this affair

the rapid city sd journal on norths sentence 
oliver north may never understand jingoists lack the ability to 
understand but us district judge gerhard a gesell showed he 
understood when he sentenced north wednesday for his role in the 
irancontra affair 
gesells sentence was just north was a small fry caught in a net 
designed to let larger fish go free putting north in prison would 
not be wise he poses no physical threat to others 
unless he is returned to a position of public trust he is 
unlikely to repeat his offenses and north would not gain 
understanding through imprisonment he may gain understanding by 
working with vulnerable youths trapped in a more important war than 
the one north thought he was waging in nicaragua the war to save 
souls from the scourge of drugs

the bellingham wash herald on norths sentence 
instead of throwing the book at oliver north us district court 
judge gerhard gesell threw a handful of the pages and expressed the 
hope that north and the rest of the country would get the message 
that message is that north deserved punishment for misusing his 
power as a national security council employee during the irancontra 
armsforhostages dealing but that the punishment should fit not 
only the crime but the criminal 
some observers believe north got off with a wristslap and 
should have done time in prison others supporting north believe a 
150000 fine and a ban from holding public office is a high price 
to have to pay for merely following orders 
we probably all lack full understanding of the case even 
though it was widely reported left undocumented for example was 
the extent of president reagans role in the illegal activities but 
one thing gesell seemed to understand fully was that jailing north 
would have achieved little more than making him an unjustified 
martyr 
future irancontra trials will help us understand more about the 
case and norths role in it until then the judge has relegated him 
to minorplayer status which is probably where history will keep 
him

san luis obispo county calif telegramtribune on norths 
sentence 
oliver north has been spared going to jail the fact remains 
there was ample justification for putting him behind bars 
given his heroic war record and his bristling performance as a 
superpatriot before during and after his trial the former marine 
colonel whipped up widespread sentiment against his going to prison 
but it can be persuasively argued it seems to us that the 
penalties imposed by judge gerhard gesell were hardly commensurate 
with the gravity of his crimes fraud lying to congress and 
destruction of government documents 
at the same time and this no doubt was central to the judges 
determinations he held that north was not a leader at all 
in the irancontra scandal but really a lowranking subordinate 
working to carry out initiatives of a few cynical superiors 
gesell obviously was referring to the late cia director william 
casey and john poindexter and robert macfarlane both former 
national security directors 
much of the american public also believes that ronald reagan 
then president was the most culpable superior 
his norths diehard supporters also are clamoring for a pardon 
president bush whose role in irancontra also begs for further 
examination would be well advised to ignore such sentiment lest a 
fresh firestorm of bitter debate sweep the country

kennebec journal augusta maine on president bushs fireworks 
show 
what a bust they came some 40000 people and assembled in 
kennebunkport the purpose of the assembly attracting visitors from 
far and near was to celebrate the most important revolution in 
history and to see a fireworks display which had received advance 
hype as the american equivalent of a royal command performance the 
best in the world because this is for the president 
then when all was in readiness and the expectant throng stood 
waiting for its thrill of thrills it is reported that barbara bush 
sent word to the fireworks maestro to in effect start early and 
make it short so in less than 15 minutes the anxiously awaited 
extravaganza was over to the acute disappointment of many 
onlookers 
its still not clear why the fireworks display was cut short 
considerations of safety to the president were cited though its 
hard to see why no one thought of that beforehand the president and 
mrs bush were reported to have spent part of the next morning 
cleaning up after the display so perhaps housekeeping was the issue 
but since the town of kennebunk canceled its fireworks show in 
favor of the presidents expectations were naturally high next 
year the bushes ought to deliver as promised or withdraw from the 
extravaganza buisness

more than a million moslems today 
descended mount arafat and crossed a scorching plain to the holy 
city of mecca for prayers culminating their annual pilgrimage 
this years pilgrimage or hajj to saudi arabia was conducted 
under the guard of antiterrorist security squads 
the worshipers filed past the road in mecca where two bombs 
exploded monday killing one person and injuring 16 
waves of men in white seamless robes signifiying equality in 
the eyes of allah and women in long dresses and head scarves 
participated in the prayer broadcast live via satellite to scores 
of countries 
about 18 million moslems came from more than 80 countries for 
the hajj which every financially able moslem is expected to make at 
least once 
iran boycotted this years hajj to protest restrictions on the 
number of pilgrims each nation was given a quota of 1000 pilgrims 
per million people 
iran alleged the restrictions were intended to limit the number 
of iranian pilgrims it also accused saudi authorities of 
fabricating mondays bomb incident to discredit iran the saudis 
have not accused iran of planting the bombs 
at twilight the pilgrims offered the eid aladha or feast of 
sacrifice prayers before slaughtering hundreds of thousands of 
sheep cows and camels 
they then streamed down mount arafat to the mina plain and on to 
mecca for the farewell prayer before dispersing arafat mina and 
mecca are all about four miles apart 
some pilgrims walked from mina to mecca but most took advantage 
of airconditioned buses provided by the saudis 
in traditional messages saudi arabias king fahd and his crown 
prince abdullah made no mention of the bombings 
the king said it was a sacred duty for him as custodian of 
islams holiest shrines to complete renovation and modernization 
plans at mecca to provide pilgrims with better conditions for future 
pilgrimages 
saudi arabia cited the construction under way as the main reason 
for curtailing the number of pilgrims limits on pilgrims first were 
imposed in 1988 
the previous year demonstrations by thousands of the 
150000strong iranian hajj contingent led to clashes with saudi 
police at least 402 people died most of them iranians 
scores of iranians were arrested during the 1986 hajj when they 
tried to bring in explosives 
princes and dignitaries from arabia merchants and paupers from 
bangladesh and india cossack and tartars from the soviet union 
mingled with other pilgrims from poland hungary spain senegal and 
indonesia all chanting in union allah akbar kabeera 
walhumdillah katheera arabic for god is so great and to him we 
pay high tribute 
the hajj is performed during the islamic lunar months of shawwal 
zulquideh and zulhijjeh similar rituals performed out of the 
season are called umrah or lesser hajj 
the hajj proper is limited to six days a pilgrim may commence 
the rituals at any time during the three months but the actual 
congregational rites were conducted this year between july 8 and 
july 13 
hajis are required to pray at the grand mosque in mecca and 
circle its kaaba a granite cube draped with goldembroidered black 
brocade moslems honor the kaaba as the house of allah as they 
circle the cube pilgrims often bend to kiss the sacred black stoe 
set in silver on the east corner of the granite structure 
the pilgrims also run back and forth seven times between safa and 
marwa two hills 800 yards apart enclosed within a huge mosque 
they commemorate the agony of hagar abrahams estranged wife who 
ran frantically in the same spot searching for water for her son 
ismail until allah guided her to a spring 
the spring today feeds the sacred well of zamzam in the heart of 
the grand mosque 
when they go to mina each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of 
the three devil pillars a spot where moslems believed the devil 
tried to tempt abraham to disobey allah and refuse to sacrifice his 
son

black nationalist leader nelson 
mandela said from prison that the whiteled government can only end 
the bloodshed in south africa through dialogue with the banned 
african national congress 
i would also like to confirm that my release is not an issue at 
this stage said mandela who heads the anc i only would like 
to contribute to the creation of the climate which would promote 
peace in south africa 
mandela met for 45 minutes on july 5 with president pw botha at 
the presidents cape town residence and the report fueled 
speculation that the man considered the leader of south africas 28 
million blacks may soon be freed 
the statement wednesday from mandela who has been in prison for 
more than 26 years was his first since 1985 that was approved by 
the government for public releace 
dialogue with the mass democratic movement and in particular 
with the african national congress is the only way of ending 
violence and bringing peace to our country he said 
antiapartheid groups which initially dismissed the talks as 
government propaganda later called the meeting a positive 
development 
for example antiapartheid leader frank chikane head of the 
south african council of churches on wednesday said the meeting was 
a calculated attempt by the government to make maximum political 
gain 
but on thursday chikane said i welcome mr mandelas 
commitment to contribute in any way possible to the creation of a 
climate which will promote peace in south africa 
mandela who is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting 
to overthrow the government has over the years occasionally sent 
messages out through his lawyer and other visitors 
the anc is the leading guerrilla group fighting apartheid under 
which south africas black majority has no vote in national affairs 
it is based in lusaka zambia and seeks a south african state based 
on one man one vote 
neither the president nor his heir apparent national party 
leader fw de klerk have commented on the bothamandela meeting 
the government announced the talks in a brief statement saturday 
but nothing has been added since 
botha has said he wants to create conditions to free mandela and 
has dropped his requirement that the founder of the guerrilla 
movements military wing renounce violence instead he has talked 
of political prisoners being willing to work for peace 
there is something oriental in the way mandela has turned 
weakness into power business day the countrys leading financial 
daily said today 
he has achieved much by doing virtually nothing forcing his 
jailers progressively to ease the conditions of his release the 
editorial added it is not too much to say that the government is 
now the prisoner of its prisoner it cannot escape his embrace 
in 1985 botha gave permission for a statement from mandela to be 
read at a rally in soweto the black township outside johannesburg 
where the black leaders family lives 
mandelas daughter zindzi read the statement before a huge 
crowd 
it was mandelas response to bothas offer to release him if he 
would renounce violence mandela refused saying botha should 
renounce violence and racial segregation 
only free men can negotiate mandela said in 1985 
prisoners cannot enter into contracts 
british prime minister margaret thatcher was quoted wednesday as 
saying mandelas release is crucial 
no black south african will accept negotiating with the 
government as long as mandela is in prison but i believe there 
is now a hope of seeing him freed although i have received no 
guarantee she was quoted as saying in an interview with the paris 
newspaper le monde 
the south african press association quoted mrs mandela as 
saying we do not condemn the meeting at all for us to get to 
the negotiation table we have to start somewhere we believe we 
would have to talk to the government at some stage or another

socialist government is accused of arranging for a shipment of 
9000 tons of yugoslav corn to be issued with greek certificates of

reparations

the coalition of the left and progress carried the motion to 
investigate athanasopoulos with 168 votes in the 300member 
parliament 
the panhellenic socialist movement which was swept from office 
amid a series of scandals in june 18 elections abstained from the 
vote 
athanasopoulos who was not reelected submitted a memorandum 
denying involvement in the scandal 
we have to note our international disgrace and the irreparable 
ethical damage done to our country in the eyes of our community 
partners said one legislator 
where did the money go new democracy party leader 
constantine mitsotakis asked parliament about the money from the 
duties that were not paid 
under the law governing the culpability of cabinet ministers a 
special committee of 12 legislators will investigate the charges 
against athanasopoulos and decide whether the former minister should 
stand trial 
the coalition government has pledged to investigate and punish 
those involved in scandals in banking the arms industry and alleged 
phonetapping by the former socialist administration

administrative costs by 10 percent 
the first 250 million hits the bone and will cause real pain 
dukakis said the balance hits raw nerve and will be devastating

today because i have to do it to avoid fiscal chaos i cant let the 
state go down the drain financially and i wont

nato today presented the warsaw pact with 
new proposals on reducing conventional arms and aircraft in europe 
two months ahead of schedule in a bid to accelerate a disarmament 
agreement 
the early presentation provided further evidence of our 
desire to achieve early results michael edes the head of the 
british delegation speaking on behalf of nato told a news 
conference 
presenting the proposal today instead of in september as 
originally planned gives the warsaw pact time to frame a response 
during an eightweek recess in the talks negotiations broke today 
and resume sept 7 
secretary of state james a baker iii outlined details of the 
nato proposal wednesday he said nato was recommending a ceiling of 
5700 combat aircraft and 1900 combat helicopters for each 
alliance the inclusion of an aircraft cutback complied with a 
longstanding east bloc demand 
according to nato data the warsaw pact countries have about 
9600 combat aircraft versus about 6700 nato aircraft 
the western proposal is based on a blueprint for deep reductions 
in conventional arms and troops in europe first unveiled by 
president bush at an alliance summit in may and subsequently 
endorsed by nato members 
bush called for military cutbacks that would fix the same ceiling 
of 275000 troops in europe for each superpower according to nato 
statistics that would require the united states to remove 30000 
troops from europe while the soviets would have to pull out more 
than 10 times that or 325000 
the proposal also foresees deep cuts in armaments with a 
proposed ceiling of 20000 tanks for each side and reductions in 
combat aircraft and artillery 
the decision to make the proposal was reached by a panel of 
senior north atlantic treaty organization officials in brussels on 
friday a us official in budapest said 
it complied with east bloc appeals that the presentation be 
speeded up 
the head of the soviet delegation oleg a grinevsky welcomed 
the nato proposal but said he was sorry it did not go further 
at first glance the proposal tabled by nato today has no new 
elements grinevsky said in a news conference 
rather it is a more detailed elaboration of the positions that 
were stated in brussels and only in respect of aviation and 
helicopters at that grinevsky said 
at a meeting in bucharest romania last weekend leaders of the 
sovietled warsaw pact praised bushs nato proposal and said an 
initial accord on reductions could be reached as early as next year 
however the east bloc summit did not produce any new concrete 
proposals on arms control of its own 
the bush proposal called for reaching agreement in six months to 
a year and for reductions to be carried out by 1992 or 1993 
in a statement issued at the end of the twoday bucharest summit 
the warsaw pact said the situation of the negotiations is such 
that the first understandings may be achieved already in 1990 
last week the head of the polish delegation to the vienna talks 
called on nato to submit the proposal before the recess rather than 
waiting until the third round of talks opens in the fall 
the soviet military bloc has a proposal on the table to reduce 
six kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent below present levels 
by 1994 then add a further 25 percent reduction by 1997 before 
moving to purely defensive forces in the year 2000 
the soviet union has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals from 
eastern europe that are to reduce the number of soviet troops in the 
region by 50000 by 1990

illinois gov james r thompson the 
longestserving incumbent governor in the nation announced today he 
would not seek a fifth term in 1990 
near tears and with his voice wavering at times thompson told 
reporters that his decision was based on family and career reasons 
my wife and daughter said they would support another term but 
i wasnt ready for that thompson said at a news conference my 
family and their happiness and security is the most important thing 
to me at this time 
he added that he would enjoy the challenge of the private 
sector thompson also said he might seek another government office 
thats entirely possible he said i do not intend to 
retire from politics only from this office 
the 53yearold thompson a moderate republican who has served 12 
years was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate early in 
his career and as a vicepresidential candidate last year 
more recently speculation has centered on whether thompson would 
leave state government to accept a federal appointment or a 
partnership in a chicago law firm 
the speculation became increasingly intense over the past few 
months particularly within the republican party both secretary of 
state jim edgar and lt gov george ryan are interested in running 
for governor but both have said they would not challenge thompson 
democratic gubernatorial hopefuls have also awaited thompsons 
move as a guide to their own strategies 
thompson first burst into the national spotlight during his 
fouryear tenure as us attorney in chicago from 197175 when he 
sent several prominent allies of the late mayor richard j daley to 
prison on corruption charges 
passing up an offer to run against daley thompson instead 
claimed the gop gubernatorial nomination in 1976 and defeated a 
daleybacked democrat michael howlett by 139 million votes the 
widest margin in illinois history 
his first term lasted only two years because illinois was in the 
process of switching its gubernatorial elections to nonpresidential 
election years 
he was reelected to a fouryear term by another record margin in 
1978 and then twice turned back challenges by democrat adlai 
stevenson iii in 1982 by the narrowest margin in state history 
and again in 1986 to become the states only fourterm governor 
though titular leader of the state gop and a key backer of bush 
thompson has frequently been at odds with his fellow republicans on 
fiscal and social issues his political reputation is one of a 
pragmatic nonideological bridgebuilder evidenced by his support 
among traditionally democratic groups such as organized labor and 
his warm relations with some conservative chicago democrats 
thompsons most successful year in office may have been 1985 
when he played a key role in passage of landmark school reform 
legislation won approval of a massive infrastructure renewal 
program and landed the much soughtafter diamondstar auto assembly 
plant 
those promising achievements gave way to frustration in his 
fourth term as his efforts to gain approval of a state income tax 
increase were blocked by democratic house speaker michael madigan 
earlier this month he wound up signing a twoyear tax increase 
drafted by madigan and approved with mostly democratic votes over 
the objections of thompsons fellow republicans that set the stage 
for a potentially bruising battle over renewal of the tax in the 
months following the 1990 election

president bush buoyed by his landmark visit to 
eastern europe joined dozens of world leaders today for a 
spectacular parisian party celebrating the 200th anniversary of the 
french revolution 
bush helped kick off the festivities by helping present to france 
the historic key to the bastille fortress birthplace of a rebellion 
against the french crown two centuries ago the key in us hands 
since 1790 is on temporary loan 
on his way to the french capital bush voiced hope that his tour 
of poland and hungary had given encouragement to those who want to 
go the path of reform political change economic change in those 
communist nations 
the gala events preceding a summit meeting of the worlds seven 
largest industrial democracies contrasted sharply with the 
presidents trip to poland and hungary where he promised to help 
both communist nations with major economic reforms 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser said 
bush would encourage the summit partners to formulate their own aid 
programs for poland and hungary he said the idea was to create sort 
of a clearinghouse to avoid duplication of assistance by the 
summit countries the united states britain france west germany 
japan canada and italy 
also scowcroft said the united states would consider giving food 
and other commodities to poland if austerity measures add to the 
hardships of the soviet bloc country 
bush was greeted by french president francois mitterrand at the 
inaugural bicentennial event at the place du trocadero commemorating 
the declaration of the rights of man that statement issued in 
august 1789 set forth the french revolutions aims of liberty 
fraternity and equality for all people 
the world leaders sat on a blue and white grandstand listening to 
a young man and woman who took turns reading the 17 articles of the 
declaration a childrens choir dressed in white sang a song of 
joy played games and threw peace laurels flowers and childrens 
toys on the esplanade 
at the end of the ceremony the leaders burst into applause as a 
flock of doves flew over the palace then chatting amiably they 
left for a lunch given by mitterrand who sat next to bush during 
the ceremony 
security was tight with an estimated 30000 police including 
rooftop marksmen guarding the summit events police also towed away 
about 1000 vehicles as part of their ban on traffic in the main 
thoroughfares 
before leaving budapest for the french capital bush told 
hungarian leaders that as your economy modernizes you will play 
an even greater role in the evolution of a new europe a europe that 
is whole and free 
bush told his hungarian hosts you are proving here in the 
heartland of europe that the rights of man are the proper 
birthright of us all 
in an impromptu news conference on air force one during the 
flight to paris bush said his east european visit has been 
watched by the people of other eastern european countries and 
hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go the path of 
reform political change economic change 
bush also dismissed a moscow spokesmans statement that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev is unable to meet a nato target date 
to reduce conventional military forces and he said the united 
states will not overhaul its middle east peace policy in response to 
political turmoil in israel 
he said that in poland and hungary the thing that is so 
impressive is the determination of all of these leaders to move 
towards economic freedom and political freedom 
bush said he had stressed publicly and privately that reforms 
including austerity measures are essential to building strong 
economies 
there is no point going there under false colors and to try to 
have everything sweetness and light he said its a message 
that it isnt going to be easy but thats part of the message 
the president said no one expressed disappointment over the 
relatively modest aid programs he proposed for poland and hungary 
i think that they understand that we are restricted in what we can 
do in terms of dollars bush said 
in paris mitterrand greeted each leader arriving by limousine at 
the ceremony site near the eiffel tower the crowd in the street 
cheered when philippines president corazon aquino appeared other 
guests included prime minister rajiv gandhi of india president 
robert mugabe of zimbabwe president mobutu sese seko of zaire and 
other african leaders un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar brazilian president jose sarney mexican president carlos 
salinas de gortari and uruguayan president julio maria sanguinetti 
the french festivities features concerts fireworks and parades 
after a 40minute meeting with mitterrand bush took part in 
ceremonies marking the return actually a brief loan of the key 
to the bastille the site where the french revolution began when the 
fortress was stormed in an uprising against the crown on july 14 
1789 
bush planned to present the large iron key to mitterrand for 
display through july 22 at the new bastille opera house adjacent to 
the site of the famous fortress 
the key was given to george washington nearly 200 years ago by 
the marquis de lafayette since 1797 the key has never left 
washingtons estate in northern virginia 
since 1858 the historic artifact has been in the possession of 
the mount vernon ladies association the private nonprofit 
organization that owns and operates washingtons home 
when the bicentennial party reaches its peak friday the champs 
elysee will be the site of a parade featuring britons maching under 
artificial rain russians dancing with a bear on ice and an american 
band strutting backward all the way down the famed avenue 
amid extraordinary political uncertainty in poland and hungary as 
they struggle with democratic reforms bush devoted the first half 
of his 10day european journey to encouraging advocates of change 
aside from strong messages of moral support he left behind 
packages of us aid of 100 million for poland and 25 million for 
hungary to spur development of private enterprise 
your challenge is enormous and historic to build a structure 
of political change and decentralized economic enterprise on the 
ruins of a failed stalinist system bush said in a speech 
wednesday at the karl marx university of economic sciences 
imre pozgay one of hungarys four communist leaders told bush 
the changes in his country were irreversible and added the 
government would accept the results of free elections set for 
next year and step down if defeated 
bush promised he will press for a coordinated plan of further 
assistance for poland and hungary at the annual economic summit with 
leaders of france britain west germany italy canada and japan 
the summit meeting begins friday evening and concludes on sunday 
with the reading of a final communique 
aside from aid for poland and hungary major topics are expected 
to be environmental problems and third world debt

norway will propose a bilateral agreement 
with the soviet union covering warnings on military accidents a 
report said thursday 
norway began drafting the treaty two years ago and made it a high 
priority after a recent soviet navy accidents off northern norway 
according to the newspaper klassekampen 
norway is ready to enter an agreement with the soviets about 
warnings on military incidents acting foreign ministry spokesman 
oeyvind nordsletten told the newspaper he did not say when the pact 
would be presented 
oslo complained of soviet slowness in providing warnings and 
details of accidents aboard two soviet nuclear submarines near 
norwegian territory 
on april 7 a soviet submarine sank in the norwegian sea on june 
26 another soviet sub suffered a reactor breakdown off northern 
norway 
nordsletten said the draft treaty is similar to those the soviets 
recently signed with the united states britain france and west 
germany 
the treaty also would require warning when ships or aircraft from 
the countries approach each other he said there is heavy air and 
sea traffic off northern norway from soviet miltary bases on the 
kola peninsula just across the norwegiansoviet border 
one example of an incident that might have been covered was 
when a norwegian orion surveillance plane was damaged by a soviet 
fighter that flew too close over the barents sea in 1987 he said 
last fall the two nations agreed to inform each other of 
civilian nuclear accidents such as the chernobyl nuclear power 
plant disaster in 1986

the annual economic summit meeting that begins 
friday will be dominated by environmental pollution and eastwest 
relations because this year theres little bad economic news for 
the seven participants to discuss 
president bush and the leaders of the six other large 
industrialized western democracies will meet through sunday along 
the way they will take time for lavish dinners fireworks displays 
and festive parades organized by french president francois 
mitterrand to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the french 
revolution 
almost as gleaming as the french celebrations has been the 
performance of the worlds economy 
in contrast to the gloomanddoom forecasts following the october 
1987 stock market crash growth in 1988 and through the first half 
of this year has been stellar 
virtually all the summit nations enjoyed an acceleration of 
economic activity last year with total growth for the seven nations 
averaging 42 percent the best showing in four years 
such a performance clears the way for other topics to take center 
stage 
bush attending his first economic summit hopes to use the 
meetings to assume the mantle of leader of the western alliance on 
economic and environmental issues much as he did on military 
matters in may with his troop reduction proposals at the nato summit 
in brussels belgium 
bush has said the environment is coming on like a freight 
train as an international issue and leaders of the other summit 
nations britain france west germany japan italy and canada 
are facing growing political pressure to do something as well 
the president arrived in paris after unveiling relatively modest 
aid proposals for hungary and poland during his historymaking trip 
to the economically troubled nations he looked to his summit 
partners for similar commitments to boost economic and democratic 
reforms in eastern europe 
im going to tell them that there is dynamic change taking 
place in eastern europe bush told reporters during the flight to 
paris from budapest hungary 
the recent turmoil in china will also be a primary topic when the 
seven leaders hold their discussions at a modernistic arch on the 
outskirts of paris but the talks are unlikely to produce any calls 
for new sanctions in retaliation for the crackdown on dissent in 
china most of the western leaders fear that any further isolation 
of the beijing government might derail economic reforms the country 
is undertaking 
not that there arent economic concerns as well 
trade imbalances have begun to widen again with the threat that 
an unruly rise in the dollar could make americas trading woes even 
worse in the coming year 
inflation is on the rise as well although us leaders insist 
that the increase is a blip and not the start of a longterm problem 
there is also the seemingly intractable problem of the 12 
trillion debt burden that has depressed growth in the developing 
world for over a decade 
as for environmental concerns bush is bringing along 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly to help 
explain the administrations new proposals to cut carbon monoxide 
and the pollutants that cause acid rain 
the talks also are expected to cover such topics as depletion of 
the ozoe layer global warming deforestation and ocean dumping 
reilly said he was expecting something of a race between the 
summit leaders to be the greenest of all on this issue 
bush is also looking to the summit to give a boost to his 
administrations third world debt proposals on march 10 treasury 
secretary nicholas brady unveiled a strategy emphasizing debt 
forgiveness and interestrate reductions instead of simply adding 
new lending to the huge debt burden being carried by developing 
countries 
the administrations desire to present the summit with an early 
success story got a boost over the weekend with the announcment that 
negotiators for the commercial banks and mexico were near a bargain 
on a debtreduction package for the third worlds second largest 
debtor 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari one of the dozens of 
world leaders in paris for the bicentennial celebration said 
thursday that the negotiations were at a critical stage and urged 
the summit nations to back the brady plan 
the communique that will formally end the summit is expected to 
endorse the overall principals of the brady debt plan and the 
japanese who already have pledged 45 billion to support the 
debtreduction effort are coming to paris with an even larger 
lending program to help the third world 
the united states is likely to be criticized for what the other 
participants view as a highhanded approach taken by the bush 
administration to remove trade barriers by threatening stiff 
sanctions against nations that fail to remove trade barriers america 
finds onerous 
bush in a presummit press conference defended his targeting of 
japan brazil and india for possible sanctions if talks on 
eliminating barriers do not produce results 
while the us trade deficit narrowed for the first time in seven 
years in 1988 there is concern that the rising dollar which makes 
american products less competitive overseas will halt the 
improvement with the us deficit still at record levels 
the summit countries beginning in 1987 have tried to coordinate 
their economic policies in such a way as to keep the dollars value 
on foreign currency markets within narrow ranges 
but earlier this year despite those efforts the dollar broke 
through the upward boundaries leading some to question whether the 
economic coordination process was in need of a drastic overhaul 
however just in recent weeks the dollar finally fell back 
within the accepted ranges taking the pressure off the summit 
leaders to come up with any significant new agreements aimed at 
dollar stabilization 
with the economy now in a record seventh year of peacetime 
expansion brady said the united states and the other summit 
countries are not anxious to embark on broad new initiatives 
nobody should be mistaken about the fact that we have very 
very good economic conditions around the world he said so 
lets not try and fiddle with the controls too much when youve got 
that kind of backdrop

commercial plugs in the style of a racing driver an advertising 
agent said thursday 
more than 11000 people reportedly have applied for the honor 
ahead of fridays deadline 
the advertising agency saatchi and saatchi has been involved in 
lining up commercial sponsorship for the trip some sponsors may 
support scientific projects others may simply want to be identified 
with the flight 
it may well come down to the type of camera the british 
astronaut uses of what sort of shoes he or she wears said 
agency spokesman bill jonesif we are successful this guy will go 
up looking like a racing driver 
britain has to raise 256 million by commercial sponsorship 
much of which will go to the total 512 million cost

the nation needs a comprehensive plan for 
controlling poison runoff into waterways from city streets farms 
mines and other sources an environmental group said thursday 
the natural resources defense council said some state and local 
governments have taken effective measures to reduce the pollution 
but the problem is growing worse in many areas because of inadequate 
national standards 
poison runoff is the leading source of pollution of at least 
half of the nations rivers lakes and coastal waters yet this 
problem has received a small fraction of government funds and 
attention said bob adler director of the groups clean water 
project 
adler said the runoff containing poisonous quantities of lead 
zinc copper phosphorus and agricultural pesticides and other toxic 
substances poses a potentially major health hazard for swimmers 
and fish and other wildlife 
this runoff has been more difficult to control than water 
pollution from factories and sewage treatment plants because it is 
diffuse and is given less federal attention he said 
adlers group announced the publication of a book based on two 
years of study of poison runoff that provides case studies of ways 
to combat the problem 
among its conclusions is that farms are the single largest 
contributor to the problem because of the use of fertilizers and 
pesticides that pollute surfrace and ground water soil erosion that 
carries excess nutrients and soil particles into rivers and streams 
and pollution from livestock 
were going to have to start thinking about regulating 
farmers adler said 
the book also said logging mining grazing and construction 
also contribute to the problem

a bomb exploded today outside a 
discotheque patronized by american military personnel wounding 
seven us army soldiers three of them seriously officials said 
the attack occurred shortly after midnight at la ceiba more than 
200 miles north of tegucigalpa us embassy spokesman charles v 
barclay said in a telephone interview there was no claim of 
responsibility 
it was the fourth attack on us soldiers in honduras since feb 
1 three soldiers were injured in the previous incidents 
todays victims were army military police who were in la ceiba 
to act as escorts for about 150 american soldiers taking part in a 
joint roadbuilding exercise with honduran troops barclay said he 
said the entire group was due to leave la ceiba today 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said the explosive was thrown as the americans left a disco barclay 
could not confirm that 
we dont know if the explosive device was hurled from a passing 
automobile or had been detonated in place barclay said he said 
the device exploded outside a discotheque 
the injured soldiers were part of a group of nine who had been 
given a nights leave and were in civilian clothes two uninjured 
soldiers fled and were arrested by honduran troops because they had 
no identification a honduran military commander said 
barclay said three of the wounded soldiers were in serious 
condition while the other four suffered lesser injuries he said 
all were assigned to the enrique soto cano air base 50 miles 
northeast of tegucigalpa a major center for us troops in honduras 
the wounded soldiers were rushed to a private hospital in la 
ceiba barclay said their names were not released 
col eric sanchez said the uninjured americans were being held 
until they could be officially identified by us officials 
sanchez the honduran military commander at la ceiba said the 
attack occurred at 1230 am and involved a homemade explosive 
device 
barclay said the troops were part of a convoy that had been 
building roads in a province 120 miles east of la ceiba the convoy 
had stopped for the night during its trip back to soto cano 
about 15000 american troops and honduran soldiers were taking 
part in an exercise called strong roads that began in december and 
ended tuesday the exercise involved bringing in troops from the 
united states a few hundred at a time for roadbuilding 
at least 20 american soldiers have been wounded in attacks in 
honduras since 1982 when the united states started increasing its 
military presence in this country and holding joint exercises with 
honduran troops 
todays attack came three months after unidentified assailants 
used gunfire and an explosive to attack a jeep convoy carrying 11 
us and six honduran soldiers outside olanchita near la ceiba 
one jeep was disabled in the april 11 attack but no injuries 
were reported 
a shadowy leftist group calling itself the morazanista national 
liberation front claimed responsibility for the attacks earlier this 
year and for attacks in 1983 and 1987 
since 1982 the united states and honduras have carried out 
around 80 military exercises jointly involving a total of 100000 
american soldiers under a 1954 reciprocal military assistance 
treaty 
the exercises were intended partly as a political signal to the 
leftist sandinista government in nicaragua which borders honduras 
to the south 
some elements of the honduran population strongly resent the 
increased us military role in the central american nation as well 
as the use of honduran territory by the contra rebels battling the 
leftist government in managua 
honduras was used by the ussupported contras in their attacks 
on sandinista forces us military aid to the contras was cut off 
about 17 months ago and us assistance to the contras has been 
limited to humanitarian aid 
thousands of contras still live in the border area but fighting 
has declined substantially as a result of a ceasefire agreed to in 
march 1988

foreign travel agents thursday urged china to end 
martial law in beijing lower prices and mount a public relations 
campaign abroad if it wants to lure back tourists scared by the 
crackdown on prodemocracy protests 
one after another travel agents told chinese tour officials 
their ideas for salvaging what both sides had expected to be a 
lucrative summer season 
we need very practical solutions and we need them very 
quickly said peter spreadborough of silk route travel in 
melbourn australia we may have lost the entire 198990 program 
weve invested heavily in promoting china the return will be zero 
for most of us 
his suggestion echoed by many other agents was for china to 
invest in overseas tour promotions something china does not 
normally do 
they want people to come in they have to go outside 
spreadborough said our problem is destination credibility we 
know its safe but until there is some sizeable effort from big guns 
in chinese tourism were fighting an uphill battle 
ken chang of pacific delight tours in hong kong said his company 
lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on promotional material for 
nowcanceled china tours 
we want our chinese friends to share the risk and the profit 
he said calling on china to help fund an advertising campaign 
some travel agents said they still planned to bring in groups in 
september although july and august tours were canceled patrick woo 
of amerasia travel in washington predicted that if the chinese get 
30 percent of what they had last year theyll be in good shape 
more than 43 million tourists visited china in 1988 on organized 
tours alone and several times that many are estimated to have come 
individually china reaped 22 billion in hard currency in a major 
boost to the countrys development program 
but since the army shot its way into beijing on june 34 killing 
hundreds and possibly thousands of civilians tourism has nearly 
halted when 16 foreigners arrived in the eastern province of 
jiangxi on thursday local officials gave them a ceremony and 
welcomed them as the first foreign visitors in two months the 
official xinhua news agency said 
china decided two weeks ago take emergency action and invited 
about 400 tour agents from hong kong japan canada the united 
states and other countries for a twoday allexpensespaid seminar 
at the conferences end the director of the beijing tourism 
administration bo xicheng promised that china would give 20 
percent discounts to foreign tour groups in the near future or at 
least before the end of the year xinhua said 
some cities branch offices of the national tour agency also have 
announced price cuts according to the torontobased travel china 
newsletter individual hotels in beijing have begun charging their 
offseason rates 
however under an austerity program imposed by the government to 
counter inflation and other economic problems chinas staterun 
tour organizations may not have the money to conduct the largescale 
promotion the agents demanded 
instead they concentrated on winning over the travel agents 
tour workers from beijing and other cities pressed their name cards 
and glossy brochures into as many hands as possible and some gave 
out gifts of sandalwood fans and tea 
the chinese also handed out political promotional material 
copies of a government report that condemned the studentled 
protests and booklets with pictures of soldiers burned and beaten 
bodies 
for 8 the tour agents could buy a government videotape called 
the true story of the turmoil with footage of civilians 
attacking soldiers the video a compilation of footage shown on 
chinese tv does not show any violence by soldiers against civilians 
some tour agents defended chinas action while others privately 
expressed anger and sorrow but all agreed that china must either 
lift martial law or reduce the military presence before large 
numbers of tourists will return 
one suggested putting soldiers on the streets only at night 
henry wong of holi asia tours in san francisco said soldiers should 
be told to take their fingers off rifle triggers and smoke a 
cigarette or drink a coke in order to ease the tense situation 
added australias spreadborough australians find it 
unacceptable for soldiers to have guns on the street it makes them 
jittery australians are used to taking vacations on beaches and 
you dont find men with guns on beaches

a senate committee voted today to launch its 
own investigation of the department of housing and urban 
development as a house panel said it has voted to strip money from 
a rehabilitation program at the heart of the burgeoning scandal 
involving the agency 
although housing secretary jack kemp has said he would not 
sacrifice programs for the poor to cure the problems he inherited a 
house appropriations subcommittee voted earlier this week to deny 
money in the fiscal 1990 budget year for the moderate rehabilitation 
program 
it was a program shot full of fraud and abuse subcommittee 
chairman rep bob traxler said today in xplaining the panels 
action its time we step back and determine what fixes may be 
necessary 
traxler dmich said the decision was neither irrevocable 
nor permanent because the senate traditionally had allocated 
money for the program despite its omission from reagan 
administration budget requests 
traxler said the bush administration like its predecessor also 
made no provision for funding the moderate rehabilitation program in 
its proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
i will not predict what the senates view of this will be he 
said 
rep bill green of new york the ranking republican on traxlers 
subcommittee said the panel will direct hud in an upcoming report 
to write regulations prohibiting the use of consultants in any 
future use of the 200 million in unspent moderate rehabilitation 
funds 
the littlenoticed vote on tuesday made the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program the first casualty of the series of internal 
hud investigations and congressional inquiries into widespread 
influencepeddling mismanagement and corruption at the department 
during the reagan years 
meanwhile the senate banking committee voted today to begin its 
own investigation of the hud scandals an investigation already was 
under way by a house government operations subcommittee 
the panel will look at management and other activities in 
connection with the moderate rehabilitation program the use of 
government coinsurance and income tax credits between 1978 and 1988 
the committee also voted to send the nomination of frank keating 
as huds general counsel to the full senate for confirmation 
the panels vote follows two days of intensive questioning of 
kemp by two house panels about the future of several of the agencys 
troubled programs 
kemp assured worried members of congress that he acted within his 
authority in suspending some programs amid allegations of 
influencepeddling and mismanagement 
members of the house banking committee on wednesday questioned 
kemps legal authority to suspend programs and warned him not to use 
scandals at his agency to eliminate programs for low or 
middleincome americans 
i wish to emphasize once again we are the committee that 
authorizes programs makes the changes in them or terminates 
them said rep henry b gonzalez chairman of the house banking 
committee 
saying he has suspended rather than terminated programs kemp 
replied that he will submit a legal analysis supporting his 
authority to act 
keating said thursday he was confident kemp had authority to 
cancel the title x land development mortgage insurance program which 
was the focus of the panel members questions 
kemp pledged not to allow problems at the housing agency to be 
used as a subterfuge to eliminate programs 
meanwhile the new york times reported today that auditors have 
determined that losses in the departments federal housing 
administration will reach 1 billion twice the previously estimated 
figure largely because of losses in the coinsurance program 
under that program private insurers assume responsibility for 20 
percent of the insurance for the departments mortgages the 
newspaper said the fbi has begun to look into the affairs of drg 
funding corp once the largest coinsurer but now suspended from 
the program 
kemp has in recent months suspended or revised several federal 
housing programs after allegations by huds inspector general and 
others that they were riddled with abuse mismanagement 
influencepeddling and favoritism 
much of his time since taking over the agency six months ago has 
been spent answering questions about possible abuses during the 
eight years of the reagan administration 
i do not want to be known as the secretary who abandoned the 
needs that people have kemp told the house employment and housing 
subcommittee on tuesday 
your good intentions are not questioned here but the tools you 
use to respond to these scandals must be reviewed by us gonzalez 
dtexas told kemp at wednesdays banking committee hearing 
we need to know where you are going with the termination of 
programs added rep chalmers p wylie rohio 
several committee members expressed concern that program 
cancellations would harm poor people in their districts 
the national scandal is the tip of the iceberg said rep 
mary rose oakar dohio there are some local scandals 
in one such case 13 people were indicted in hauppauge ny 
wednesday on state charges of fraudulently obtaining funds from a 
federally subsidized program that made houses available to poor 
families 
kemp also pledged to curb the use of consultants on hud 
subsidized projects 
several congressmen have introduced legislation to limit the role 
and fees of consultants in such projects and to require full 
disclosure of the use of consultants 
kemp said he will seek to revoke waivers granted by the office of 
government ethics to the postemployment lobbying restriction for 58 
senior jobs at hud in an effort to close the revolving door between 
government agencies and private firms that do business with them 
in april kemp suspended 1989 funding for the moderate 
rehabilitation program after an inspector generals report said 
projects were chosen as the result of influencepeddling and 
favoritism for former hud and other government officials who 
received big fees as developers and consultants

when it comes to fighting city hall dr john 
pittman sure knows how to raise a stink 
when zoning authorities rejected the heart surgeons request to 
put up lowrise office buildings on his 68acre property in this 
wealthy suburb pittman turned the place into a hog farm 
the unexpected whiff of rural indiana is anything but welcome 
among tenants of the new tintedglass office buildings in the 
neighborhood 
theres an old adage you dont have a pig in a parlor said 
f richard rembusch executive vice president of browning 
investments and one of many unhappy purveyors of office space 
there is just a foul odor 
pittman swears he didnt bring in the pigs out of spite he said 
it was the only thing he could do with the property after his 
building plans were blocked 
there are signs the standoff may be easing recently pittman 
sold about 200 of his 300 hogs because of declining prices he 
said 
but mayor dorothy hancock maintained she struck a gentlemens 
agreement with pittman to scale back the pig operation in the 
interest of not making people madder

the west made a new proposal thursday on 
reducing conventional arms in europe acting two months ahead of 
schedule in an attempt to hasten agreement a soviet delegate said 
it contained nothing new 
in moscow the kremlin welcomed the effort to speed negotiations 
and said a deal might be possible within six months 
we have no intention of delaying this important matter of 
reducing the level of military confrontation said foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov he added however that it 
might be difficult to meet a bush administration proposal to make 
the actual cuts by 1992 
he said the nato ideas in general are viewed by us as serious 
and constructive proposals meeting our own proposals halfway 
negotiators for the north atlantic treaty organization offered 
the proposal on the last day of secondround talks on reducing 
conventional forces giving the warsaw pact an eightweek recess to 
study it 
this provided further evidence of our desire to achieve 
early results michael edes head of the british delegation told 
a news conference on behalf of the western alliance 
oleg a grinevsky head of the soviet delegation said agreement 
by 1990 seems quite possible if all sides are agreeable 
he welcomed the nato plan but said he was sorry it did not 
go further 
at first glance the proposal tabled by nato today has no new 
elements grinevsky said rather it is a more detailed 
elaboration of the positions that were stated in brussels and only 
in respect of aviation and helicopters at that 
the western suggestion is based on a blueprint for deep 
reductions in conventional forces in europe presented by president 
bush at the nato summit in may and endorsed by the alliance 
including combat aircraft and helicopters met a longstanding 
demand of the warsaw pact 
edes said the west initially opposed including aircraft because 
their mobility posed verification problems in a zone stretching from 
the atlantic to the ural mountains 
because of natos concession on the point he said its 
political will to achieve agreement cant be doubted 
bushs proposal in brussels would put a ceiling on us and 
soviet troops in the reduction zone of 275000 each nato said that 
would mean removal of 30000 american soldiers and a cut by the 
soviet union of 325000 
it also called for deep cuts in armaments with equal limits on 
tanks personnel carriers and artillery 
the proposal submitted thursday also includes limits on the 
number of combat aircraft and helicopters and provides for 
destruction of equipment withdrawn edes said destroying the 
hardware was a new element and would require detailed verfication 
procedures 
secretary of state james a baker iii revealed the figures to 
journalists wednesday in budapest nato proposes equal ceilings of 
5700 on combat aircraft and 1900 on combat helicopters according 
to nato the warsaw pact has about 9600 combat aircraft and the 
western alliance about 6700 
edes said the new levels would adequately safeguard defensive 
needs of either side 
western delegates would not give the precise numbers of various 
armaments that would have to be removed from europe 
precise figures will emerge in the course of negotiations 
edes said the numbers game is not very fruitful at this stage 
accompanying the western proposal were definitions of types of 
nato aircraft included in the proposal 
stephen j ledogar the chief us delegate said nato wanted 
comparisons on the basis of aircraft capabilities which he called a 
look alike count alike policy 
grinevsky criticized the nato idea of reducing all combat 
aircraft he said the suggestion that defensive systems be included 
was totally at odds with an agreement that firststage reduction 
cover only offensive armaments 
asked about western concern that defensive aircraft could be 
modified for strike capability he said the soviet union would be 
ready to invite inspectors and even to have permanent 
inspector teams to verify that there is no cheating 
the warsaw pact has a proposal on the table to reduce six kinds 
of weapons 10 percent to 15 percent by 1994 with a further 25 
percent reduction by 1997 and a move to purely defensive forces 
three years later 
grinevsky complained about the lack of verification procedures in 
the nato proposal western delegates said measures on verification 
and related issues remained to be worked out 
ledogar said nato will will be working hard to have the 
full proposal on the table at the next round scheduled to begin 
sept 7 he called bushs original oneyear timetable for an 
agreement perfectly realistic

sen albert gore jr didnt get favored 
treatment from banks that loaned him 16 million for his 
unsuccessful run for the democratic presidential nomination the 
federal election commission said thursday 
most of the loans were taken out around the time of a group 
southern primaries in march 1988 the tennessee senator had pinned 
much of his hopes for winning the nomination on those primaries 
election commission auditors initially questioned whether some of 
the banks making the loans had gotten enough collateral and 
assurances of repayment four of the banks are in tennessee and the 
other is in the district of columbia 
gores campaign argued that the loans had been repaid in full 
which should serve as the ultimate proof of the soundness of the 
decision to lend the money

the revolutionaries who stormed the hated bastille 
prison on july 14 1789 found only seven inmates to free locked up 
not for their politics but for fraud incest and lunacy 
the structure built in the 14th century to defend paris against 
english attackers had earlier held such famous prisoners as nicolas 
fouquet believed to be the man in the iron mask the poet 
voltaire and the marquis de sade 
by 1784 the bastille was due to be demolished but five years 
later it was still being used as a prison and as a rest home for 82 
retired soldiers 
on the fateful day of july 14 bread in the bakers shops of 
paris reached its highest price in a year and the old fortress 
became the target of hungry workers from the adjacent faubourg st 
antoine district 
some accounts suggest the crowd feared they would be caught 
between the heavy naval guns mounted in the bastilles 75foot 
towers and regiments of the kings cavalry 
leaders of the 3000strong gathering asked the garrison for 
gunpowder and arms when they were refused the crowd reinforced by 
the unemployed from montmartre and with army deserters attacked 
crying the bastille for us troops out 
the cannon in the towers had alarmed the attackers but there 
were no cannonballs or shot the garrison of 32 swiss guards had 
only an assortment of light rifles still about 170 people were 
killed in the action and 115 wounded on both sides 
the marquis bernard de launey governor of the bastille was 
taken away and murdered on the way to city hall 
the attackers opened the dungeons to find seven prisoners jean 
bechade bernard larouche jean la courrege and jeanantoine 
piyarde imprisoned for fraud a monsieur tavernier and the comte de 
whyte de malleville both mentally deranged and the comtes de 
solages imprisoned for incest 
the edifice was then set afire and the traces of the blaze are 
still visible burned into the walls of a canal that runs through 
the fortress foundations 
soon afterward the bastille was demolished some stones were 
sold as souvenirs and others were used in the construction of the 
concorde bridge over the seine in 1790 
july 14 was declared frances national day in 1880 91 years 
after the prison fell

cuban war hero arnaldo ochoa and three other 
former army officers were executed by firing squad today for 
shipping tons of drugs into the united states the official cuban 
news agency said 
the executions ended a courtmartial and appeal process that 
revealed a ring in the army and interior ministry engaged in drug 
trafficking black marketeering smuggling and other crimes 
the prensa latina news agency said the four were executed at dawn 
in cuba in addition to ochoa a former army general they included 
former col antonio de la guardia font former maj armado padron 
and former capt jorge martinez 
they were sentenced to death last week stripped of their 
military ranks and thrown out of the communist party 
ochoa 57 fought in the guerrilla war that brought fidel castro 
to power and was made a hero of the revolution cubas highest 
honor for heading cubas 50000man expedition in angola and an 
earlier one to ethiopia ochoa also headed a mission to nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government 
the defendants appealed their sentences to the council of state 
the councils 29 members voted unanimously sunday to uphold the 
death sentences 
castro giving a fivehour summation to the panel said the four 
must face a firing squad to restore faith in the cuban revolution 
ensure discipline in the armed forces and set an example for others 
in addition to drug trafficking they were convicted of treason 
and other crimes 
the courtmartial also handed out prison sentences ranging from 
10 years to 30 years to 10 other defendants in the case they were 
stripped of rank and decorations and were dishonorably discharged 
the scandal shook castros government embarrassing him and the 
communist party he had for years been denying us accusations his 
nation was being used for drug shipments saying the reports were a 
plot to embarrass the revolution 
but he had to admit the accusations were true in addition to the 
officers put on trial the transportation and interior ministers 
have been sacked and there have been unconfirmed reports that other 
officials were arrested 
castro said the drug scandal did immense internal damage eroded 
cubas international image and crippled the tourism industry it has 
been trying to foster 
castro accused the united states of trying to score propaganda 
points on the drug trafficking issue he also said ochoa had stolen 
from nicaragua and angola and he held him responsible for defeats 
suffered by cuban forces supporting the government of angola against 
south africasupported guerrillas 
instead of sharing information on drug smuggling castro said 
the united states engaged in a propaganda campaign to discredit 
cuba its communist revolution and his younger brother defense 
minister raul castro 
in washington the state department deputy spokesman richard 
boucher said the bush administration did not have access to all the 
evidence in the case and therefore cannot make a judgment about the 
executions 
with regard to policy we of course support vigorous 
prosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be he 
said 
as for the possibility of us cooperation with cuba as 
suggested by castro boucher said the united states is waiting to 
see what cuba will do in terms of efforts to combat drugrelated 
activity that still continues 
you dont automatically start negotiating cooperation until you 
have an indication the other side is really serious and thats what 
were looking for he said

a senate panel thursday approved a 127 million 
bill to pay for 700 additional district of columbia police in an 
effort to stem the burgeoning murder rate in the nations capital 
the house already has approved the plan for the federal 
government to pick up the tab for the extra officers 
by thursday 229 people had been killed in the district this 
year compared with 159 at the same time in 1988 a record 372 
people were killed last year 
police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs 
before the governmental affairs committee approved the fiveyear 
plan sen carl levin dmich said he might introduce an amendment 
requiring the city to pay for part of the program 
the city already has agreed to pay about 2 million in recruiting 
and training costs 
however levin may drop plans to have the city pay for the 
officers if hes convinced the district is also making efforts to 
hire police said levin aide linda gustitus 
the city is adding 200 officers in the current fiscal year while 
300 more are to be hired in the fiscal year that starts oct 1 
the panel also approved an amendment by sen jon heinz rpa 
that requires the city to share routine arrest information and other 
police data with the fbi and other federal law enforcement groups 
because of a 1968 law establishing a balance of power between the 
federal and local police departments the district is the only 
jurisdiction in the nation not to share such information

about 33000 soviets moved to the united states in 1988 this 
year soviets are registering their intent to emigrate at an annual 
rate of 120000 and that could reach a quartermillion by 1990 
said max robinson consulgeneral at the us embassy 
the united states has a policy of giving all soviets who seek 
to emigrate to the united states the chance to do so robinson 
said that dates back to a very recent time when we were engaged 
in a major human rights struggle with soviet officials to free up 
emigration they are doing so at rates that we did not expect but 
are delighted to see 
i think that once the new emigration law comes into effect and 
a pattern is established it could double next year and come awfully 
close to a quarter million he said 
that many soviet emigres could overwhelm the us immigration 
system since 200000 would approximately equal the number allowed 
into the united states from rest of the world robinson said 
that creates an imbalance that we are going to take a good hard 
look at from a policy perspective said robinson the policy is 
under review washington by the administration and congress 
president bush has said if the soviets enact the proposed changes 
in their emigration law he will urge congress to pass a oneyear 
waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment thereby reducing the tariffs 
on soviet goods exported to the united states the law passed in 
1972 was sponsored by the late sen henry jackson and thenrep 
charles vanik 
soviet officials involved in drafting the liberalized emigration 
law want it enacted as speedily as possible said yuri reshetov 
head of the foreign ministry human rights department 
the draft law establishes freedom of entry and departure 
exit or entry on a permanent or temporary basis will be free 
reshetov told a news conference the law is on par with 
international practice in this area 
the key change will be dropping the requirement that soviets 
seeking to emigrate obtain an invitation from an immediate family 
member abroad instead soviets will need only an invitation from a 
friend relative or commercial enterprise saying the emigre will be 
supported according to us officials familar with drafts of the 
law 
the draft addresses two other oftencriticized points in the law 
which deny visas to people who have conducted classified research 
and require wouldbe emigres to secure statements from relatives 
that they leave behind no outstanding financial obligations 
reshetov said 
terms of secrecy will expire after five years and the cases of 
socalled poor relatives will be handled by family courts he 
said 
foreign ministry officials have tried to impress upon members of 
the new legislature the supreme soviet the necessity of the 
speedy adoption of this law reshetov said 
the us consulgeneral said soviet citizens were lining up for 
visas in anticipation of the new legislation 
of the 33000 soviet citizens who entered the united states in 
1988 said robinson 20000 first went to rome on israeli visas and 
then on to the united states and the remainder went directly on 
us documents 
so far in 1989 soviets are registering with us officials at 
the rate of 60000 a year and at the same rate at the dutch 
embassy which handles consular affairs for the israeli government 
in any recent week he said 1200 to 1500 soviets registered at 
the us embassy of whom 40 percent were armenian 25 percent 
jewish 15 percent ethnic russians 5 percent to 8 percent 
ukrainians and 5 percent balts others were azerbaijani turkish 
georgian or tadzhik or another nationality 
of the comparable number that register weekly at the dutch 
embassy for israeli visas he said about 95 percent are jewish

president bush said thursday the united states will 
not relax its policy on the middle east to accommodate political 
turmoil in israel a nation he said is beset by great 
difficulties 
bush talking with reporters on air force one as he flew here 
from hungary said israel should go forward with elections among 
palestinians in the occupied territories as a step toward peace 
and he said the united states will not change its policy of 
opposing israeli settlements in the occupied territories the us 
view is that such settlements are obstacles to peace 
bushs comments reflected the strain in usisraeli relations 
caused by the july 5 decision by prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc to harden its stand on conditions for middle 
east peace negotiations 
at a press conference in paris brent scowcroft the presidents 
national security adviser drew a distinction between the decision 
of the likud party and the israeli government what likud does is 
a party matter and what we deal with is the israeli government he 
said 
scowcroft said the purpose of a planned visit to israel by a us 
delegation was just to ascertain in the wake of the likud 
conference whether or not there has been a change in israeli 
government policy 
bush said the delegation would not be part of any highlevel 
diplomacy 
amid charges in israel that the united states is meddling in 
israeli politics bush told reporters 
the us policy is set i am the president of the united 
states israel is a friend and will remain a friend but i have to 
say what our policy is 
i dont think theres great heartburn here but i just want to 
continue to articulate what we believe he said 
bush said i want to see things go forward in terms of the 
peace process over there and we want to see the election process go 
forward 
and if anybody can make a case to me that the recent 
deliberations in that likud party will enchance the election 
process then i would say great but i am afraid that other people 
are looking at it and saying that what has happened does not enhance 
the possiblity of elections 
rejecting suggestings that the united states is rattled by 
developments in israel bush said i dont know that the united 
states is so shook up but they shamir and his allies know the 
united states policy and the united states policy on settlements has 
not changed and it is not going to change 
we might as well be frank with our friends because that is what 
friendship is about the president said 
he said they have great difficultes inside of israel i 
understand that i understand the political pressures but i cant be 
varying us policy everyday to accommodate political change i am 
not going to do that

much more than cold hard cash president bush left 
behind hin in poland and hungary the shining symbol of an america 
that cares about the people of eastern europe as they struggle 
through a trial period of transformation from marxist to market 
economies 
he did it with his earnest presence by neither overpromising 
us support nor encouraging a backlash from the soviet union 
we were not there to poke a stick in the eye of mr 
gorbachev said the obviously pleased president as he chatted with 
reporters thursday aboard air force one on the way to paris 
just the opposite he said his aim was to encourage the 
very kind of reforms that he gorbachev is championing and more 
reforms 
reflecting thursday on the uniformly friendly reception he 
received in hungary and poland bush told reporters on air force one 
i think it shores up their desire for change because i think it 
shows all of us the genuine affection for the united states that 
exists in these countries 
bushs message to the leaders and people of the two countries as 
they transit this wrenching period of change was that they have in 
the united states a new partner to lend a hand 
clearly however the modest aid packages bush outlined are not 
enough to put either poland or hungary in the capitalist column 
poland is reeling under 100 percent inflation annually running 
against global trends the average life span in the country has 
declined to 65 years pollution is heavy 
hungary the showcase of socalism has an inflation rate of at 
least 20 percent a year the poverty line is 52 a month and 
according to research by the heritage foundation of washington 40 
percent of hungarians fall under it 
bush acknowledged on his flight here to a sevennation economic 
summit meeting that the aid packages including a 100 million 
developmment fund for poland and a 20 million fund for hungary 
were inadequate to rescue the economies 
but bush said that in his very frank talks with polish and 
hungarian leaders he found they understand we are restricted in 
what we can do in terms of dollars of aid or dollars of support 
for some very worthy project 
even lech walesa the leader of the polish union solidarity 
backed away from his quest for 10 billion in aid 
as it turned out bush said walesa told him over lunch in gdansk 
on tuesday that solidarity was seeking loans from international 
banks amounting to 10 billion not direct us help 
earlier a spokesman for the polish government col wieslaw 
gornicki complained that there was very little concrete 
material in what bush offered he specifically noted the 
presidents repeated calls for further sacrificies 
two years ago the poles refused to kick out the props from a 
government support system that makes rent and food staples cheap 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser did 
say here on thursday that the united states would be ready to ease 
poland through an austerity period with food aid and other 
commodities 
bush also plans to ask the leaders of the other six nations at 
this economic summit britain canada france italy japan and 
west germany to help out in what scowcroft called a 
clearinghouse effort to avoid duplicating aid

a small plane with a stricken pilot ran out of gas 
and crashed into the ocean today after flying hundreds of miles on 
autopilot astonished rescuers said the man swam toward them and was 
pulled alive from the water 
the pilot identified as a washington dc lawyer was taken by 
helicopter to nassau the bahamas and will be flown by jet to 
florida the coast guard said 
the words you keep hearing are youre kidding said petty 
officer veronica cady a coast guard spokeswoman 
military pilots and rescuers trained to parachute into the ocean 
to save ditched pilots could only watch helplessly as their aircraft 
tracked the singleengine plane for nearly four hours while it 
slowly ran out of gas the plane crashed in the atlantic in the 
bahamas 
with all that time he didnt answer us no communciation 
whatsoever seen slumped behind the wheel we assumed he was at the 
least unconscious ms cady said for him to survive a crash 
like that it just sent us all into shock we didnt expect this 
story to have a happy ending 
rescuers didnt know how he got out of the plane she said there 
was no immediate word on the mans condition 
the federal aviation administration declined to identify the 
pilot but staff members at the washington law firm of thomas root 
36 a communications lawyer confirmed that he was the man 
nothing more was heard from him after he reported to air traffic 
controllers in virginia at 830 am that he was having chest pains 
and difficulty breathing he had taken off from washingtons 
national airport at about 630 am bound for rocky mount nc 
the man was glimpsed apparently unconscious at one point as the 
plane headed southward roughly parallel to the east coast there was 
no one else visible in the plane and radio messages to the plane 
went unanswered 
the coast guard said the plane ran out of gas and crashed into 
the ocean in the central bahamas about 15 miles east of the island 
of eleuthera the site is about 250 miles southeast of miami and 800 
miles from the pilots original destination

spiraled into the water so it didnt make the best of all possible 
landings chief petty officer lou parris said 
faa spokesman jack barker in atlanta said that as the plane 
headed southward it had gotten as near as 100 miles from the east 
coast shore because of the curvature of the coastline 
hans hess manager of the rocky mountwilson nc airport said 
the plane had been due to arrive there at 749 am hess said a 
person had been waiting to meet the pilot and the plane he did not 
know if that person was a relative and did not identify the person 
after its distress call the plane was intercepted by two marine 
corps fa18 hornets when it entered norfolk naval station airspace

bill pierman shift supervisor in the air traffic control tower 
at washington national told raleigh radio station wptf the plane 
very easily could wind up in the bahamas 
put an airplane on automatic pilot and its going to continue 
just exactly on the course that the automatic pilot is set for 
he said the automatic pilot was set on a heading that would have 
sent the plane toward bahamas but the pilot would have made a turn 
for the rocky mountwilson airport 
the two rescue teams are part of the 301st aerospace rescue and 
recovery squad the c130 part of the squad is based at homestead 
the helicopter part at patrick said lt col margaret stanek of

a national group of engineers urged by a white 
house official to take a stand called thursday for actions to 
combat overheating of the earth without waiting for absolute proof 
it is happening 
the steps should include efforts to improve the cleanliness of 
coal burning to increase use of nuclear energy and to plant more 
trees according to the report released by ernest l daman 
president of the american society of mechanical engineers 
while there are still scientific uncertainties about the 
greenhouse effect there is enough evidence to show that the 
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing said a 
alan moghissi who headed the societys risk analysis task force 
a prudent course of action may consist of assuming that adverse 
effects may take place and that corrective actions may be 
necessary said moghissi of the university of marylandbaltimore 
the society released a position paper entitled energy and the 
environment including a wideranging series of recommendations 
for improving energy efficiency as a means of helping the 
environment 
daman said the decision to issue a position paper on global 
change a controversial issue in recent years had generated debate 
within the 116000member society of mechanical engineers 
however he said white house chief of staff john sununu an 
engineer and a member of the society helped spur the group to 
action 
daman said that sununu had told him that if technical groups want 
to be listened to they have to stop issuing general 
dogoodthings reports and instead take positions on issues 
we have to do that i think sununu is right daman said 
some environmental groups have criticized the bush administration 
for taking what they consider a toocautious approach to the issue 
of global warming 
bush officials have said the issue is hardly clearcut but a 
report last month by the white house advisory council on 
environmental quality said the government might find it necessary to 
plan future projects considering climate change even before all 
the uncertainties are known 
the engineering societys report deals with the theory that 
increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could cause the climate 
to warm melting polar ice caps disrupting farming and leading to 
other major changes in society carbon dioxide allows shortwave 
radiation from the sun to pass through to the earth but blocks the 
longwave radiation from earth that ordinarily travels out into 
space 
many scientists believe that this change will result in an 
increase in the average temperature of the earth although others 
say too little is known to reach any conclusions yet 
the mechanical engineers conclude in their study that research 
should be accelerated on the greenhouse effect including an 
international agreement on reforestation 
the group called for an international fund to help maintain 
tropical rain forests plus a national effort toward planting more 
trees across this country trees and other plants remove carbon 
dioxide from the air 
other proposals put forth by the engineers include 
incentives for improving the efficiency of coalburning plants 
substantial research to develop safer nuclear reactors based on 
currently operating reactors 
development of technology to improve the fuel efficiency of 
automobiles 
continued support for the development of renewable energy 
systems 
establishment of a central facility for receiving evaluating 
and packing spent nuclear fuel and preparing it for final disposal 
a national effort to reprocess and recycle nuclear fuel 
improvement of material requirements and safety of hydrogen 
energy 
increased research on acid rain reduction

a public group charged thursday that the 
national science foundation uses a secret system ripe for abuse 
to evaluate grant applications from scientists and urged the agency 
to make the process more open 
public citizen a nonprofit advocacy organization told nsf 
director erich bloch that the system violates the letter and the 
spirit of various federal laws that are designed to make federal 
agency decisionmaking fair and accountable 
eric glitzenstein a lawyer for public citizen said at a news 
conference that the nsf for 14 years maintained a system of record 
keeping that blocked grant applicants from learning what had been 
put into their permanent file 
that meant unfounded allegations about a scientist were kept 
secret even if the information played a role in denying his grant 
application glitzenstein said 
the scientist cannot learn about the allegation cannot respond 
to it and has virtually no ability to appeal the denial he said 
anytime you have system based on secret reviews you have a 
potential for abuse 
the nsf is distributing about 18 billion to about 16000 
research projects for the 1989 fiscal year officials said 
the petition sent to bloch also alleges that the nsf has an 
inadquate system for dealing with potential conflicts of interest 
that may affect approval of an applicants grant applicants 
glitzenstein said arent allowed to know who is reviewing their 
proposal which means reviewers could include scientists who compete 
with the applicant 
that system also is ripe for abuse glitzenstein said 
the nsf changed its filing system last summer to allow future 
applicants to have have some access to grantreview records but 
those before 1988 remain closed he said 
lewis grotke nsf assistant general counsel said the agency 
would consider the petition but is under no legal obligation to act 
the agency he said has tried to develop a fair system to review 
grant applications 
individual scientists or research teams apply for grants to 
finance projects the nsf distributes the applications to experts in 
the field who evaluate the proposals and make recommendations 
glitzenstein said public citizen became involved after a 
university of texas geologist jon ervin kalb learned that two of 
his applications in the 1970s had been denied after reviewers 
discussed an incorrect and unfounded rumor that kalb worked for the 
central intelligence agency 
kalb and the nsf settled a lawsuit on the issue in 1987 the 
agency gave kalb 20000 in cash apologized and agreed to correct 
its records glitzenstein said

the chairman of a senate committee drafting a 
puerto rican plebiscite bill criticized the bush administration 
thursday for failing to answer questions concerning the economic 
impact of proposed statehood or enhanced commonwealth status 
those alternatives to puerto ricos commonwealth status will be 
on the ballot when the people of puerto rico vote in a referendum 
scheduled for 1991 and sen j bennett johnston dla thinks the 
voters should know in advance what their choice will entail 
johnston irritated by the absence from washington of president 
bushs aide handling puerto rican affairs told a us treasury 
official that his request to leave the senate energy and natural 
resources committee hearing early was an insult to this committee 
and to the puerto rican status issue 
kenneth w gideon assistant secretary of the treasury for tax 
policy responded that the administration is willing to work with 
the senate committee on the plebiscite he told the committee the 
choice facing the people of puerto rico is fundamentally a political 
one with longterm implications for their rights and obligations as 
citizens 
but this view clashed with that of johnson who believes puerto 
rican voters should know in advance what they should expect in terms 
of future us funds for food health and other basic programs under 
any transition afforded under independence or statehood 
johnston is asking the administration to spell out in detail the 
fiscal impact of major federally funded programs and is seeking 
information regarding all 385 federally funded programs on the 
island 
puerto rico presently participates in all but 30 usfunded 
programs under its present commonwealth status 
in seeking enhanced commonwealth status gov rafael 
hernandez colon seeks a larger voice for the island in determining 
which federal laws should be applicable to the island the governor 
first proposed the holding of a status plebiscite during an 
inaugural address earlier this year 
johnston who earlier scored president bush for remarking on his 
personal preference on the island said he hopes for an evenhanded 
approach to all options during the referendum he said the bush 
administration needs a totally new attitude regarding the 
plebiscite and the present hearings on legislation setting up the 
federally supported referendum

king fahd of saudi arabia called for 
islamic unity thursday as 18 million moslems ended the annual 
pilgrimage to their holiest shrines guarded by antiterrorism squads 
deployed after two bombings 
fahd made no mention of the explosions monday that killed a 
pakistani pilgrim and wounded 16 other people near the grand mosque 
in mecca the birthplace of the prophet mohammed 
our prayer is that the coming feasts will see the sons of 
the islamic nation in solidarity united and cooperating for the 
good of our causes and efforts to strengthen security spread peace 
establish justice and restore rights he said in a message 
broadcast by saudi radio and television 
as twilight descended around mecca the army of pilgrims prayed 
before they slit the throats of more than 1 million sheep cows and 
camels for eid aladha or the feast of sacrifice 
the meat traditionally went to poor saudis but since the 
discovery of oil virtually eliminated poverty in the kingdom most 
is flown to poor moslems in 26 countries 
the faithful then streamed down mount arafat to the scorching 
plain of mina and went on to mecca for final prayers during the 
pilgrimage or hajj 
waves of veiled women and men in white seamless robes signifying 
equality before allah took part in the prayers televised live by 
satellite to scores of islamic countries 
mondays bombings were the only incidents to mar this years 
pilgrimage and came amid an intensifying war of words with iran 
over the saudis limit of 1000 pilgrims for every 1 million 
population in moslem countries 
iran boycotted the pilgrimage as it did when the limits were 
introduced last year and cut its usual contingent of 150000 by 
twothirds 
saudi security authorities have detained an undisclosed number of 
suspects in the bombings the saudis have not accused any group or 
country although persian gulf newspapers pointed to iran iranian 
leaders denied involvement and accused saudi authorities of trying 
to discredit them 
tehran has used the bombings to strengthen its calls for the 
overthrow of saudi arabias royal family which it accuses of being 
antiislamic underscoring the historic rift between the worlds 1 
billion moslems 
irans estimated 50 million people are overwhelmingly of the 
shiite sect saudi arabias 12 million people like most moslems 
mainly are from the mainstream sunni sect 
the saudis cited vast renovation and construction projects in 
mecca and other holy sites for reducing the number of pilgrims 
they severed relations with tehran in april last year citing 
terrorism and subversion 
relations between the two countries soured by saudi support of 
iraq in the iraniraq war worsened during the 1987 hajj when the 
saudis charged iranian pilgrims started riots that killed more than 
400 pilgrims mostly iranians 
the saudis have spent billions of dollars modernizing the holy 
cities and providing all manner of services for what has become a 
logistical nightmare 
pilgrims once trudged in the sweltering heat on foot or by camel 
to make the hajj now they are transported free in 7500 
airconditioned buses hundreds of trucks and scores of helicopters 
the hajj which must be made at least once by all moslems who can 
afford it is the worlds largest religious congress it brings 
together arabian princes merchants from indonesia paupers from 
bangladesh and india 
each year moslems from soviet uzbekistan poland hungary 
spain senegal and other states join in chanting god is so great 
and to him we pay high tribute 
at mina each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the three 
devil pillars a spot where moslems believe the devil tried to 
tempt abraham to disobey allah and refuse to sacrifice his son 
it was 120 degrees thursday when swarms of hajjis rushed to a 
mina gorge to stone the devil many were hospitalized for 
sunstroke 
during the hajj pilgrims must abstain from sex and may not 
quarrel cut their hair or even kill a fly

the leaders of the worlds seven largest industrial 
democracies are in paris for the 15th annual economic summit here 
are sketches of the leaders and their priorities for the summit 
 
united states 
president bush 65 is attending his first economic summit he 
arrives with proposals on global pollution a new strategy for 
resolving the third world debt problem and recommendations to foster 
economic and democratic reforms in communist eastern europe 
the administration is hoping that these initiatives will allow 
bush to assume the leadership role in the western alliance on 
economic and environmental matters in much the same way he 
established his leadership on military policy at the nato summit in 
may 
on the environment bush will also be seeking international 
cooperation in combating depletion of the ozone layer global 
warming deforestation and ocean dumping 
on debt the administration will be pushing the plan unveiled 
march 10 by treasury secretary nicholas brady which stresses 
voluntary forgiveness by commercial banks of a portion of the 12 
trillion in third world debt in return the banks would receive 
guarantees underwritten by international lending agencies that the 
remaining debt would be repaid 
while economic growth in the united states is slowing most 
economists believe the country will be able to avoid a recession 
this year however there is concern about an uptick in inflation 
this year and worries as well that improvement in americas huge 
trade deficit may have stalled out 
given bushs extensive international experience he at least 
wont have the handicap that former president ronald reagan faced at 
his first economic summit in 1981 the other world leaders viewed 
reagan as something of an oddity an actorturnedpresident with 
strange ideas about supplyside economics

prime minister margaret thatcher 63 is the most senior of the 
summiteers having celebrated her 10th year in office in may but 
she goes to paris with her conservative party government in trouble 
in june 15 elections for the european parliament the 
conservatives were routed by the opposition socialist labor party 
it was mrs thatchers first defeat in a national election since she 
won office 
and for the first time since she won a third consecutive 
fiveyear term in the 1987 general election thatchers personal 
approval ratings are behind those of labor leader neil kinnock 34 
percent versus 41 percent for kinnock 
in paris thatcher expects major debate on the resurgence of 
inflation british inflation has risen from an annual rate of 42 
percent a year ago to 83 percent double the average for other 
european nations 
the high inflation accompanied by steep increases in interest 
rates has led to consumer unrest and rising union militancy there 
have been simultaneous oneday strikes by railroad and london subway 
workers mainly over pay 
 
france 
socialist president francois mitterrand 72 ranks no 2 in 
seniority behind thatcher having just been reelected to a second 
sevenyear term last spring he is still riding comfortably high in 
the opinion polls as his conservative opposition flounders in 
divisive squabbles 
his biggest economic headache is the same one he has had since 
first elected in may 1981 unemployment which has been at or above 
10 percent for several years the french trade deficit has also been 
rising in recent months 
mitterrands top priority is debt he has long cast himself as 
champion of the downtrodden debtridden third world 
in may mitterrand unilaterally forgave 16 billion francs 25 
billion in public sector debt to africas 35 poorest countries the 
french are looking for other summit countries to match that 
generosity 
on the issue of the debt burden being carried by larger third 
world nations such as brazil and mexico the french want to come up 
with a package amalgamating the brady plan with ideas put forward by 
the japanese and by mitterrand last september 
all those plans generally call for forgving a portion of the big 
debtor countries debts in exchange for guarantees that the rest 
will be paid

prime minister sousuke uno 66 is the newest leader at the 
summit and the most besieged he comes to paris at a time when his 
government is shaken by an influencepeddling scandal and by 
allegations that he kept a number of paid mistresses 
uno then foreign minister succeeded former prime minister 
noboru takeshita a little over a month ago when takeshita resigned 
in the wake of the bribery scandal now uno is rumored to be near 
resignation because of the sex scandal and his political party is at 
its lowest point in 34 years of rule 
in an effort to shore up his image as an international leader 
uno will pledge nearly 40 billion in new funds for debt relief and 
environmental assistance to developing nations an impressive 
package which should deflect criticism that japan now the worlds 
largest creditor country has not done enough to relieve the 
crushing debt burden faced by the third world 
but it remains to be seen whether the new assistance package and 
other japanese initiatives would be enough to defuse onos worsening 
political position back home 
 
west germany 
despite a vibrant economy chancellor helmut kohl 59 head of 
government since october 1982 is another summit leader facing major 
problems at home kohls ratings in opinion polls have slid 
dramatically in the past six months and some observers say he may 
not win federal elections slated for december 1990 
in an effort to bolster his image kohl announced a major cabinet 
shakeup in april at the summit west germany is expected to caution 
against doing anything that would unleash inflation 
west germany which is expected to post a growth rate of 35 
percent this year recently boosted a key interest rate in an effort 
to guard against inflation the move however displeased the bush 
administration which believes the interest rate increase will slow 
german consumer demand and dampen the countrys appetite for 
imported goods including us products 
it is expected that both kohl and bush will press their 
respective sides of this dispute during the paris summit 
 
italy 
italy is going though one of its recurring government crises the 
coalition led by premier ciriaco de mita a christian democrat 
resigned may 19 and negotiations to form a new government are still 
under way 
de mita 61 will represent italy at the summit in his capacity 
as caretaker premier this has not been an impediment in the past a 
caretaker italian government hosted the economic summit in venice in 
1987 de mita has headed up the government since april 1988 
italian officials are focusing on three issues at the summit 
cleaning up the environment fighting the drug epidemic and third 
world debt on the environment italy would like to see standards 
established to measure performance by each country 
according to one forecast italys economy is expected to grow at 
a healthy annual rate of 35 percent this year and slow only 
marginally in 1990 but the upbeat forecast on growth is clouded by 
concern over inflation which has been creeping up to an annual rate 
of 7 percent 
 
canada 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney 50 will be looking in 
paris for confirmation that inflation poses a threat on the 
international front his government has insisted that interest rates 
remain high to avert the threat of inflation despite complaints 
that they could speed the start of a slowdown or even in the worst 
forecasts recession 
the canadian inflation rate of 5 percent so far this year is the 
highest in five years 
mulroney is in the first year of his second term and has embarked 
on a program intended to eventually bring the governments budget 
deficit under control but other than his austerity message critics 
say his government is adrift in the second term without any major 
theme after the big drive to win approval in 1988 for a free trade 
agreement with the united states 
the environment has emerged as a hot topic in canada so mulroney 
is interested in pushing the environmental agenda at the summit in 
hopes that he can portray himself as a world leader on the issue

rooftop marksmen airborne television cameras and a 
security force of 30000 protected the leaders of 34 nations 
thursday as they kicked off the bicentennial celebration of the 
french revolution 
extra radar installations and even groundtoair missiles were in 
place for the threeday celebration and for the summit of the 
worlds seven leading industrialized democracies which begins 
friday 
its going well very well said jean hanot chief of police 
at the summit site in western paris anyhow you cant be a 
pessimist in this business 
the guns and guards were focused first on paris main boulevards 
where red white and blue flags flew and noisy motorcades carried 
leaders to an array of bicentennial events not always to the 
pleasure of pedestrians 
on the rue du faubourg st honore the elegant street on which 
the elysee palace of president francois mitterrand is situated 
police shoved parisians back into their shops as motorcades sped by 
i thought this was our city one resident grumbled 
parts of the city were closed to drivers through the weekend 
although many residents fled the city to avoid the mess police said 
1000 cars were towed thursday alone 
popular lowlying fly boats for tourists were forbidden from 
plying the seine river running through paris 
a 200footlong blimp which can carry a crew of 10 relayed live 
television pictures from two cameras to ground command centers 
the dirigible estimated to cost 7 million was used earlier 
this month for surveillance during the visit of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
mirage fighters and crotale groundtoair missiles backed up the 
blimp and six radar systems were added to the four normally 
installed around paris to ensure that uninvited guests did not enter 
the skies security officials said 
at the arch the gleaming archshaped building where the seven 
summiteers will meet police also planned air protection said hanot 
he said that in addition to 4000 police in and around the steel 
fence ringing the site 200 sharpshooters were to be stationed on 
the rooftops of the jumble of skyscrapers in the area

fellow villagers expected something 
terrible of christian dornier but the madness of the strange 
brooding man was worse than they had feared 
dornier shot and killed 14 people including his mother and 
sister and wounded eight others including his father in a 
twohour rampage on wednesday 
it was a bloodbath dominique cuenot of the village council 
said thursday we knew he would create havoc one day and the 
police should have dealt with him months ago unfortunately our 
laws dont allow such preventive action 
everyone here was afraid of christian dornier said joel 
clausse whose father roger is mayor his behavior was strange 
no one ever complained to the police about him but we all knew 
this farming village in eastern france had 128 residents when 
dornier 31 picked up his shotgun wednesday when his murderous 
spree was over seven of them were dead including three children 
he killed seven more from nearby villages and seriously wounded 
eight people 
joel clausse saw dornier driving up in his car wednesday 
pointing his doublebarreled shotgun through the window 
from my upstairs window i saw he was pointing his gun directly 
at my mother so i aimed my own gun at him and fired claussee 
said i saw the blood spurting from a wound in his neck but then 
he fled and i saw nothing more of him 
joels mother ginettte said she owes her life to her son her 
5yearold niece pauline was killed while playing in the garden 
christian dorniers killings began with his sister corinne 26 
who was married only last saturday 
there was no argument or quarrel of any kind said dorniers 
younger brother serge he picked up his gun and fired it 
pointblank at corinne killing her instantly then in the mad scene 
that followed my mother jeanne telephoned to the police for help 
he fired and killed her too 
dorniers father georges 63 was one of the eight people 
hospitalized with serious wounds 
daniel maillard corinnes husband escaped only because he was 
in the toilet serge said 
then christian dornier got in his car a black volkswagen and 
set off on his shooting spree he was seriously wounded when police 
caught up with him and opened fire and was being treated in a 
besancon hospital thursday under police guard 
in paris an antihunting group called for tighter controls on 
firearms used by hunters which are much easier to obtain than 
tightly regulated handguns and other weapons 
the rally of opponents to hunting issued a statement saying 
hunting weapons should be taken away from from people under 
therapeutic medicine and even hunters out of season 
serge dornier works for the peugeot automobile manufacturing 
plant at montbeliard and like many young frenchmen has little 
interest in farming he said the family had agreed christian should 
ultimately take over the farm from his parents and it would be sold 
if if he could not work it on his own 
serge estimated the 148 acres were worth about 60000 
christian was a taciturn depressed fellow serge said of his 
brother he had no friends hardly ever talked to anyone a few 
weeks ago he suddenly got a punk haircut he did strange things like 
that and we did not pay much attention 
people in the village began to talk including neighbor remy 
barrand who said christian shot at him last month and a farmers 
wife who said he pelted her with stones early one morning a few 
weeks ago 
the village council discussed what to do and decided no action 
was called for because christian dornier had never been in trouble 
with the law 
we advised the family to get him psychiatric treatment and 
they did said jacques fleury a council member 
a psychiatrist came regularly from nearby baumelesdames and 
prescribed tranquilizers but serge said his brother did not take 
them 
we thought something happened to him during his 12 months 
military service about eight years ago serge said he was never 
the same after that 
three children playing in their gardens or bicycling were among 
those killed from christian dorniers car so were several elderly 
people in nearby villages a farmer driving his tractor in a field 
the schoolteacher at neighboring autechaux and the wife of the mayor 
of nearby voilans 
the teacher and mayors wife arrived at a crossroads in separate 
cars simultaneously with dornier both were shot to death and their 
cars crashed 
capt rene sarrazin police commander at baumeles dames was 
struck by bullets in his neck and groin while driving to luxiol in 
response to mrs dorniers call he was undergoing emergency 
treatment thursday 
the bodies of the victims were laid out in the various town halls 
and were to be buried simultaneously friday 
all celebrations of fridays 200th anniversary of the french 
revolution were canceled in the region

the leaders of egypt india venezuela and senegal 
on thursday urged french president francois mitterrand to help 
organize a summit meeting as soon as possible between developed and 
developing nations 
mitterrand endorsed the proposal but said he would not seek a 
decision on the issue at a summit meeting of the leaders of seven 
major industrialized nations that starts here friday 
in a communique issued on the eve of the annual economic summit 
presidents hosni mubarak of egypt carlos andres perez of venezuela 
and abdou diouf of senegal joined with indian prime minister rajiv 
gandhi in saying 
we believe that steps must be taken to organize a summitlevel 
meeting as soon as possible with a view to discussing global 
economic and environmental questions of mutual interest 
mitterrand told the four that he was ready to take the steps 
necessary to bring about the project said presidential spokesman 
hubert vedrine 
but vedrine said mitterrand did not intend to ask the other 
nations participating in the economic summit west germany canada 
italy japan the united states and britain to decide on the 
request for a major conference among the developed and undeveloped 
nations 
this is not something for the immediate future vedrine told 
a press conference 
the four leaders representing nations in africa the mideast 
south america and asia said the proposed conference should mark the 
beginning of a consultative process between leaders from the 
developed and developing world 
the call for a summit among the leaders of the developed and 
undeveloped nations was the first publicized result of some 20 
bilateral meetings as well as informal lunchtime conversations among 
the leaders of 34 nations gathered here for the summit and the 
bicentennial celebration of the french revolution 
during their 15th annual economic summit this weekend the 
participants are expected to address the problem of the 12 
trillion debt that has stunted the developing worlds growth for 
more than a decade 
both mitterrand and treasury secretary nicholas brady are 
expected to push for partial forgiveness of third world debts in 
exchange for guarantees of repayment of the balance 
officials said mubarak discussed the issue with president bush at 
a luncheon at the elysee palace for almost three dozen heads of 
state and government attending the french revolution bicentennial 
events 
gandhi who sat next to margaret thatcher raised the issue with 
the british leader 
the developing nations leaders made their pitch for the ear of 
the richer nations at a time when the industrialized countries are 
steeped in a sense of economic optimism with the economic woes that 
dominated previous summits apparently under control 
summit host mitterrand to whom the communique was addressed has 
cast himself as a champion of poorer nations and announced in may 
that france would forgive debts totalling 25 billion owed by 35 
african nations 
in his response to the four leaders mitterrand expressed his 
appreciation of this idea which is in line with his ongoing action 
in view of restarting the dialogue between the worlds rich 
and poor nations his spokesman said 
the united states too announced earlier this month it would 
forgive the debt of the poorest nations of subsaharan africa

a bank says its considering going after a cut of 
the 6 million lottery jackpot won by the husband of a former 
employee who cheated the bank 
our attorneys are examining possible options said beth 
smith spokeswoman for first interstate bank of denver were 
exploring in light of her recent good fortune our options to 
recover some of our losses that she caused 
the jackpot was won this week by william romero whose wife 
darlene a former bond trader for the bank pleaded guilty in 
december to federal charges of making false entries in bank ledgers 
to make it appear the bank was profiting from her bond trades when 
it in fact was losing money 
mrs romero was placed on five years probation and ordered to 
pay 12000 restitution 
the purported profits brought her 66000 in commissions before 
she was fired from her job which carried a 60000 annual salary 
first interstate says the scheme cost it 35 million in 1987 
it isnt clear if the bank can tap romeros winnings for his 
wifes actions because state lottery rules require the money be paid 
directly to the winner said marlene desmond a lottery spokeswoman 
the couple has declared bankruptcy 
mrs romeros lawyer scott robinson said he would oppose any 
move to go after the winnings at the time of the sentencing 
thats all the money she had he said they cant take it away

china sentenced an office worker to 10 years in 
prison thursday for telling an american television crew that the 
military massacred thousands of people in its attack on 
demonstrators in tiananmen square 
an intermediate court in the northeast port city of dalian found 
xiao bin 42 guilty of spreading counterrevolutionary rumors 
it deprived him of all political rights for three years 
the national evening television news showed xiao a junior 
section chief in a rubber factory being led by police into the 
court to receive the verdict 
xiao in an interview with an abc television crew said 20000 
people were killed in the military assault to recapture tiananmen 
square from students demonstrating for democratic reforms in an 
emotional statement he told abc that military tanks had run over 
people and troops had shot to death people wounded by beatings or 
gunfire 
china central television apparently intercepted the unedited 
video as abc sent it by satellite to its new york headquarters 
the staterun television subsequently broadcast the interview and 
urged viewers to help find the man two women reported him within 
hours and he was arrested june 11 the women were commended and 
given cash rewards 
abc said it was deeply distressed over the use of its tape 
and began covering the faces of students it interviewed 
china denies anyone was killed on tiananmen square it says about 
200 civilians were killed as troops battled rioters who threw stones 
and firebombs to stop them from reaching the square 
chinese sources and western diplomats have said up to 3000 may 
have died when troops opened fire on unarmed protesters 
earlier thursday the foreign ministry denied china has become a 
diplomatic outcast because of the bloody events at tiananmen a 
foreign ministry spokeswoman said most nations support chinas tough 
measures to eliminate political dissent 
spokeswoman li jinhua asked at a weekly briefing how china 
reacts to the outpouring of international criticism said your 
assessment is different from mine 
the fact is that there are only a few countries who are 
interfering in chinas internal affairs the majority of countries 
have expressed their understanding sympathy and even support for 
us 
she repeated chinas protests to france for harboring wanted 
dissidents wuer kaixi and yan jiaqi and said france was guilty of 
flagrant violation of international law and the norms governing 
international relations 
most strong criticism has come from the west although some 
communist countries such as hungary and yugoslavia also have 
deplored the loss of life in the tiananmen attack 
the only countries to support chinas crackdown have been 
hardline communist states such as north korea romania and east 
germany most third world countries have said only that they have no 
wish to interfere in chinas internal affairs 
on wednesday premier li peng and new communist party chief jiang 
zemin told a gathering of ambassadors and diplomats they must 
increase their work in explaining the truth to counter rumors of 
western reports jiang said the diplomats must help foreign 
friends get rid of their misunderstandings of recent events in 
china 
chinese authorities also tried to present their version of events 
thursday at a seminar with foreign tour agents in which they handed 
out copies of a government report that condemned the studentled 
protests as counterrevolutionary and carried pictures of soldiers 
burnt and beaten bodies 
the travel agents invited to beijing as china seeks ways to 
salvage its nearly defunct tourist industry agreed that beijing 
must either lift martial law or reduce the military presence before 
it can expect foreign tourists to return 
china earned 2 billion in hard currency from tourism last year 
beijing also has lost several major international conventions 
including a meeting of the world trade centers association that was 
scheduled for september 
chinas representative zhang ming expressed great regret 
thursday over the associations july 5 decision to change the site 
of the 23nation conference to geneva 
he said china has been preparing for the annual meeting for a 
year and that social order in beijing has returned to normal and 
will be further stabilized the official xinhua news agency reported 
we will unswervingly carry out the policy of reform and opening 
and our trade and economic relations with other countries and 
regions will further develop all foresighted economists and 
entrepreneurs can see this zhang said

the environmental protection agency said 
thursday it will add 52 military installations nuclear fuel 
facilities and nuclear laboratories to its list of the nations 
worst hazardous waste sites it gave no sign how much the required 
cleanups will cost 
many of these facilities are much larger and more complex than 
other superfund sites with wide varieties of of hazardous and 
radioactive wastes epa administrator william reilly said in a 
news release announcing the additions 
because they are federal facilities owned by various agencies 
mostly the defense and energy departments the cleanups mandated by 
superfund legislation will come out of the agency budgets the epa 
said 
you will see budget demands ballooning in future years as 
remedies are selected and the cleanup process the expensive part of 
the process kicks in jon cannon the assistant epa administrator 
in charge of the superfund said 
the list includes such facilities as the feed materials 
production center in fernald ohio the oak ridge reservation in 
tennessee brookhaven national laboratory in new york savannah 
river nuclear military plant in south carolina and the lawrence 
livermore laboratory in california 
the picatinny army arsenal in new jersey a 100yearold 
munitions testing and storage depot is also listed 
most of the sites slated for addition to the national priorities 
or superfund list are military installation 
the 52 sites announced thursday are in 26 states california had 
the most sites 10 followed by alaska and florida each with 
four of the 52 sites 41 belonged to the department of defense 
nine to doe one to the transportation department and one to the 
federal aviation administration 
all the doe sites contain both hazardous and radioactive waste 
except the bonneville power administrations ross complex in 
vancouver wash 
those eight doe sites are brookhaven in upton ny lawrence 
livermore in livermore calif the fernald center the mound plant 
in miamisburg ohio savannah river in aiken sc oak ridge in 
oak ridge tenn monticello mill tailings in monticello utah and 
the idaho national engineering laboratory in idaho falls 
so far the priorities list has 1224 hazarous waste sites 889 of 
which are final and 335 are proposed federal sites account for 115 
of that total with 41 final and 74 proposed 
epa says the list will evenually include more than 200 federal 
facilities 
once a site is proposed for inclusion that proposal is open for 
public comment usually about 60 days the list then becomes final 
according to epa officials at a news briefing the first step 
once a site makes the list is a period of study and negotiations 
lasting up to two years to determine a cleanup course federal law 
requires that actual cleanup work begins no more than 15 months 
later 
states and concerned citizens of the states as well as the epa 
may intervene to make sure the cleanup proceeds as scheduled 
the epa officials noted that the defense department had 500 
million in cleanup money in its budget proposal for fiscal 1990 but 
they refused to comment on whether the funds would be adequate 
we have not engaged in budgeteering relating to these 
cleanups said cannon cannon did say there were government 
accounting office estimates that the cleanup of doe facilities would 
cost between 80 billion and 115 billion 
the problem with time and cost estimates he said is we dont 
know what the ultimate remedies are going to be 
the epa says that to speed up the negotiations over the 
individual site cleanups it is asking to increase the number of its 
specialized superfund fieldworkers from 34 to 116

one hundred and ninetynine years ago the marquis 
de la fayette gave the key to the bastille to president george 
washington on thursday the americans gave it back well for a 
week anyway 
the bastille was the central paris prison stormed by the populace 
on july 14 1789 that action became the symbol of the french 
revolution 
the bastille later was destroyed but the marquis who served as 
a general under washington during the american revolution made a 
gift of the key as a tribute which i owe as a son to my adopted 
father as an aide de camp to my general as a missionary of liberty 
to its patriarch 
the key has hung in the central corridor of washingtons virginia 
home mount vernon since the end of his presidency 
the key was presented to president francois mitterrand on 
nineday loan by eugenia seamans regent of the mount vernon ladies 
association a nonprofit organization that has owned and operated 
mount vernon since 1858 
the large iron key will be displayed through july 22 at the new 
paris opera on the place de la bastille in central paris next to 
where the prison once stood as part of frances bicentennial 
celebrations 
the very brief ceremony was held at the elysee palace immediately 
after the 40minute meeting between mitterrand and president bush 
here for the bicentennial festivities and to attend the summit of 
the seven major industrial democracies

the federal communications commission on 
thursday approved new rules that will allow thousands of fm stations 
serving small communities to double their signal strengths and reach 
larger audiences 
the commission in a 30 vote said socalled class a fm stations 
could boost their power from the present limit of 3000 watts up to 
6000 watts 
the commission said the increased power will allow these stations 
to provide better service to their listeners without causing 
interference problems with other stations 
the commission also revised the distances by which class a 
stations must be separated from other stations in order to limit 
interference the current separation is about 65 miles 105 
kilometers while the new separation will be about 71 miles 115 
kilometers effective oct 2 
the area covered will be 40 percent greater said jay 
jackson an official in the fccs mass media bureau 
existing stations that do not meet the revised separation 
requirements will be grandfathered and will be allowed to 
relocate their antennas or request permission to use directional 
antennas jackson said 
there are more than 2000 class a fm stations nationwide the 
most numerous of the fccs seven classes of fm stations and those 
which have the smallest service areas the largest fm stations have 
signals with 100000 watts or more 
the commission said the small communities to which class a 
channels were originally allotted have grown over the years while 
the coverage of these stations has remained unchanged 
fcc chairman dennis patrick expressed concern about the 
commission being hit with a wave of applications from stations that 
need permission to boost their signal strength he said the current 
backlog was six months in processing such applications and that it 
could increase to 18 months under the crush of new filings 
he said he hoped congress will allocate additional funds to the 
agency to handle the expected glut 
but we should not forgo good policy decisions because it will 
strain bureau resources patrick added 
he acknowledged that some fm stations had asked that the rules be 
applied in a blanket fashion rather than on a selective basis 
patrick said a blanket approach would have caused too many 
interference problems 
we have not granted all the latitude that was requested he 
said 
to allow many stations to increase their power without delay the 
commission said it will publish a list of existing class a stations 
that will be able to boost their signal without interfering with 
other stations it estimated that about 500 stations will be on the 
list 
licensees who can increase their power with simple technical 
changes will be allowed to do so on or after dec 1 the commission 
said provided that the changes will not subject workers or 
residents to hazardous levels of radio frequency energy radiation

antiapartheid groups unsure 
how to react to talks between president pw botha and black leader 
nelson mandela reversed course thursday and said the meeting was a 
positive development 
we do not condemn the meeting at all mandelas wife winnie 
was quoted as saying thursday by the independent south african press 
association for us to get to the negotiation table we have to 
start somewhere 
neither botha nor his heir apparent national party leader fw 
de klerk has commented on the july 5 meeting at the presidential 
residence in cape town 
antiapartheid groups including mandelas african national 
congress initially dismissed the talks as government propaganda 
that involved no shift in policy 
but in a statement wednesday mandela appeared to welcome his 
chance to talk with botha 
i only would like to contribute to the creation of the climate 
which would promote peace in south africa the jailed 70yearold 
activist said i would also like to confirm that my release is not 
an issue at this stage 
the statement was mandelas first since 1985 that was approved by 
the government for public release 
member of parliament helen suzman a longtime apartheid foe had 
lunch with mandela on thursday but would not disclose anything he 
said except he told me he was pleased to have met president 
botha 
she had not seen him since august when he was being treated in 
hospital for tuberculosis she said he described his health as good 
and he was in very good spirits he keeps fit with the help of an 
exercise bicycle and he is visited regularly by his doctor she 
said 
antiapartheid leader frank chikane appeared with mrs mandela on 
sunday and said the meeting was political mischief intended to 
sow confusion in the minds of black people 
the south african council of churches which chikane leads said 
wednesday it was a calculated attempt by the government to make 
maximum political gain 
however chikane said thursday i welcome mr mandelas 
commitment to contribute in any way possible to the creation of a 
climate which will promote peace in south africa 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu said mandelas statement was 
remarkably statesmanlike and should dispel the belief among many 
south african whites that mandela is a socalled terrorist 
white south africa is going to be quite quite amazed when they 
get to hear him speak for himself tutu said 
the outlawed african national congress dismissed the meeting 
monday as a public relations exercise it has not commented 
publicly on mandelas statement 
mandela wants peace said the frontpage headline in die 
burger a progovernment afrikaanslanguage newspaper mandela 
peace by dialogue said the citizen a progovernment 
englishlanguage daily 
such headlines were considered unthinkable until recently both 
newspapers regularly referred to the african national congress as a 
terrorist organization 
there is something oriental in the way mandela has turned 
weakness into power said the antiapartheid business day the 
leading financial daily 
he has achieved much by doing virtually nothing forcing his 
jailers progressively to ease the conditions of his release the 
editorial added it is not too much to say that the government is 
now the prisoner of its prisoner it cannot escape his embrace 
the government has said mandela founder of the congress 
guerrilla wing must renounce violence before he can be freed but 
botha this year has suggested those terms may be eased 
mandela serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the government has said he will not disavow violence 
until his organization is legalized and apartheid is dismantled

an addict who gave birth to two children 
with traces of cocaine in their system was convicted of drug 
delivery thursday under a law routinely used against drug dealers 
a derivative of cocaine which the defendant had introduced into 
her body passed into theirs through the umbilical cord circuit 
judge oh eaton jr ruled in the nonjury trial 
jennifer clarise johnson 23 faces up to 30 years in prison but 
prosecutor jeff deen said he would recommend that she continue in a 
drugtreatment program and receive a long period of probation 
the single mother is believed to be the first person tried in 
florida under the drugdelivery law for transmitting drugs to a 
newborn 
deen said the verdict is a new tool for prosecutors to put a 
stop to this great problem in this state and in the nation 
a key issue in the case was whether a newborn is a person after 
birth but before the umbilical cord is severed the state made that 
argument to justify prosecution under a law making it a felony to 
deliver drugs to minors 
the judge agreed 
i am convinced and find that a child who is born but whose 
umbilical cord has not been severed is a person within the intent 
and meaning of florida law the judge said he also ruled that the 
term delivery includes passage of cocaine through the umbilical 
cord after birth eaton said 
ms johnson refused to comment defense attorney jim sweeting 
said he would appeal noting the judge invited review by appellate 
courts and the legislature 
sweeting said the ruling was a signal to pregnant addicts to 
avoid prenatal care and to give birth to their babies outside of a 
hospital i think what we found today is that having a babys a 
crime for pregnant addicts he said 
but judge said he believed the opposite to be true that 
pregnant addicts are being put on notice that they have a 
responsibility to seek treatment 
ms johnson gave birth to a boy in 1987 and a girl in january 
her aunt and mother care for the children who are seemingly 
healthy ms johnson lives at a drug treatment center in apopka 
sweeting had argued that the law was being bent to punish his 
client belatedly for her drug addiction and that the drugdelivery 
law was not meant for mothers fetuses or newborns 
this is a social policy issue sweeting told eaton lets 
leave those issues to those elected to resolve them in the florida 
legislature 
arguing that a mother and child did not constitute two separate 
people at birth sweeting said ms johnson did not physically 
deliver cocaine to her children if it happened he said it was 
done by osmosis

a house committee on thursday approved 
expansions in the medicaid healthcare program for the poor that 
would cost the federal government about 4 billion over five years 
the expansions would bring into the federalstate program many of 
the pregnant women infants and children who are not now covered and 
have no private health insurance 
the house energy and commerce committee also unanimously approved 
a nonbinding resolution calling for the medicare program covering 
catastrophic illnesses to be made voluntary saying congress cannot 
ignore the outrage among the elderly over the program 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the panels health 
subcommittee said i think we need to make some changes in the 
catastrophic care program because so many people are upset 
i dont believe theres any other issue ive had people talk to 
me about said rep carlos moorhead rcalif 
rep michael bilirakis rfla who proposed the resolution 
called the program a catastrophic catastrophe under which many 
elderly citizens are being forced to pay for coverage they already 
have through their former employers and other sources 
the measures were approved 3013 as part of a huge 
deficitcutting package for fiscal year 1990 which begins oct 1 
the package now moves to the house budget committee 
the medicaid expansions would add about 183 million to the 
projected 38 billion cost of the program in the next fiscal year 
one change would require states to phase in over five years 
coverage of pregnant women and infants with incomes of up to 185 
percent of the federal poverty level the requirement would begin at 
130 percent of poverty by april 1990 which is what the bush 
administration has proposed but would rise to 185 percent by july 
1 1993 
a similar expansion has been proposed in the senate 
the committee shot down an attempt by rep sonny callahan 
rala to protect states like his own where the median income is 
low and a large proportion of residents live below the federal 
poverty line he said that under the proposed expansion more than 
half of alabamas newborn children would become eligible for 
medicaid at a prohibitive cost to the state which shares in the 
cost of the program 
another expansion would phase in coverage of children in families 
with incomes below the federal poverty level beginning july 1 
1990 with children born after sept 30 1983 as long as these 
children remained poor they would be covered by medicaid 
the committee also approved a change in the way physicians are 
paid under the medicare program replacing the current fee schedule 
with a new one based on such things as the skill training and time 
required to perform a service the fee structure is intended to 
correct inequities in the current system that reimburses specialists 
like surgeons and ophthalmologists at higher rates than general 
practitioners and internists whose services are mainly cognitive 
the house ways and means committee has approved a similar plan 
but included another change that would set an annual target for 
medicare spending on physicians under the target physician 
reimbursement rates could be lowered to recoup overspending of the 
target 
the different versions are expected to be worked out in a 
conference committee later

congress opened hearings on the supreme courts 
flagburning decision thursday with one lawmaker foreseeing 
violence if the decision isnt overturned and another decrying 
shameful and crass demagoguery by those trying to amend the 
constitution 
we have to take action otherwise people will be burning flags 
throughout the country on every holiday occasion said rep gv 
sonny montgomery 
if we dont do something i fear americans and especially 
veterans groups are going to stop the desecration of the flag in 
their own way and people are going to get hurt he said 
montgomery is cosponsor with house gop leader bob michel of an 
amendment endorsed by president bush to overcome last months 54 
decision by the court the justices said burning the flag was a 
constitutionally protected form of political dissent 
sen howard metzenbaum a liberal democrat from ohio took strong 
issue with those supporting a constitutional amendment 
no amendment in our history has restricted individual 
freedom he said this is not the time to break faith with two 
centuries of tradition 
metzenbaum said the court ruling had triggered a crude form of 
political oneupmanship a crass competition about who loves the 
flag more shameful and crass demagoguery all with a cold eye 
toward the next election 
many politicians have been scrambling to embrace the flag issue 
since the courts ruling 
bush quickly called for a constitutional amendment to overturn 
the ruling but leading congressional democrats have been pushing 
instead for a law that would address the issue without altering the 
constitution 
the argument played out thursday at a hearing by the house 
constitutional law subcommittee the opening shot in congress over 
what is sure to be an extended debate 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee urged the house panel to approve legislation like his own 
bill which could take effect almost immediately a constitutional 
amendment would require approval by the states after congress acted 
but supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment said they 
doubted anything short of that would succeed 
we believe there is no quick legislative fix said michel 
montgomery dmiss chairman of the house veterans affairs 
committee said the subcommittee should swiftly approve the 
amendment instead of tinkering with legal nuance which might still 
offend the court 
but subcommittee chairman don edwards dcalif urged his 
colleagues to be cautious 
the flag is sturdy flying proudly through every fierce battle 
of every war and through times of social upheaval he said the 
constitution however is fragile and can be amended by the votes of 
legislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment 
edwards told reporters after the hearing that he believed more 
lawmakers were becoming leery of a constitutional amendment 
opponents of an amendment hope that by swiftly passing legislation 
on flag burning perhaps by the august recess they can further cool 
the fervor for an amendment 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he and other 
lawmakers were finding their constituents were opposed to flag 
burning but also concerned about a constitutional amendment 
i find it encouraging because it seems to me that people are 
calmly looking at the question of whether the constitution should be 
amended and i am glad that it is being examined with that calm 
foley said 
rep jim sensenbrenner of wisconsin ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said he would fight attempts in congress to 
obfuscate the issues with legal mumblejumble lawmakers should 
respond to the will of the people he said distributing a milwaukee 
journal article with a poll saying 75 percent of those surveyed in 
his state favor an amendment 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said the issue might be more 
complicated than it appears at first glance 
she held up for the television cameras various uses of the flag 
which might or might not be construed a desecration she included a 
picture of herself wrapped in the flag which appeared on the cover 
of ms magazine and one of barbara bush wearing a flag around her 
neck 
i really wonder how we know which of these are desecrations and 
which arent she said

millions chanting death to america 
and beating themselves in grief surrounded the golddomed tomb of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on thursday to end 40 days of mourning 
for the founder of the islamic republic 
his successor as irans religious leader president ali khamenei 
appeared in public for the first time since khomeinis june 6 
funeral and delivered a tirade against the terrorists of the 
united states and its allies 
the speeches by khamenei and other iranian leaders turned the 
religious ceremony into an rally against the united states israel 
and saudi arabia 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani seen as khameneis 
successor was cheered when he appeared on a podium some distance 
from the grave accompanied by bodyguards carrying automatic rifles 
khomeinis son ahmad and khomeinis elder brother ayatollah 
morteza pasandideh were also hailed by the crowd when they appeared 
on the podium 
ahmad 43 flanked by his weeping uncle said iran should stand 
firm against plots in the region against us an apparent 
reference to saudi arabias curb on iranians from making the annual 
pilgrimage to mecca that climaxed thursday 
as the representative of khomeinis family he declared the 
mourning period over 
iranian media monitored in cyprus said millions of people 
rhythmically thumping their chests and heads in a ritualized frenzy 
of grief packed an area 1 miles deep around the shrine in the 
beheshte zahra cemetery outside tehran 
there was no independent estimate of the crowd but aerial views 
shown on iranian television indicated it was as big as the gathering 
at khomeinis funeral which authorities estimated was attended by 
10 million people 
khomeini died june 3 at the age of 86 10 years after his islamic 
revolution toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
iranian tv showed swarms of wailing mourners pressing around 
khomeinis shrine which is considered sacred they believed 
khomeinis blessing and protection would be bestowed on anyone who 
touches the temporary square monument that has been constructed over 
khomeinis grave 
the official islamic republic news agency said 10000 people 
collapsed with heart problems or were injured in the suffocating 
throng another 10000 were overcome by the 110degree temperatures 
irna said 
the live broadcast from the cemetery 10 miles south of the 
capital showed those who had collapsed being handed by other 
mourners over the heads of the crowd to first aid teams waiting on 
the fringes iranian media reported many were in serious condition 
even after treatment at 50 medical stations set up along roads 
leading to the cemetery 
firefighters sprayed water on the people to cool them down as 
loudspeakers blared readings from the koran islams holy book 
many traveled from across the country before thursdays 
ceremonies to keep an allnight vigil around the shrine irna 
reported 
only lowranking officials from a few countries attended 
thursdays ceremonies major world leaders also shunned khomeinis 
funeral 
khamenei denied iran was behind the bombings in mecca on monday 
that killed one person and wounded 16 during the pilgrimage 
if exporting the revolution means exporting explosives and 
creating havoc among other nations then this accusation is far from 
the hands of the islamic republic he said 
exporting mischief and corruption belongs to america and 
other aggressive governments he declared 
the hands of the america and its underlings are stained 
with the blood of innocents they are the terrorists the islamic 
republic is absolved of these allegations 
thursdays scene was similar to the mass outpouring of grief at 
khomeinis funeral when at least eight people died and 11000 were 
injured as frenzied crowds struggled to catch a glimpse of his 
shrouded body 
but this time the authorities were better prepared and 
organization was more evident with medical tents a fleet of 600 
buses centers for lost children and enough food for 10 million 
this time mourners were also covered against death and injury by 
a special government insurance scheme 
irans staterun insurance companies announced that the 
equivalent of 13500 will be paid to the family of anyone killed or 
seriously injured in the service medical expenses of up to 2000 
also will be paid 
irna said 7000 workers toiled since the funeral to erect the 
monument over the grave and levelled a a 43acre area around it to 
accomodate the hundreds of thousands who gather there every day

if president bush lays down a major new 
challenge for american space exploration next week nasa wont be 
ready the new head of the national aeronautics and space 
administration said thursday 
todays nasa cant do it said richard h truly in his first 
news conference as nasas administrator 
we have been through several years of very marginal funding 
he said we have a lot on our plate and to take on new challenges 
would require buttressing the facilities and the people to do the 
job 
the national space society has urged bush to announce a national 
goal of establishing a settlement on the moon in his speech july 20 
commemorating the first landing on the moon 20 years ago just as 
president john f kennedy established a moon landing target nearly 
30 years earlier 
any new goal in whatever year is going to require adequate 
resources to do it said truly given the adequate resources i 
think nasa is very strong and i think that we have a nasa that can 
be built upon to take on major new challenges but ill tell you 
this todays nasa cant do it 
truly denied a published report that the national space council 
of which he is a member has decided to make a formal recommendation 
for such a major effort when bush returns from europe next week 
earlier thursday however vice president dan quayle briefed 
about a dozen congressmen about a major new initiative the 
council is considering 
they basically outlined three options said rep robert 
walker rpa the ranking republican member of the house space 
science subcommittee one for the united states to move ahead 
with a robotic program and gradually phase men out of the space 
program another to go back to the moon and then going from 
there to mars and third to take us directly to mars after the turn 
of the century 
walker said the council was trying to decide among the three 
options before making a recommendation to bush 
he said the preferred option as it was outlined to the 
congressmen is the mission that would take us back to the moon 
establish a permanent base some time after the first of the century 
and to mars within the first decade 
it will require doubling the size of nasa and the nasa 
budget walker said 
the space agency has asked for 13 billion in the next fiscal 
year 
truly said a new government ethics law that goes into effect on 
sunday along with a pay cap on senior executives has cost his agency 
several top managers and has created a very disturbing situation 
i think this ethics legislation has caused us to lose an 
inordinate number compared to the average he said 
there are people who have left who could have given us three or 
four more years of service and thats a crying shame he said 
he spoke a day after richard o aller head of nasas office of 
space operations quit suddenly the ninth highlevel agency 
resignation this year aller was the third to say publicly he is 
leaving because of the ethics law 
we know of a few others who are making their final decisions 
today and tomorrow literally truly said 
its not so much the number but the quality and experience of 
these people he said when 10 senior service executive people 
leave you they take with them 250 to 300 years of government 
leadership and experience when they walk out the door 
truly said it is an unhealthy situation to have a public 
service that people cant afford to work for thats not a good 
situation he said and its one we need to deal with

dubiel interviewed by telephone from the air force reserve 
headquarters in robins ga said the rescuers came from the 301st 
aerospace rescue and recovery squad based at homestead air force 
base on floridas east coast 
the florida unit composed of 235 reservists is one of three 
such rescue teams based around the country the others are based 
near detroit mich and near portland ore he said 
the three squads have racked up more than 400 military and 
civilian saves or rescues over the past 10 years dubiel said 
theyve been trained to bring em back alive he said 
we do all kinds of things we search for lost hikers on 
mountaintops we provide standby rescue support for the space 
launches dubiel said from the florida base the crews are 
regularly called to assist the coast guard in the atlantic and the 
caribbean he said 
the parachutists are specially trained to dive into the ocean to 
make their rescues and not only do the resuers have to be trained 
medically to assist victims in distress they have to know how to 
pull them from the water pluck them off a mountian if they have 
to dubiel said they have to be in super condition

is to augment the air force in crises and in peacetime and provide 
backup and daily support to the military force dubiel said

who dove into the water only the copilot is a parttime reservist

the coast guard has released a taiwanese 
fishing vessel held in midway island after taiwan agreed to 
prosecute its captain and crewmembers on charges of illegal driftnet 
fishing and trying to bribe us personnel a state department 
official said thursday 
we have assurances from the president and prime minister of 
tawian that both counts will be prosecutued to the maximum extent 
possible under their laws said ed wolfe the departments 
ambassador for oceans and fisheries 
the ta chieh no 3 left for taiwan on saturday after being 
detained at midway for several weeks while the state department and 
taiwanese foreign ministry worked out details of its release and the 
prosecution 
a coast guard party suspecting illegal fishing boarded the ta 
chieh no 3 with permission on july 6 and was offered gold money 
alcohol and sexual favors in return for ignoring the violations 
when the bribes were turned down coast guard officials said the 
vessels captain ordered the boarding party to leave 
us personnel were allowed to reboard the ship two days later 
and found a ships log that indicated the vessel had been fishing in 
prohibited waters for at least three years 
the midgett then escorted the ta chieh to midway while the two 
nations negotiated over its release and the prosecution of the 
captain and crew 
state department officials had previsouly said the incident 
helped prompt the taiwanese to the negotiating table and eventually 
led to a tentative monitoring and enforcement agreement for north 
pacific driftnet fishing 
the agreement will allow us officials to board tawianese 
vessels suspected of illegal fishing on the high seas and will 
require that all taiwanese driftnet vessels be equipped with 
satellite transponders in 1990

oldstyle swat teams havent worked so 
agriculture department scientists are trying new tactics to curb 
flies where the nations farms meet the cities 
weve seen instances all over the country where urban 
encroachment in agricultural areas has caused problems for 
homeowners and agricultural producers said ralph a bram of the 
departments agricultural research service 
cities are sprawling into the countryside at an estimated rate of 
900000 to 15 million acres a year he said thursday in an agency 
report and to the newcomers flies and barnyard odors arent part 
of their idyllic country dream 
some flies can travel great distances from manure piles or other 
barnyard breeding places to find targets the stable fly can migrate 
up to 135 miles 
bram is the national program leader for insects affecting humans 
at the agencys research facility in beltsville md 
we have to learn how to increase nonchemical fly control and 
how to make the save chemicals we have work better he said it 
goes beyond relying on screen doors sprays and swatters 
possible tactics include nonchemical baits in traps to lure 
flies natural predators such as wasps that prey on flies while in 
their pupa stage of development and natural organisms such as fungi 
and bacteria that attack flies in cattle feedlots 
the usda attack is directed at four main kinds of flies 
stable flies which have biting mouth parts and feed on blood 
house flies which secrete digestive enzymes onto their food 
then suck up both enzymes and food 
horn flies which bother only livestock on pastures and 
rangeland 
face flies also pests of livestock but an annoyance to 
homeowners in the fall 
stable flies and house flies from farms are the major problem 
species for homeowners said gustave d thomas an entomologist and 
research leader at the agencys midwest livestock insects research 
laboratory lincoln neb 
in the united states the stable fly is estimated to cost 400 
million annually in damage to cattle he said 
its hard to put a dollar value on the damage caused by the 
house fly but worldwide this fly may rank in the top 10 insect 
problems because it can transmit a lot of diseases

about 12000 striking siberian coal miners agreed 
thursday to return to work after the government agreed to provide 
better work and living conditions mine officials and strikers said 
the twoday strike began tuesday at all five mines in 
mezhdurechensk prompting communist party and coal ministry 
officials to rush to the western siberian town of 107000 to settle 
the dispute the communist party newspaper pravda said 
strikers said thursday they were satisfied with government 
concessions that included better nightshift pay said victor 
ivanov a member of the government commission negotiating with the 
strikers 
strikes are becoming more common in the soviet union where they 
once were considered a western phenomenon brought on by capitalist 
exploitation of workers strikes used to be brutally repressed and 
hushed up but this year miners strikes have generally ended within 
days with government concessions 
nightshift workers at the shevyakov mine began the strike 
monday and it spread tuesday to about 12000 workers citywide 
pravda said 
the newspaper described the strikers demands sympathetically 
including calls for roundtheclock cafeteria service meat and 
sausage for underground workers free soap one free towel per month 
and a quilted jacket in winter 
the strikers 30 demands included economic independence for the 
mines extended vacations for underground workers and improved food 
and housing the labor daily trud reported 
calls for greater financial independence of individual mines and 
for increased nightshift pay were among those immediately granted 
said alexander kolmagorov a worker at the shevyakov mine 
requests for better food supplies and housing will take more 
time kolmagorov said by telephone from the mines strike 
headquarters 
people are back at work ivanov said all their demands are 
legal and are being decided most of them are satisfied but some 
will take time 
trud said the demands resulted from long years of neglect by 
authorities interested only in coal production and not in the 
miners needs 
mezhdurechensk about 1600 miles southwest of moscow produces 
30 million tons of highquality coal per year trud said 
in a bitter letter trud published in january mezhdurechensk 
miners complained that 10000 families are waiting for apartments 
hospitals and clinics are as crowded as anthills with patients 
waiting a week or more to see a doctor and schools are overcrowded 
the situation was aggravated when the ministry recently took away 
two housing complexes from miners to accommodate other workers trud 
said 
a top soviet official said in may that new legislation is being 
drafted that will give unions the legal right to strike 
similar strikes were reported in march and april in the urals 
mountain city of vorkuta and the siberian city of norilsk but both 
ended without incident

gov michael s dukakis cut nearly half a billion 
dollars from the state budget thursday in a move he said was made 
necessary by miscalculations mistakes and misinformation 
he said the needy would be hurt the most and he renewed his call 
for a tax increase 
the spending cuts in the 123 billion budget include a 210 
million reduction in aid to cities and towns a freeze in welfare 
benefits and a 62 million cut in public and higher education 
spending 
dukakis whose states budget problems have called into question 
the massachusetts miracle he touted during his democratic run 
for the presidency had argued for six months for tax increases to 
avoid such cuts 
the house has given initial approval to a 744 million tax 
increase but that is a temporary twoyear hike that only pays 
leftover bills from the fiscal year that ended june 30 the cuts 
made by dukakis are for the new fiscal year 
the state constitution effectively requires a balanced budget 
all of us in state government have arrived at this unhappy 
moment through a combination of miscalculations mistakes and 
misinformation dukakis said 
im disappointed in myself for not being more effective and 
persuasive im disappointed in the legislatures failure to send me 
a balanced budget im disappointed in all of us who have let the 
talkmasters and the columnists define our values our commitment to 
public service our commitment to each other 
the mood was somber as dukakis outlined the cuts before about 700 
state employees lobbyists and others who packed a statehouse 
auditorium 
this state is bankrupt and somebody better realize it 
worcester mayor jordan levy said afterward the democratic party 
is going to be finished business in massachusetts 
dukakis insisted the legislatures budget understated expenses by 
about 351 million and overestimated revenue by 140 million he 
used his lineitem veto authority and his power to withhold funding 
to cut the budget 
targets of cuts include human services aid for the mentally ill 
environmental programs and the state aids program 
of the 491 million in vetoes and conditional cuts that would 
be restored if money becomes available the 210 million local and 
school aid reduction is most likely to generate controversy 
communities depend on the state for about 40 percent of their 
revenue for everything from schools to police and fire protection 
barbara anderson head of citizens for limited taxation said of 
higher taxes it isnt going to happen there arent going to be 
any more taxes than theyve already done

a 23 million fraud and tax evasion case 
against the church of scientology international has been sent to a 
national court after a district judge ruled it was too big for his 
jurisdiction court sources said thursday 
scientology president heber jentzsch and 10 others arrested in a 
police raid on a madrid hotel in november remain free on bail 
pending formal charging in connection with the case 
jentzsch now in the united states must report to court 
officials july 18 the sources said 
in a 41page court order issued wednesday madrid 21st district 
court judge jose maria vazquez honrubia said his ninemonth 
investigation showed that scientology officials in spain had 
violated 13 laws 
the spanish justice ministry twice has denied the church status 
as a religious entity 
the accusations included massive fraud document forgery 
operating without a license illicit association and several public 
health violations 
several churchrelated organizations including the drug 
rehabilitation program narconon were named in the court order 
which vazquez honrubia remanded to the investigative division of the 
national court 
the national court must now decide whether to accept the case if 
it refuses the supreme court will decide which court has 
jurisdiction 
a lawyer for three of the accused said he was pleased the case 
would be in the hands of another less obsessed judge 
the accusations reflect religious prejudice and are closer to 
science fiction than penal reality said the lawyer luis 
rodriguez ramos 
lawyers for jentzsch and the others have filed several complaints 
of bias against vazquez honrubia who drew national attention for 
his handling of the case after the nov 20 1988 arrests 
vazquez honrubia said the investigation was far from complete 
police arrested 71 people in the raid 60 of whom were released 
by the judge after questioning jentzsch and the others spent 20 
days in jail before vazquez honrubia agreed to free them dec 10 on 
a combined bail of 11 million 
the court document described the church of scientology and its 
sister organizations as making up a multinational dedicated to 
sales of goods and services courses and classes 
the judge said the organizations promise mental and physical 
health based on totally unscientific theories in order to obtain 
growing sums of money from captive adherents 
the order said the organizations defrauded spanish tax 
authorities of the equivalent of 171 million between 1985 and 1988 
it also said investigators received complaints against the groups 
from 95 people in 10 spanish provinces alleging personal and 
material damages totaling 632000 
at the time of the arrests vazquez honrubia blocked church bank 
accounts holding 900000 
the church of scientology founded in the 1950s by american 
science fiction author l ron hubbard is based on hubbards 1949 
book dianetics the modern science of mental health

britains foreign secretary met with a palestine 
liberation organization official thursday and urged the plo to 
follow a moderate line despite disappointing moves in israel 
the foreign office reported 
it said sir geoffrey howes 10minute meeting with bassam abu 
sharif was the first between a british cabinet officer and a senior 
plo official 
sharif told reporters afterward it was a very important 
political meeting especially at this delicate moment in the middle 
east due to the decisions taken by the likud party giving a blow to 
peace efforts 
last week the rightwing likud bloc of israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir set new israeli conditions for elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip they are expected to make 
palestinian acceptance of the elections less likely 
israels deputy foreign minister benyamin netanyahu said in a 
television interview the howesharif meeting was a setback not 
only for genuine peace in the middle east but for british 
policy against terrorism 
despite the its public renunciation of terrorism and recognition 
of israels right to exist he said the plo supports terrorist 
activity and openly declares in the middle east that it plans to 
destroy the jewish state 
the board of deputies of british jews said it had strongly 
protested to howe 
sharif was invited last week to confer with minister of state 
william waldegrave whom he last met in may after 35 minutes with 
waldegrave he was taken to see howe 
a foreign office spokesman said the purpose was for howe to 
encourage the plo to stick to its moderate policy despite the 
disappointing outcome of the likud meeting and the rising tide of 
violence in the occupied territories 
more than 550 palestinians and 35 israelis have been killed 
during a 19monthold uprising against israeli rule in the west bank 
and gaza 
likuds new conditions for elections which would choose 
palestinians to negotiate peace with israel demand that the 
uprising end before they are held and specify that palestinians in 
arab east jerusalem cannot participate

communist party officials who lack the gumption to 
respond to the passionate demands and complaints of soviet citizens 
should quit president mikhail s gorbachev said in a speech 
reported thursday 
gorbachev offered that blunt opinion to leningrad communist party 
leaders wednesday just before they sacked their local party chief 
yuri f solovyov a candidate member of the ruling politburo 
passions are boiling on the streets but in many party 
organizations there is silence gorbachev said in his speech 
which was released by the official news agency tass thursday it 
is necessary to quickly blast out this silence this dangerous 
silence 
it is necessary to face life to go into life whoever doesnt 
have the strength whoever cannot find his place let him leave 
gorbachev said before anything else we must think of the party 
of perestroika of socialism 
perestroika or restructuring is gorbachevs campaign to 
overhaul soviet society and the economy 
although gorbachev never mentioned solovyov by name he was 
clearly referring to him when soviet election law was reformed to 
allow multiple candidates solovyov and other leningrad leaders 
engineered their parliamentary races to run unopposed then they 
suffered humiliating defeats when angry citizens crossed their names 
off ballots denying them the required 50 percent approval 
solovyov also ignored calls for his resignation and the issues 
raised during the election campaign which brought thousands of 
leningraders into the streets for public meetings 
in his speech gorbachev charged that the leningrad regional 
party committee failed to pay attention to the roots of peoples 
complaints in particular their demand for practical results from 
perestroika 
the party he indicated must defend itself through its actions 
as an example he cited local authorities for failing to improve 
a particular factorys working conditions he said the conditions 
were like those facing laborers in the time of peter the great who 
founded leningrad in 1703 
theyve been talking about ventilation for two years and they 
cannot put it right the dust is terrible the conditions 
unbearable its shameful 
well comrades for this you need billions gorbachev asked 
rhetorically 
so people look at this and say perestroika has been going on 
for four years and nothing has changed this is where we get 
irritation indignation and criticism he said where is their 
official union where is their party organization 
local authorities often blame moscow for failing to solve purely 
local problems which the central government doesnt handle and 
shouldnt handle he said 
gorbachev also told his audience not to fear new ideas a 
failing he had previously found in solovyov in april gorbachev 
reprimanded the leningrad party chief for complaining that the party 
was becoming a discussion club 
the current period of change gorbachev said wednesday brings 
forth diverse opinions which many people perceive as a threat to 
what we have achieved as a threat to perestroika comrades we must 
preserve our strength of spirit our tolerance our realism in 
evaluating the progress of perestroika in predictions for the 
future

the house ways and means committee voted 
thursday to speed up elimination of the tax deduction for interest 
on consumer loans in order to keep a tax break for bankers and 
corporate executives 
the quicker loss of the interest deduction will affect about 24 
million couples and individuals the other part of the bargain is 
expected to benefit a few dozen people committee aides said 
the panel working on a broad package of tax changes rejected an 
effort to delay the new surtax that older americans pay for 
catastrophic health insurance that change would have been financed 
in turn by cutting the tax on capital gains 
that combination of changes proposed by rep bill archer 
rtexas was defeated on a 2511 vote all democrats and republican 
reps william gradison of ohio and ray mcgrath of new york opposed 
it 
however committee aides said the panel appears ready to make 
some significant change in the financing of catastrophic insurance 
since many older americans have been vocal in their opposition to 
the present law aides also indicated there still is considerable 
sentiment among members to make some reduction in the capitalgains 
tax even though chairman dan rostenkowski dill has ruled out a 
reduction on the grounds that his democratic troops wont support it 
the committee completed action on the assembly of 53 billion 
worth of deficitreduction revenue increases that it is under orders 
from the budget committee to produce for the budget years that 
begins oct 1 however work will continue next week on a variety of 
other tax proposals including catastrophic medical insurance 
capital gains and child care 
by a voice vote the panel overturned a decision taken 24 hours 
earlier and eliminated from the package an increase in taxes on 
snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco the three products would have 
been taxed at 267 a pound snuff now is taxed at 24 cents pipe 
tobacco at 45 cents and chewing tobacco at 8 cents 
in place of those increases the committee voted to speed up 
collection of taxes from dividends received from mutual funds 
instead of being liable for taxes on the date a dividend is 
received a shareowner would have to pay from the time the dividend 
is declared 
the biggest single revenueraiser affecting corporations that 
use employee stockownership plans to avoid takeover and banks that 
lend to them was scaled back it was to finance part of that 
retreat that the committee agreed to a quicker end to deductions for 
interest on consumer loans 
under the 1986 tax reform legislation those deductions have been 
reduced year by year on their way to complete elimination this year 
only 20 percent of interest paid on loans for automobiles education 
and credit cards is deductible 
that had been scheduled to drop next year to 10 percent under 
the committees action the interest deduction would die at the end 
of this year 
the committee wants to reduce two existing tax benefits connected 
with esops under which workers are given shares of the companies 
where they are employed 
under the committees action thursday a banker that lends to an 
esop will be allowed to continue avoiding tax on half the interest 
earned from such loans only if the esop owns 30 percent or more of 
the corporation the same 30 percent test would be applied before a 
corporation could take a tax deduction for certain dividends paid on 
esop stock 
a second change would make the new rule effective on july 10 
more than a month later than the committee originally had agreed to 
this change would allow dozens of corporations that are in the 
processing of setting up esops to qualify for treatment under the 
old rules 
most of the provisions in the committees deficitreduction plan 
are technical changes that generally affect only corporations

prohibits additional defenses

are just willing to say nyet the soviets will eventually 
come to join with us in a transition to a different strategic

police thursday afternoon by the lawyer for one suspect the lawyer 
was not identified and police refused to confirm the report 
the news agency said the four arrests followed another ransom 
demand made early last month but did not give a figure or say 
whether any money had been paid 
none of the four suspects aged 2237 has been identified in 
keeping with dutch police practice two have been released pending 
charges the agency report said 
the thieves smashed a 6footwide hole in a window of the 
kroellermueller museum in a remote location in the middle of a 
large national park near the village of otterlo 
police stymied by an almost total lack of clues put the case on 
the back burner in march after several months of silence the 
thieves contacted museum director rwd oxenaar to demand the 
ransom 
on april 6 oxenaar received a telephone call at his home from a 
man who said the loom valued at 18 million to 22 million 
could be found in the trunk of a car parked nearby 
the painting wrapped in a blanket was found with only a few 
scratches so minute that officials first thought it had not been 
damaged at all 
a few days later a caller told oxenaar to have a driver standing 
by with the money but the ransom exchange fell through 
art experts had speculated the paintings would be held for ramsom 
because they are so wellknown that they would be virtually 
unsellable on the open market 
the final and most famous version of potato eaters also 
dated 1885 is on display at the vincent van gogh national museum in 
amsterdam the museum has the largest collection of works by the 
impressionist who lived from 1853 to 1890

the chairman of a senate narcotics 
subcommittee attacking the antidrug campaigns of the reagan and 
bush administrations as phony proposed a 120 million program 
thursday to help local police establish and expand drug intelligence 
units 
sen john f kerry dmass introduced legislation to provide 
direct aid to local police departments for computers electronic 
intelligencegathering equipment and added personnel for antidrug 
task forces 
its time we gave police officers the kind of support they 
deserve kerry said at a news conference we would be expanding 
the kind of police work which prevents drugrelated crime from 
happening in the first place 
the chairman of the senate foreign relations narcotics 
subcommittee said 63 million would go to state governments at 
least 500000 to each state for drug intelligence units and 
equipment about twofifths of that money would be passed on to 
cities with fewer than 100000 people 
the rest of the money 57 million would go directly from the 
justice department to big cities 
kerry said the drug intelligence act would provide an extra 
boost to local police departments at a time when their budgets are 
the tightest but their needs in fighting a real war on drugs are the 
greatest 
police drug intelligence units that already exist in major 
cities are important components in the war on drugs he said 
but even where these units exist they need upgrading and more 
equipment 
kerry deriding the antidrug efforts of republican 
administrations through the 1980s said the bush administration has 
spent only 500 million of the 27 billion congress allocated last 
year for the governments antidrug effort 
we dont have a real war on drugs today kerry said 
theyre talking out of both sides of their mouth its phony

france uncorked three days of bicentennial hoopla 
thursday by inaugurating a gleaming hightech opera house at the 
site of the bastille the despised prison where its revolution began 
president francois mitterrand president bush and their wives 
sat in frontrow balcony seats at the opera bastille for an opening 
concert featuring singers placido domingo and barbara hendricks 
also present were 32 other presidents and prime ministers who 
came to paris for this weekends celebrations of the revolutions 
200th anniversary and for the annual summit of the worlds seven 
richest countries 
sharpshooters were posted on rooftops and in windows of buildings 
surrounding the place de la bastille as the leaders arrived 
authorities have clamped tight and highly visible security around 
the capital this week 
later thursday more than 100000 people jammed into the large 
circular plaza for the beginning of the largest of about 30000 
outdoor popular balls around the country to celebrate bastille day 
on friday 
surrounding streets were packed with people of all ages enjoying 
the balmy summer night the air was filled with the smell of 
grilling sausages and the sounds of exploding firecrackers and 
accordion music pouring from a giant white tent opposite the new 
opera 
i usually prefer smaller parties but i wanted to come be part 
of the most popular of french celebrations said gilles driate 
from a southeastern suburb he then grabbed the hand of a surprised 
and delighted lady with gray hair and they danced away 
meanwhile mitterrand and his guests had a late dinner at the 
musee dorsay the spectacular museum of 19th century art converted 
from a train station 
earlier in the day at the opera bastille the political leaders 
were joined by a starstudded crowd including actress catherine 
deneuve tennis player yannick noah and nobel peace prizewinning 
author elie wiesel 
a rousing orchestral rendition of the marseillaise the french 
national anthem opened the show the 75minute program ended with 
an even more stirring version with all the performers joining in 
bush smiling broadly applauded enthusiastically as the show 
closed 
the visiting leaders earlier joined mitterrand in an outdoor 
ceremony honoring the declaration of the rights of man and the 
citizen proclaimed in 1789 
mitterrand was flanked by bush at the trocadero across the seine 
from the eiffel tower during the brief celebration of what many 
consider the chief legacy of the french revolution 
at the new opera house domingo miss hendricks and teresa 
berganza sang selections from french operas such as charlesfrancois 
gounods faust and camille saintsaens samson and delila 
frances georges pretre conducted the orchestra and chorus of the 
orchestre de paris in a work titled la nuit davant le jour or 
the night before the day the staging and the stark elegant 
decor were the work of american bob wilson the darling of french 
avantgarde theater 
the opera bastille was conceived early in mitterrands first 
presidential term as a muchneeded alternative to the ornate but 
inadequate palais garnier known worldwide as the paris opera 
from the start the project was beset with administrative 
political and financial problems and it even came close to being 
canceled 
designed by canadian architect carlos ott the huge 
glassandsteel building boasts stateoftheart sound lighting and 
staging technology including special acoustical fire curtains a 
movable proscenium and electronically controlled stage dollies that 
bring in sets for an entire opera in minutes 
the 2700seat main auditorium a contemporary blend of black 
and white with oakpaneled walls and hardwood floors was designed 
for acoustics 
expert opinion on the new hall was not all positive however 
music critic frank erikson of the weekly lexpress said he was 
terribly disappointed by the halls acoustics 
the voices do not project into the room he said the 
singers were standing at the edge of the stage and yet the sound was 
completely muffled this is quite serious 
the opera bastille which is shaped like an ocean liner was 
captainless until may when myungwhun chung of south korea was named 
musical director by pierre berge the financial wizard behind the 
yvessaint laurent fashion empire berge was chosen by mitterrand to 
oversee the project in its final days 
chung a softspoken but determined optimist known as a 
consummate artist fills the vacancy left in january when berge 
fired israeli conductor daniel barenboim for his high fees and 
elitist ideas about opera 
chung has promised to present the first production in february 
the opera bastille will close july 20 so the building can be 
finished 
the human rights celebration at the trocadero was a simple but 
dramatic reading of the 17 articles of declaration adopted by the 
french national assembly on aug 26 1789 
punctuating the reading was a group of 48 children singing the 
song of joy a hymn composed for the occasion the choir members 
who have been rehearsing since july 1 were from the united states 
poland finland the soviet union west germany france japan 
rwanda togo australia canada mexico hungary lebanon and the 
philippines 
the three american singers were from the phoenix ariz boys 
choir we wanted to symbolize peace said harvey smith director 
of the phoenix choir who helped train the paris group the 
children brought things from their world and shared them with those 
here today

a house committee voted thursday to levy 
licensing fees on hamradio operators and satellitelaunching 
companies and to increase fees on communications businesses to help 
reduce the federal budget deficit by 50 million 
the house energy and commerce committee also voted to outlaw 
obscene dialaporn messages on interstate and intrastate telephone 
calls and to restrict access to indecent dialaporn messages 
it adopted a new fairness doctrine that requires broadcasters to 
air opposing views on controversial public issues 
the committee attached the dialaporn and fairness doctrine 
motions to a budget reconciliation bill the 50 million in 
increased fees were to help congress meet the 110 billion deficit 
limit established by the grammrudman deficitreduction law for 
fiscal 1990 
under the committees bill existing licensing fees charged by 
the federal communications commission will go up an average of 126 
percent 
seventeen communications areas that were exempted will have fees 
for the first time ranging from 30 for an amateur radio license to 
70000 for a permit to launch a satellite said committee spokesman 
mike connolly 
fcc fines that have not been changed since 1934 also will be 
increased connolly said 
he said the vast majority of the 50 million will come from 
new fees with about a third of the money coming from private radio 
operations such a rural radio national paging services offshore 
radio and mobile and cellular phones 
minimum fees in nearly all cases will be 30 as opposed to 5 
currently the 70000 for satellites is the maximum other fees 
include a 6760 fee for a telephone company that requested an fcc 
hearing 
the dialaporn provision is in response to a supreme court 
ruling last month that invalidated a 1988 law that had outlawed the 
2 billion dialaporn business 
the court said indecent speech was protected by the constitution 
but that obscene speech was not 
the court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that is 
patently offensive purient and has no serious literary artistic 
political or scientific value 
connolly said the committees action takes the ruling of the 
court and works with those constitutional restraints it bans 
obsecne speech and it regulates indecent speech 
the bill requires telephone companies to block dialaporn calls 
to their customers lines unless a customer formally asks to have 
access to the service 
the fairness doctrine was added only after the committee voted 
358 against an amendment by rep tom tauke riowa to strip the 
provision from the bill 
tauke said the fairness doctrine a set of guidelines the fcc 
repealed in 1987 was unnecessary unconstitutional and made the 
bill veto bait at the white house 
the house and senate commerce committees both passed fairness 
doctrine bills in april president bush has indicated he would veto 
a fairness doctrine law and fairness doctrine proponents were not 
assured of enough votes to override a veto

tens of thousands of hungarians on 
thursday mourned longtime communist party leader janos kadar who 
died last week more than a year after being eased from power by 
reformers 
we came to thank him for what he did for us and the hungarian 
people said viktor segre who said he and his wife eva waited 
more than three hours to view kadars red and black shrouded casket 
lying in state at the central committee headquarters in budapest 
kadar 77 died on july 6 he is to be buried friday in a state 
ceremony attended by hungarys new leadership and delegations from 
the warsaw pact 
on thursday mourners many weeping and carrying flowers 
gathered in the late afternoon to pay their respects to kadar who 
took power as soviet troops crushed the 1956 antistalinist uprising 
in the 32 years before he was ousted by a new generation of 
reformers in 1988 kadar was conciliatory or ruthless by turns as he 
searched for consensus in party ranks 
but kadar gained respect at home and abroad by the 1970s after 
launching economic reforms and ushering in a new spirit of tolerance 
that was in stark contrast to the early years of his rule and many 
neighboring communist countries 
kadars legacy of stability and reform efforts appeared to have 
drawn many to the austere center of communist power in hungary 
bedecked on thursday with wreaths and floral displays in his memory 
he gave us peace and a sense of security said eva segre 
he got the country going again after 1956 and won international 
respect for hungary 
comrade kadar was a great man said an elderly woman who 
asked not to be identified she said she waited four hours and 
would have waited longer if i had to 
the line of those waiting to file through the hushed gallery of 
the central committee building stretched more than four city blocks 
hundreds clutched small bouquets of carnations and roses and many 
carried large wreaths 
in may 1988 kadar lost his post as party general secretary a 
year later he was removed as honorary party chairman and stripped 
of his membership in the policysetting central committee which 
criticized him for mistakes during his long rule 
although he ushered in economic reforms in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s kadar was increasingly blamed for an economic decline 
after the reforms stalled many in the party leadership viewed him 
as an obstacle to renewal in the country 
the communist partys reevaluation of the 1956 uprising as a 
popular revolt and the rehabilitation of imre nagy the prime 
minister who led it eroded the legitimacy of kadars rule for many 
nagy was executed in 1958 and was buried in an unmarked grave 
his remains were reburied in an elaborate ceremony june 16 that was 
attended by hundreds of thousands of hungarians 
under the leadership of a new generation of reformers hungary 
has embarked on an ambitious program of economic and political 
reforms designed to move the nation toward a market economy and 
closer ties to the west

sen chris dodd dconn said thursday that 
nicaraguas national elections next year will be fair and free and 
that its sandinista government deserves some credit for that from 
the bush administration 
dodd chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
latin america also said he expects significant progress in the 
latin american peace process at the aug 7 meeting of the regions 
presidents 
dodd returned early this week from a visit to the region and 
told a news conference the bush administration should be encouraging 
the process by rewarding the sandinista government for its progress 
the administration he said has characterized its policy toward 
nicaragua as one of carrots and sticks rewards when progress is 
made toward democratic reforms and sanctions when there are reverses 
at this point there have been no carrots offered dodd said 
you almost get the sense that the administration is disappointed 
that the nicaraguans have made progress in some areas 
asked for an example of positive steps taken by the sandinistas 
dodd cited the provisions made for election observers to be present 
in the country for a full six months before the balloting and for 
impromtu political rallies 
on paper it doesnt look bad he said i can see these 
words come back to haunt me in 10 months but on paper its not 
bad 
on another subject dodd sharply criticized the organization of 
american states for taking no action against gen manuel antonio 
noriega panamas military ruler who retained power in may after 
nullifying the results of presidential elections 
if the oas cannot be supportive on noriega i dont think we 
can get together on anything dodd said

patients of the states largest hospital company 
had to cross picket lines to see their doctors thursday as 1300 
nurses began striking for higher wages and guaranteed hours 
the strike left group health cooperative of puget sound with a 
nonunion staff capable of handling only onefifth of the normal 
patient load at its three hospitals 
about 130 patients were moved to other hospitals and 72 remained 
said phil nudelman the health maintenance organizations executive 
vice president and chief operating officer 
negotiations broke off shortly after midnight thursday and 
picketing began at 6 am at group health hospitals and clinics in 
five puget sound counties that include this city and tacoma 
picket lines were up at all group health centers except its 
specialty medical center which provides urology oncology internal 
medicine and other services sosne said 
the cooperative also runs 23 family medical centers and four 
specialty medical centers all the centers will be open and staffed 
by physicians and other staff nudelman said 
group health began hiring nonunion nurses and preparing to lay 
off nonnursing staff in preparation for whats expected to be a 
long strike nudelman said the layoffs were intended to save money 
diane sosne president of local 1199 of the national union and 
health care employees said the talks broke off because group health 
refused to compromise on key issues particularly staffing decisions 
nudelman said the cooperatives latest offer was still on the 
table and that a phone call was all that was needed to reopen talks 
our wage and benefit package would make group health nurses the 
best paid in the state of washington he said it would also 
give our nurses significant input into decisionmaking that directly 
affects their workplace the latest contract offer would boost 
yearly pay for a firstyear nurse to 27706 from 23000 based on 
a 40hour work week a nurse with 15 years experience would earn 
about 41000 up from 33000 
the nurses were seeking raises of 16 percent in the first year 
and 14 percent in the second managements offer amounts to 235 
percent over two years 
also at issue in the talks is the companys practice of cutting 
nurses hours when there are few patients in the hospital the 
nurses are seeking contract provisions to protect their income 
the company a health maintenance organization has about 370000 
members 
an hmo is a type of medical insurance plan that offers members 
treatment for a fixed monthly payment rather than reimbursing them 
on a pervisit basis

biologists on thursday used longhandled 
nets to scoop an endangered species of trout from a creek polluted 
with ash from a nearly beaten wild fire firefighters mopped up 
blazes in five other western states 
the gila trout lured into a clear section of diamond creek a day 
earlier were collected along a threequarter mile stretch and put 
in holding tanks on the sides of mules or horses to be taken 
eventually to an apache fish hatchery 
they are hoping to remove at least 300 of the fish from the 
creek and more if possible said andrea garcia a us forest 
service spokeswoman 
the creek was becoming choked by ash from a lightningcaused fire 
in gila national forest that burned more than 10000 acres before 
being contained on monday the blaze began june 30 and burned 50 
miles northeast of silver city 
the fire should be controlled in two to four days ms garcia 
said 
fires in arizona california colorado nebraska and utah were 
largely contained thursday firefighters mostly mopped up and 
monitored hot spots 
ash kicked up by the new mexico blaze had settled in diamond 
creek choking off oxygen and possibly boosting the waters 
alkalinity 
the netted fish were to be transported in 250gallon aerated 
tanks aboard two trucks to a hatchery run by the us bureau of 
indian affairs on the mescalero apache reservation in southcentral 
new mexico said ms garcia 
she said the fish are fairly hardy 
gila trout once were widespread in mountain streams in the gila 
river basin but timber cutting overgrazing irrigation and the 
introduction of rainbow trout have diminished their numbers 
the fish has been on the federal endangered species list since 
1967 
the rescue was undertaken by the state department of game and 
fish the us fish and wildlife service and the forest service 
in utah fire bosses took a waitandsee attitude thursday on the 
states only active wildfire a 100acre blaze in an inaccessible 
area of desolation canyon 140 miles southeast of salt lake city 
the fire was within a mile of an uintah and ouray indian reservation 
and threatened important deer and elk winter ranges said bureau of 
land management district manager gene nodine 
if the fire does make a major run we would have to wait until 
it reached a more accessible less hazardous area to actively 
suppress it he said 
humidity rose significantly in eastern utah helping firefighters 
subdue a 4500acre fire 28 miles from grand junction colo thirty 
miles to the northwest firefighters demobilized after battling a

sri lankan soldiers and police will 
take charge of law and order from indian troops in the northeast 
who then will be treated as an occupational army foreign minister 
ranjan wijeratne said thursday 
he said the takeover will occur july 29 the deadline president 
ranasinghe premadasa set for the pullout of 40000 indian troops 
deployed in sri lanka india is refusing to withdraw them 
a moderate tamil leader who supported the deployment of indian 
soldiers in sri lanka and a party colleague were killed in a colombo 
home thursday officials said 
in his comments thursday wijeratne said president ranasinghe 
premadasa would stick to the pullout deadline 
sri lankan army and police will come out of their barracks to 
maintain law and order in the north and east because after july 29 
the indian troops will be treated as an occupational army 
wijeratne said 
on wednesday indian prime minister rajiv gandhi said a pullout 
of the troops could only be decided through negotiations and had to 
be accompanied by increasing powers for the tamil government in the 
northeastern province the message was tantamount to refusing to 
withdraw the troops by premadasas deadline 
in a reply thursday premadasa said military action by the indian 
armed forces was unnecessary and prejudicial to a settlement by 
discussion and negotiation 
he said his government was willing to hold talks on the issue but 
the pullout and political issue were totally unconnected 
indian soldiers were deployed in sri lankas tamildominated 
north and east on july 29 1987 under an agreement between the two 
countries the indianmediated accord was aimed at ending a 
rebellion by tamil insurgents 
the rebels were to give up their weapons in exchange for limited 
autonomy in regions where they dominated and indian soldiers were to 
ensure peace 
but the peace plan fell apart after the largest rebel group the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam backed out and began fighting the 
indians smaller tamil groups surrendered and were voted to power in 
the provinces local elections last year but now accuse the 
government of not giving them enough power 
the moderate tamil leader who was killed was identified by an 
information department official as appapillai amirthalingam the 
62yearold leader of the tamil united liberation front the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said another party 
member was also killed and three people were injured 
in new delhi the united news of india news agency said 
amirthalingam and his colleague were killed by three gunmen 
belonging to the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the three gunmen 
were later shot and killed by amirthalingams bodyguards the news 
agency said 
india and sri lanka exchanged sharply worded letters after 
premadasa asked india on june 1 to pull out its soldiers by the 
second anniversary of the agreement the request followed talks in 
may between his government and the tamil tigers the first direct 
contact between the two sides since the insurgency began in 1983 
under the 1987 agreement indian soldiers took over law and order 
in the north and east and sri lankan troops were confined to their 
barracks 
india became involved in the troubles of the island nation off 
its southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million 
tamils for the rebel cause sri lankan tamils launched a war for a 
separate nation complaining of discrimination by the majority 
sinhalese community 
the predominantly hindu tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people and the buddhist sinhalese make up 75 percent 
also thursday officials announced that more than 40000 public 
transport workers ended a crippling monthlong strike after reaching 
a wage agreement with the government 
bus drivers clerks and mechanics of the stateowned transport 
company walked off their jobs on june 12 demanding higher wages 
but the government said the strike was sponsored by sinhalese 
militants using the wage issue to fuel civil unrest 
the militants say the government has been too soft on the tamils 
transport minister wijepala mendis said in a statement that the 
government would increase workers monthly salaries by 560 and 
give monthly back pay of 150 retroactive to january 1982

leave the government after the bush administration and american jews 
asked it thursday not to upset israeli peace proposals

intermediaries

thrown by arab nationalists or accidentally dropped by a police 
officer israel army radio said several suspects were detained but 
did not elaborate 
jerusalem police chief aryeh bibi said later the grenade was not 
of the type used by police and was not dropped by a policemen

abu sharif of the plo and urged the plo to follow a moderate line 
the foreign office reported it said the meeting was the first 
between a british cabinet officer and a senior plo official 
israels deputy foreign minister benyamin netanyahu called the 
meeting was a setback not only for genuine peace in the middle 
east but for british policy against terrorism 
peres spoke after labor ministers met wednesday night and decided 
to stay in the governing coalition if shamir reaffirms his 
commitment to the peace initiative 
labor party leaders recommended monday the party quit the cabinet 
to protest hardline conditions for peace talks with the 
palestinians the conditions including an end to the uprising 
before peace talks are held were adopted by shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc july 5 
labor leaders did not cancel a party vote on the issue set for 
next month but many ministers said a compromise was possible 
the labor move followed appeals from secretary of state james a 
baker iii and american jewish leaders for labor to stay in the 
government the state department denied it sought to intervene but 
israeli officials confirmed the appeals 
president bush said thursday the united states will not change 
its middle east policy he said israel should go forward with 
elections in which the 17 million palestinians of the occupied 
lands would elect representatives to negotiate with israel 
leading voices within likud said they wanted labor to stay and 
the peace plan remained intact 
netanyahu said if they want to leave its their business 
but added i dont think it would be proper at this moment 
shamir aide yossi ahimeir said the prime minister met with 
palestinian leaders from the occupied lands about the election plan 
and some observers said the meetings were timed to pacify labor 
there have been there are and there will be meetings with 
palestinians from the territories but there were no meetings 
with plo people or those linked or close to the plo ahimeir said 
israeli radio reported that plo spokesman ahmed abdelrahman said 
his organization has had direct contacts with israeli officials 
including a discussion with a messenger of defense minister yitzhak 
rabin and that shamir was aware of it 
shamir peres and rabin as well as the foreign and justice 
ministries denied direct or indirect contacts with the plo 
shamirs office director yossi benaharon dismissed such reports 
by describing the plo as the embodiment of cheating lies and 
obscenity

the senate on thursday approved an overhaul of 
the immigration system that would limit new arrivals to 630000 in 
each of the next three years and expand the number coming from 
western europe 
this bill not only carries forward and increases the present 
emphasis on family reunification it also opens opportunities for 
new immigrants with new skills said sen edward m kennedy 
dmass one of the bills sponsors 
the bill approved 8117 after two days of debate now goes to 
the house it was originally designed to cap immigration at 600000 
in each of the next three years but was expanded by 30000 visas 
before final passage 
the ceiling represents 136000 more visas than were issued in 
1988 but but critics say the bill still could reduce visas for all 
but the closest relatives of american citizens and permanent 
residents of the united states 
the senate approved a similar bill in 1988 but it died in the 
house 
the measure now goes to the house with kennedy and the measures 
cosponsor sen alan k simpson rwyo saying they are optimistic 
about the prospects this year 
lawmakers voted 7821 to expand the cap by 30000 visas a year 
following an emotional appeal from sen arlen specter rpa who 
recalled how his father fled the boot of the czar in 1911 and 
arrived in america with no rubles in his pocket he had to come 
steerage 
there is nothing magic to me about the number 600000 
specter said 
but senators fought back 5246 a move by sen rudy boschwitz 
rminn to expand by 40000 the number of brothers and sisters of 
american citizens that would be allowed into the country annually 
my heart is on the side of what sen boschwitz is doing sen 
paul simon dill said but he added that there is a saturation 
point with the american public and i want to be prudent as we move 
ahead 
simpson said it was time to face the unfortunate but hideously 
cold reality that there are many more people who want to come here 
than there is room or intent to accommodate them 
following intense floor skirmishing the senate did approve an 
amendment from sen richard c shelby dala that would force the 
census bureau to halt its practice of including illegal aliens in 
its official count 
sen jesse helms rnc said that under the current system 
states like california would gain a congressional seat at north 
carolinas expense because their populations are swollen with 
illegal aliens 
kennedy called the amendment flatly unconstitutional but 
lawmakers refused 5841 to kill it and eventually adopted it on a 
voice vote 
the legislation would reserve 120000 visas annually for those 
entering on a basis other than family ties 
that category includes 54000 visas subject to a point system 
giving credit for those with special skills needed by american 
industry but who do not have employers ready to sponsor them 
the senate judiciary committee voted 122 to delete the provision 
that would provide extra points to individuals who speak english 
simpson appealed to the senate in vain to restore the point system 
but lawmakers rejected the idea 5643 
english is the language of success he declared he said 
those who are unable to understand english will have a tough time 
obtaining jobs and urged lawmakers not to be swayed by sentimental 
portrayals as immigrants as the heart and soul of the american dream 
the heart and soul disappears when you cant get work he 
said 
simon however quoted a news clipping that said 13 of the 16 
valedictorians in bostons publish high schools this year were born 
in foreign countries and the majority apparently did not have 
english for a mother tongue 
simpson expressed frustration that the sentimenttinged debate 
appeared to be going against him 
you have snorted and ripped and rolled around in it and you 
have just given birth to a mouse he declared 
meanwhile the house approved 35844 and sent to the senate 
separate legislation to ease immigration of certain soviet and 
southeast asian refugees 
it would temporarily reestablish the legal status of soviet jews 
and evangelican christians as well as certain categories of 
vietnamese laotians and cambodians as persecuted without 
individuals having to prove it in their own cases that would aid 
them in obtaining standing as refugees 
the measure is opposed by the bush administration which contends 
it unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certain 
refugees and makes it more difficult to administer the us refugee 
program fairly 
those voting against the measure were sens john breaux dla 
dale bumpers dark robert c byrd dwva kent conrad dnd

illinois gov james r thompson the 
longestserving incumbent governor in the nation said thursday he 
will not seek a fifth term in 1990 
the announcement set off a political scramble for the governors 
seat but the 53yearold republican who was mentioned early in his 
political career as a presidential contender said he hoped his 
legacy would go far beyond the coming battle to succeed him 
i believe with all my heart that in most ways this is a better 
state with a better chance for the future than when i entered the 
governorship in january of 1977 said thompson who was near tears 
during a 30minute news conference at the state of illinois center 
thompson flanked by his wife jayne and their 10yearold 
daughter samantha said he chose to leave public life because he 
needed to provide for his family and sought the challenge of 
returning to the private sector as a lawyer or businessman 
thompson declined to rule out running for another office and 
said he could have won another term as governor 
my wife and daughter have told me they are willing to support a 
campaign for reelection but i am not willing at this time to ask 
them to do that thompson said my family and their happiness 
and security are more important to me than anything else in the 
world 
mrs thompson who spent a month earlier this year at the betty 
ford clinic in california undergoing treatment for alcoholism said 
she supported the decision and acknowledged that public life 
extracted a toll from the family 
i think its sometimes difficult to live your life in the 
public eye she said 
jockeying for position has already begun among possible 
candidates for next years primary race for governor at least three 
democrats and as many republicans are considered possible 
candidates with democratic attorney general neil hartigan and gop 
secretary of state jim edgar among top likely contenders 
though titular leader of the state gop and a backer of president 
bush the moderate thompson has frequently been at odds with fellow 
republicans on fiscal and social issues 
thompson was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate after 
his 1976 and 1978 victories made him one of the few republicans to 
buck the postwatergate wave that swamped many gop colleagues 
he first burst into the national spotlight during a fouryear 
tenure as the us attorney from 197175 when he sent several 
prominent allies of the late mayor richard j daley to prison on 
corruption charges 
passing up an offer to run against daley thompson instead 
claimed the gop gubernatorial nomination in 1976 and defeated 
daleybacked democrat michael howlett by a record 139 million votes 
he bested former democratic us sen adlai stevenson iii in his 
last two campaigns in 1982 by the narrowest margin in state 
history and again in 1986 to become the only fourterm governor in 
state history 
the son of a chicago physician thompson once autographed a 
highschool yearbook vote for me for president but he spent 
much of his early career in law as a cook county prosecutor a 
northwestern university law professor and an assistant state 
attorney general

a baby died thursday after being shot by 
her 6yearold sister hours after gov bob martinez signed a bill to 
protect children from accidental shootings in the home 
ninemonthold enereida suarez of tampa was the fourth florida 
child killed this summer in an accidental shooting 
she was shot late wednesday after her sister llasmin found a 
38caliber revolver lying under a towel on their parents bed 
police said 
martinez was horrified by the news said his press secretary 
jack peck 
it just underscores the whole problem when a child is shot 
just hours after he signs a bill to stop these things from 
happening peck said 
although the law signed by martinez doesnt take effect until 
oct 1 tampa authorities could bring charges under existing laws 
we will gather all the information and turn it over to the 
state attorneys office for review under the culpable negligence 
statute said police spokesman steve cole 
under the new law no grieving parent of an injured or fatally 
wounded child shot by another member of the family could be arrested 
until seven days after the incident 
the law provides for adults to be charged with a felony 
punishable by up to five years in prison and a 5000 fine if a 
child shoots himself or another because of the owners carelessness 
if a minor threatens someone with the gun or displays it in 
public the gun owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days 
in jail and a 500 fine 
the law requires gun owners to prevent loaded weapons kept in 
homes and businesses from falling into the hands of children 15 and 
younger by using such precautions as trigger locks or keeping a 
weapon in a locked box 
three children died in early june in similar household shootings 
inspiring lawmakers to push for the legislation during a special 
session intended to deal with other issues last month

gunmen stormed a leftist city 
councilmans house in medellin and tried to assassinate him 
thursday but his bodyguards killed 10 of the attackers including 
two police officers the national police said 
elsewhere leftist guerrillas kidnapped a federal congressman and 
blew up the countrys biggest oil pipeline for the 25th time this 
year 
the 10 slain attackers had tried to kill councilman gonzalo 
alvarez henao in medellin where drug traffickers have been 
financing rightwing death squads to exterminate members of a 
leftist party 
alvarez is the leader in medellin of the patriotic union party 
organized six years ago with the support of leftist guerrillas 
rightwing death squads have killed 729 members of the patriotic 
union in the last four years 
alvarez was attacked twice first while he was in his car shortly 
before midnight wednesday police col antonio sanchez vargas said 
at a news conference in medellin 
alvarezs guards held off the attackers while the councilman and 
other guards got away vargas said 
then shortly after midnight gunmen stormed the councilmans 
house and his guards killed 10 attackers vargas said 
unfortunately among the dead attackers we found two policemen 
who had broken their vows to serve society vargas said 
medellin a city of 2 million people in northwest colombia is 
the the headquarters for colombias biggest drug traffickers the 
traffickers began killing leftists after guerrillas kidnapped and 
held for ransom members of some of the traffickers families 
traffickers and guerrillas also are at war because the guerrillas 
demand that the drug traffickers pay for having their 
cocaineprocessing laboratories in rebel controlled areas 
the congressman kidnapped by guerrillas was alfonso campo soto 
according to the national police in the northwest state of cesar he 
was kidnapped thursday in cesar state near his ranch the police 
said 
police blamed the national liberation army which has abducted 54 
persons this year including congressmen mayors city councilmen 
policemen and news reporters 
the police quoted campos family as saying that the guerrillas 
told them that campo would be released soon 
most of the people who have been kidnapped by the guerrillas of 
the national liberation army have been released after being 
lectured on the guerrillas political objectives 
the national liberation army also blew up the countrys main oil 
pipeline thursday for the 25th time this year the national police 
said 
the attack again forced suspension of the pumping of 220000 
barrels of oil a day from the big canon limon field in northeast 
colombia 
colombias oil production has plunged to 312000 barrels a day 
from 420000 barrels a day in january because of the guerrilla 
attacks the state oil company ecopetrol said last week 
the pipeline runs 500 miles from the cano limon field to the 
caribbean port of covenas cano limon is operated jointly by 
occidental petroleum royal dutch shell and ecopetrol 
the national liberation army wants foreign oil companies out of 
colombia

senators from the south and upper midwest 
pressed thursday to get aid for weatherdamaged crops in their 
states included in droughtrelief legislation lawmakers are rushing 
to finish this summer 
weve got a comprehensive problem thats going to take a 
comprehensive approach sen tom daschle dsd told fellow 
members of the senate agriculture committee the loss is great 
and the time is short 
the bush administration and senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas have been backing off their insistence that drought relief be 
limited to winter wheat farmers however it is uncertain whether 
enough money would be available to cover losses of other crops 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter had said he would recommend 
president bush veto a drought relief package approved by the house 
that would cover more than 500 crops and cost more than 900 million 
however recent flooding has severely damaged crops such as 
cotton across the south and north dakota gov george sinner this 
week declared his entire state a disaster area because of hot dry 
weather 
soybean and cotton crops are rated fair to poor in arkansas 
mississippi and louisiana primarily because of heavy rains crops 
also have been hurt in alabama georgia north carolina and south 
carolina nine southern senators said in a letter thursday to 
yeutter 
parts of louisiana have received up to 60 inches of rain said 
sen john breaux dla 
the committee is scheduled to vote on a droughtrelief bill next 
week that lawmakers hope to get approved by congress before the 
august recess 
dole said yeutter could be authorized to provide aid to other 
crops where farmers can demonstrate weatherrelated losses 
however he argued that the legislation should first take care of 
winter wheat farmers who already have lost much of their crop 
what we need to figure out in this committee hopefully on a 
bipartisan basis is how were going to deal with areas that have a 
demonstrated loss and how were going to find the money dole said 
winter wheat farmers deserve first crack at drought relief 
because most of the money the government is saving in the farm 
program this year is because of the lower wheat production dole 
said 
the agriculture department estimated the government would save 
950 million in farm program payments to winter wheat growers 
because wheat prices are high the congressional budget office has 
said overall savings to the farm program from wheat and other crops 
this year could run as high as 15 billion

the b2 stealth bomber sped down a runway 
thursday successfully completing its final ground test and setting 
the stage for a first flight that could come as early as saturday 
an air force general said 
the sleek batwinged bomber raced down the runway at air force 
plant 42 achieving a top speed of 75 mph said brig gen richard 
scofield director of the b2 program 
although scofield said the bombers longdelayed first flight 
could come saturday he cautioned that the air force is being 
prudent and will not be rushed despite political controversy 
harrying the bombers progress toward full production 
the plane will fly when it is ready he said 
however scofield said that b2 builder northrop corp and air 
force officials believe they have all the data they need to send the 
bomber airborne 
the radarevading bomber was tested in high winds that kicked up 
clouds of dust on the 11000foot runway at the air forces prime 
research and development plant in the mojave desert 
during the test the bombers nose wheel lifted up into the air 
a procedure that was anticipated scofield said 
it was not an aborted takeoff he said 
the bomber rolled to the end of the runway and one of its tires 
became stuck in soft asphalt making it necessary to tow it back to 
its hangar 
however scofield said everything went perfectly in conducting 
the test as far as the air force was concerned 
no first flight is anticipated friday because the crew and the 
pilots needed rest the general said 
the flying wing was decked out with orange highlights that were 
used to cover sensors and test equipment 
on monday the gray bomber built from composite materials rather 
than metal conducted slowspeed tests on the ground achieving a 
speed of approximately 102 mph 
in washington on thursday defense secretary dick cheney pleaded 
with congress not to nickel and dime to death the b2 saying 
the stealth bomber is essential for us capability to penetrate 
improving soviet air defenses 
testifying before the house armed services committee cheney 
urged lawmakers to try to overcome sticker shock at the 500 
million to 750 million price for each plane and to restore some 
800 million the panel cut from the b2 budget last month 
lawmakers warned air force officials earlier this week that the 
b2 faces a tough uphill fight in congress despite the warplanes 
strategic importance 
put it in perspective or theres a real possibility that the 
b2 will become a museum piece rep les aspin dwis chairman 
of the house armed services committee told air force officials at 
the start of a hearing 
the air force campaign comes amid growing opposition to the 
bomber which recent estimates indicate would be the most expensive 
aircraft in history 
the pentagon announced last week the first flight tests of the 
bomber which are 18 months behind schedule would be held during 
the next two weeks 
the pentagon is proposing a 47 billion budget in fiscal 1990 
for the b2 
the plane will cost about 24 billion over a threeyear peak 
period beginning in fiscal 1992 according to defense department 
figures 
the department has invested about 224 billion in the plane so 
far

the house approved environmentalistbacked 
legislation thursday that would cancel 50year deals under which two 
timber companies have been harvesting trees from tongass national 
forest at bargain basement prices 
the legislation which passed 35660 also establishes more 
wilderness areas in the forest in southeastern alaska and creates 
buffer zones around many streams and tributaries to protect fish 
from logging operations 
the timber contracts have been a raid on the taxpayers said 
rep george miller dcalif who led debate in favor of the bill 
we say get your hands out of our pockets 
the timber companies keep the bureaucrats employed and the 
bureaucrats keep the timber companies wallowing in federal 
subsidies said miller 
im terribly disappointed said rep don young ralaska who 
led the fight against the bill in the name of jobs for his states 
residents it goes to show the influence of the environmentalist 
point of view 
the legislation is directed at louisiana pacificketchikan and 
alaska pulp co a japanese firm and young said 6000 jobs could be 
lost if the companies go out of business 
proponents of the bill however said it throws the door open to 
competition from independent timber companies owned by alaskans 
which could create more jobs for the state population 
if we cancel these contracts it doesnt drive the timber 
industry out of alaska said robert mrazek dny cosponsor of 
the bill it simply puts these companies on same footing as other 
companies 
young alaska gov steve cowper and many members of congress 
including agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas 
favored a version of the bill that would have called for 
renegotiation rather than cancellation of the timber contracts the 
agriculture committee oversees the forest service which is part of 
the agriculture department 
but that version offered as an amendment failed on a 269144 
vote 
the bill now goes to the senate where young said he expected an 
outcome more to his liking if the legislation is not changed it 
will be vetoed by president bush said young 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has said he would recommend 
a veto of legislation that called for termination of the contracts 
the house bill eliminates the 40 million that now goes annually 
for such activities as roadbuilding to aid the timber companies in 
tongass and requires an amount to be set each year in the federal 
budget proponents said that could save the government 205 million 
over the next five years 
it also would end the requirement that the government make 45 
billion board feet of the forests timber available each decade 
the bill would designate 23 areas as wilderness barring timber 
harvesting and development on 18 million acres the legislation 
also would ban logging within 100 feet of salmon streams 
in an effort to establish a stable economy in southeast alaska 
congress in 1947 authorized the forest service to later sign the 
unprecedented 50year contracts with timber companies the contracts 
with the two firms expire in 2004 and 2011 
the forest is the size of west virginia and delaware combined and 
stretches over most of alaskas 500mile long panhandle 
its one of the few remaining temperate rain forests with an 
annual precipitation of averaging 150 inches it and the olympic 
national park in washington are the last remnants of a rain forest 
that used to stretch from northern california to alaska

of 43 miles enough to hit the syrian capital of damascus if fired 
from the eastern edge of the christian enclave 
the christians have never had that capability in lebanons 
14yearold civil war 
the londonbased weekly quoted aoun saying that as far as the 
blockade is concerned there is so much one can take before an 
explosion occurs 
im not for a frogs war with syria but patience has its 
limits aoun was quoted as saying in the telephone interview 
the syrians alarmed at the reports of the missiles last week 
tightened their naval blockade 
however police said the tanker that broke the blockade docked at 
the port of byblos 19 miles north of beirut at noon and began 
unloading its cargo triggering a fierce syrian bombardment 
christian army gunners retaliated firing 155mm howitzers at 
syrian batteries along the seaside ein mreisseh boulevard in moslem 
west beirut a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
he declined to name the tanker or say how much fuel it carried 
for the 1 million christians trapped in their 310squaremile 
enclave for 16 weeks 
the syrians have been trying to stop fuel food and arms from 
reaching the christian forces led by aoun who also leads the 
christian half of this countrys dual government 
it was not clear how the tanker dodged syrian gunboats patrolling 
off the christian coast they have turned back several ships trying 
to run the blockade this week 
several others have been sunk by syrian shellfire 
three shells hit the campus of the american university of beirut 
which overlooks ein mreisseh during the night classes have been 
suspended and there were no casualties 
but customers at uncle sams restaurant across the street were 
blown off their chairs 
the whole place turned orange with the blast said 
photographic technician janine haidar 
beiruts moslem sector also was rocked overnight wednesday by 
gunbattles between rival shiite militiamen who traded hitandrun 
grenade assaults on each others strongholds behind mortar barrages 
no casualties were reported from the fighting that raged in the 
southern slums between the syrianbacked amal militia and 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god 
the hostilities ebbed into sporadic sniping at daybreak as syrian 
troops in charge of west beiruts security sought to enforce a 
ceasefire the police spokesman said 
eighteen people have been killed and 51 wounded in two weeks of 
sporadic street battles 
the secular amal and fundamentalist hezbollah have been vying 
since april 1988 to control lebanons 12 million shiites the 
countrys largest sect the fighting flared after several months of 
relative calm 
the artillery duels between the syrian and christian forces 
smothered the festive mood of moslems marking the first day of eid 
aladha or the feast of sacrifice which is islams holiest 
children who were setting off firecrackers fled the streets 
packed candy stores and sidewalk cafes quickly emptied 
the shelling underscored the failure of three arab league envoys 
the foreign ministers of morocco algeria and saudi arabia to end 
the war 
the ministers have talked with syrian president hafez assad in 
damascus and iraqi president saddam hussein in baghdad in the last 
few days all three left wednesday to spend the feast holidays in 
their own countries 
iraq syrias main arab foe backs aoun and has been supplying 
his estimated 20000 troops which are outgunned and outnumbered 
4to1 by the syrians and their lebanese moslem allies 
saddam seeks to thwart syrian ambitions in lebanon which assad 
considers vital to his countrys security and take revenge for 
assads support of iran in the eightyear persian gulf war 
aoun has vowed to drive the syrians out of lebanon where they 
came in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate

a busboy who found a video camera and wire hidden 
in a booth at an eatery near city hall has blown the cover on an 
apparent federal corruption probe the restaurants lawyer said 
thursday 
owners of counselors row restaurant a spot popular with 
lawmakers and others with clout were shocked outraged and 
extremely upset that this type of conduct exists in the united 
states said restaurant attorney nicholas m spina 
the fbi planted the listening devices and they were discovered 
by one of our busboys spina said 
the fbi also tapped a telephone on a pedestal next to a table 
often used by influential politicians the chicago tribune reported 
quoting unidentified sources 
the sophisticated wideangle camera with a small lens was found 
friday hidden in the base of a booth spina said 
fbi spokesman bob long declined to comment on whether the fbi was 
involved as did us attorney anton valukas the federal prosecutor 
added that counselors row is not the target of any investigation 
restaurant coowner george borovilos said that after he talked to 
the fbi tuesday agents came to the establishment and removed the 
camera they left behind a connecting wire that ran under a seat 
cushion through a concrete wall and down into the basement of the 
building borovilos said 
spina said gary shapiro the federal prosecutor in charge of 
organized crime investigations in chicago confirmed that he had 
authorized planting the device 
shapiro has refused to comment on the case 
a judge approved the installation of the surveillance equipment 
and it was placed in the restaurant without the owners consent 
apparently on a weekend when the place was closed spina said 
we are awaiting word from valukas office to see if theyll 
agree to make the sealed court order a public one spina said 
thursday 
spina said the camera was pointed at a table often used by 
alderman fred roti and democratic ward committeeman john darco 
among other local politicians 
roti said in a news release there is no reason for me to be 
investigated and no reason to believe that i am being 
investigated 
he added in an interview broadcast by wgntv thursday i dont 
like it im sure a lot of other people dont like it but whether 
we like it or not they have court jurisdiction and the right to do 
it so being angry is meaningless to me 
the telephone rang unanswered at darcos office thursday 
alderman bernard stone told wgn its an open restaurant its 
an open table when we leave at 9 oclock god knows who sits here 
alderman richard mell who also frequents the table or ones 
nearby said i have no problem with the bugs is it true it 
looks like a very interesting story

a war hero who fought with fidel castro in 
cubas revolution was executed by firing squad at dawn thursday with 
three other officers for smuggling tons of drugs into the united 
states the official cuban news agency said 
the drug scandal has stunned and embarrassed castro and his 
communist government which for years denied us accusations that 
cuba was being used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana to the united 
states 
in a brief dispatch monitored in mexico city the cuban news 
agency prensa latina said the sentences against maj gen arnaldo 
ochoa col antonio de la guardia font maj amado padron and capt 
jorge martinez had been carried out 
ochoa was a trusted aide to president castro commanding cuban 
forces in ethiopia and angola and heading a cuban military mission 
to nicaragua 
the news agency noted that the four men along with 10 other 
officers were convicted by a summary courtmartial and that the 
deliberations on their appeal were broadcast to the cuban nation 
castro who long rejected us drug smuggling accusations as a 
plot to defame cuba said sunday the scandal had done immense 
internal damage and eroded cubas international image 
he called the sentences a bitter decision but added that he 
also thought about others who have died 
i think of those who fell to build a decent society to 
create a republic where justice ruled where there was no 
corruption dishonesty fraud or treason castro told the council 
of state before it voted to affirm the death sentences 
us officials said thursday the united states isnt convinced 
cuba is serious about combating drug trafficking despite the 
executions 
deputy state department spokesman richard boucher said the 
administration has had information linking cuba to narcotics 
smuggling since 1982 and has expressed its concerns since then 
he reacted coolly to a suggestion by castro that the united 
states and cuba join to wage this common battle against drugs 
you dont automatically start negotiating cooperation until you 
have an indication the other side is really serious and thats what 
were looking for boucher said asserting that drug smuggling 
through cuba continues 
the investigation courtmartial and appeal were given 
unprecedented publicity aimed at showing they had a fair trial and 
at erasing a stain on the honor of cuba and the communist party 
ordinary life virtually came to a halt during televised 
proceedings that began june 12 cubans gathered around their sets in 
fascination not just at the drug scandal but also because of the 
scenario of unbridled greed that unfolded 
the trial indicated that ochoa helped smuggle tons of cocaine and 
marijuana into the united states in alliance with colombias 
medellin cartel the worlds largest drug trafficking organization 
the officers were also convicted of black marketeering and 
smuggling diamonds ivory sugar fine woods manufactured goods and 
us dollars 
all confessed guilt but asked for mercy based on their records 
and contrition ten of the officers including one woman were 
sentenced to terms that ranged from 10 to 30 years in prison 
in a statement before a military court of honor that stripped the 
accused of military ranks and decorations ochoa said he deserved to 
die for betraying castro and the revolution 
defense minister raul castro fidels brother told an earlier 
court of honor that ochoa had been spreading around gifts and 
handing out objects of value mainly to officers in a delirious 
exercise of selfindulgence for the creation of an image and links 
of gratitude to his person 
that seemed to imply that ochoa was trying to bring others into 
his ring there was speculation that ochoa was either trying to 
avoid being turned in or even building his own power base perhaps 
to challenge or gain some measure of independence from the castro 
brothers who have ruled cuba since 1959 
ochoa 57 fought in the guerrilla war that brought castro to 
power and was made a hero of the revolution cubas highest honor 
for heading the cubas 50000man expedition in angola and an 
earlier one to ethiopia 
in his summation to the council of state made up of top 
government and party officials and constituting cubas final court 
of appeal castro tried to distance himself from ochoa citing 
mistakes he made in angola that led to battlefield defeats 
castro said ochoa had concentrated on his illicit activities and 
risked defeat by south african forces aiding angolan rebels he said 
people must wonder how an officer so out of control could have 
been given such responsibility 
in addition to the officers on trial the transportation and 
interior ministers have been sacked for failing to detect and halt 
the ring according to cuban media reports unconfirmed reports said 
other officials were arrested 
castro said commuting ochoas sentence could create an impression 
that highranking officials could get away with anything ochoa and 
his cohorts must have felt like the most untouchable people in the 
world castro said

preliminary tests showed no oil in a slick from 
the exxon valdez the coast guard said thursday but the damaged 
tanker will remain outside san diego bay while more tests are 
conducted 
the tests conducted by a coast guard laboratory conflict with the 
preliminary conclusion of the state fish and game departments lab 
state officials said traces of petroleum were discovered in 
samples taken from the 18milelong slick that developed when the 
valdez arrived off san diego from alaska on monday 
the coast guard test also used a sample from that slick 
the results indicate no presence of oil coast guard cmdr 
jack scarborough said they indicate the presence of some 
unidentified organic matter 
a team of federal and state scientists coordinated by a 
specialist from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
has been assembled to analyze fresh samples from subsequent valdez 
discharges 
there are questions that have been raised relative to the 
sampling procedures used by both laboratories said pete 
bontadelli director of the state fish and game department that 
is the reason we are establishing a single coordinated team so we 
can resolve the question once and for all 
the valdez was towed 2500 miles to san diego from alaska where 
it was responsible for the nations worst oil spill the vessel was 
damaged march 24 when it struck a reef in alaskas prince william 
sound spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
coast guard officials have barred the valdez from entering san 
diego bay for repairs until they are sure it poses no environmental 
or navigational threat the ship remained about 50 miles off san 
diego on thursday 
were quite comfortable with where it is and until everyone 
understands what the analysis tells us we are in no hurry to 
move said frank iarossi exxon shipping co president 
before the valdez can enter the harbor five steel slabs that 
peeled away from its hull during the trip from alaska must be 
removed so it can navigate the shallow harbor channel for the 
safety of the divers the salvage work must be performed in a 
sheltered cove or inlet but officials dont want to move the ship 
until they determine whats being discharged

the rehearsal room fills with british accents as 
actors break for lunch after spending a recent morning trying to 
sound as american as apple pie 
its all in a days work at the royal shakespeare company which 
is reviving the classic 1939 american comedy the man who came to 
dinner by george s kaufman and moss hart 
the rsc had a 1979 hit with trevor nunns production of kaufman 
and harts once in a lifetime which went on to a commercial 
west end run the man who came to dinner opens at the barbican 
theater on july 20 and runs in repertory through september 12 
this play is superlatively well put together with any luck 
its one of those wonderful comic machines said john wood the 
englishman who plays the irascible dinner guest sheridan whiteside 
the supporting cast includes such rsc stalwarts as richard haddon 
haines and marjorie yates as whitesides hosts the stanleys and 
ralph fiennes as the local newspaperman bert jefferson 
whiteside a wicked caricature of the celebrated wit and theater 
critic alexander woollcott is a new york radio celebrity who ends 
up housebound with an ohio family when a dinner invitation becomes a 
comedy of misadventures 
monty woolley originated the part in new york and in the 1941 
film and robert morley was its first london star morleys son 
theater critic sheridan morley was born that year and was named 
after sheridan whiteside 
the play is ripe with whitesides acidtongued lines 
whiteside in introducing his secretary to bert jefferson 
this aging debutante mr jefferson i retain in my employ only 
because she is the sole support of her twoheaded brother 
the play was most recently seen in new york in 1980 at circle in 
the square directed by and starring ellis rabb 
the latest revival marks the rsc directing debut of broadway 
veteran gene saks who is most often associated with the plays of 
neil simon his staging of simons farce rumors is a current 
broadway hit 
saks had only worked in london once before restaging his 
broadway musical hit i love my wife for the west end when the 
rsc approached him 
i found this offer very flattering said saks in an 
interview they said we wanted an american to do it and who 
knows more about american comedy than you do i said well now 
ill have to do it 
saks came to london in march to meet with john wood whom he knew 
socially during woods longtime residency in new york starring in 
deathtrap travesties and amadeus 
he called wood a very special tremendously talented and 
experienced actor who can teach anybody a lot 
wood stars as prospero in the tempest at the rsc and will 
play the doomed halvard solness in henrik ibsens the master 
builder opening there sept 26 
the actor said he responded with some diffidence to the offer to 
play whiteside adding that the roles unusual demands require a 
masseur 
whiteside is wheelchairbound for much of the play having 
slipped and broken his hip this is lower backpain on an operatic 
scale said wood 
saks liked the lesser pressures and diminished intensity of 
working at the rsc where shows are guaranteed a run as opposed to 
new york where they can close overnight 
im always shocked at the reaction of the new york press and 
of some of the public said saks who besides his string of neil 
simon hits directed two recent broadway flops bob larbeys play 
a month of sundays and the musical rags 
i want to say its after all only a play if you didnt like 
it thats your prerogative but lets go on to the next one 
instead new york failures are he said left like a street 
accident with blood all over them 
the rsc reminded saks of the actors studio where he trained as 
an actor in the 1940s 
theres a real revolution against phony traditional acting 
he said they all seem to want to be truthful and get underneath 
things the same as good actors are doing in america 
theres less and less difference between the two

among the rural carvers 
hes unselfconscious a visionary who happens to be an 
artist said painter ricky burnett one of a committee of friends 
formed to manage hlungwanes funds and artistic career and who is

there are touches of japan and south america in his work he 
has a feel for nature and observes it closely burnett said 
hlungwane is vague about the details of his life the son of a 
miner he is about 66 married with 12 children he quit work after 
losing a finger in an industrial accident declaring that any 
machine that could take a finger would wind up taking an arm 
i dont take money money is trouble i want your heart 
hlungwane tells visitors when you have given me your heart you 
have paid me 
after people took him at his word and began carrying off 
sculptures without paying for them burnett and others in the 
johannesburg art world formed a management committee for hlungwane 
near the village is a riverbank where hlungwane once buried deep 
in the earth a lifesize carving of a horse he later spent days in 
an unsuccessful search to retrieve the sculpture 
near the river is a hill where hlungwane has dug foundation holes 
for a new and different project a gasoline station and hotel 
members of his management committee are puzzled but hlungwane has 
no doubts 
the garage and jerusalem are the same thing he said 
jerusalem is the center of the whole world and all routes go by 
this garage from zimbabwe zululand and johannesburg

this is another in occasional series of articles 
on the proliferation of moviemaking outside hollywood tempted by 
friendly officials eager to please filmmakers are flocking to 
outofstate locations spending billions of dollars that once would

the stars are hanging out in north carolina 
and theyre not just in the sky 
projects featuring such movie actors as faye dunaway robert 
duvall natasha richardson debra winger and nick nolte are 
solidifying north carolina as a hotbed for moviemaking 
theyre major caliber people and major caliber projects both 
of those are looking at academy awardtype situations said bill 
arnold director of the north carolina film commission 
in the past few months two movies with those actors have been 
shooting in north carolina the handmaids tale in raleigh and 
durham and everybody wins in wilmington 
i think we started out with major films and higher caliber 
pictures than had been the general rule in the south arnold said 
starting with such movies as being there starring peter 
sellers in 1979 and brainstorm starring natalie wood in 1983 
north carolina has also made steven spielbergs the color 
purple the year of the dragon and many others 
north carolina is one of the fastest growing moviemaking 
locations in the country and is second to california in the number 
of sound stages and studios arnold said with 18 sound stages and 
four studios with plans for a fifth 
we also have the largest resident work force of crew and 
technical people on the east coast after new york he said 
still even though 42 states have film offices and actively 
compete for business california remains the film leader of the 
united states with new york close at its heels 
though not always cheaper its easier to make a movie outside 
california onestop statecontrolled film offices are preferred to 
californias patchwork approach where local governments issue 
permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70 
years old 
and the longheld belief that hollywood could recreate anything 
from the tara plantation in gone with the wind to the las vegas 
strip in one from the heart has been abandoned by filmmakers who 
want greater realism 
north carolinas moderate climate and diverse landscape are 
attractive to hollywood producers 
its the best said michael stroud location manager for 
the handmaids tale 
everyone makes it so easy for you and the bureaucracy is nil 
this really is the ideal place to film i think the south in 
general 
the movies bull durham a delightful romp about life in minor 
league baseball and winter people a drama about intense 
relations starring kelly mcgillis were both filmed in 1987 
winter people is a depressionera very cold snowy film 
bull durham is just the opposite arnold said but they were 
both shot in november and they both got what they want 
since north carolina can offer a variety of looks film 
company have fewer location moves 
the handmaids tale which is being filmed entirely in the 
state needed seasonal changes and also the look of a new england 
college which it found at duke university based on the acclaimed 
novel by margaret atwood the book is a daring move into the future 
and tells the tale of what happens after a rightwing religious 
revolution has swept america imposing a dictatorial regime and 
ruthlessly executing any dissenters 
in 1982 the sciencefiction movie brainstorm filmed in six 
different locations without leaving north carolina 
lake lure in the north carolina mountains served as the backdrop 
for much of the musical dirty dancing which arnold calls one of 
the most successful made in the state 
it cost them vestron pictures 23 million to shoot that 
here arnold said theyve been back here twice since that 
movie has generated more than 750 million thats a tremendous 
return thats the kind of thing that really sells the state 
north carolinas return also has been tremendous 
since the states film office was established in 1980 it has 
spent only 105 million to attract moviemakers none of it on 
advertising like many states do such as texas ohio massachusetts 
and pennsylvania arkansas even offered a 5 percent rebate 
the film industry is really very small arnold said if 
north carolina is a good place to shoot everybody will know it we 
have put our emphasis on making sure the people who come here get 
what they were promised theyd get 
films tv movies commercials and videos have pumped 16 billion 
into the north carolina economy over the past nine years including 
297 million generated by 19 productions in 1988 
producers say they can make a movie cheaper in north carolina a 
right to work state partly because they have a choice of whether 
to use union or nonunion actors and technicians 
money can be saved by hiring nonunion extras for movies with 
large casts but many films made outside california use union crews 
because their hollywoodbased production companies must honor 
contracts with talent and craft unions the cost of an average 
movie in hollywood is 18 million arnold said dino de 
laurentiis whose studio was based in north carolina two years ago 
said the average cost in north carolina is 9 million 
it has grown at a rate that its been comfortable for the state 
to accommodate its been very beneficial 
the economic impact is mostly indirect through money film 
companies spend on hotels food supplies equipment and location 
fees 
when stephen kings firestarter was filming in 1983 orton 
plantation in wilmington was used as major location 
they needed to burn that to the ground in a final scene 
arnold said what they had to do was recreate the facade and 
they spent 80000 to burn it in one whack 
a service station operator pumped 6000 worth of gas in one day 
for production company trucks and cars when brainstorm was being 
shot 
the direct impact though comes by way of income taxes 
the movies made in north carolina have created 53000 jobs 
including actors extras crew people and drivers 
basically a film company will come into a community and drop 
literally millions of dollars its a great economic boost 
stroud said 
you dont have to go out and browbeat a community to get 
involved said arnold in general the citizens are very excited 
about making movies

matt groening had been asked to pitch ideas 
for an animated television show before but network executives 
didnt quite get it 
they would say what do you want to do groening recalled 
and id say i want a show with the wit and charm of bullwinkle 
and theyd say you dont understand were trying to appeal to 
3yearolds id say i do a cartoon called life in hell why did 
you want to talk to me 
producerdirector james l brooks the mary tyler moore show 
broadcast news knew exactly what groenings life in hell 
cartoon was all about 
the strip is carried by alternative weekly newspapers around 
the country such as the village voice brooks asked groening to 
create the brief bumpers cartoon vignettes that lead in and 
out of commercials during the tracey ullman show of which 
brooks is executive producer 
the simpsons a homely squabbling brood of middleamericans 
became such a hit on ullman fox is spinning them off into their 
own series 
fox wont yet say when but sometime during the next season 
tracey ullman and company will bid adieu to the simpsons the week 
before they embark on their own show it will be the first 
primetime network animated series since the jetsons and the 
flintstones in the 1960s 
the simpsons is set in the mythical midwestern city of 
springfield a burg replete with a nuclear power plant and a toxic 
waste dump 
the voices of homer marge and their kids lisa bart and maggie 
are provided by dan castellanata and julie kavner both of the 
tracey ullman show nancy cartwright yeardley smith and celebrity 
guest voices such as harry shearer and penny marshall 
brooks groening and producerwriter sam simon told a meeting of 
television critics that they just dont know what america will think 
of the simpsons once audiences start getting a bigger dose of their 
darkly funny sitcom antics 
someone wondered whether america was in fact receiving enough 
cutting satire of sitcom families in foxs married with 
children simon insisted almost maintaining a straight face that 
the simpsons are unlike the unscrupulous and conniving bundys and 
really do love each other deep down 
they dont hate each other simon said if they do 
occasionally strangle each other or hit each other over the head 
its just an impulsive act 
whether they will go over whether these drawn figures will go 
over we dont know brooks said 
the simpsons who look very much like the wildeyed rabbits who 
populate groenings life in hell strip derived from an 
unpublishable novel groening said he wrote in high school 
mean kids 
groening said he never expected to become a cartoonist since 
my drawing didnt improve much after sixth grade he describes 
the simpsons as having large round eyes and a tremendous 
overbite problem basically his rabbits without the giant ears 
maybe someday marge will take off a wig and reveal her true 
identity he teased 
groening said he does fervently hope that binky and the other 
rabbits from life in hell might get their own tv series too 
someday 
someday groening said maybe television will be ready for 
my hellish stuff

elsewhere in television 
cops in russia foxs realitybased cops went on location 
to the soviet union earlier this year and the resulting special 
cops in russia airs saturday three american and three soviet 
camera crews followed the soviet police as they went about their 
patrols in moscow and leningrad 
the onehour special includes soviet police investigations of 
homicides suicides black marketing domestic disputes and drug 
offenses 
we were incredibly pleased with the openness and cooperation 
that the government displayed in welcoming us to ride along with 
their police said stephen chao vice president of fox television 
stations 
people will be amazed at the similarities and differences 
between the soviet police and their american counterparts a lot of 
the traditional stereotypes about the soviet police and the russian 
people will be quickly dispelled within the first few minutes of the 
special 
the special will also be shown in the soviet union 
getting in on the act fox like the big three networks has a 
crosspromotion deal now with cocacola fox and coke will join to 
promote each others products in tv and radio ads and a contest in 
which winners get a caribbean cruise abc cbs and nbc have also 
announced crosspromotion deals with retailers in a bid to draw 
audiences back from cable video and independent stations like 
foxs affiliates

while president bush still supports a cut in the 
capital gains tax rate the chances of it occurring this year have 
dimmed largely because it got caught up in politics 
opposition to a cut which would have made it financially less 
costly to sell stocks that have risen in value was largely based on 
fears among elected officials that the public would view a cut as a 
gift to the rich 
lost amid the concern were such arguments that a cut might 
actually raise federal revenues helping to lower the deficit that 
it might be fairer and that it might encourage business formations 
and the creation of jobs 
true or false the gift to the rich brand promoted by 
opponents of a cut is a brand that could harass an elected official 
for the rest of his or her political days which could be brief if 
voters took it to heart 
true it might help the rich but true also is the assertion that 
it might help the lessthanrich as professor lawrence lindsey of 
harvard university indicated in testimoney before the house ways and 
means committee 
suppose he said that 20 years ago you managed to buy one unit 
of the dow jones industrial average which at the time was selling 
for about 900 a small investment to be sure but one that grew to 
a high of 2700 in 1987 
you would have an 1800 capital gain which might seem to be a 
compliment to your great patience and your ability to withstand the 
risk of violent market ups and downs then you figure the tax state 
and federal roughly onethird 
quite a belt but that isnt even the tough part even tougher to 
digest is the realization that an enormous amount of that is simply 
inflation inflation is bad enough but you might conclude that to 
be taxed on it is insulting 
the fact of the matter is you would have come out a loser not a 
gainer for your risktaking and patience economist lindsey points 
out that for you to have merely broken even you would have had to 
sell at 3000 not 2700 
that of course would have been impossible since the dow jones 
industrial average has never in its history reached that level 
having plunged right after reaching 2700 points it is now around 
2500 points 
drowned out by the gifttotherich contention is the assertion 
that a cut would raise federal revenues by billions of dollars a 
year the thesis is backed by various studies but most convincingly 
by history since a capital gains tax reduction in 1979 was followed 
by a sharp increase in revenue 
not everyone agrees that a cut would increase revenues year after 
year some critics say the impact might be felt mainly in the first 
year or two when investors with longterm gains would be enticed 
into cashing in their assets 
and in fact joseph minarik of the urban institute argues the 
history of the last decade is not favorable to the claims of revenue 
raising through capital gains tax cuts 
but while congress and academics argued about the numbers the 
thesis was never shot down ie proven without any doubt to be 
incorrect 
instead the lure of extra billions of dollars in revenues even 
by a congress desperately searching for ways to close the budget 
gap just wasnt strong enough to withstand the political damage of 
a gift to the rich 
in theory anyway a capital gains tax might also lead to higher 
federal revenues in an entirely different way by spurring investors 
and entrepreneurs into forming new businesses which if they grow 
become taxpayers 
but unless congress has a change of heart such a cut is not 
destined to be passed this year for rich investors or ordinary 
folks such as those who buy mutual funds

like a lot of couples matthew and pamela 
schultz taught their teenage sons the family business it wasnt 
your typical momandpop operation the schultzes were into robbery 
for william 16 and matt 15 the tools of the trade were 
ak47s police scanners surveillance and survival gear maps wigs 
even hypnosis police say they were trained in handtohand combat 
went through daily routines of jogging situps and pushups and 
memorized streets zones and police codes 
there were dry runs and days of scrupulously logging police 
movement 
files police found in a rented home near sarasota included 
blueprintlike drawings and maps showing distances to police and 
fire stations hospitals malls railroad terminals and streets 
leading to interstate highways 
after a job the two teens would be hypnotized and debriefed 
some sessions were more detailed than others said detective 
bob drone in kenneth city 50 miles north of sarasota the reason 
was if any mistakes were made during a robbery they could be 
corrected before the next one 
one mistake the schultzes made cost them they pleaded guilty in 
tennessee to a botched robbery and drew a 10year prison sentence 
documents police found in the house left no doubt the schultzes 
thought of it as a business there were ledger entries for 
expenditures a contract dealt with firearm purchases handling of 
loot and standards of behavior 
no greed will be tolerated for personal use and pleasure it 
warned according to investigators 
police dont know much about the family schultz 29 was at one 
time a trucker his 35yearold wife was a onetime exotic dancer and 
was married to a rochester ny man named hinton who fathered the 
boys and since has died 
the schultzes told their landlady stella penney they were matt 
and pat avery last september when they rented the threebedroom 
country home she owned on 10 acres near sarasota they said theyd 
be there two years 
schultz told mrs penney he was a marine on special assignment at 
macdill air force base in tampa 70 miles away i wasnt 
suspicious i didnt know they were criminals she said adding 
that the boys were polite but didnt seem to go to school and 
dressed mostly in military clothes 
over the months mrs penney grew wary of mrs schultz who 
demanded several days notice before the landlady could visit then 
was rude to her i was getting kind of scared of her the others 
would come around and apologize make excuses for her that she was 
having a bad day or the like 
the first police knew of the schultzes was a sixmonth spree of 
robberies and burglaries that began in the sarasota area in may 
1988 on nov 26 the schultzes sat outside a kenneth city 
restaurant while the two teens and a runaway they had picked up took 
30004000 at gunpoint drone said 
on dec 1 mrs penney got the november rent matt opened his 
wallet and i saw a stack of big bills two inches thick it was 
loaded there were hundreds i said what did you do rob a bank 
 
schultz said no then told her he was going to tampa on business 
and would be back in a few weeks but the family fled 
it looked like they got out in a hurry mrs penney said 
they left behind two big dogs their clothes and a 300 electric 
bill 
gone were the stove dining room table and fans and the carpet 
was ruined one bedroom was painted in military camouflage colors a 
barrel on the wooded lot had been used for target practice and 
looked like swiss cheese shots had been fired into the barn empty 
ammunition shells were scattered around and there were three 
homemade obstacle courses in the front yard 
scared by a local crimereenactment tv show the schultzes headed 
home to churchville ny starting back south in january or 
february police say 
they made it as far as red bank tenn outside chattanooga 
where police nabbed the two schultz boys and a runaway from new york 
after the botched armed robbery of a businessman as he made a night 
deposit said sgt dan dyer 
police recovered all but 110 of the 1180 cash and 300 in 
checks some was stashed in a motel light globe and 300 was in a 
refrigerator drip tray he said the light globe had been lined 
with tissue paper so the money was not visible even when you shined 
a flashlight on it some of the stuff was ingenious 
police confiscated an ak47 and 750 rounds of ammunition a 
45caliber pistol with 130 rounds an automatic rifle with 300 
rounds magazine clips and a number of militarytype knives dyer 
said they had enough weapons and ammo to keep us held off the 
better part of a week 
the schultzes pleaded guilty last month to the robbery a judge 
sentenced the adults to 10 years to run concurrently with any 
sentence in florida the boys unspecified sentence is to be 
parallel and concurrent to floridas 
the family was extradited last month and pleaded innocent july 7 
to charges stemming from three shoestore robberies one each at a 
computer software store and a yogurt shop and burglaries of a 
restaurant and three schools 
matthew and pamela schultz and william hinton now 17 face 24 
counts each of conspiracy robbery with a firearm burglary and 
grand theft each is being held on nearly 500000 bond matt hinton 
was indicted by a grand jury on 19 counts as an adult and is being 
held on 200000 bond 
they are to be tried oct 23 
police traced the family to the rented home and found shotguns 
ammunition and 60 pounds of spent shells they also seized a 
threeinchthick file giving more than a glimpse into the carefully 
orchestrated resourceful operation that included runaways the 
adults brought into the fold 
the contract they found reads in part 
any and all firearms will be bought by the business and held by 
the overseer for proper use stolen money would be cleaned and 
unmarked by overseer matt big expenditures would not be allowed 
in one lump sum as it might be traced back anyone who took drugs 
or alcohol within seven days of a job would be excluded traceable 
items had to be destroyed 
there also were individuals notes three days ago stopped 
smoking you can beat anybody but matthew you are smart

while america marks the 20th 
anniversary of mans landing on the moon nasa has on its wish list 
a permanent scientific lunar outpost early next century 
when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin set foot in the 
lunar dust july 20 1969 some scientists saw it as a logical step 
toward building a research base there 
but no overwhelming public or political support developed for 
such an expensive undertaking and blueprints were shelved 
some scientists continued through the years to yearn for a moon 
base mineralrich lunar soil could support crops grown under 
pressurized domes researchers say and a commercially valuable gas 
prevalent on the moon could be returned to earth where it is rare 
the scientists have a glimmer of hope in a document released last 
december by nasas office of exploration beyond earths horizons 
human exploration of the solar system in the 21st century it 
outlined possibilities for two moon bases among four potential 
manned expeditions the other two involve flights to the martian 
moon phobos and to mars itself 
one of the moon bases envisioned would not be permanently 
staffed it would serve chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where 
telescopes free of the earths obscuring atmosphere and interfering 
electronic transmissions could study the most distant radioemitting 
galaxies and search for extraterrestrial life 
the exploration office plan puts this unmanned base on the moons 
far side which is permanently hidden from earth each of four 
successive fourperson crews would work through a 14day lunar day 
setting up equipment delivered by unmanned cargo vehicles before 
returning to earth or an orbiting space station as a 14day night 
begins staying through a frigid lunar night would require 
considerable extra support equipment 
once the observatory is built the telescopes would operate 
automatically sending images and data to earth through a satellite 
orbiting the moon or the ground could direct them to look at 
certain celestial objects 
astronauts would return to the base every three years to service 
the equipment and to collect and replace telescope film 
the second base on the front side of the moon would be 
permanently manned 
many astronaut crews over several years would be required to 
construct an antarctictype facility using raw building materials 
already there the apollo missions disclosed that every shovelful of 
lunar soil is rich in metals and silicon and that this soil can be 
mixed with water to form a type of cement 
oxygen is the most abundant element on the moon and this can be 
combined with hydrogen to make water because oxygen is fivesixths 
of what rocket engines burn the base could also serve as a tank 
farm for spacecraft flying between earth and the moon or embarking 
for mars or elsewhere in the solar system 
a lunar resource of potentially great commercial value is 
helium3 an isotope of helium with one neutron and two protons 
instead of the two neutrons and two protons in ordinary helium 
physicists see it as a cleaner more efficient alternative to the 
fuels foreseen for conventional fusion reactors to generate 
electrical power 
on earth helium3 exists only in very small quantities as a 
byproduct of nuclear weapons production but on the moon it is 
abundant deposited by the suns charged particles 
studies done by the fusion technology institute at the university 
of wisconsin and nasa indicate that as little as 40000 pounds of 
helium3 could be transported to earth on just two lunar return 
trips used in a national array of fusion reactors this amount 
could supply the energy needs of the united states for a year 
the exploration office study says either or both moon bases could 
be started early in the next century the report did not include 
expedition costs but frank martin chief of the office said 
its clear that in order to do these things you are going to have 
to spend more money a larger percentage of the federal budget

to work or not to work the question never 
comes up in japan where school is considered the only job fit for 
students 
but american teenagers are working in droves much of their cash 
going for cars clothes beer and sometimes drugs they are perhaps 
learning the work ethic but they are also learning conspicuous 
consumption and some critics say they are compromising their 
education as well 
when she was named national teacher of the year last april mary 
bicouvaris singled out working students and asked them to put a 
priority on school they are very busy people she said what 
i find deplorable many times is they work school into the business 
schedule rather than fit business into the school schedule 
most studies have shown little or no effect on school performance 
if students keep their work time to 20 hours a week but the studies 
are based on averages that dont apply to individual students plus 
there are no federal hourly restrictions on teenagers of 16 and 17 
and many work far more than 20 hours 
the national assessment of educational progress which surveys 
tens of thousands of students on academic proficiency and recently 
added questions on work estimates that more than half of all 11th 
graders and twothirds of high school seniors have jobs 
teachers all have their stories about students whose work lives 
have eclipsed their school lives who leave the classroom to work 
seven hours at a fastfood restaurant and show up the next day 
unprepared their heads nodding onto their desks 
they will tell you i just dont have time to do that 
assignment i have to work and they expect you to buy that says 
patrick welsh an alexandria va english teacher who has written a 
book about high school 
i dont buy it he adds but what happens is a gradual and 
subtle erosion of standards and the amount of work youre going to 
hit kids with its happening all over the country 
a wisconsin study of four high schools did indeed find teachers 
were making less demands on students than they had made five years 
before at least partially in response to the students work 
schedules 
work also has been associated with increased drug and alcohol 
use working kids have more money are under more stress and may 
come into contact with older teenagers more likely to have such 
habits says laurence steinberg a temple university researcher and 
psychology professor 
if your only outcome measure is test scores or grades you may 
be missing something says steinberg coauthor with ellen 
greenberger of a book called when teenagers work 
the book describes a 1982 study of 531 orange county calif 
teenagers in which the authors found that work in excess of 15 to 
20 hours a week tended to cause lower grades and diminished 
involvement in school 
earning and learning a recent report by the national 
assessment of educational progress said a review of other studies 
turned up no comparable results and added that there is no cause 
for alarm concerning the academic performance of students who work 
but steinberg said his and greenbergers earlier results have 
been confirmed in a much larger study of 10000 students in 
wisconsin and california that has not yet been published 
paul barton author of the naep report said he did not mean to 
suggest that this is a rosy situation for all students the 
averages show no association between school and work but individual 
circumstances should be taken into account there are probably lots 
of kids buried in these averages who work long hours and do poorly 
and im sure educators see them 
the united states has by far the highest rate of working students 
in the world with canada a distant second steinberg says 
working while one goes to high school is unheard of in japan he 
says the japanese society is organized such that school is the 
only thing that kids are to be concerned about while theyre 
teenagers 
in america parents often approve of and even push their children 
to work many like knowing where their kids are and believe strongly 
that a job even if it is only flipping hamburgers at a fastfood 
joint builds character and teaches good work habits 
parents have this thing about the work ethic you teach your 
children to work very hard in jobs like waiting tables or pumping 
gas and this is a sign of responsibility but a lot of those kids 
get very poor grades and a lot of that money goes for beer on 
weekends says susan dawes of alexandria va 
susan and david dawes have raised two valedictorians who went on 
to ivy league colleges a third child with a straighta average is 
headed for princeton this fall the three all boys were never 
allowed to hold outside jobs 
they were spending three to four hours a night on homework 
mrs dawes says my husband never wanted them to work during the 
school year he had taken odd jobs during the school year and he 
just thought it was too much 
mrs dawes says she saw many kids with a lot of money from 
their jobs and the parents didnt quite have the control of what the 
kids spent their money on i think a lot of it went to alcohol in 
some cases a lot of times what they want the money for is 
nothing substantial a better polo shirt its not worth their 
working

<TEXT>
statistics back up mrs dawes impression that most teenagers 
are working for discretionary income not money needed to support 
their families 
teenage research unlimited a chicagoarea research firm found 
that teens had 31 billion in income derived from jobs allowances 
and other money from their parents in 1988 the average teenager 
earns 6150 a week the company reported and it is almost 
exclusively discretionary 
teens now buy products and services such as hitech 
televisions and vcrs personal computers and automobiles tru 
said other highpriority items are cosmetics clothes and sports 
and recreation equipment 
that kind of consumerism irks teachers who understand that while 
work is an economic necessity for some students more seem to be 
earning money for designer clothes car payments and entertainment 
they place more value on the instant gratification than on the 
longterm value of getting a good education says mary futrell a 
former high school business teacher who is winding up a sixyear 
tenure as president of the national education association 
you dont want to destroy the work ethic but at the same time 
you know full well that this is interfering with their education 
she adds we need a better balance we need to make sure young 
people and their families understand that the primary focus has to 
be on education and if the job interferes with the education they 
should quit the job 
teachers and others may bemoan their students preoccupation with 
work but the service sectors voracious need for employees assures 
that any student who wants a job will find one competition is so 
tough for older teens that employers are dipping deeper into the 14 
and 15yearold age group 
in many cases schools and parents are required to sign off on 
student work permits giving them an opportunity to intervene if 
they think the job will be too much for the student to handle along 
with school as it stands now most schools dont take advantage 
of that opportunity steinberg said 
he said that is because schools are susceptible to the demands of 
local industry and the need for good community relations in 
california steinberg said principals told us employers would 
call them and say we need more students can you let more of them 
out of school early 
the press of unfilled jobs led the reagan administration to 
propose easing hourly restrictions on 14 and 15yearolds who may 
now work only three hours on school days and no more than 18 hours a 
week when school is in session 
a labor department advisory committee concluded last fall that 
the prime responsibility for this age group should be toward their 
educational and developmental needs and said permissible work 
hours should not be expanded the department is expected to heed the 
panels recommendation 
at the other end of the spectrum new york legislators are 
pondering proposals to cut back work hours for 16 and 17yearolds 
who are under no federal constraints under gov mario cuomos plan 
they would be limited to four hours of work on school days and 28 
hours a week while school is in session 
in proposing the change last may cuomo acknowledged that work 
experience can be valuable and that teenagers are an important 
labor pool for state businesses but he added that it would be 
very shortsighted for new york to have any child labor policies that 
limit our young peoples educational achievement

communist north korea is gradually ending decades 
of secrecy and claims to have achieved paradise but it is a 
paradise where all 20 million angels march in lockstep here is a 
report from the ap bureau chief in beijing who visited pyongyang 
recently 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the hermit of asia is emerging and 
what is seen is a regimented society that in contrast to more 
liberal communism elsewhere trains its 20 million people to obey 
every command of the state 
north korea claims to have achieved paradise on earth its 
leaders declare with pride that the nation has no taxes no prisons 
no want no social unrest 
wellinformed outsiders however say the country has trouble 
feeding itself is burdened with foreign debts and is rapidly 
falling behind the vibrant capitalist economy of rival south korea 
western journalists got a rare glimpse of a closed society during 
the world festival of youth and students held july 18 in pyongyang 
the meeting of 15000 young people most of them from 
leftleaning organizations was the first major international event 
in the north korean capital and the city was carefully prepared as a 
showcase 
pyongyang had a wellscrubbed look of prosperity treelined 
avenues were festooned with banners and flags and balconies of 
wellkept apartment buildings were draped with flowers 
stores in the capital which foreign residents said usually were 
poorly stocked bulged with goods and shoppers 
visitors were given tours of kindergartens with chandeliers and 
indoor swimming pools of hospitals outfitted with new japanese and 
west german equipment of homes with color televisions and 
refrigerators 
they found another jarring element everywhere total control of 
the populace and the pervasive personality cult of president kim il 
sung the 77yearold great leader and dear leader kim jong 
il his son and presumed successor 
above their hearts north koreans wear badges with the elder 
kims portrait 
nearly every room of every office and home has a picture of the 
senior kim and many have portraits of both kims 
billboards and monuments recite and depict heroic deeds of the 
man who has led the north since the korean peninsula was divided in 
1945 after the defeat of japan in world war ii 
this is our happy land and its all due to the great leader and 
the dear leader said kim ho sok manager of a collective farm 
outside pyongyang some people call this paradise on earth 
visitors heard the same statement again and again from other 
north koreans 
in pyongyang the national showcase visitors see neat apartments 
of three or four rooms with central heating hot water and basic 
appliances the average factory worker is paid only about 100 won a 
month 45 at the official rate but enjoys free housing education 
and medical care 
life is harder in the countryside many cottages do not have 
running water or private toilets but in areas around the capital 
stucco apartment buildings of two or three stories are being built 
to replace them 
several foreigners with extensive knowledge of north korea said 
it has enormous problems 
many basic foods are rationed and the foreigners said the 
government often cannot supply the average monthly meat allotment of 
44 pounds per family they said no fruit and few vegetables are 
available in winter 
kim byong hun an economist at kim il sung university denied 
food was in short supply he said the reason for rationing rice was 
to build up reserves to feed south korea after reunification 
a foreigner who has made 18 visits to north korea said the 
government forces people to donate from their savings for the 
purpose it says of helping poor people in south korea 
some of the rules are difficult to fathom bicycles are banned in 
pyongyang even though cars are seldom seen on the broad boulevards 
the few traffic lights at intersections were turned off 
north koreans said vehicles are scarce because the nation lacks 
petroleum deposits this countrys creed has become juche a 
philosophy of selfreliance 
everyone does voluntary work for the government once a week 
tens of thousands were mobilized to help build stadiums and 
apartments when the north tried in vain to become cohost with the 
south of the 1988 summer olympics the facilities were used for the 
youth festival 
where a person lives and works is not his business but the 
states although many homes have televisions few have radios 
apparently to prevent people from listening to foreign broadcasts 
several rural homes visited had wall loudspeakers used by local 
officials to broadcast instructions and ideological teachings north 
korea has almost no private telephones 
li chol sin vice chairman of the committee for cultural 
relations with foreign countries denied claims by amnesty 
international and other human rights groups that north korea is a 
major abuser of human rights 
in north korea everyone has housing and free medical care and 
theres no unemployment he said how can countries with 
unemployment criticize us for human rights 
the regimen appears to accomplish its aim several students 
stopped randomly at kim il sung university said they never would 
question government policy 
in our country students absolutely support the party said 
pak song ok a 21yearold studying the philosophy of juche 
economists said north korea will not follow other communist 
nations in experimenting with capitaliststyle reform even though 
the growth rate is only 2 percent to 3 percent a year compared to 
about 11 percent in south korea 
we will not liberalize our economy and not put much stress on 
material incentives said kim hwa chon of kim il sung university 
he said workers receive some extra pay for exceeding quotas and 
farmers may grow vegetables in private plots around their homes but 
the main rewards for hard work remain political citations as model 
workers or appointments as deputies in local legislatures 
the economist illustrated allegiance to the selfreliance creed 
by opening his shirt to show that even his tshirt was a domestic 
product 
foreign debt has accumulated despite juche to somewhere 
between 5 billion and 8 billion according to foreign observers 
dealing with north korea is a gamble one foreign businessman 
said because the government sometimes pays bills promptly and 
sometimes neglects them another said his company accepts only 
barter deals or cash in advance 
other foreigners said north korea finances imported technology 
for factories and limousines for high officials by selling gold and 
other precious metals 
in its hesitant opening to the oustside world the government has 
enacted a joint venture law and begun several projects mainly with 
communist countries or overseas koreans 
a 105story pyramidshaped hotel now dominates the pyongyang 
skyline it is to be finished in 1990 for what north korea hopes 
will be a flood of tourists with wads of foreign currency

he is the great leader whose 
deeds are praised whose portrait and words are everywhere kim il 
sung has nearly deified himself in his selfmade world of 
regimentation and mass obedience 
president kim who is 77 and has ruled north korea since the 
peninsula was divided in 1945 has crafted an unmatched cult of 
personality 
fouryearolds at changgwang kindergarten in pyongyang sit around

shrine covered with a white cloth kim sat there during a visit to 
the university in 1970 
stuffed animals he donated fill a display room at the university 
which also contains a shotgun the great leader provided so students 
could add to the collection 
at the main entrance of every school institution store office 
and factory is a largerthanlife portrait of kim il sung in 
appropriate context 
hospitals show him counseling doctors schools portray him 
receiving the adulation of children in bookstores his image bends 
over weighty tomes 
visitors to a factory or school are told how kim stood on a 
nearby hill to order it built then provided onthespot 
guidance now and then 
li hung son of pyongyangs largest textile mill said kim had 
visited it 48 times only under the wise guidance of great leader 
kim il sung have we achieved prosperity he declared 
kim ho sok of the haksan collective farm outside pyongyang said 
kim had visited 18 times to teach farmers which crops to grow and 
how to manage the enterprise parents only give children life but 
the great leader takes care of all the people he said 
a huge stone monument that dominates the farm entrance is 
emblazoned with the words he uttered during his visits 
nearly every room of every home has a portrait of the great 
leader often accompanied by one of the dear leader adults wear 
badges with kim il sungs picture just above the heart 
from billboards and statues kim observes the streets and subway 
stations of pyongyang an arch of triumph replica 200 feet high 
honors his achievements as a young revolutionary 
more than 40000 people a day visit the shrine of mangyongdae 
the thatchroofed farmhouse on pyongyangs outskirts where kim was 
born in 1912 equal numbers go to the korean revolution museum 
which has 100 rooms and 140000 items relating to his revolutionary 
accomplishments 
accounts in the museum say kims greatgrandfather helped sink a 
us pirate ship that was scouting possible invasion routes in 
1866 they say his father was a leader in fighting the japanese who 
ruled korea from 1910 to 1945 and died young after imprisonment and 
torture 
the great leader himself it is said left home at 13 to join the 
resistance and founded koreas first communist organization a year 
later 
works by and about kim fill pyongyangs bookstores 
one volume is titled a great man it begins by saying history 
has recorded the stories of many great men but none can match 
those of general kim il sung genius of mankind produced by korea in 
the 20th century 
his appearance in public can ignite a nearfrenzy of celebration 
at opening ceremonies of an international youth festival in 
pyongyang kims arrival on his dais was the signal for fireworks to 
explode doves to be released trumpets to sound and thousands of 
koreans to genuflect worshipfully 
an economist kim hwa chon was asked about the high cost of 
building memorials to the great leader and replied we never count 
the money for monuments the hearts of the korean people built 
them

expert precision singing or dancing 
by tens of thousands is no trick for north koreans because 
regimentation to them is the story of life 
an international youth festival opened with ceremonies involving 
70000 youngsters from the host country including a dazzling 
display of rapidly changing pictures by 50000 card flashers 
most of the 20 million citizens were mobilized to make sure 
communist north koreas first major international event would be a 
success 
nearly everyone in pyongyang helped build kwangbok street a 
highrise apartment complex for 25000 families which was finished 
in two years and housed festival delegates 
office workers volunteer for public service work once a week 
kindergarten teachers initiate a lifelong course in patriotism 
absolute loyalty to the system and reverence for president kim il 
sung 
ideological training and service to the state dominate the 
education system workers have political study sessions at least 
once a week 
songs books television movies and loudspeaker announcements 
beamed into homes reinforce the message 
for those not convinced an entire nation could be trained to 
obey the youth offered some examples 
thousands of pedestrians along the airport road waved whenever a 
carload of foreigners passed 
several hundred folk dancers in a city square stopped dancing 
and applauded when told through the loudspeaker of a passing bus 
that it carried foreigners 
a foreigner entered a department store and one order from his 
north korean interpreter opened a path in the crowd so the visitor 
could be served first 
buses and military trucks took thousands of north koreans to 
each festival event to make sure all were wellattended 
when festival delegates rallied at a school against chinas 
suppression of prodemocracy students about 1000 north koreans 
suddenly appeared and began dancing in the schoolyard leaving no 
room for a demonstration

dont tell joseph ritchie he cant buy eastern 
airlines 
the quixotic bidder for the strikebound carrier may not have 
experience in the flying business but hes a math wizard whos 
vaulted over other daunting obstacles to build a successful company 
from scratch along the way he was a bus driver on chicagos 
southwest side a prison guard and a deputy sheriff 
ritchie 42 is principal owner and president of chicago research 
amp trading group a leading options trading company yet has never 
studied business or economics 
you make more by paying more ritchie said in an interview 
during a trip to new york the more you reward people the more 
youre going to get back and the more youre going to make in the 
long run 
ritchie boasted that crt with around 600 employees pays many of 
them twice the industry average 
eastern boss frank lorenzo on the other hand has been locked in 
a costcutting battle with the airlines unions that precipitated 
the fourmonthold strike 
as a manager ritchie said he prefers to turn people loose 
rather than control them 
ritchie a conservative republican is the american partner in jv 
dialogue a ussoviet joint venture that sells personal computers 
in the soviet union he attributes its success to the human side 
of the equation 
the people who command ritchies attention now are the 31000 
pilots machinists and flight attendants who worked for miamibased 
eastern before their walkout that started march 4 since early may 
ritchie in alliance with easterns three unions has been trying to 
buy the troubled carrier despite several stinging setbacks 
ritchie has offered 50 million and the unions have kicked in 
another 50 million as well as wage concessions totaling 210 
million in addition the unions have pledged up to 175 million 
from their wages if certain goals arent met during the first six 
months of operation under joint ownership 
like a modernday don quixote ritchie seems to be tilting at 
windmills lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
has increasingly gained momentum for his plan to rebuild eastern as 
a smaller carrier and sell 18 billion in assets to pay debts 
the federal bankruptcy court in new york where eastern sought 
protection from creditors on march 9 has removed ritchies buyout 
plan from consideration and lorenzo has dismissed it as a joke 
why does he go on 
i think the people at eastern understand why ritchie 
answered with a buddhalike smile theyve really become like 
brothers and sisters to me 
besides although the bankruptcy court proceedings have turned 
against him ritchie says he believes theres still hope from 
another quarter washington despite the impression he gives of 
farmboy aw shucks naivete ritchie is plugged into the 
washington power grid he makes frequent trips to the capital where 
he has attended meetings with white house aides and members of 
congress 
he appears to have some reason at least to be hopeful newt 
gingrich house republican whip recently wrote to transportation 
secretary samuel skinner asking him to get involved in easterns 
bankruptcy case 
some congressmen from both parties are concerned that the 
disappearance of eastern as a major carrier could threaten airline 
competition already delicate because of the industrys 
consolidation since deregulation in 1978 
that concern led the aviation subcommittee of the house public 
works and transportation committee to hold a hearing on eastern on 
june 29 and it extends to some highranking members of the bush 
administration according to washington insiders 
if the transportation department intervened in the case it could 
bring at least a temporary halt to the sales of eastern assets that 
the bankruptcy court has been approving ritchie said 
when he talks about eastern ritchies dark eyes flash framed by 
his silverwhite hair and trim mustache fresh off the trump shuttle 
from washington he rotated his thin wiry frame in stretching 
exercises before sitting 
ritchie lives on a farm 55 miles west of chicago with wife sharon 
and their nine children whose ages range from 1 to 23 until now 
he has mostly evaded the press leaving phone calls unreturned and 
sprinting out of bankruptcy court hearings to a waiting limousine 
his testimony at the congressional hearing on eastern was a rare 
public appearance he has never given a press conference 
my first impression was this mans not for real said a 
ritchie associate who asked not to be identified i found him 
refreshingly naive 
ritchie says he first got the notion of engrossing himself in the 
eastern saga when he read an article in time magazine about the 
strike back in march 
some sources in the options market say ritchies company crt 
has a reputation for honesty and efficiency theyre known as 
being very moral said a stock options trader who requested 
anonymity they want their employees to become rich too he 
added noting crts liberal profitsharing policy 
candidates for jobs at crt have to pass through an elaborate 
interviewing process involving encounters with as many as 15 people 
after graduating wheaton college in suburban chicago with a 
bachelors degree in philosophy i hated school he says 
ritchie took the bus driving job in chicago that was followed by a 
1year stint as a guard at the cook county house of corrections 
where he played chess with the inmates 
he became deputy sheriff in 1973 in du page county ill where 
sheriff richard doria remembers him now as very quiet obviously 
an intelligent kid 
ritchie then moved to los angeles and started trading precious 
metals returning to chicago in 1975 and starting crt with a couple 
of partners in 1977 
he is considered a math whiz who cracked the problem of rubiks 
cube in less than five minutes and developed a basic mathematical 
formula for options trading that helped crt mushroom into a leader 
in the field

ronald reagans imprint on the judiciary is far 
broader and deeper than his three supreme court appointments in 
eight years he named nearly half the judges now on the federal bench 
his conservative legacy will extend well into the next century 
ever more significant as the supreme court loosens the reins its 
decisions have imposed on lower courts thats been the trend in 
such recent rulings as those weighing against abortion curtailing 
affirmative action programs and permitting capital punishment of 
youthful and retarded murderers 
in a study of reagans judicial appointments sheldon goldman a 
political scientist at the university of massachusetts says they 
represent a major and what is likely to be an enduring legacy 
reagan named 346 or 47 percent of the nations active federal 
judges 
goldman writing in the journal of the american judicature 
society says the reagan administration set up the most systematic 
philosophical screening process in us history to check out 
candidates for judicial appointments 
it demonstrated the importance given judicial selection by the 
reagan administration and the recognition that the appointment 
process by placing on the bench those opposed to the creation of 
new rights by liberal activist courts could be used to achieve the 
administrations social agenda goldman says 
that process was slow gradually gaining headway during the 
latter years of reagans presidency and accelerating this year 
after president bush had succeeded him 
goldman notes that because the lower courts must follow supreme 
court precedent in their decisions reagan appointees could not 
change course on issues such as abortion and affirmative action 
until the high court modified its stand on them now that is 
happening 
reagan named three new justices sandra day oconnor antonin 
scalia and anthony kennedy and promoted william h rehnquist from 
associate to chief justice 
while that consolidated a conservative majority the reagan 
appointees succeeded justices who were themselves centrist or 
relatively conservative it may fall to bush to appoint successors 
to the three oldest and most liberal justices all of them over 80 
i want people who will interpret the constitution and not 
legislate from the bench bush said as a candidate that was 
vintage reagan as was his warning against liberal activists on the 
bench 
but as goldman observed the high court has exercised its own 
brand of judicial activism in rulings to undo earlier decisions on 
civil rights and other issues 
goldman says the real impact of reagans appointments on district 
and appeals court decisions will be gradual reaching into the 21st 
century and likely to be reinforced by the judges bush chooses 
whether thats good or bad depends on the viewpoint of the person 
who is judging the trend 
for civil libertarians this means that when the country 
celebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the bill of 
rights in 1991 the courts will be dominated by those hostile to a 
liberal reading of those rights goldman says for judicial 
conservatives this means a healthy return to government by the 
elected representatives of the people 
in the conservative view such contentious issues as abortion 
civil rights and capital punishment belong in the hands of 
politicians voters and legislators rather than in the hands of 
judges with lifetime tenure 
thats the line justice scalia followed in his separate opinion 
on the abortion decision he said the court should have overturned 
its original abortion rights decision and thus yielded its control 
of what i believe to be and many of our citizens recognize to be 
a political issue 
scalia is unwavering in that view a decade ago as a university 
of chicago law professor he advanced the same argument on federal 
rulemaking 
the main problem is that the agencies have been assigned too 
many tasks requiring judgments that are of an essentially political 
nature and that ought to be made by our elected representatives 
he said then 
not that elected representatives necessarily want to handle 
contentious closely divided issues on which a vote gained may well 
mean a vote lost too by conservative reasoning thats their 
problem

its an area in west africa twothirds the size 
of the united states not counting alaska its the sahel a region 
the green revolution forgot and is not likely to remember 
the land is poor the people are poor and there are too many of 
them the outlook is grim says agriculture department economist 
john day 
if the sahels population of 38 million keeps growing at its 
annual rate of 28 percent it will double in about 25 years he 
said the lands carrying capacity its ability to provide food 
and fiber for humans and animals without losing longterm 
productivity has already been exceeded 
if current population trends continue along with current farming 
technologies the population of the sahel will exceed the lands 
carrying capacity by about 30 million people by the turn of the 
century day said 
collectively he said the eight countries that make up the sahel 
comprise the only region in the world where population growth has 
outpaced increases in food production over the last 20 years 
the countries are senegal gambia mauritania mali burkina 
faso niger chad and cape verde 
only 4 percent of the region is arable or fit for crops the 
balance is desert 59 percent permanent pasture 26 percent and 
woodlands 11 percent 
per capita food production declined about 16 percent annually 
from 1962 to 1988 and is highly variable from year to year day 
writes in the july issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
gains in overall food output have come primarily from expanding 
crop plantings into marginal lands and by cropping traditional farm 
plots more intensively he said but the average yields of food 
crops have dropped the past 20 years 
as soil degradation develops land is turned into desert it is 
this desertification process that has caused concerns in some 
other parts of the world not only in the sahel 
day outlined some of the steps that he thinks could be taken if 
the sahel is to slow its downward spin and relieve some of the 
regions dependence on imports and food aid 
even during 1986 and 1987 when weather was better and domestic 
production was up imports and food aid made up about 20 percent of 
the regions food supply he said 
economic policies have stunted farmers incentives to adopt new 
technology and have strongly affected production methods day said 
for example he said sahelian currencies are overvalued which 
makes imports relatively cheap and exports expensive and that 
encourages food imports and depresses farm prices urban wages are 
artificially high and cheap food policies hamper production 
largescale irrigation systems hold little promise in the sahel 
at least for the present day said eightyfive percent of the 
region gets less than 24 inches of rainfall annually 
the green revolution technology dramatically boosted crop 
production in asia latin america and other parts of africa but not 
in the sahel 
day said the green revolutions output growth was based largely 
on gains from highyielding crop varieties which are mostly 
effective when combined with ample water and chemical fertilizers 
but water control or irrigation is largely absent in the sahel 
sahelian farmers have generally rejected the green revolution 
approach because the highyielding varieties rarely outperform 
traditional crops there 
farmers have learned that applying fertilizers in semiarid 
regions lacking water control is very risky with a high probability 
of economic loss he said 
day said one of the questions is whether traditional production 
techniques can be modified to boost productivity and meet the 
sahels needs development specialists he said are not convinced 
that a lowresource approach by itself can achieve these 
objectives 
basically that would involve animal and human labor in cropping 
systems that use manures and few purchased production inputs 
such as machines or fertilizer and other chemicals 
dryland farming techniques already used in india australia the 
united states and other countries could be adapted to the sahel 
research shows that using moistureconserving furrowdikes and 
chemical fertilizers for example could raise the sahels food 
production and farm income 50 percent to 70 percent and reduce soil 
erosion by as much as 70 percent day said 
farming will always be risky in the sahel he said but 
more efforts to conserve soil and water could cut the risks 
day said efforts to encourage voluntary population control are 
important and could help bring the population into closer 
balance with the lands carrying capacity 
lester r brown head of worldwatch institute a private 
washingtonbased research organization has warned for many years of 
desertification the abuse of farmland and forests and the need for 
curbing population growth 
unfortunately farmers alone cannot brighten the worlds food 
prospects brown said in his 1989 report state of the world 
without the help of national leaders and family planners in 
slowing population growth the hunger and malnutrition that has 
already engulfed large parts of africa and latin america will deepen 
and spread 
brown added population stabilization is the only acceptable 
goal in a world where growth in human numbers is leading to a 
lifethreatening deterioration of environmental systems

the choir is black at st catherine of sienna 
roman catholic church as are the eucharistic ministers and lectors 
the altar boys and girls even the hymnal 
the priest however is white but father ernie rudloff has 
attended workshops on black preaching and has learned to walk among 
the congregation while giving his sermon to speak longer and 
louder to make a few jokes and invite an occasional amen from 
his almost allblack congregation 
father ernie is a black white priest insists john mitchell 
a member of the queens parish for three decades hes adapting the 
old ways to please us 
rudloff and flock epitomize a dilemma facing the us catholic 
church an expanding black laity and a dearth of black clergy 
the case of the rev george a stallings a washington priest who 
was suspended after he formed his own church has focused attention 
on racial tensions in the church and blacks desire for new forms of 
worship 
but what some call the black mass is a fait accompli in urban 
dioceses and most black catholics say theyre most concerned with 
the need for more black priests and lay leaders 
rudloff a popular priest who makes no apologies for his race 
sums up part of the problem this way the black priests just 
arent there 
in the past five years the american churchs black membership has 
doubled to 2 million but there still are only 300 black priests 
roughly the same as 15 years ago and 600 black nuns and other 
religious less than 100 of the nations 1000 predominantly black 
parishes have a black pastor 
the diocese of brooklyn has around 150000 black catholics more 
than any other american diocese and more than a half dozen 
allblack parishes but there are only two black pastors and only a 
few more black parish priests at st catherines there still are no 
black deacons although two are in training and both the school and 
the religious education program are headed by white nuns 
black catholics say that the paucity of black clergy and lay 
leaders is a reflection of the churchs historic racism a racism 
to which several parishioners at st catherines can testify 
charlie bowen a deaconate candidate recalls life at a catholic 
military boarding school in virginia where blacks and whites sat on 
separate sides of the chapel john mitchell says that as a boy he 
was thrown out of a church in harlem by a white priest who thought 
he was going to steal something and when he first came to st 
catherines in 1956 he says a white couple would not rise to let 
him and his family get seats further down a pew 
such experiences led them to sympathize with stallings up to a 
point 
if its possible to be right and wrong then father stallings 
is right and wrong says bowen who helps distribute holy 
communion at morning mass there are problems in the church but 
if you have a problem in your family you dont go out and start 
another family 
on wednesday the nations black catholic bishops struck a similar 
note urging stallings to return to the church and fight racism from 
within it 
the bishops said they hoped stallings and his followers are not 
commingling personal disappointment individually felt frustrations 
and personal anger under the banner of racism racism they said 
is too serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish 
concerns 
blacks at st catherines are proud of their contribution to the 
church especially singing and preaching the traditional mass was 
so somber that by the time it was over you wanted to cry says 
millicent modeste but you should have joy in your soul at church 
it should give you a lift for the rest of the day 
the bible says make a joyous noise adds mitchell the 
noisemakers have come to include charlotte rydzewski who first came 
to st catherines 35 years ago when most parishioners were white 
like her when the congregation takes up rocking gospel hymns such 
as god never fails you can hear her all over the church 
mitchell said 
the traditional christian greeting of peace treated by many 
white catholics as a perfunctory obligation resembles a 
minicoffee break here says rudloff who walks up and down the 
aisle shaking hands we have to cut it off so we can get on with 
mass 
at our lady of charity in brooklyn a black pastor has taken what 
he calls inculturization even further there are drums as well 
as an organ a statue of a black jesus over the altar and prayers 
for the release of nelson mandela from a south african jail the 
rev robert seay wears a white african stole over his vestments 
the churchs biggest liability in developing more priests like 
seay is its own history including the use of slaves on jesuit farms 
in the first half of the 19th century the relatively progressive 
archdiocese of chicago did not ordain its first black priest until 
1947 and separate churches for black catholics were common in large 
cities well into the 1950s 
but in the 1960s the number of black catholics increased 35 
percent more than half the new members were converts and today 
immigration and the popularity of urban parochial schools continue 
to extend catholicism among blacks although the priest population 
has remained stagnant there are 13 black bishops including 
archbishop eugene marino of atlanta compared to one in 1968 
in 1987 the national conference of catholic bishops created a 
secretariat for black catholics and more than 50 similar offices 
have been set up in dioceses around the country 
beverly carroll is director of the secretariat black people have 
long memories she says and the church has a long history to 
overcome we had to struggle just to sit in church let alone 
minister 
we suffer the sins of our fathers says seay the church in 
earlier days refused to have an open door policy now were paying 
for that

auto pollution oil spills and growing dependence on foreigners 
for fuel have helped natural gas emerge as an energy solution thats 
literally lurking beneath our feet scientists say 
the naturally occurring gas called methane once considered 
useful mainly to heat and cook is now widely viewed as the most 
realistic way to power cars and trucks into the 21st century because 
it is plentiful safe and clean 
theres such a vast supply underground that us energy companies 
cap wells when the price gets too low for profitable sale 
petroleumrich saudi arabia squanders methane by burning the gas as 
it spurts from crude oil wells 
the saudis flare each day enough gas to fuel twothirds of the 
road transport of western europe says princeton university 
professor enoch durbin a leading proponent of the natural gas 
alternative 
from a satellite the brightest subject on earth youd think 
would be new york or san francisco its the saudi fields 
naturalgas powered vehicles in canada part of an experimental 
fuelalternative program durbin helped create have logged 500000 
miles without an overhaul because gaseous fuel does not cause the 
wear and tear of liquid fuel liquid fuels wash lubricants off walls 
of a cars engine increasing friction and wear 
the canadian vehicles recently began rusting and falling apart 
but the engines are in such good condition they are being sold for 
use in other vehicles durbin says 
despite its attractiveness natural gas as a motor fuel has two 
big drawbacks 
first it takes up 1000 times the space of equivalent gasoline 
and must therefore be compressed even then it occupies more space 
than gasoline so naturalgas powered vehicles need big tanks and 
frequent fillups 
a car durbin converted and supplied with two natural gas tanks 
could go only 200 miles without a refill for example 
the second obstacle is the lack of a nationwide refueling 
structure 
if youre going to use it you have to be confined to a regular 
route where you can refill says michael german senior vice 
president of the american gas association which represents us 
distributors and pipelines 
german says the 30000 cars in the united states now running on 
natural gas are mainly fleet vehicles that travel regular routes 
one remedy proposed is to equip vehicles with dualfuel tanks so 
if the natural gas runs out the driver could switch to gasoline 
but the extra tanks would take up passenger and cargo space 
where to store natural gas also is considered by some to be a 
problem unlike petroleum natural gas needs a large leakproof 
storage vault or it escapes into the atmosphere 
natural gas now flows to homes and businesses through about 12 
million miles of underground metal pipe 
so the system exists for getting gas from producers to service 
stations whats needed scientists say are pumps at the stations 
to dispense the gas into vehicles 
ninetythree percent of the natural gas used in the united states 
is domestically produced and the rest comes from canada nearly half 
the crude oil consumed here on the other hand is foreign 
about 80 percent of natural gas comes from underground gas 
reservoirs the rest is found with oil 
some experts worry that greatly increased use of natural gas 
would deplete supplies and increase reliance on foreign energy 
suppliers but others reject that fear 
we have such huge methane reserves we dont know how much we 
have says raymond baddour chemical engineering professor at 
massachusetts institute of technology i think this fuel has a 
very bright future for you your children and grandchildren 
moreover it is renewable from unconventional sources such as 
putrifying garbage sewage and animal waste which theoretically 
could yield limitless supplies 
durbin recalls asking a geologist about the supply of natural gas 
he said what do you want to pay at 60 cents per 1000 cubic 
feet theres none 
no one wants to drill a deep hole if its cheap durbin says 
if you tell me youre willing to pay 2 instead of 60 cents i 
suddenly can drill a deep hole 
the department of energy estimates proven reserves of natural gas 
in the united states total 1872 trillion cubic feet by some 
reckonngs that represents at least three centuries worth of 
supply even if all us vehicles burned natural gas instead of 
gasoline 
proven reserves of domestic crude oil in comparison are 
estimated at 273 billion barrels or a 9year supply at current 
consumption rates 
there is a tremendous amount of shutin gas that is sitting 
there waiting for a market or for the price to go up which is the 
same thing says charles andrew an official of john s herold amp 
co an oil and gas appraisal concern 
about a half million cars are powered by natural gas worldwide 
all backyard creations no auto manufacturer makes a natural gas 
car but that is changing 
the soviet union for example is developing a plant to mass 
produce natural gaspowered vehicles by 1991 
in the united states the allure of natural gas has presented 
automakers with a catch22 problem they are reluctant to build a 
naturalgas car largely because the fuel is not yet widely 
available oil companies balk at producing large quantities until 
the vehicles gain acceptance 
new clean air regulations however could spur them into action 
the environmental protection agency has set air quality standards 
for new buses in 1991 that no diesel engine can now meet similar 
rules for trucks take effect in 1994 
while diesel engine manufacturers are designing prototypes that 
would burn substitute fuels natural gas is at the top of the list 
theyve kept their options open but natural gas has very 
cleanburning fuel with no particulate matter which is the biggest 
problem diesel users have german says so it makes sense to 
focus on natural gas over the others 
several us cities are now experimenting with natural gas to 
power municipal vehicles largely because fleet operators realize 
they could save money german says 
a gallon equivalent of natural gas costs about 40 cents vs about 
115 for regular unleaded a taxi company in canada that spent 
900000 to convert 128 vehicles for example recovered the expense 
in a year via savings of 75000 a month in fuel costs 
another big advantage of natural gas is that it emits mainly 
water and carbon dioxide when burned 
you use natural gas at home without ventilating youre cooking 
with it you wouldnt think of using kerosene gasoline or anything 
else without ventilation says durbin 
moreover durbin and others say natural gas doesnt ignite as 
easily as gasoline so in a car crash it would dissipate harmlessly 
instead of exploding in a dangerous fireball 
other gasoline alternatives proposed by the bush administration 
including ethanol and methanol are costlier dirtier and would 
increase oil consumption because it takes more crude to make them 
says mit professor david white codirector of the schools energy 
laboratory 
some people who are proposing these changes havent done their 
homework white says

a japanese drug developed to fight cancerous 
tumors is startlingly effective in halting rejection of transplanted 
kidneys say doctors in japan who are the first to test the compound 
on organ recipients 
american researchers are just as impressed with 
15deoxyspergualin also known as dsg and expect to try it on 
transplant patients in a year or two 
its clearly very effective yet i think its teaching us that 
there are ways to control the immune system we heretofore had not 
even thought possible said dr randall morris director of the 
laboratory for transplantation immunology at stanford university 
among the possibilities suggested by dsg research but yet to be 
proven outside the laboratory are lower doses of cyclosporine a 
potent antirejection drug fraught with side effects routine 
matching of organs regardless of blood type and longer survival of 
animals getting organs from other species a step toward the day 
when animal organs might be transplanted into humans 
at the very least if it allows us to lower the dose of 
cyclosporine it might be useful said dr robert corry chairman 
of surgery at the university of iowa and president of the united 
network for organ sharing 
transplant pioneer dr thomas e starzl of the university of 
pittsburgh is encouraged by the japanese findings even though he 
halted animal tests several years ago because of the drugs toxicity 
and its intravenous use 
in the big picture over a long period of time you cant give 
drugs intravenously so thats a limitation but it could be useful 
as a kind of bailout on a shortterm basis to control 
rejection starzl said 
to get 100 percent of graft survival we must have several 
kinds of potent immunesuppressive drugs said dr hiroshi 
amemiya head of surgical research at the national cardiovascular 
center in osaka japan this is one of that kind of potent drugs 
there were 9123 kidney transplants in the united states last 
year according to the united network for organ sharing virtually 
all transplant recipients experience some organ rejection but most 
is temporary minor and can be controlled with drugs ninetysix 
percent of transplanted kidneys are functioning a year after surgery 
if the organs come from living relatives said kelle straw of unos 
the success rate is 91 percent when the kidneys come from dead 
strangers as is the case in the vast majority of transplants 
dsg is a chemical byproduct of spergualin a substance isolated 
by japanese scientists in 1981 from bacteria found in soil two 
japanese companies launched laboratory tests in 1985 and amemiya 
and others began conducting the worlds first clinical trials 
involving transplant patients last fall 
bristolmyers co is under agreement with the japanese firms to 
develop the synthetic drug for use in the united states 
us researchers have studied dsg as an antirejection agent in 
animals but it has been tested on about 90 cancer patients over the 
past three years the national cancer institute is conducting 
clinical trials at the university of texas at san antonio and 
memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york 
the human tests were begun after experiments showed dsg inhibited 
growth of tumors in mice said dr michaele christian senior 
investigator in the ncis developmental chemotherapy section its 
hard to say whether the drug is going to be useful as an anticancer 
agent its too early to tell 
amemiya reported at the american society of transplant surgeons 
annual meeting in chicago last month that 30 kidney recipients at 
six centers in japan were treated temporarily with dsg the 18 males 
and 12 females ranging in age from 13 to 43 received their new 
kidneys as far back as 1975 
the compound was administered after they suffered organ 
rejection standard antirejection drugs didnt work including 
okt3 which wipes out white blood cells called tcells that attack 
transplanted organs amemiya said 
the food and drug administration approved okt3 in 1987 for 
general use in kidney transplantation it still is experimental in 
other types of transplants 
twentyseven of the 34 episodes of organ rejection experienced by 
the japanese patients were reversed within 10 days according to 
amemiya only one transplanted kidney was lost with the patient 
forced back to dialysis 
dsg worked best with the milder forms of rejection occurring 
within six months of transplantation amemiya said we dont have 
any good therapy for chronic rejection which occurs one to five 
years later and is characterized by a narrowing of the transplanted 
organs arteries 
side effects were temporary and included nausea and numbness 
around the mouth each of the 30 japanese patients continued to 
receive cyclosporine and other immunesuppressive medications during 
the trial amemiya said 
cyclosporine derived from a soil fungus helps prevent rejection 
by freezing certain tcells so they dont divide and increase in 
number but the daily oral doses can lead to kidney failure and high 
blood pressure 
dsg allows certain tcells to divide normally but for some reason 
the cells do not attack transplanted tissue morris said 
transplanted organs also can be attacked by antibodies the 
recipients body produces in response to foreign tissue 
transplanting organs across blood types or from one species to 
another generates even more of these antibodies 
cyclosporine and other antirejection drugs prevent the 
antibodies from forming provided the medication is given as soon as 
an organ is transplanted treatment must continue throughout the 
patients life 
while dsg cannot reduce antibodies already in the blood there is 
evidence it can suppress production of more possibly explaining 
its ability to prolong survival of animals receiving organs from 
other types of animals morris said 
in experiments at stanford transplanted hearts in mice were 
rejected within 11 days when no medication was given and within a 
month if cyclosporine was given daily when mice got dsg for several 
weeks right after transplants their new hearts functioned for 
several months after treatment ceased 
the paramount and striking attribute of dsg to me is its 
ability to educate the immune system to accept the graft for a very 
long period morris said this means that patient may not have 
to take this drug forever

a fungus that may have been released into 
the environment 79 years ago has killed off many gypsy moth 
caterpillars in three northeast states and could lead to a weapon 
against the devastating insects 
entomologists wont know until they do a gypsy moth egg count in 
the fall if the fungus blocked or just delayed an outbreak but it 
has spared thousands of trees from defoliation in connecticut 
massachusetts and new york 
scientists also dont know whether the fungus flourished only 
because of this years unusually cool wet spring and will subside 
i think this is probably something we may never see again 
said us forest service entomologist michael mcmanus 
nonetheless federal and state entomologists are growing the 
fungus to ascertain its species and ensure that samples are 
preserved 
the gypsy moth a european import escaped from a massachusetts 
researcher in 1882 as he tried to cross it with a silkworm to make 
stronger silk the moth has spread slowly reaching ohio and west 
virginia in great numbers and farther west in small pockets it 
feeds mostly on the leaves of oak and other hardwood trees and in a 
major infestation in 198081 caterpillars stripped more than 12 
million acres in the east including over half connecticuts 3 
million acres 
generally the caterpillars work in a cycle with light 
defoliation in the first year increasing in the second and third 
years severe defoliation over several years will slow the growth of 
a tree and in some cases kill it 
nearly a quartermillion acres in pennsylvania were sprayed this 
year the first year of a cycle with insecticide other states 
also sprayed mostly in urban and suburban areas dimilin a 
pesticide that inhibits the growth and development of the 
caterpillars is most commonly used 
researchers are also working on products to limit the damage of 
the moth while minimizing damage to the rest of the environment 
forest service scientists have created a virusbased pesticide 
called gypchek that destroys many of the insects and 
drastically affects their ability to reproduce but it has not been 
perfected and a reasonably priced and practical commercial product 
is probably at least two years away 
scientists are also experimenting with a protozoa native to 
europe that weakens gypsy moths and leaves them more vulunerable to 
diseases 
from 1905 to 1911 researchers imported 127 species of the moths 
natural enemies from europe and the soviet union but only eight 
have survived in 1910 and 1911 researchers released a small amount 
of a japanese fungus in suburban boston it infected only a small 
percentage of the caterpillars in the target aread but the research 
was conducted under unfavorable weather conditions 
entomologists at the connecticut agriculture experiment station 
here excitedly announced in june that a fungus and not a virus that 
periodically attacks gypsy moths had killed many leafeating larvae 
in the three states and a recent report indicates it may be at work 
in new jersey 
the fungus spores land on the caterpillars and produce enzymes 
that eat through the skin inside the fungus grows killing the 
caterpillar 
quite possibly this is the same thing and this has been 
spreading slowly and gone undetected or never had an opportunity to 
express itself until this year said entomologist theodore 
andreadis at the experiment station 
scientists have conducted two very limited releases of the 
japanese fungus in recent years at the allegany state park in new 
york in 1985 and shenandoah national park in virginia in 1986 in 
both cases there was only very limited transmission of the fungus 
from infected caterpillars to native larvae said ann hajek a us 
department of agriculture entomologist in ithaca 
but neither was a good test a virus attacked the gypsy moths in 
the 1985 exeriment and a drought hampered the research the 
following year 
the fungus release has tightly controlled federal regulations 
put it in the same bag as genetically engineered micororganisms 
hajek said 
mcmanus questioned if the fungus could be successfully used as a 
biological weapon because there would have to be enough moisture for 
it to survive 
andreadis said that if the fungus at work in the northeast is the 
japanese strain regulators should allow its use as a biological 
control

it may seem unromantic to stamp out the 
twinkling of the stars but astronomer samuel durrance doesnt think 
so 
in order to study them about their mysteries we have to be 
able to see them better durrance said were trying to see 
their true beauty 
durrance leads a johns hopkins university team working on 
adaptive optics technology which uses mirrors sensors and 
computers to reduce the atmospheric distortion that makes stars seem 
to dance much like lying at the bottom of a pool and looking at 
an object being dangled above you the water distorts the image of 
what you see quite severely the twinkling is not an aspect of 
the stars but an aspect of the atmosphere 
scientists at other institutions are developing similar 
instruments by making it easier to examine material around stars 
they may bring astronomers closer to an elusive goal discovering 
planets outside our solar system 
scientists theorize that material left after a star has formed 
falls into a stable orbit around it and coalesces over millions of 
years into planets 
the johns hopkins instrument wont allow astronomers to directly 
see possible planets but could let them measure changes in the 
brightness around a star possible evidence of planets said 
researcher mark clampin 
the instrument an adaptive optics coronagraph uses two mirrors 
sensors and a highspeed computer to manipulate light waves entering 
a telescope one mirror is a thin membrane whose contours can be 
changed as often as 100 times a second to compensate for the motion 
of a stars image the other called a flat mirror wobbles 100 
times a second to eliminate the distortion of light rays as they 
strike the telescope lens 
only the flat mirror was tested during observations in may of 
beta pictoris a star 312 trillion miles away at an observatory in 
las campanas chile the entire system is expected to be ready in 
about two years 
a complete system already is in use at the national optical 
astronomy observatories in tucson ariz astronomer larry goad said 
it is one of two started in anticipation of the next generation of 
groundbased telescopes 
the new telescopes which will be about eight meters in diameter 
instead of the customary two to five meters will need help 
correcting distortions in the larger amount of light they can gather 
goad said adaptive optics devices are considered experimental at 
this point because nobody except their creators can figure out how 
to operate them 
astronomers at the university of california at berkeley also have 
an experimental system in the works and a related development at 
the university of illinois is the invention of lasergenerated 
artificial stars an artificial star can provide the guide star 
scientists need to calibrate adaptive optics equipment properly 
said electrical engineer chet gardner 
artificial stars formed with a yelloworange laser beam that 
illuminates a spot in a layer of sodium particles about 60 miles 
high can compensate for the usual lack of a bright object in the 
sky near the object under study 
in order to do this detwinkling one needs a very bright object 
or a reference point that is very bright so you can deform the 
mirror to correct the distortion gardner said this star works 
just as well as an actual star that may be millions of miles away 
the hopkins instrument was designed in part to get a better look 
at an unusual disk around beta pictoris which was detected several 
years ago by its infrared emissions clampin said it is too soon to 
know what the observations in chile will yield images of the beta 
pictoris disk containing matter that could be planets or material 
that will form planets are being enhanced 
its hard to predict revolutions durrance said its 
certainly going to have an impact and i think it will have a major 
impact when we can eliminate the effects of the distortion

a computerized xray scanner developed to 
find defects in auto parts is giving medical researchers better 
glimpses of bone structure than conventional analysis methods can 
and in less time 
this new technology is allowing us to better understand the 
consequences of bone changes caused by disease or age such as 
osteoporosis said steven goldstein director of the university of 
michigans orthopedic research lab 
the microcomputer tomography scanner or microct was developed 
in 1981 by ford motor co to find structural flaws in ceramic car 
parts it yields threedimensional images which goldstein is using 
to study trabecular bone a porous spongy shockabsorbing 
structure found near joints 
osteoporosis and other bone diseases affect trabecular bone 
first and more extremely than other bone osteoporosis a common 
ailment among the elderly occurs when bones become porous brittle 
and slower to heal 
by studying how trabecular bone changes during the course of the 
disease goldstein hopes to learn how to control the weakening 
the microct in 15 minutes takes 129 twodimensional xrays of a 
small bone sample from several angles the data is fed to a computer 
that creates a threedimensional image in less than three hours 
the computerized bone reconstruction is faster than microscopic 
analysis yields more details and lets researchers examine inner 
bone structure without having to slice up the specimen he said 
however the microct cannot be used on living patients and is 
only used on bone specimens because it would burn soft tissue

a new computerized compact disc with the 
capacity of 1350 floppy diskettes may mean affordable access to 
data once reserved only for those with mainframe computers and 
sizeable budgets researchers say 
fedstat the compact discread only memory cdrom and the 
technology that makes it work are a venture of the university of 
alabama jvc disc america co and us statistics inc a 
virginiabased online data service 
fedstat contains some of the most widely used census bureau 
demographic and economic data on the single disc are statistics 
about each city and county in the united states information about 
population business and the economy 
while some of the information has been available in printed form 
some had been accessible only through magnetic tape processed by a 
mainframe computer 
never before has this much government data been available in an 
inexpensive easily used format said philip turner dean of the 
graduate school of library service and director of the project for 
the university 
the county business patterns files alone take up about 2 feet of 
shelf space on paper said us statistics president warren glimpse 
the capacity cant be measured only in terms of its volume as found 
in other sources this is a new approach to data he said the 
capacity to crosstabulate to create new data is infinite with 
fedstat 
the disc contains 484 million characters retailing at 195 it 
is used on a cdrom player attached to a personal computer the 
player costs about 500 
data range from population figures as specific as the number of 
children under 5 for any county in the nation to annual economic 
data by county for the past 20 years users also can prepare county 
maps selecting from thousands of subjects compare counties 
metropolitan areas states the nation and other countries and 
develop forecasts based on historical data 
the first orders for fedstat have come from such organizations as 
the new york public library and the library of congress turner 
predicted that within two years cdrom technology will be available 
at most university libraries larger public libraries and 15 to 20 
percent of school libraries 
a new version of the first fedstat disc will be produced each 
year glimpse said with partial updates issued on additional discs 
throughout the year

commodities exchanges give speculators the opportunity to bet 
millions of dollars on the future prices of such goods as soybeans 
gold treasury bills and frozen orange juice 
the purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of 
price fluctuations from people who dont want the risk such as 
farmers or metals processors to speculators who are willing to 
gamble on making big profits 
futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods 
at a specified price at a certain time in the future options which 
also are widely traded on the exchanges give purchasers the right 
but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain price 
within a specified period 
commodities traders standing in recessed pits and dressed in 
brightly colored jackets shout orders and wave hand signals to each 
other in a free forall auction of contracts 
in a typical transaction on a commodities exchange a farmer who 
wants to lock in a guaranteed price for his crop to minimize risk 
will promise to deliver 20000 bushels of soybeans at a specified 
future date at a specified price 
assuming the price rises the speculator who buys the contract 
could later take the beans from the farmer and resell them to 
someone else at the higher prevailing market price pocketing the 
profit 
but if the price drops the speculator would lose money by having 
to pay the farmer the agreedupon price and then resell the soybeans 
at the lower market price 
speculators rarely end up actually holding with mountains of tin 
or pork bellies because they sell their positions at a profit or 
loss before the delivery date the ultimate buyer is a customer who 
actually needs the commodity 
although the exchanges began with agricultural products they 
have rapidly expanded into financial products for example the 
chicago board of trade does most of its business in contracts based 
on the value of the standard amp poors 100stock and 500stock 
indexes 
other major exchanges include the chicago mercantile exchange 
the new york mercantile exchange the commodity exchange in new 
york the new york cotton exchange the coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange

the european commission has unveiled a 
new draft european company statute aimed at easing business in the 
future single european market 
the new draft announced wednesday is a watereddown version of 
the initial proposal which britain had strongly opposed 
eec internal market commissioner martin bangemann said however 
the statute aims to ensure that workers will be involved in 
corporate decisionmaking although this had raised britains main 
objection 
there will be no european company without a definition of the 
place of workers in it and in which way they participate in 
decisions bangemann said 
the proposal which has to be approved by the 12 member countries 
of the european economic community gives companies the choice of 
creating a european company bangemann said without forcing them to 
and without replacing national company statutes 
companies could create a european company through a merger a 
holding company or a common subsidiary provided that at least two 
of them have their headquarters in different member countries 
bangemann explained 
the new proposal lowers the minimum capital of a european company 
to 100000 european currency units or around 110000 to allow 
small and mediumsized companies to choose the new european statute 
the draft also contains tax incentives by allowing companies to 
offset losses in one member country against profits in another 
although bangemann said the european commission did not want the 
provision to be reserved only for companies choosing a european 
statute 
the provisions on employee participation would allow eec 
countries rather than companies to choose which model to adopt 
this is a change from an earlier proposal which gave companies the 
choice 
the commission the eecs executive body is offering three 
options appointing workers to supervisory boards following the west 
german example workers committees as used in france belgium 
italy and the netherlands or other models chosen in consultation 
with the companies concerned 
bangemann said member countries could allow companies to choose 
between the three models or limit the choice to one model he said 
west germany for example could limit the choice to the first 
option to remain in line with west german law

fox inc says it has created a new company to 
oversee its television production activities and has named the head 
of a major independent movie studio to run its filmmaking operations 
as part of a major restructuring 
joe roth the creative force behind filmmaker morgan creek 
productions has been appointed chairman of twentieth century fox 
film corp fox announced wednesday 
roth will oversee all of foxs worldwide motion picture 
activities and will be responsible for developing new movie 
properties fox says it wants to nearly triple its film output 
fox also said it has created a new company twentieth television 
corp to replace the film corporations television production arm 
which was called 20th century fox television production 
harris katleman president the television production division 
will serve as president of the new company 
the television arm produces the shows la law mr 
belvedere and alien nation among others 
the moves were designed to separate the motion picture and 
television units said barry diller chairman of fox inc a unit of 
rupert murdochs news corp ltd 
the separation of our motion picture operations from our 
television production and distribution activities will provide the 
concentrated effort necessary to achieve our goal of distributing 24 
to 30 motion pictures per year throughout the world diller said 
in a statement 
after finishing third among all studios in 1988 fox is currently 
slumping at the national box office with the weak showings of this 
years say anything the fly ii and skin deep fox is 
no 7 of the eight major film studios according to the trade 
newspaper daily variety fox now claims slightly more than 6 percent 
of 1989s boxoffice receits 
fox hopes that the abyss an expensive and muchdelayed 
underwater adventure movie will generate robust ticket sales when 
it opens next month 
roth effectively replaces leonard goldberg who resigned from fox 
in early may to become an independent producer diller has been 
running the studio in the interim 
as president of morgan creek roth produced the films dead 
ringers young guns skin deep major league and 
renegades the first three films were distributed theatrically 
by fox as will be the comedy coupe de ville which roth just 
finished directing 
roth leaves behind the morgan creek productions nightbreed 
exorcist 1990 and enemies a love story all of which 
should be released in coming months 
in a recent interview explaining the companys successful track 
record roth said i dont want to get too big too impersonal 
james robinson morgan creeks chairman and a leading subaru car 
salesman said that the company will name a new head of production 
soon 
much of morgan creeks success is attributable to our 
association with fox robinson said and we now look forward to 
an even stronger working relationship with fox 
fox inc also owns the fox television network the fledgling 
fourth national tv network

share prices in bat industries plc dropped as 
investors took profits and speculated whether a group led by sir 
james goldsmith would succeed in its 21 billion hostile bid for the 
conglomerate in what would be europes largestever takeover 
possible hurdles could include the reluctance of institutional 
shareholders to accept the groups alldebt offer for the 
tobaccoretailing giant scrutiny by the british government and 
defensive litigation in the united states experts said 
an important element is how the government is going to react 
said philip healey editor of the british publication aquisitions 
monthly is it good for the uk industry what benefits will come 
out of it besides making three rich men richer 
bat stock fell the equivalent of 37 cents a share to close at 
1421 wednesday on the london stock exchange following a 
324ashare runup tuesday 
the stock remained above the goldsmith groups offer of 1377 a 
share in debt securities indicating speculation that a higher offer 
might emerge 
in the united states american depositary receipts representing 
shares of bat closed at 1412 down from 1437 tuesday on the 
american stock exchange 
a sweeter offer may rival the record 25 billion purchase of rjr 
nabisco inc completed earlier this year by the new york investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
bats board of directors met wednesday and afterward reaffirmed 
in a statement that it regarded the offer as unwelcome 
the anglofrench financier goldsmith joined by british merchant 
banker jacob rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer 
launched the bid tuesday morning through a newly formed company 
hoylake investments plc 
the group said it intended to break up bat the worlds biggest 
tobacco company by selling its nontobacco interests which 
include financial services retailing and papermaking 
analysts said the bidders could encounter trouble winning over 
british institutional investors who have been hostile toward highly 
leveraged offers or those relying on debt rather than cash or 
stock the bid would require a better price and some cash to 
succeed analysts said adding they believed goldsmiths offer was 
only an opening shot 
the takeover also may face an investigation by the monopolies and 
mergers commission on public interest grounds although prime 
minister margaret thatchers conservative government champions 
freemarket policies it has blocked takeovers in the past 
the government for example in march blocked the acquisition of 
brewer scottish and newcastle plc by the australian company elders 
ixl citing the public interest 
for the same reason the government last year ordered kuwait to 
more than halve its 22 percent stake in british petroleum co plc 
bp subsequently bought the entire holding 
the offer for bat also might face legal action in the united 
states where bat has extensive interests including brown amp 
williamson tobacco corp farmers insurance group inc and the saks 
fifth avenue and marshall fields department stores 
earlier this year south africancontrolled minorco sas hostile 
bid for the british mining giant consolidated gold fields plc ran 
aground in a us court a new york federal judge citing antitrust 
concerns issued a temporary restraining order against that bid 
which then expired under british takeover rules 
gold fields since has agreed to be taken over by british 
conglomerate hanson plc 
there was some speculation that bats management might try a 
leveraged buyout but analysts said the obvious choices for 
engineers for such a big deal have their hands quite full 
in a leveraged buyout a bidder uses borrowed money to take over 
a target and then uses the targets earnings or sells off its pieces 
to pay off the debt 
kohlberg kravis the acknowledged leveraged buyout king is still 
dealing with rjr nabisco and wasserstein perella and co another 
new york buyout firm is involved in an offer for gateway corp a 
british supermarket operator

investors bid time incs stock higher as they 
continued to speculate about how a delaware judge might rule on the 
threeway battle for the media giant 
time rose 187 to close at 14812 a share wednesday on the 
new york stock exchange as wall street waited for chancery court 
judge william t allens verdict on paramount communications incs 
request for an injunction against times 14 billion tender offer 
for warner communications inc 
allen was expected to rule by weeks end before he leaves for a 
vacation and before times 70ashare offer for warner expires at 
midnight monday 
after allen heard arguments in the case tuesday investor 
pessimism about the chances for success of paramounts 122 
billion 200ashare bid for time sent times stock tumbling 637 
a share to 14625 analysts said that at under 150 a share the 
stock attracted bargain hunters wednesday 
fred anschel an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said the 
market continued to speculate on the outcome of the delaware court 
case 
if the judge decides in favor of time the company plans to allow 
its tender offer for warner to expire as scheduled monday even if 
paramount appeals to the delaware supreme court 
edward adler a time spokesman said wednesday he did not 
immediately know whether time would extend the tender offer if the 
judge ruled in favor of paramount 
it also was not known what paramount planned to do if allen 
denied its request 
paramount stock was up 50 cents to 5850 a share on the nyse 
wednesday while warner stock fell 37 cents to 6250 a share 
in arguments tuesday attorneys for paramount and some of times 
shareholders contended that times directors violated their duty in 
refusing to let shareholders vote on paramounts bid 
the lawyers claimed the time board effectively put the company up 
for sale when it agreed to a stockswap merger with warner in march 
under delaware law if a company is up for sale its board must 
entertain any bids that would fetch the most money for shareholders 
time attorneys dismissed that argument saying the merger was 
simply a business transaction that followed two years of 
negotiations 
time announced the tender offer for warner after paramount 
launched its bid

baseball allstar bo jackson shows he can handle 
a tennis racket leap above a basketball rim and run like the wind 
in a new commercial but he slid through the hockey scenes in his 
socks 
jackson put his multiple athletic talents on display in the ad 
for shoemaker nike inc which aired for the first time in tuesday 
nights television broadcast of the allstar game 
the 60second spot opens with shots of jackson who plays both 
baseball and football professionally hitting a baseball and eluding 
wouldbe tacklers 
bo knows baseball says los angeles dodgers star kirk gibson 
in the commercial bo knows football adds los angeles rams 
quarterback jim everett 
pro basketball star michael jordan runner joan benoit samuelson 
a professional womens cycling team and a group of bodybuilders also 
attest to jacksons grasp of those sports between clips of jackson 
in action 
even john mcenroe manages to say bo knows tennis although it 
sounds more like a question than a declaration 
but after jackson is shown delivering a devastating check and 
manuevering past several hockey players los angeles kings star 
wayne gretzky smiles in delivering his oneword assessment no 
nike advertising director scott bedbury said wednesday the hockey 
scenes with jackson actually were shot in a gymnasium in lawrence 
kan where the nike admakers caught up with the kansas city royals 
outfielder last spring 
bedbury said the actors were in their socks for the scene not on 
skates we didnt think it was worth the risk to jackson to ask 
him to perform that scene on ice where he might risk an injury 
bedbury said 
the commercial ends with jackson trying to play a guitar on stage 
along with another famous bo musician bo diddley who composed and 
performed the music in the ad 
as jackson struggles to make some sweet sounds from his guitar 
diddley points a finger at him and snaps bo you dont know 
diddley 
jacksons baseball soccer cycling and running scenes also were 
shot in lawrence along with scenes to appear in an international 
version of the ad that features jackson playing soccer and cricket 
bedbury said instructors who showed jackson some of the nuances 
of cricket were amazed at how far he hit the cricket ball 
other scenes for the ad were shot in orlando fla and los 
angeles 
jim riswold a copywriter and associate creative director at 
nikes ad agency wieden amp kennedy said the idea for the commercial 
developed over a few beers one february night 
nike marketing director tom clarke told the group they had to 
come up with something new featuring jackson who had appeared in 
three commercials by himself last year on behalf of nikes line of 
crosstraining shoes athletic shoes suitable for several sports 
we got off on a discussion of the other bos we have all heard 
of bo derek the beau brummels somebody mentioned bo diddley and 
we thought that might be interesting riswold said 
riswold said that with the jacksondiddley matchup in mind he 
and art director david jenkins had no problem developing a rough 
outline of the entire commercial the next morning 
nike declined to say how much jackson diddley or any of the 
other athletes received for appearing in the commercials 
but bedbury said all of the athletes except the bodybuilders 
already had contracts of some sort with nike that call for personal 
appearances each year the bodybuilders were recruited off a los 
angelesarea beach he said 
riswold said he didnt think any of the professionals hesitated 
about appearing in an ad starring someone else i think they 
enjoyed it they were being set up as the experts in their fields 
he said 
the full 60second version of the ad is expected to run through 
august when 30second versions will begin and run through winter

an effort to sharply limit oil drilling off the 
us coast spurred by the exxon valdez disaster is headed to the 
senate with a strong voice of approval from the house 
the house on wednesday approved the most extensive ban on 
offshore oil leasing of the decade widely expanding prohibitions 
for one year against drilling off large portions of the atlantic 
pacific and alaska coasts 
those people who have allied themselves with the oil industry 
understand how dramatic a statement this is now rep george 
miller dcalif said before the vote 
the oneyear moratorium was part of the 11 billion interior 
department appropriation bill which was approved 37449 there was 
no separate vote on the oil leasing provision 
the senate has not voted on the interior appropriation and 
several senators plan to introduce similar prohibitions 
the bush administration opposes the expanded prohibitions 
under the house bill leases for offshore oil drilling would be 
banned in areas off the coasts of california florida a stretch of 
the atlantic ocean between maine and maryland and for the first 
time off part of alaskas coast 
the appropriations bill sets spending by the interior department 
and related agencies for fiscal 1990 and the provision prohibits 
appropriated money from being used to lease or approve oil drilling 
or exploration in the areas during the year 
miller and other legislators are seeking to permanently ban 
drilling in some areas of the outer continental shelf 
this moratorium will provide needed breathing room to enact the 
stronger safeguard i have proposed of a 10year moratorium said 
rep jim courter rnj 
support for limits on offshore oil exploration has grown since 
the march disaster in which the tanker exxon valdez spilled 16 
million gallons of oil into the pristine prince william sound water 
off the alaska coast 
smaller tanker accidents over one weekend last month spilled oil 
into water off the texas delaware and rhode island coasts 
the american petroleum institute the major industry trade group 
called the house vote a tragedy for our nation 
in an emotional reaction to tanker oil spills the house has 
taken an action that will inevitably boomerang the institute said 
in a statement tanker traffic bringing imported oil into us 
waters will have to increase as domestic oil production continues to 
decline 
in a june 29 letter to house appropriations leaders 
administration budget director richard darman said the oil leasing 
provision and the bills total budget which is 245 billion more 
than bush requested are the main reasons the white house opposes 
the bill 
the administration also objects to a buy america provision 
that requires offshore oil and gas rigs to be constructed with at 
least 50 percent us labor and materials

the union representing northwest airlines 
pilots says it will ask a federal mediator to call an impasse in 
talks with the airline paving the way for a possible strike if 
substantial progress in talks isnt made by friday 
twentyeight months in negotiations is probably long enough to 
conclude a contract pilot spokesman curt kruse of the 
5000member air line pilots association said wednesday 
we are getting the feeling that management is stringing us 
along and trying to make this last as long as possible kruse said 
but northwest spokesman bob gibbons denied the allegation 
the goal is to get a contract not string anybody along 
gibbons said as along as both sides are talking we can move 
toward an agreement 
the unions harsh talk came after the pilots and northwest 
negotiators met wednesday for the second time this week northwest 
and the union have tentatively settled hundreds of issues in the the 
past two months but are still at odds over the hard issues wages 
job security work rules and insurance 
former republic airlines pilots and original northwest pilots are 
still working under separate agreements even though the two airlines 
combined operations nearly three years ago 
the result is that our membership becomes increasingly 
frustrated kruse said they want a showdown with management 
under federal labor law only the national mediation board can 
declare an impasse in airline negotiations if the board declares an 
impasse a 30day coolingoff period begins after the end of the 
coolingoff period the union is free to strike and the company can 
implement its final offer 
kruse said if substantial movement doesnt occur in the 
negotiations the union strike committee will ask the unions master 
executive councils to obtain airport permits for informational 
picketing

pepsico inc chairman d wayne calloway said 
thursday his firm needs to resort to guerrilla tactics to make an 
appreciable dent in cocacolas share of the japanese soft drink 
market 
cocacola dominates japans cola market with a 92 percent share 
compared with pepsis 6 percent according to food and beverage 
industry statistics 
when you have as strong a share as cocacola that calls for 
guerrilla warfare calloway said that means chipping away at 
the convenience store chains store by store vending machine by 
vending machine he said 
pepsico also owns the kentucky fried chicken pizza hut and taco 
bell restaurant chains and the snack food company frito lay pepsi 
cola has been successful in other countries such as the soviet 
union where it has 21 bottling plants and contracts for 20 more 
but gaining market share in japan is trench warfare store by 
store pizza by pizza its that kind of business calloway told 
reporters over a hotelcatered lunch of consomme mille fanti and 
filet steak au poivre 
pepsico was a sponsor for the worldwide tour of pop superstar 
michael jackson who performed in japan in 1987 and 1988 those 
visits boosted pepsi cola sales in japan briefly to 1215 percent of 
the cola market but they fell back each time 
cocacola says japan is its most profitable market calloway 
said that says youre up against a pretty formidable force he 
said problems remain with brand recognition and the complex japanese 
distribution system 
were not going to go out and do something crazy he said 
there is no silver bullet no bomb we can drop 
but he said pepsico would keep up steady efforts at market 
penetration including increasing local retail outlets and investing 
in vending machines 
pepsico also is expanding into noncarbonated drinks such as 
fruit juices sports drinks and coffee calloway said 
were not the market leader so we cant afford to do a lot of 
advertising and marketing we have to do it in a controlled manner 
if i went out and matched cocacolas spending here unless you have 
the distributors and the vendors it wont help 
pepsicos other ventures in japan have fared better kentucky 
fried chicken a joint venture with the trading giant mitsubishi 
corp has cornered 98 percent of this countrys fried chicken 
market according to shinsuke ohkawara president of kentucky fried 
chicken japan who accompanied calloway 
kentucky fried chicken has 834 outlets in japan the largest 
westernstyle restaurant chain in this country and projected sales 
of 863 million this year ohkawara said 
by the end of the year pepsico will have 18000 restaurants 
worldwide the largest restaurant chain in the world and directly 
own or operate 40 percent of them with the rest franchises or joint 
ventures calloway said 
by contrast the mcdonalds fastfood chain has some 11000 
outlets worldwide with 20 percent of them directly operated he 
said

homeowners seeking to take advantage of falling 
interest rates this summer should be able to refinance their 
mortgages faster and more cheaply under a new program offered by the 
nations largest mortgage buyer 
the federal national mortgage association known as fannie mae 
said wednesday the changes would offer lower closing costs and 
speedier approval to homeowners replacing fixed or adjustablerate 
mortgages with new fixedrate loans 
what were trying to do here is grease the skids and make it 
easier for people to refinance said economist david w berson of 
fannie mae a congressionallychartered shareholderowned company 
that provides money for home buyers by purchasing mortgages from 
lenders and packaging them into securities for sale to investors 
lenders are anticipating a surge in refinancing this summer 
because fixedrate mortgages have fallen by about 1 percentage 
points since march and are expected to fall by another quarter of a 
point by fall 
fixed rates are below 10 percent for the first time in more than 
a year oneyear adjustable rates have edged down in recent months 
but not by as much and still are about a percentage point higher 
than a year ago 
berson said he expected roughly 300000 homeowners to refinance 
in the julyseptember quarter he said about 90 billion in 
fixedrate mortgages would be written in the quarter and between 25 
percent to 35 percent of those likely would be refinancings fannie 
mae helps finance one of every eight mortgages 
much of this summers refinancing activity will come from 
homeowners who took out discounted adjustablerate mortgages and 
are now facing higher payments for instance home buyers who took 
out an adjustablerate mortgage at a 7 percent rate in 1987 are 
probably now paying 11 percent 
that would on average increase their monthly principal and 
interest payments on a 100000 mortgage from 699 two years ago to 
990 now refinancing to a fixedrate mortgage at 9 percent would 
lower the payment to 859 
during the last refinancing boom in 1986 and 1987 homeowners 
often had to wait three months before getting approval for their new 
loans berson said the waiting period has dropped to about six 
weeks and the companys new program could shorten the process by 
another week or two he said 
with certain restrictions fannie mae will waive a new home 
appraisal saving homeowners several hundred dollars in that case 
the new loan must come from the original mortgage lender however 
the waiver will not apply if the current loan is backed by the 
veterans administration or federal housing administration 
also fannie mae for many loans will not require borrowers to go 
through another credit and income check those loans must be for a 
one or twofamily main residence or a second home the new mortgage 
must not exceed 90 percent of the homes value or 95 percent with 
mortgage insurance 
homeowners will not be allowed to take more than 1 percent of the 
new loan in cash they will be permitted to borrow the money to pay 
for the closing fees of the new loan thus eliminating most upfront 
costs

an expansion of midway airlines which is trying to 
acquire jets routes and gates from eastern airlines may provide 
jobs for strikeweary workers the chairman of the chicagobased 
carrier said 
david hinson midway chairman and chief executive officer said 
wednesday the carrier should sign a 2065 million agreement next 
week for 16 eastern planes two canadian routes and 13 gates at 
philadelphia international airport which midway plans to develop 
into its east coast hub 
by the mid1990s hinson said midway hopes to have more than 
1000 employees in philadelphia and operate routes from canada to 
the caribbean 
the former eastern workers are highquality professionals that 
we would give top priority to hire under the appropriate 
circumstances said hinson in a visit to miami international 
airport where midway operates its principal maintenance facilities 
midway has hired nine former eastern pilots since machinists 
pilots and flight attendants at the miamibased airline went on 
strike march 4 
the midway deal is part of easterns strategy to significantly 
downsize operations from its prestrike level of more than 1000 
flights us bankruptcy judge burton lifland in new york must 
approve the agreement 
eastern which filed for bankruptcy protection march 9 has 
already sold its profitable northeast shuttle to billionaire donald 
trump for 365 million and has announced plans to sell at least 20 
more jets 
while eastern considers relocating its headquarters to atlanta 
hinson said midways expansion plans could more than double flights 
into miami 
if the philadelphia deal is approved midway may have up to five 
flights a day to miami from chicago and philadelphia said hinson 
the airline which acquired bankrupt air florida as it expanded to a 
national carrier during the past decade also holds several of air 
floridas former latin american and caribbean routes which hinson 
said may be used after the philadelphia hub is established 
midway currently flies via miami to nassau bahamas and the us 
virgin islands 
the east coast service would put midway in direct competition 
with usair the northeasts largest carrier which first sought 
easterns philadelphia gates and routes 
usair is a formidable competitor and we have our work cut out 
for us to move into their territory hinson said 
hinson who predicted more airline bankruptcies before the 
industry settles said the philadelphia expansion will be steady but 
not overly aggressive 
were generally a conservative company said hinson a former 
northwest airlines copilot we are not out to roll the dice 
often dubbed the darling of deregulation midway was the 
first carrier chartered after government control of the industry 
ended in 1979 and began as a small midwest carrier catering to 
fullfare business travelers by the early 1980s it was losing more 
than 20 million annually and began courting regular passengers soon 
after acquiring air florida in late 1984 
midway operates more than 220 regular and commuter flights to 51 
cities from midway airport south of chicago the carrier inaugurated 
west coast service this spring and made a 900 million order for 37 
jets from mcdonnell douglas corp with an option for 37 more 
for the first quarter midway reported record earnings of 29 
million but profits have been erratic in recent years dropping 
more than 40 percent last year 
on wednesday midway announced a tentative labor agreement with 
the teamsters representing more than 450 mechanics stock clerks 
and aircraft cleaners

hasbro inc plans to begin producing 
popular cabbage patch kids dolls immediately now that it has 
completed the purchase of most product lines from financially 
troubled coleco industries inc the company says 
hasbro the nations largest toymaker completed its purchase of 
colecos major assets on wednesday for 85 million cash and an 
option for coleco to purchase 1 million shares of hasbro at 2885 
after its bankruptcy plan was confirmed said barry alperin 
hasbros executive vice president 
hasbro closed at 20 on the american exchange wednesday down 25 
cents 
the pawtucketbased company said it had reached agreement with 
original appalachian artworks owner and creator of cabbage patch 
kids to begin manufacturing the dolls immediately in time to 
advertise them for christmas 
the dolls would be made overseas and packaged at hasbros milton 
bradley division in east longmeadow mass alperin said most of 
colecos other lines including scrabble parcheesi perfection and 
aggravation also would be produced in massachusetts 
milton bradley has the capacity there and theyve handled 
things like this before alperin said 
hasbro also bought the right to use colecos name and would 
discontinue some of its products including alf and wrinkles 
alperin said 
chairman alan g hassenfeld said the acquisition would add some 
timetested products which will enrich hasbros three divisions 
without material additions to our cost structure 
hasbros third division is playskool 
we will be putting on some people to handle cabbage patch but 
were talking tens or twentys alperin said these are short 
term decisions and well deal with this on a long term basis as we 
get into it 
alperin said the cabbage patch line which was the largest 
selling toy of all time in 1985 has not had the attention it 
deserved over the past couple of years 
sales of cabbage patch peaked at more than 600 million in 1985 
compared with 58 million last year 
but the transactions success does not rest solely on cabbage 
patch products alperin said some of the board games for example 
are tried and true names in the games field he said 
alperin would not release internal figures estimating projected 
revenues for the new products 
coleco is far from hasbros most ambitious purchase it aqcuired 
milton bradley in 1984 for more than 350 million alperin said 
the connecticutbased coleco filed for protection from its 
creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a year ago 
citing debts of 5403 million

five us companies are vying to place ads 
costing more than 1 million on the side of a soviet space shuttle 
scheduled for launch next month according to a company with 
exclusive rights to sell the advertising 
san franciscobased sovietpacific enterprises would only 
identify the five as a major oil company a television network an 
international courier a consumergoods produce and a food company 
the ads printed on thin plasticlike film stuck on the spaceship 
with an adhesive will disintegrate within 45 seconds of launch 
because of the heat generated as the craft cuts through the earths 
atmosphere 
talks with the five companies are now in the final stages said 
sam hollis jr marketing director for sovietpacific 
but were looking for just one sponsor he said hollis said 
his company doesnt want the space ship to look like an 
indianapolis 500 race car with 500 different advertisements 
for a payment estimated at more than 1 million the company that 
is picked will be allowed to place two 10by21foot signs on the 
side of the soyuz shuttle scheduled for launch aug 30 it also can 
display its corporate logo or advertisements around the baikonur 
launch site and send a camera crew to film the august liftoff 
the soviet space agency glavkosmos and licensintorg the 
commercialspace and licensing agency in the ussr have imposed only 
one restriction said hollis they wont allow sponsorship by liquor 
or tobacco companies 
more than 100 million people in the soviet union are expected to 
view a live broadcast of the blastoff presenting an ideal 
opportunity to a company that wants to introduce a new product in 
that nation 
less than 45 seconds might seem short for a million dollars but 
a company spokesman pointed out that a 60second spot during a super 
bowl broadcast costs more than that 
glavkosmos has signed commerical agreements with several western 
companies 
in march a japanese televison network paid the agency 12 
million for the right to send a correspondent into space in 1991 
the national aeronautics and space administration which 
administers the us space program does not accept advertising or 
payment from private citizens for flights 
in the past us space shuttles have carried some projects for a 
fee but that practice was canceled after the challenger explosion 
in 1986 that killed seven astronauts

commission said thursday it had cleared a film distribution venture 
by three us companies after they agreed to amend their pact to 
comply with eec antitrust rules 
the commission said that the agreement between paramount pictures 
corp mca inc and mgmua communications to create a joint venture 
united international pictures to distribute their films in the eec 
had contained exclusivity clauses which restricted competition 
these clauses were changed so that the venture now only has the 
right of first refusal on the parent companies films this means 
that if united international chooses not to distribute a film the 
parent company could distribute it on its own or through a third 
party 
the companies also agreed to maintain appropriate records and 
to establish an arbitration procedure to solve problems such as film 
allocation and access to screen space the commission said 
the commissions clearance lasts for five years after which it 
will review the companies agreement 
it said the changes to the agreement were designed to ensure that 
the parent companies remained autonomous and that the films were 
distributed as widely as possible

be closed in phases between the end of this year and next spring 
its always difficult to make these types of decisions when it 
affects loyal and dedicated employees william smithburg chairman 
and chief executive said in a statement but for competitive 
reasons we felt it necessary to take these steps 
quaker said the actions would force the company to take a 
onetime charge of 104 million or 80 cents per share a change in 
accounting methods for grocery products inventories will force 
another 20 to 25centpershare charge 
those charges coupled with a 21 million 20centpershare loss 
by the european pet foods group mean the company will take losses of 
more than 120 per share in the fiscal year ended june 30

in a joint release wednesday the companies said the ftc had 
postponed a decision about the deal until antitrust concerns were 
resolved 
neither pennwalt nor the french company societe nationale elf 
aquitaine would elaborate on the ftc concerns 
we are concerned in that we want to go ahead with the 
transaction as soon as we are allowed to said lowell williams an 
elf aquitaine spokesman i dont think its unusual and you cant 
always expect the government to agree with you we are taking all 
reasonable efforts to get the situation cleared up 
susan ticknor an ftc spokeswoman said she could neither confirm 
nor deny any investigation of the deal however she said that in

deal especially when they feel the ftc decision could be negative

the eec commission thursday imposed 
provisional antidumping duties on imports of compact disc players 
from japan and south korea because they may threaten the survival of 
the eec industry 
the duties which range from 64 percent to 339 percent hit 
major japanese consumer electronics companies including sony corp 
sanyo electric co pioneer electronic corp and matsushita electric 
industrial co 
major south korean companies affected include goldstar co and 
samsung electronics co 
the duties which take effect next week but must be ratified by 
the eec council of ministers within three months followed a 
twoyear investigation by the eec after it received a complaint by 
the main eec producers of compact disc players 
these are nv philips of the netherlands bang amp olufsen of 
denmark and grundig ag of west germany 
in a statement the commission said that the cd player imports 
seriously held back the development of the community industry the 
main inventor and the major developer of the product 
it added that most of the japanese and all of the south korean 
companies involved adopted marketing and pricing policies in clear 
violation of international trading rules on dumping or selling at 
below market price 
the commission calculates whether dumping occurs by comparing the 
price on the exporters domestic market with the price charged in 
the 12nation trade bloc 
the commission said that it found cd player dumping margins 
of between 154 percent and 4554 percent in the case of the 
japanese exports and of between 201 percent and 325 percent for 
the korean exports 
it said that the low prices of the imports caused an important 
price depression which resulted in severe losses for eec 
producers which lost about 30 percent of their annual revenue 
the eec inquiry covered the period june 1 1986 to may 31 1987 
although sales of the players started in 1984 
the commission did not give a total value of the eec market for 
cd players although it said that the imports in 1987 which made up 
about twothirds of the market were valued at 300 million european 
currency units or about 33 million 
imports surged 23fold to about 23 million units in 1987 from 
97924 units in 1984 of which more than 90 percent came from japan 
this compared with a fivefold increase in eec producers sales the 
commission said it did not give figures for sales by eec producers 
the market share of japanese and south korean exporters rose to 
more than 75 percent in 1987 from just under 50 percent in 1984 
while the share of the eec industry fell from more than 50 percent 
to 18 percent in 1987 the commission said 
the eec investigated 14 producers of cd players but imposed 
duties on 11 of them 
the duties on the companies are as follows 
matsushita electric industrial co 339 percent pioneer 
electronic corp 288 percent sanyo electric co 278 percent 
yamaha corp 237 percent victor co of japan jvc 209 percent 
kenwood corp 193 percent nippon columbia co 175 percent sony 
corp 159 percent onkyo corp 85 percent funai electric 
trading co 84 percent teac corp 64 percent 
duties also were imposed on four south korean companies inkel 
corp 201 percent goldstar co 325 percent samsung electronics 
co 23 percent and haitai electronics co 213 percent 
an official who asked not to be named at sony belgium nv 
sonys belgian subsidiary said that sony was not so concerned by 
the duties because its factory in colmar france had been producing 
between 75 percent and 80 percent of sonys cd players for the eec 
market since 1988 
he said that the factory was not established to avoid paying 
duties but was in line with sonys policy of making products in the 
companys local markets 
nv philips was unavailable for comment

the matter will be examined by the state tosha review commission 
an unbiased third party that will decide if the citation should be 
upheld or rule that nissan may keep the records secret ms mcnulty 
said 
if state labor lawyers and nissan attorneys fail to reach 
agreement the issue will go before an administrative law judge

judges order forbids the union to impede coal traffic she was

mccaw cellular communications inc is discussing 
sweetening its 54 billion cash offer for lin broadcasting corp 
shares that it does not already own by including stock that would 
boost the offer to 62 billion 
in a joint statement the companies said they are in continuing 
negotiations over a proposal under which each share of lin stock 
would be exchanged for cash and stock having an aggregate value of 
12750 a share 
the cash portion of the deal would come to at least 110 a share 
the statement read with mccaw class a stock making up the remainder 
of the offer 
mccaws latest offer for lin was for 110 a share in cash 
the companies cautioned in the statement that there can be no 
assurances that the negotiations will result in an agreement 
they said the transaction under discussion would not be completed 
before nov 1 and would preclude lins previouslyannounced spinoff 
of its television stations 
if the kirkland washbased mccaws takeover attempt is 
successful it would result in the largest cellular telephone market 
in the country 
the announcement came a day after mccaw disclosed in a filing 
with the securities and exchange commission that mccaw and lin had 
recommenced negotiations through their advisers 
steven bruce of abernathy macgregor mccaws outside public 
investor relations counsel in new york said wednesdays 
conversation between mccaw and lin financial advisers was a 
resumption of talks that occurred last weekend 
mccaw had launched a bid of 120 a share for lin in june but lin 
rejected it as inadequate lin has about 539 million shares on a 
fully diluted basis and mccaw already owns about 5 million or 98 
percent of those shares 
on monday mccaw lowered its bid to 110 per share citing a new 
york court settlement that was unfavorable to lin 
the new york court of appeals recently denied lins claims to 
certain cellular interests of metromedia co in the new york city 
and philadelphia markets 
the new offer reduced the value of its bid for shares it does not 
already own to about 536 billion from 58 billion

the late serafino ferruzzi made his fortune helping 
to feed starving postwar italy his soninlaw raul gardini has 
wider ambitions and they are having repercussions on one of the 
worlds busiest commodities markets 
gardinis company ferruzzi finanziara spa was at the center of 
attention this week as the reported target of an emergency order by 
the chicago board of trade to break up an alleged attempt to corner 
the soybean market 
the company denied it had done anything wrong and protested the 
order which required liquidation of large positions in the 
markets july soybean contract saying it was only trying to 
satisfy its export commitments 
since taking over the ravennabased company nine years ago 
gardini has turned the ferruzzi food group into western europes 
biggest grain exporter and italys second largest privatesector 
industrial concern after fiat 
if giovanni agnelli head of the fiat auto empire is italys 
industrial king then the handsome silverhaired gardini may be the 
crown prince 
but while agnelli was born into wealth italys financial press 
frequently reminds gardini of his middleclass farming origins and 
his roughandtumble boardroom style 
while agnelli who holds a law degree is reverently referred to 
as the avvocato lawyer gardini has been nicknamed il 
contadino the peasant 
gardini has made a number of bold moves since he became head of 
the ferruzzi group 
the most important was his 1987 takeover of the montedison 
chemical company a move that consolidated ferruzzis power as 
italys secondlargest private business group 
italys financial press takes pride in describing gardini as one 
of the new breed of enterpreneurs who look beyond italys borders 
and are not afraid of a corporate fight 
the 56yearold gardini an avid outdoorsman and hunter who owns 
a 500yearold palace on venices grand canal is equally proud of 
his roots as a farmer 
he was born in ravenna attended an agricultural school and went 
to work for ferruzzi in 1957 he married ferruzzis daughter ida 
since becoming chairman in 1980 gardini launched a major 
expansion and the group now owns some 25 million acres of land 
distributed over three continents 
perhaps his boldest move was his raid on montedison one of the 
10 largest chemical companies in the world but saddled with debt and 
aging plants that were accused of being some of italys worst 
polluters 
the italian newsweekly lespresso headlined the montedison 
takeover the great blitz and published a photograph of gardini 
in his hunting attire gripping a shotgun with a cigarette dangling 
from his mouth 
gardini has been accused of riding roughshod over the interests 
of minority shareholders a controversial restructuring of the 
montedison group in 1988 caused a stir among investors pushing the 
milan stock exchange into a tailspin 
to foreign critics he said this is an italian operation in 
the italian market and if investors dont like it they can leave 
among his moves was the ouster of montedison chairman mario 
schimberni who had encouraged gardini to buy into montedison 
schimberni now heads the italian state railroad 
ferruzzi finanziara ranked 28th in fortune 500 magazines 
recently released list of the largest industrial corporations 
outside the united states with 1988 group sales of 183 billion 
fiat was eighth with sales of 34 billion 
since taking control of montedison ferruzzi has been seeking to 
wed the agricultural and chemical industries the group recently 
announced plans to produce and market a biodegradable plastic made 
from corn starch

sales of the big three automakers cars and light 
trucks rose 89 percent in early july compared with last year when 
incentives had been rolled back and sales fell from a torrid june 
rate the companies said thursday 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said they 
sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 33504 during the july 
110 period this year compared with a rate of 30766 during the same 
time last year 
car sales were up 103 percent and truck sales were 68 percent 
higher 
the sales rate during june last year was particularly strong 
even for what proved to be the secondbest sales year in auto 
history but the incentives that spurred those deals began coming 
off in early july 1988 
this year incentives are available but they arent catching as 
many consumers eyes in fact gm this week boosted customer and 
dealer incentives in an effort to shrink swollen inventories of 1989

abandoned in april it was announced thursday 
a definitive contract between faberges owner riklis family 
corp and unilever united states inc the holding company for 
unilevers american operations has been signed and the transaction 
is expected to be completed within 30 days 
unilever and riklis had reached an agreement in principle on the 
takeover back in february and intended to negotiate details of a 
final contract within 3 months but the talks broke down 
in late april unilever said it was dropping its plan to acquire 
faberge inc and its independent subsidiary elizabeth arden because 
meshulam riklis riklis group was demanding changes in the tentative 
agreement that would have raised the price 
in a joint news release thursday the companies said their 
differences have been resolved completion of the transaction is 
subject to a number of technical conditions that the companies did 
not specify 
chris atkins a spokesman for unilever described the conditions 
as minor matters that wont jeopardize the deal

said 
the signed contract resembles the arrangements made in february 
we are delighted that negotiations were resumed and that they 
have resulted in a transaction in line with the original terms 
said unilever chairman michael angus 
faberge will be an excellent fit with unilevers existing 
personal products operations and elizabeth arden furthers our 
ambition to be strongly represented in the important prestige 
skincare color cosmetics and fragrance sectors he said 
under the contract unilever is to buy all of faberge except for 
the mcgregor apparel group which comprises clothing lines such as 
botany 500 wonderknit and bill the kid

products perfumes and makeups marketed under the names elizabeth 
arden lagerfeld fendi and chloe new yorkbased riklis whose 
other holdings include samsonite luggage and culligan water 
softeners acquired elizabeth arden from the drug maker eli lilly amp 
co for about 700 million in late 1987 
combined sales of faberge and elizabeth arden amounted to more 
than 800 million in the year ended january 1989 and profit was 93 
million

two subsidiaries of an italian agribusiness giant 
today filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block further 
implementation of the chicago board of trades order limiting 
soybean futures holdings a cbot official said 
the lawsuit was filed against the exchange in us district court 
in chicago by ferruzzi trading international sa and ferruzzi usa 
inc said ray carmichael cbot spokesman 
he said the exchange would vigorously fight the lawsuit 
the parent of the two firms ferruzzi spa has denied it 
attempted to corner the soybean market charging instead that a 
cbots order calling for liquidation of large positions in the 
exchanges july contract undermines the reliability of such 
contracts 
soybean futures rebounded moderately in early trading today 
analysts said the buying was a reaction to a government report 
released late wednesday that indicated spring soybean plantings were 
below expectations 
exchange spokesman raymond carmichael said the board of trade 
order was issued late tuesday to correct a wide disparity between 
the number of contracts outstanding and the actual supply of 
soybeans available 
in a statement released wednesday in milan italy ferruzi said 
its accumulation of beans was undertaken so that the group could 
assure the uninterrupted operation of its processing plants and 
to satisfy export commitments particularly to the soviet union 
all actions taken by the group were within accepted practices 
and the emergency order was taken in disregard to the true 
economics of the marketplace the company said 
ferruzzi western europes leading grain trader said it had been 
accumulating soybeans openly in compliance with cbot rules because 
last years drought could have caused a shortage but it did not say 
how much it had bought 
the statement also said the bot action would undermine the 
reliability of the contracts of the board of trade 
in minnesota the state agriculture commissioner on wednesday 
asked the fbi to investigate whether any board of trade officials 
benefited from the emergency order 
commissioner jim nichols said a drop in soybean prices would 
benefit those holding short positions or obligations to sell 
soybeans 
it is possible that some of the members of the board of 
directors who made this order held short positions and benefited 
greatly from this order nichols said in a letter to fbi director 
william sessions 
soybeans are used for products ranging from tofu and cooking oil 
to cosmetics and animal feed 
activity in the bot soybean pit the worlds largest for that 
commodity was heaviest at the beginning and end of the session 
wednesday as traders tried to sort rumors from facts 
a bot soybean trader said the late sale wednesday of 3 million to 
4 million bushels by a large brokerage near the close of trading 
helped soybeans close 39 cents down on the day at 686 a bushel 
the trader who spoke on condition of anonymity said that sale 
had all the earmarks of a foreign firm moving to comply with the 
bots emergency liquidation order 
one of the reasons for the midday trading lull according to 
several traders was a report that a ferruzzi subsidiary in belle 
chasse la planned to ask a federal court for a restraining order 
against the bot action 
spokesman edward barron of the ferruzzi subsidiary declined to 
comment on the report 
ferruzzis holdings in louisiana include american bank and trust 
of new orleans a grain elevator and land 
bot spokesman raymond carmichael said the exchanges board of 
directors issued the order to liquidate large soybean positions to 
correct a wide disparity between the number of contracts being held 
for deliverable supplies of the product and the actual supply of 
soybeans available 
carmichael refused to comment on whether the bots effort was 
designed to break up any firms attempt to corner the market 
a number of traders and analysts compared the soybean market 
situation to an alleged effort by the hunt brothers of texas a 
decade ago to corner the world silver market but others doubted 
such extensive manipulation of the soybean market had taken place 
the exchange ordered all traders holding commitments to buy or 
sell more than 3 million bushels of soybeans for delivery this month 
to reduce those positions by at least 20 percent each trading day 
through july 20 when the july contract expires 
the emergency resolution said no trader may control more than 3 
million bushels of july soybeans at the close of trading tuesday 
and no trader may control more than 1 million bushels by the 
contracts expiration two days later 
futures are binding contracts to buy or sell a set amount of a 
commodity at an agreedupon price at a later date a typical corner 
occurs when a trader holding a large number of buy contracts also 
owns so much of the commodity that sellers cannot acquire enough to 
honor their delivery commitments 
the artificial supply squeeze causes the commoditys price to 
soar until the trader working the corner sells out at a huge profit 
the suntimes also quoted unidentified sources saying the bot 
action stemmed in part from complaints by archer daniels midland 
co the decatur illbased agribusiness giant 
adm spokesman dick burket said the company had no comment 
wednesday 
a trading source who insisted on anonymity told the associated 
press that the situation began as a battle between adm and ferruzzi 
for export business 
ferruzzi was smart enough to cover itself by getting supplies 
from the cash market and the futures market he said adm relied 
almost entirely on the futures market when supplies got tight adm 
had to go to the cash market to satisfy export demands and the 
tighter the supply the higher the premium they paid 
the commodity futures trading commission which regulates the 
futures industry said wednesday in washington that it had been 
monitoring the soybean market for several months but it would not 
comment on whether an investigation was under way into any attempt 
to corner the soybean market

isosceles plc on thursday claimed victory in its 
nearly 3monthold battle for gateway corp plc saying it had more 
than 50 percent of the british food store groups shares under its 
control 
a rival bidding group that includes the us investment firm 
wasserstein perella amp co said it wouldnt give up its interest in 
gateway it said it would hold on to its stake of nearly 34 percent 
in gateway and that it would be an active shareholder 
isosceles a group of disgruntled gateway shareholders said it 
had received acceptances for its 21 billionpound the equivalent 
of about 34 billion bid from shareholders owning 1207 million 
ordinary shares or 135 percent of the total isosceles already 
owned 374 percent of gateway shares 
the announcement claiming control came minutes after the rival 
bidders said they had bought an additional 203 million gateway 
shares in the market wednesday to lift their holdings to 3379 
percent 
a spokesman for newgateway plc the takeover vehicle of 
wasserstein perella and its partner great atlantic amp pacific tea 
co said theres no drama in isosceles crossing the 50percent 
threshold first 
isosceles gaining a majority stake in gateway stock was always 
a possibility that was considered at the time newgateway made its 
final offer said the spokesman who wasnt identified in 
accordance with british custom 
isosceles began its hostile takeover attempt in april offering 
210 pence or about 342 a share later it increased its offer to 
230 pence or 375 a share after newgateway entered the bidding 
newgateways offer stands at 242 pence or 394 a share 
alec monk gateways chairman said the situation was still a 
stalemate and that isosceles would need around 75 percent of 
gateway to consolidate the company 
and they cant possibly achieve that because newgateway 
controls nearly 34 percent monk added 
isosceles plans to break up gateway to help repay its debt by 
selling 62 major superstores to asda group plc for around 703 
million pounds or about 115 billion although newgateways bid is 
also highly leveraged the group has pledged to sell only a limited 
number of less profitable stores 
isosceles can press ahead with its reorganization plans with just 
over 50 percent control but analysts predict it will run into 
fierce resistance from newgateway 
newgateway said it looks forward to its role as a major 
longterm shareholder in gateway 
we regard this as an important investment in a major british 
food retailer the group said we intend to be an active 
shareholder

japanese businessmen and trade officials see 
dismal prospects for investment in china in the coming year and 
dispute suggestions japan may profit from chinas current political 
maladies 
fears that japan will take advantage of the flight of other 
foreign businesses to tighten its grip on the china market are 
unfounded said one japanese trade office manager 
its a big misunderstanding said the official who like other 
japanese interviewed spoke on condition he not be identified 
he said that since the june 34 military assault on prodemocracy 
protesters in beijing not one trade delegation from japan has 
passed through his office 
after the attack there was a mass exodus of foreigners 
including the japanese japan warned its businessmen against a quick 
return saying it would give the impression of a thief at a fire 
someone profiting from anothers misfortune 
about half the 1000 japanese based in beijing have returned and 
more are expected back in the coming week most however have come 
mainly to settle accounts or fulfill existing contracts one of them 
said 
a few companies may eventually reduce their staff here he said 
no one will increase their japanese employees 
matsushita electric spokesman naomi haga said in tokyo that an 
official opening planned for late july for a joint venture that has 
begun producing color tv sets was now impossible 
beijing is under martial law and the japanese government urged 
japanese to leave the country he said we cant give the 
project up it would violate the contract but its dangerous to 
be there now and we dont have enough japanese at the site to keep 
it on schedule 
japans prime minister sousuke uno has said economic sanctions 
wont be imposed on china but tokyo has stopped highlevel contacts 
and put off discussions on 58 billion in official development 
loans japan is to provide china for the 199095 period 
more important said an embassy official in beijing japanese 
companies wont be investing in china in the near future because of 
an erosion of trust in the beijing government 
even if martial law is lifted the government has already lost 
too much credibility he said 
he said chinese companies will have increasing difficulties 
borrowing money on the world market one japanese securities firm 
has put off lending 100 million to southern chinas guangdong 
international trust and investment corp 
the embassy official said japanese companies much criticized by 
china for their reluctance to invest in projects had finally 
decided the time was right after former prime minister noboru 
takeshita signed an investment protection agreement in beijing in 
august since then more than 100 million in investment had been 
pledged 
but chinas recent crackdown on political dissent and fears the 
arbitrary use of force could some day be applied to the foreign 
business community have thrown cold water on future investment 
plans he said 
so far no one is talking about leaving its too early for 
such a decision said kazuhiro takeda of the japanchina 
association of economics and trade in tokyo most companies are 
watching the conditions seeing what direction the chinese 
government takes 
those already in china wont give up he said but for at least a 
year there will be few newcomers he said 
shortterm prospects also were poor for trade between china and 
its biggest trading partner outside hong kong 
last year trade volume reached a nearly balanced 193 billion 
and expectations were it would top 20 billion this year in the 
first five months of 1989 trade was up 15 percent to 82 billion 
but the political chaos coming on top of a faltering economy 
has put many chinese companies in a serious economic pinch japanese 
steelmakers temporarily suspended shipments to china because they 
couldnt get letters of credit from chinese banks chinese companies 
cant get funds for raw materials because of the governments tough 
austerity policies that have dried up credit 
the diplomat said china can finally produce the quality light 
industrial goods and silk that japan demands but now cant deliver 
the goods because of transportation supply and energy problems 
he said japans trade surplus is likely to grow again although 
china may move to cut back imports as its exports tail off 
he said japan has exhausted most of its investment possibilities 
in thailand and other asian countries and japanese companies 
looking for ways to spend their money still consider china the top 
candidate in the long run 
but every japanese interviewed stressed that caution will be 
the guiding principle the chinese say there will be no change in 
their opendoor policy but at the same time they are criticizing 
capitalism the trade official said for the time being well 
have to wait and watch

when geo a hormel amp co meatpackers were 
threatening to strike nearly four years ago two reporters bet on 
how long the strike would last 
paul klauda said more than 10 days dave hage said one day or 
less thinking the strike would never happen 
i thought they would realize before they came to the brink that 
the strike would be a failure and that they wouldnt strike hage 
said 
he was wrong 
the bitter strike in austin minn lasted for months and 
provided hage and klauda both reporters for the star tribune in 
minneapolis with enough drama to fill a nearly 400page book 
no retreat no surrender labors war at hormel published in 
june by william morrow amp co inc is one of several books about the 
strike due on the market this year 
there were so many strands that went beyond just a normal 
labormanagement fight it wasnt just another strike said 
klauda who teamed with hage to follow the battle for the star 
tribune 
the walkouts intriguing ingredients included the presence of a 
fortune 500 company in a small southern minnesota town the 
halfcentury of labor peace hormel had enjoyed the benign history 
of the austin union which struck for three days in 1933 and the 
locals hiring of flamboyant union consultant ray rogers known for 
organizing jp stevens textile mills in the south and more 
recently helping eastern airlines strikers in their battle with 
management 
you just stumbled across one great story after another said 
hage and there just wasnt time to go back and revisit those 
people to explore a certain accusation or to get to know a certain 
person better because tomorrow or sunday theres always another 
news story to write 
for a time the strike was one of the nations top labor stories 
while other plants in the hormel chain agreed to wage concessions 
workers in austin decided to fight a proposed wage cut more than 
1400 union members walked off their jobs on aug 17 1985 
local p9 of the united food and commercial workers objected to a 
profitable company imposing a wage cut hormel said the cut was 
needed for the company to stay competitive 
since the strike ended the maker of spam luncheon meat cure 81 
ham and black label bacon has reported two consecutive years of 
record earnings continuing a fiveyear stretch of increasing 
profits 
hage and klauda said the strike symbolized worker anxiety about 
concessions in the 1980s but they concluded it failed to turn the 
tide partly because events in a town of 23000 werent going to 
reverse nationwide economic forces 
youre not going to overturn the high unemployment rate hage 
said youre not going to overturn all these trends in the 
meatpacking industry that involve nonunion competitors and falling 
redmeat consumption 
in their book hage and klauda trace the roots of the strike the 
first against hormel since the austin walkout 52 years before the 
reporters found it ironic that hormel with a history of good labor 
relations and innovations such as profitsharing dating to the 
1930s was the target of such bitterness 
they also were fascinated by jim guyette the young p9 president 
elected on a noconcessions platform guyette and other local 
officers were suspended by the ufcw international union which took 
control of p9 for refusing to end the strike and negotiated a 
settlement ratified in september 1986 the trusteeship has since 
been lifted and new local officers elected 
in klaudas view the uncompromising guyette was driven the 
same way someone would be driven to go serve in a third world 
country in some kind of humanitarian way 
guyette now works for a hospital and healthcare workers union in 
michigan i was after a fair and decent contract that people could 
work under said in an interview a safe place to work a place 
where you didnt have to raise your hand to go to the bathroom 
thats all i was after 
five months after the strike began hormel reopened the plant and 
began hiring replacement workers the company was flooded by 
applicants and former strikers who crossed the picket line gov 
rudy perpich called out the national guard to maintain order at the 
plant 
one of those hired as a replacement worker was michael t fahey 
whose book on the strike packing it in the hormel strike 
198586 was published in april by kirwin amp sons publishing inc 
of st paul 
fahey concludes hormel was the wrong target for a meatpackers 
strike and that guyette was on an ego trip 
jim guyette had a very strong ego and he ran into another ego 
just as strong dick knowlton hormels president board chairman 
and chief executive officer fahey said thing was knowlton 
had more horses 
another book on strike at hormel takes a prostrike side 
and offers an insiders account according to its author hardy 
green the book will be published this fall by temple university 
press of philadelphia 
green worked for rogers new yorkbased corporate campaign and 
was in austin for much of the strike he disputes claims that 
guyette was on a power trip 
anyone who was in austin could see this was not the strike of 
one person he said it could never be the strike of one person 
leading a bunch of zombies because these people went all over the 
country 
three years since the strike ended there are signs that wounds 
are healing in austin hormel has notified 35 of 442 former strikers 
on a preferential hiring list that they will be called back to work 
by july 24 the company also held an employee appreciation picnic in 
austin that attracted more than 5000

bat industries plc abandoned a 400 million note 
issue thursday because of what it called market disruption caused by 
a hostile 21 billion takeover bid from an investor group led by sir 
james goldsmith 
the issue set for completion monday would have been one of the 
biggest eurobond offerings ever by a nonus company 
the londonbased conglomerate said it also withdrew the issue to 
protect its investors against substantial losses that could result 
from the hostile and highly leveraged nature of the bid 
the group which also includes british merchant banker jacob 
rothschild and australian entrepreneur kerry packer is offering the 
equivalent of 1386 a share in debt securities to acquire bat a 
tactic that underscores the growing dominance of the american style 
on the worldwide takeover scene 
americansized it is four times bigger than the previous biggest 
british bid and rivals the record 25 billion buyout earlier this 
year of us food and tobacco giant rjr nabisco corp 
instead of cash the groups offer uses junk bonds an american 
financing technique not readily accepted on this side of the 
atlantic 
both sides also have lined up leading american investment bankers 
as soldiers and many of the battles are expected to take place 
before american courts and us insurance regulators 
bat has wideranging interests in the united states including 
brown and williamson tobacco corp farmers insurance group inc and 
the saks fifth avenue and marshall fields department stores 
fortyone percent of bats pretax profit and 30 percent of its 
revenue came from north america last year 
bat immediately rejected the offer from the goldsmith group after 
it was launched tuesday through a newly formed company called 
hoylake investments plc 
bats shares on londons stock exchange continued retreating 
toward the offering price finishing down the equivalent of 24 cents 
at 1405 thursday 
junk bonds such as those the goldsmith group is offering in its 
cashless bid are not as widely used or accepted in britain where 
highdebt ventures are less common than in the united states 
junk bonds are highyield highrisk debt securities commonly 
used to finance takeovers and corporate expansions in the united 
states their name comes from their low credit rating which means 
they have a greater risk of default than higherrated bonds 
also new to the relatively staid british takeover scene is the 
breakup of such a large company goldsmith said he wanted to 
unbundle bat by selling off its nontobacco interests which he 
claims have depressed the companys stock price 
in the bat war the offense has lined up junk bond pioneers 
drexel burnham lambert inc and bankers trust co among its 
financing pros its legal advisers include skadden arps slate 
meagher and flom a prominent us takeover law firm 
the defense quickly enlisted goldman sachs and co and shearson 
lehman hutton inc to help lazard brothers and co plot its strategy 
aggressive american investment firms have been leaders in 
developing sophisticated takeover and antitakeover techniques honed 
during the us merger mania of the 1980s 
in addition with all the big buyout funds in the united 
states and most of the big buyout funds being led by americans 
that lining up american firms would be both a defensive and an 
aggressive move said clive sherling a director of the buyout 
firm alan patricof associates ltd in london 
bats defense might be a management buyout which could be 
financed partly with funds from us investors sherling said 
im sure that it would be led from the states and therefore by 
having american advisers they would have a more direct line to the 
cash sherling said 
he also noted the goldsmith group had enlisted highpowered us 
takeover firms for the same reason bat has 
if youre sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure out 
what the defensive strategy would be you would figure they would 
use american advisers and you would try to cut them off at the pass 
and get the best ones sherling said

actor kirk douglas settled his lawsuit thursday 
against sperry corp which dropped him as spokesman two years ago 
when it merged with burroughs corp to form unisys corp 
the settlement for an undisclosed amount occurred just as jury 
selection was to begin in federal court in manhattan 
ive never been in a courtroom before except in a movie and 
then i always knew my lines douglas said after the settlement 
douglas had filed a breach of contract suit two years ago against 
sperry and unisys claiming termination of the contract wrecked his 
chances of getting a similarly prestigious and rewarding contract 
with any other major us corporation 
the 178 million suit was later amended to 125 million 
terms of the settlement werent revealed but douglas said 
everyone is satisfied im happy im pleased it was amicably 
settled 
douglas was sperrys corporate spokesman from october 1985 until 
it was acquired by burroughs on sept 16 1986 the company told 
douglas in a letter that it was assuming a new company name and 
corporate identity and refused to take on douglas contract 
douglas star of spartacus lust for life and more than 
70 other films had claimed that the contract was supposed to 
continue if the sperry product line or corporate identity survived a 
merger the suit cited the continued marketing of some products with 
the sperry logo 
unisys maintained that a clause in douglas contract said that in 
the event of a merger the contract would not continue unless both 
parties agreed said peter hynes spokesman for the blue bell 
pabased information systems company 
i am grateful to go back to the world of make believe said 
douglas who was accompanied in court by his wife anne 
douglas made personal appearances television commercials and 
said he interrupted filming of tough guys with burt lancaster to 
make a promotional film for sperry he said he hasnt worked for any 
other companies as a spokesman but would consider doing it again

stock prices pushed ahead today extending the 
advance that carried the market to new postcrash highs on wednesday 
analysts said some traders had grown leery of chasing after 
stocks following the markets latest rally which produced gains in 
each of the first seven trading days in july 
but wall streeters were looking ahead optimistically to several 
economic reports due from the government on friday including 
monthly statistics on industrial production and the producer price 
index of finished goods 
the figures are expected to provide further confirmation that 
economic growth is slowing fulfilling a primary goal of the federal 
reserves credit policy 
investors will give especially close scrutiny to the report on 
producer prices which if it lives up to its advance billing will 
show a slackening of inflationary pressures

byproduct of dealers desires to lighten their holdings of west

earlyjuly sales of north americanmade cars and 
light trucks jumped 89 percent over the same period last year the 
companies reported thursday 
the eight major usbased automakers reported they sold vehicles 
at an average rate of 35614 a day during the july 110 period this 
year compared with a rate of 32696 during the same time last year 
car sales were up 93 percent and truck sales rose 83 percent 
its got to be surprising that they were up that much said 
analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc 
of new york 
but david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc said he had 
expected sales to be a bit stronger because general motors had been 
advertising in incentive programs to take delivery by july 10 
earlyjuly sales were inflated by that artificial july 10 
deadline he said adding he expected slower midjuly sales 
general motors corps earlyjuly car sales were up 113 percent 
and ford motor cos car sales rose 169 percent car sales by 
chrysler corp fell 58 percent 
chrysler is plagued with product availability problems heaney 
and healy said the company is getting production and marketing for 
its dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim in line as it phases out its 
kcars the reliant and aries 
its a phasing out and a phasing in and thats combined with an 
overall weak market heaney said 
the industrys earlyjuly increases are compared with a period 
last year that worked out to be just about on trend for the entire 
year the secondbest in the industrys history 
but for 1989 as a whole sales this year are lagging behind last 
years pace 
the eight companies reported their combined car and light truck 
sales ran 44 percent behind last years pace through july 10 so 
far this yea the automakers have sold vehicles at a daily rate of 
38100 compared with a rate of 39835 a day last year 
car sales were down 56 percent and truck sales were off 21 
percent 
one of the surprises in the earlyjuly sales figures was a 318 
percent drop in sales of usmade hondas demand for the cars has 
been tapering off and the company has offered its dealers incentives 
to get customers in showrooms 
heaney said there may be another problem 
theres going to be a new accord launched in the fall and when 
you know that why do you want to buy last years model she said 
among the big three ford sold cars at a daily rate of 6923 
during early july this year up from a 5919 caraday rate during 
the same time last year fords car sales so far this year were 
running 25 percent behind last years pace 
ford truck dealers were selling 36 percent more vehicles in 
early july this year than last year but 38 percent fewer so far 
this year 
gms car sales went at a daily rate of 10615 during early july 
this year compared with a rate of 9534 during the same time last 
year gms car sales for the year were down 9 percent from last year 
the companys truck sales ran 132 percent ahead of last years 
pace in early july but were down 28 percent for the entire year 
chryslers car sales fell to a daily rate of 2921 this year from 
the 3100 daily rate of a year ago for the calendar year

lockheed corp reported a 27 percent 
drop in its secondquarter earnings and blamed much of the fall on 
the costs of three aircraft programs 
the aerospace company said its aftertax earnings in the second 
quarter fell to 77 million or 120 a share from 106 million or 
177 a share in 1988s second quarter 
revenue declined 3 percent to 245 billion from 253 billion a 
year earlier 
dan tellep lockheeds chairman and chief executive said the 
deterioration in profit reflected 27 million in costs involving 
three aircraft programs 
one of the programs included a phaseout of lockheeds p3 
aircraft production the plane designed for hunting submarines had 
no customer prospects 
the us navy last year selected lockheed for development of the 
p7a a new generation antisub plane 
the other two programs on which cost adjustments were made 
involve fixedprice development contracts for modifications to two 
air force c5as to transport space cargo and modification of a c141 
for an advance radar test bed 
the overall decline in 1989 revenue and earnings was largely due 
to the cost of completing the new generation c5b tellep said in a 
news release which called the outlook for new defense contracts 
flat to declining 
we remain confident that lockheeds strong core business 
programs will provide the basis for resumed earnings growth in 
1990 tellep said pointing to continuing projects such as the 
stealth fighter plane and the p7a 
lockheed in april issued 107 million shares for the esop plan 
and successfully thwarted dallas investor harold simmons effort to 
take over the aerospace company 
lockheeds move put 17 percent of the companys stock in employee 
hands making it impossible for simmons to acquire the 85 percent 
needed for buyout approval lockheed acted before simmons made a 
tender offer 
for the first half of the year lockheed earned 139 million or 
225 a share down 37 percent from earnings of 220 million or 
361 a share in 1988s first six months 
revenue amounted to 445 billion down from 492 billion

pilots at northwest airlines continued 
mediated contract talks thursday but a union spokesman said the 
group is growing weary of the negotiations 
we have made progress in the past few months but not enough 
progress said andy murphy a spokesman for the air line pilots 
association this thing has been going on for 2 years and our 
pilots are running out of patience 
curt kruse another spokesman for the pilots told the st paul 
pioneer press dispatch wednesday that the union would consider 
asking for an impasse which would free the pilots to strike after a 
30day cooling off period such a request would be decided by the 
national mediation board 
kruse told the newspaper the union would back away from 
considering such a request only if the two sides reach a tentative 
settlement or make substantial progress in their bargaining by 
friday 
but murphy backed away from the remark thursday saying a request 
for an impasse is only one of several options being considered by 
the pilots 
he said the group is likely to make a statement next week about 
the status of negotiations which resumed this week for the first 
time since midjune when northwest accepted a 4 billion buyout 
proposal from los angeles investor alfred checchi 
former republic airlines pilots who joined northwest in the 
acquisition of republic in late 1986 have been without a contract 
for the past 2 years while the contract covering northwest pilots 
expired three years ago 
talks to bring the pilots under one pact began in april 1987 and 
broke off last november when 96 percent voted to authorize a 
strike northwest then requested federal mediation and talks resumed 
in december 
murphy said more progress has been made in the past two months 
than in the previous two years but he said serious disagreements 
remain over wages work rules and benefits 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said its a positive sign that 
the two sides are still at the bargaining table 
as long as we are meeting we can move toward an agreement 
said northwest spokesman bob gibbons there is momentum there and 
hopefully we can keep that going

lawyers seeking to represent more than 80000 
people filed suit thursday against the investment firm drexel 
burnham lambert inc and leveraged buyout specialist kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co seeking to reverse the 24 billion takeover of jim 
walter corp two years ago 
the lawsuit filed in state court in beaumont claims the buyout 
was a fraudulent attempt to escape more than 3 billion in 
liabilities stemming from asbestos claims against celotex corp a 
subsidiary of tampa flabased homebuilder jim walter also named 
as a defendant 
jim walter last year sold celotex a longtime producer of 
asbestos which has been proven to cause cancer and other health 
problems 
i think this will prove to be a landmark case in this 
country houston attorney stephen susman said after the lawsuit 
was filed 
however spokesman for kohlberg kravis and jim walter said the 
claims were similar to those in a suit already in federal court and 
were without merit 
the suit which asks for class action status seeks no monetary 
damages for three named plaintiffs or for the thousands of others it 
says have similar separate lawsuits pending in courts around the 
country 
instead it attempts to prevent the further sale of any jim 
walter assets and to hold kohlberg kravis and the remaining 
corporate structure responsible for any judgments related to 
asbestosrelated lawsuits 
we want to undo this transaction susman said we want the 
people responsible for this transaction to be liable for any 
judgments in favor of more than 80000 people who are seeking 
justice 
the suit alleges kohlberg kravis 1987 buyout of jim walter was 
part of a scheme by jim walter to evade its liability in the growing 
number of lawsuits being filed against celotex 
the intended effect of these transactions was to strip jim 
walter of virtually all of its valuable assets and as a necessary 
consequence to limit the resources available to satisfy asbestos 
judgments against celotex and jim walter the lawsuit states 
about 2 billion of the buyout was financed by bank loans and 
the investment group led by kohlberg kravis later sold bonds through 
drexel to replace the bank debt selected jim walter assets have 
since been sold to help pay for the deal 
this was a standard gardenvariety leveraged buyout jim 
walter spokesman david townsend said thursday consequently our 
position has been and continues to be that the allegations set forth 
in the previous federal complaint and in this complaint are 
totally without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
the federal suit is similar but names neither drexel or kohlberg 
kravis as defendants and is limited to those plaintiffs who filed 
their asbestos lawsuits within the eastern district of texas susman 
said 
kohlberg kravis spokesman tom daly said the lawsuit addressed 
the same substantive issues that are already in federal court 
that suit is without merit and we think well win it 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the firm declined comment on 
the suit since it had not seen it

mccaw cellular communications inc is 
discussing a 12750 per share buyout offer for lin broadcasting 
corp that would give lin shareholders stock in mccaw the companies 
said thursday 
a mccaw spokesman said the new cash and common stock offer 
replaces the 110 per share cash offer mccaw made for lin on monday 
following a new york court settlement unfavorable to lin that offer 
was to expire july 21 
the new offer raises to 62 billion the total amount mccaw would 
have to spend to acquire the 902 percent of lins 539 million 
shares that it does not already own the 110 a share offer was 
worth 536 billion 
if the kirkland washbased mccaws takeover attempt is 
successful it would solidify mccaws position as the nations 
largest cellular telephone company 
the new offer came after lin complained that the 110 per share 
offer was less than what mccaw believes lin is worth 
the offer of 110 per share is gone negotiations led to a 
higher price potential said steven bruce of abernathy macgregor 
mccaws outside public investor relations counsel in new york 
he said the price was upped in an attempt to reach a friendly 
transaction 
negotiations resumed between the two companies advisers on 
tuesday 
bruce said the cash portion of the new offer could be higher than 
110 per share mccaw had originally bid 120 per share for mccaw 
the amount of mccaw that would be held by lin will be determined 
by the final cash offer and the price of mccaw stock on the day a 
deal is closed bruce said it is not clear if the class a common 
stock would be new stock or existing shares he said the shares 
will have voting rights he said 
the offer means participation by lin in mccaw he said when 
asked if lin wants participation on mccaws board he said 
everything is under discussion 
trading in both companies stocks was heavy on thursday they are 
each traded in the overthecounter market 
mccaw closed at 40 per share down 12 cents on a trading 
volume of 11 million shares lin rose 250 a share to 11675 on 
volume of nearly 18 million shares 
in a joint statement the companies said the proposal provides 
for each share of lin stock to be exchanged for cash and stock 
having an aggregate value of 12750 a share 
the companies cautioned that there can be no assurances the 
new offer will result in an agreement 
the announcement came a day after mccaw disclosed in a filing 
with the securities and exchange commission that mccaw and lin had 
recommenced negotiations through their advisers 
the new york court of appeals recently denied lins claims to 
certain cellular interests of metromedia co in the new york city 
and philadelphia markets

an antinuclear group that has led a general 
electric co boycott for three years released figures thursday aimed 
at showing the campaign has cost the corporate giant 506 million 
in lost business ge rejected the claims 
the group infact based the calculation on the number of people 
whom it said have joined the boycott in an attempt to drive ge and 
other defense contractors out of the nuclear weapons industry 
ge wants you to think it brings good things to life said 
nancy cole executive director of the group it also brings death 
and destruction we think thats got to be stopped 
infact stands for infant formula action coalition the 
bostonbased group organized a boycott of the nestle co a decade 
ago to stop that company from selling what infact said was unsafe 
powdered babys milk the group switched to the ge boycott in july 
1986 and has claimed widespread success 
by infacts calculations at least 253 million people worldwide 
have stopped buying ge products because of the boycott resulting in 
lost revenue to the company of 2532 million in heavily populated 
areas of the united states and an equal amount elsewhere 
ge spokesman george jamison rejected infacts assertions 
anybody can claim anything jamison said the facts of the 
matter are since 1985 ge revenues are up 56 percent from 32 
billion to 50 billion earnings are up 49 percent also during that 
time market share has increased in all ge consumer businesses 
these are facts which are reported in our annual report they speak 
for themselves 
ge based in fairfield conn makes products ranging from 
dishwashers to jet engines to hightech medical equipment it is one 
of the nations leading defense contractors and the fifthlargest 
us industrial concern 
the company also owns the nbc television network and a 
controlling interest in kidder peabody group inc a large wall 
street investment firm 
infact has targeted ge because of what it calls the companys 
extensive involvement in the production and promotion of nuclear 
weaons and the trail of radioactive and toxic waste the companys 
nuclear weapons work leaves behind 
jamison said infacts goal is unilateral disarmament we want 
peace every bit as much as infact does but along with a majority of 
the american people ge believes it can be assured only by a strong 
national defense

general electric co in response to an 
inquiry from the new york stock exchange said thursday that it had 
no discussions about nor interest in acquiring honeywell inc 
the fairfield conn company issued its brief statement after 
honeywell stock jumped 6 a share to close at 8550 on the 
exchange ge stock was unchanged at 5438 
ge did not comment beyond its statement and stock exchange 
officials left work before they could be contacted about it 
late last week analysts attributed a similar increase in 
honeywells stock price to a rumor published in business week that 
ge was considering acquiring the automated controls makers general 
electric previously declined to comment on the rumor and honeywell 
has refused to comment on all takeover speculation 
before honeywell stock declined 175 tuesday it had been pushed 
up more than 9 in the two previous days of trading it was down 
slightly wednesday before surging again thursday when more than 21 
million shares traded hands 
the stock is trading very heavily said kurt rivard of 
minneapolisbased dain bosworth inc the action youre seeing in 
honeywell can be attributed to more than the general electric 
rumor 
rivard said honeywells value to an acquirer could range from 
110 a share to 140 a share 
thursdays trading included the sale of a 500000share block of 
honeywell stock at the market price rivard said it was unclear who 
moved the block he said 
takeover rumors concerning honeywell intensified after the 
company lost 435 million in its fiscal 1988 
chairman james renier said at the companys annual meeting may 5 
that the speculation was inevitable given the discrepancy between 
stock market values and perceived trueasset values 
with the exception of fiscal 1987 honeywells financial 
performance has lagged for the past seven years 
the company sought approval at the annual meeting of two 
antitakeover measures but an opposition group led by north 
american partners of fort worth texas lobbied to defeat the 
proposals in a proxy fight 
north american has said it is not interested in acquiring 
honeywell

a housesenate conference trying to craft a 
savings and loan bailout bill adjourned thursday night after 5 
hours of bitter and fruitless debate over how to proceed on a senate 
compromise proposal 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady issued a statement that the 
administration would strongly support the senate offer although 
he said he wanted to review the details 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich the leader of the fivemember 
senate team suprised many house members by starting the session 
with a senate offer for a comprehensive compromise and asking them 
to consider it overnight or over the weekend 
but the huge 94member house delegation was unable to respond 
because its leader rep henry b gonzalez dtexas has divided the 
delegation into platoons of between 20 and 30 members each with 
jurisdiction over part of the bill 
house delegates responded to riegle by voting to put the senate 
offer aside and proceeded to try to tackle the massive sampl bill 
issue by issue as senators sat rolling their eyes 
the house side made proposals on capital standards and funding 
essentially mirroring the original house bill but the senate 
refused to consider them 
at the end of the session shortly after 8 pm the only thing 
the two sides could agree on was a motion to meet at 10 am friday 
and try again 
riegle explaining that each position in the senate offer was 
crossconnected with the others said the senate could not 
proceed as the house wished and could only respond to a package 
counter offer from the house 
i dont think were communicating here sen john heinz 
rpa said 
rep jim leach riowa said riegle had made a bold 
imaginative offer designed to seize the leadership of the 
conference 
meanwhile sen jake garn rutah released a letter written from 
hungary by president bush who expressed strong support for the 
administrations plan to keep sampl rescue spending out of the budget 
deficit 
its the first time bush has addressed the issue personally 
although brady has threatened to recommend a veto if congress fails 
to adopt the administration plan bush did not raise the threat of a 
veto in the letter 
the conference committee which held its first substantive 
session on tuesday is trying to resolve differences between the 
senate bill passed in april and the house bill passed in june 
both sides noting that savings and loans are losing at least 10 
million a day say urgent action is needed and are aiming to send a 
compromise to the white house for bushs signature before congress 
leaves on its august vacation 
among the key elements of the senate offer are 
acceptance of the houses plan to require sampl owners to risk 3 
in real tangible capital for every 100 in lending by jan 1 1995 
the senate bill had provided a laxer standard of 150 
adoption of the senate and bush administration plan to keep sampl 
rescue spending out of the budget deficit the house had favored a 
plan that would have swelled the deficit by 44 billion over three 
years arguing that it was a more honest way of accounting for the 
spending 
a compromise on junk bond ownership by sampls limiting sampls to a 
junk bond portfolio equal to 6 percent of their assets or twice the 
amount of their capital the house had wanted to require sampls to 
sell their junk bonds within two years while the senate bill has a 
more liberal junk bond limit of 11 percent of assets 
acceptance with modification of house provisions requiring the 
sampl industryowned federal home loan banks to subsidize housing for 
poor people and forcing banks and sampls to disclose their record of 
serving poor and minority people 
adoption of a senate clause guaranteeing federal home loan bank 
board chairman m danny wall the right to serve the two years 
remaining in his term the offer also retains walls authority over 
statechartered sampls the house had wanted to transfer that 
authority to the federal deposit insurance corp 
gonzalez complained that the offer was too vague and amounted to 
little more than a letter of intent he told reporters that the 
senators by proceeding with a broad offer rather than sticking to 
the conference agenda may wind up delaying ultimate enactment of 
the bill 
in a 6hour session tuesday legislators agreed to raise civil 
and criminal fines for bank and sampl fraud to a maximum of 1 million 
a day and the maximum jail term to five years

the developer of dallas upscale galleria shopping 
and office complex announced plans thursday to build a signature 
office tower for oryx energy co the citys first major skyscraper 
construction in several years 
the announcement of the 26 to 28story building does not 
necessarily mean the citys lagging real estate market has 
recovered analysts said but nevertheless is welcome 
i dont think it signals a turnaround it signals a situation 
where you had a large user with a specific need said thomas 
katopody a partner in the dallas office of kenneth leventhal amp co 
accountants he said there is a twoyear supply of office space 
already built with about a oneyear inventory of class a space 
neither will the tower add to downtowns distinctive skyline as 
it will be built about seven miles north of the central business 
district near the intersection of two major highways 
the building will be part of the galleria complex which includes 
two office towers one of 24 stories and one of 25 a westin hotel 
and a fourstory shopping mall the complex was built by houston 
developer gerald d hines interests 
nearby is the 24story occidental tower headquarters of 
occidental chemical corp a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corp 
staman ogilvie executive vice president of hines refused to 
discuss the buildings cost but analysts said it could run as high 
as 200 a square foot or about 118 million for the 590000 square 
feet 
construction will begin after the first of the year with oryx 
north americas largest independent oil company moving in by the 
end of 1991 ogilvie said 
neither he nor the company would disclose leasing or equity 
arrangements and ogilvie said the company still is pursuing 
financing 
he said many financiers were surprised when contacted about new 
construction in dallas but oryx longterm lease commitment makes 
the project a very financiable undertaking 
the oryx headquarters had been a hotly contested prize in dallas 
hungry real estate community but company officials said there just 
wasnt enough quality space in one place despite millions of empty 
square feet available 
we wanted a building where we would be the only tenant or at 
least the major tenant oryx chairman robert p hauptfuhrer said 
we want to establish a definite identity and presence in the 
business community so a dallas location that will be recognized by 
all as the oryx energy building was a major consideration 
oryx will move about 1000 of its employees into the new building 
from two locations elsewhere in dallas 
oryx formerly was known as sun exploration amp production co 
before it was spun off last year by parent sun co which kept the 
retailing and refining end of the business 
the last major skyscraper built in dallas was cityplace center a 
42story building announced in 1984 and completed last year it 
remains about half empty occupied mainly by builder southland 
corp owner of the 7eleven convenience store chain 
most of the citys other towers were finished by 1987 and none 
are currently under construction

a federal judge thursday denied a request by an 
italian company to block a chicago board of trade order that is 
forcing the firm to sell a huge quantity of soybean futures 
the lawsuit filed by ferruzzi trading international sa and 
ferruzzi usa inc both subsidiaries of ferruzzi finanziara spa 
sought the restraining order and a permanent injunction against the 
exchanges directive published reports have said the firm was the 
object of the directive because it was trying to corner the soybean 
market something ferruzzi spokesmen deny 
the lawsuit claimed ferruzzi had been irreparably injured by the 
board of trades order which it said would diminish confidence in 
the market and hurt us farmers 
but us district judge james zagel who denied the request for a 
temporary injunction said blocking the cbots order could cause 
harm to the public 
the preservation of procedures adopted by the board of trade is 
in the interest of the public zagel said in issuing his 
lateafternoon decision 
ferruzzis attorney james fox said he did not know whether the 
italian firm would pursue the lawsuit or seek monetary damages 
cbot chairman karsten mahlmann praised the decision he told a 
news conference late thursday that there were over 40 million july 
soybean contracts open and abnormally low levels of stocks available 
to satisfy the contracts which would have resulted in a number of 
defaults without the exchanges order 
he said the exchanges business conduct committee tried to 
promote the orderly liquidation of the contracts but not enough 
market participants responded 
during the hearing before zagel fox said the emergency order 
forced the italian firm to reduce its holdings of july soybean 
contracts by 20 percent on wednesday and another 20 percent 
thursday he said the order did irreparable damage to ferruzzi 
cbot attorney john e angle said the exchange had entered into 
discussions with ferruzzi officials and had asked them to reduce 
their futures contracts but they refused to comply 
board of trade spokesman raymond carmichael said previously the 
exchange would vigorously fight the lawsuit 
soybean futures prices rose sharply thursday in reaction to news 
of the lawsuit soybeans for delivery in july settled at 697 a 
bushel 11 cents above the previous days settlement the july 
contract skidded 39 cents on wednesday 
in two related developments the american soybean association 
called for an investigation of the board of trades directive and 
the minnesota agriculture commissioner asked the fbi to check 
whether board of trade officials may have benefited from the effects 
of the order 
the board of trade the worlds largest market for grain and 
soybean futures issued the emergency order tuesday requiring any 
player holding obligations to receive or deliver more than 3 million 
bushels of soybeans for july delivery to reduce those holdings to 1 
million bushels by the end of trading thursday when the july 
contract expires 
ferruzzis lawsuit said the company holds obligations to take 
delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans ferruzzi also is 
believed to own a large quantity of physical soybeans 
if it does not reduce its position in the futures market 
ferruzzi theoretically could force those on the other end of its 
futures contracts to deliver possibly causing a scramble for 
supplies that would drive the price of its soybeans up sharply 
ferruzzi has said it accumulated large soybean supplies to keep 
its processing plants running and to meet export commitments and 
that its large futures market position was a hedge against price 
fluctuations 
carmichael said the exchanges board of directors issued its 
order because it appeared there might not be enough deliverable 
soybeans available to satisfy all the contracts 
the board of trade did not mention ferruzzi in its order and has 
refused to further explain the reasons for its decision however 
rumors among market watchers have pointed to ferruzzi 
in issuing the order the exchange cited federal regulations that 
allow it take such action to ensure the orderly expiration of a 
futures contract 
the st louisbased american soybean association urged the board 
of trade to fully explain the reasons behind its order to soybean 
producers and processors and saying failure to do so would be 
another blow to the credibility of the board 
minnesota agriculture commissioner jim nichols on wednesday asked 
the fbi to investigate whether any board of trade officials 
benefited from the emergency order 
in a letter to fbi director william sessions nichols said it was 
possible that some bot board members who made the order held short 
positions obligations to sell soybeans and benefited from the 
price drop following the order 
exchange spokesmen would not comment on the developments 
but an exchange official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
dismissed as sour grapes the complaints of traders who ended up on 
the losing side of wednesdays dizzying drop in soybean prices 
any time you have any sort of order affecting the market youre 
going to have someone complaining about it he said someone is 
always on the other side 
some traders said the exchange should have left the market alone 
to sort itself out others said the emergency order spawned 
confusion and public mistrust at time when the board of trades 
image has been tarnished by a federal investigation of suspected 
trading fraud 
exchange member james merritt a 22year veteran of the grain 
pits said soybean farmers a group the board of trade has been 
wooing for years felt betrayed 
they feel like why should they try to legitimately hedge when 
the sanctity of the contracts are being questioned said merritt 
research director for merchants trading co 
theyre having second thoughts about this right now and i think 
i probably speak for the entire brokerage community in saying that 
its become quite an emotional issue
