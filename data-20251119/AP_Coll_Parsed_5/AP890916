hundreds of people filled a school 
auditorium friday night to remember with prayer and hymns the 10 
victims of wednesdays pyro mining co disaster 
gov wallace wilkinson said kentuckians in general and the 
families of pyro mining co miners in particular share in the 
immense grief 
tragedies like this one make us mindful of the fragile 
nature of the thread that holds us together wilkinson said during 
the service at union county high school near this western kentucky 
community 
the auditorum with seating for 700 appeared to be nearly 
filled a large wreath with yellow mums and white carnations backed 
the podium onstage with more flowers and ferns and a candle for 
each of the victims in the foreground 
an american flag was at one side of the stage and the crowd sang 
amazing grace 
in the investigation of william station mine near wheatcroft 
was delayed as officials of pyro and state and federal agencies 
attempted to clear explosive levels of methane that persisted around 
the explosion site 
investigators entered the mine friday afternoon in an attempt to 
reduce the hazardous methane levels 
officials of the us mine safety and health administration 
approved with modifications a company plan for reducing methane 
levels said kathy snyder spokeswoman for msha if the plan is 
successful officials will remain underground and the probe will 
begin she said 
earlier friday the head of a publicinterest law firm said pyro 
and federal authorities failed to prevent the disaster even though 
there were plenty of warning signs 
this year federal inspectors briefly shut down the william 
station mine because of imminent dangers said j davitt 
mcateer executive director of the occupational safety and health 
law center 
pyro reported 267 accidents at the underground mine since 1985 
but failed to report several others mcateer said 
last year for example an msha audit of mine records revealed 
pyro did not report eight accidents at william station seven of 
which forced workers to miss work mcateer said accidents also went 
unreported the two previous years he said 
ed calman a pyro spokesman refused to discuss the companys 
safety record he said pyro would reserve further comment until 
company state and federal officials completed their investigation 
of the accident which was expected to take several weeks 
mcateer said msha was too lenient on pyro after it discovered 
blatant safety violations at william station 
he said william station had a coaldust explosion in september 
1988 which injured two miners and a methane ignition three months 
later which injured no one in 1985 one miner was electrocuted at 
the mine and another died in an explosion he said 
the following year another miner died at william station 
although mcateer said the report submitted to msha by the company 
didnt specify a cause of death 
msha spokesman frank ogorman who could not immediately verify 
that pyro failed to report some accidents denied mcateers claim 
that his agency did not properly police pyro was totally false

for 12 years guenter bachmann 
worked as a loading dock supervisor at a state cooperative in east 
germany then he got tired of not being able to say what he really 
thought 
last week bachmann and his wife sabina packed the family car 
with a few belongings and headed for hungary to join thousands of 
their countrymen streaming to the west over hungarys border with 
austria 
it just hit me all of a sudden the heavyset 33yearold 
bachmann said outside a refugee camp in west germanys picturesque 
bavarian countryside 
i just finally had enough of never being able to say what i 
really thought and there was no hint it was ever going to change 
the estimated 14000 east germans who fled to the west via 
hungary in the past week come from all walks of life ranging from 
laborers to tradesmen from bakers to doctors and lawyers 
their exodus occurred amid increasing pressure for democratic 
reforms across eastern europe which has rejected the need for 
economic and political reforms under way in the soviet union poland 
and hungary 
east germany enjoys the best standard of living in the east bloc 
but shortages are an aggravating fact of daily life 
dissent quickly is silenced by security forces demonstrators 
demanding democracy routinely are beaten and jailed 
public dissatisfaction in the hardline communist nation of 16 
million has mounted steadily 
according to the west german ministry for intergerman affairs 
74 percent of east germans who have come to west germany since 
august left because of a lack of freedom of expression and human 
rights 
the discontent is causing east germany to lose some of its best 
workers in the countrys biggest drain of talent since the berlin 
wall went up in 1961 
a ministry report published thursday said 55 percent of east 
german refugees who have come to west germany since august are 
between 18 and 30 years old and 86 percent have high levels of job 
training 
the survey said the majority enjoyed relatively comfortable 
lifestyles in east germany nearly all owned a television more than 
half of them color sixtyone percent owned cars according to the 
report 
but it wasnt enough to keep them in east germany 
when you read the stateowned newspapers you feel like they 
really must take you for a fool said karl dengler a chemical 
engineering student from leipzig who was interviewed after crossing 
into the west the paper declares one production success after 
another and east germanys commitment to human rights while in 
reality you still have to wait 15 years for what passes for a car 
and land in jail if you show a banner praising soviet glasnost 
hermann knorr 25 said he decided to leave out of frustration at 
not being able to change the system 
you talk and talk in small groups and nothing ever happens 
said knorr a former communist party member who was close to 
finishing a law degree in east berlin 
when i finally gave up and tried to organize illegal 
discussion groups the state security paid me a visit 
knorr said he had wanted to stay in east germany but lost all 
hope 
many young refugees said the aggravations of daily life became 
unbearable when added to severe travel restrictions to the west and 
lack of free expression 
when i applied for an apartment of my own i was told that the 
wait would be 10 years said heidi brueckl who was a medical 
assistant in gera 
i get along with my parents all right but i dont think i need 
to live with them until im 35 i want to be able to live my own 
life 
anna schroetter a 27yearold textile worker form leipzig said 
she was proud of some of the achievements of her country especially 
social programs that guaranteed free day care and other services 
but what good is day care and kindergarten when your children 
are drilled full of ideological nonsense what good are guarantees 
of a job when you have no real say in the work place she asked

rock n roll pioneer dick clark said 
friday hes donating hundreds of videotapes films and other 
memorabilia for a music museum in a 30story pyramid being built 
along the mississippi river 
ive got a great collection of stuff to share clark said 
clarks announcement was to have kicked off a night of parades 
music and fireworks to mark the start of construction of the 56 
million pyramid intended as the centerpiece of a 200 million 
tourist theme park billed as a musical disneyland 
then it rained and the party was postponed 24 hours leaving 
thousands of wouldbe revelers wandering aimlessly past soggy beer 
and souvenir stands and the empty soundstages set up for 
streetparty bands 
promoters had promised for weeks that the celebration called the 
big dig would be the biggest party memphis had ever seen but

ton of explosives and a laserlight show outlining the shape of the 
321foot pyramid 
police said they had expected up to 100000 spectators for the 
show but were unable to count the sparse crowd that showed up 
because it was too scattered through downtown 
were going to have the whole show tomorrow night shlenker 
said it just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken 
out of our hands it rained so hard that weve got pools of water 
its just too dangerous with the electrical equipment to risk 
peoples lives 
a latenight rock n roll concert featuring comedian dan aykroyd 
and his blues brothers review was to go on as scheduled at an 
amphitheater on the citys mud island tourist park near the pyramid 
site 
clark who helped usher in rock n roll with his tv show 
american bandstand said the museum will be a hall of fame 
linked to his annual american music awards the museum will include 
computerized displays with recordings and videotapes of the nations 
musical past 
youll be able to punch up a date and find out what musically 
was happening what world events were happening and what it meant to 
your life clark said 
the concrete and stainless steel pyramid is scheduled to open in 
may 1991 it is called the great american pyramid

president bush anxious for money to launch the 
war on drugs says he is ready to deal with senate democrats seeking 
to expand the program by 22 billion now and enlarge it in the 
future 
were flexible in terms of the funding method bush said at a 
white house luncheon friday but i strongly believe we must return 
the integrated elements of this drug strategy which took more than 
six months to develop 
his comment came as a senate bipartisan task force came away from 
two hours of negotiations friday with republicans promising to 
present a fresh financing plan when talks resume monday 
meanwhile the rev jesse l jackson told the house select 
committee on narcotics the bush plan does not match the breadth of 
this social crisis and urged summitstyle talks to draw up a new 
version 
in the senate the democratic plan to generate an additional 22 
billion through a halfpercent acrosstheboard cut in federal 
programs remained part of a money bill for transportation programs 
awaiting final floor action 
the administration opposes the idea offered by senate 
appropriations committee chairman robert c byrd dwva which 
would slice 18 billion from the defense departments budget 
we cant afford to sacrifice our military preparedness bush 
said friday 
democrats were confident following the initial session of the 
task force made up of nine republican and nine democratic senators 
it was a good step byrd told a news conference 
democrats said however that money agreements reached now would 
be only a start on the drug war and that they have fundamental 
disagreements with the bush administration over what its size and 
scale should be 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
said democrats eventually want to expand the attack on cocaine 
dealers beyond what has been envisioned thus far by republicans and 
provide more treatment and education 
national drug policy director william j bennett author of the 
drug plan says it most likely will be expanded in the future and an 
updated version is due in february he also says the 
administrations request is a sharp increase over a drugfighting 
budget that was only 2 billion three years ago 
jackson drew applause and scattered shouts of approval from 
spectators as he told the house select committee on narcotics the 
nation needs a new initiative equal to the scope and depth of the 
problem 
he criticized the plan for lack of enforcement strength aid for 
the poor and input from national and community leaders with 
experience in fighting drugs he said a meeting at the camp david 
presidential retreat should be convened to redraw the strategy 
jackson was sharply critical of both bennett and the president 
in april mr bennett announced that he would take 
comprehensive emergency action to attack the drug crisis in the 
nations capital jackson said five months later we still have 
the emergency but no action 
president bush announced a drug plan for bogota colombia 
where is his plan for the district of columbia and cities around the 
nation he said 
jackson reported to be weighing a race for mayor of washington 
suggested the nations capital could be a model for fighting the 
drug scourge he was asked what his role in that effort would be 
a volunteer he said

patients worried they may be infected with the 
aids virus will be able to get a quick and confidential answer soon 
with a simple test that takes only 10 minutes 
the test now undergoing trials at nine centers will enable 
people to get results quickly in a doctors office instead of having 
to wait to hear from a distant laboratory 
it provides a new means for patients to learn of their aids 
status and still retain anonymity said jarel r kelsey president 
of murex corp a norcross ga firm that developed the test 
once this method is widely available it will encourage more 
people to determine their status 
tests for aids now require that blood be drawn and sent to a 
laboratory for complex processing patients must wait to find out if 
they have contracted the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which 
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids 
that can take a number of days sometimes said kelsey 
concern about whether the test information will be kept 
confidential and the long wait for results discourage some people 
from being tested for aids even though they may be at risk for the 
disease he said 
the new test called suds for single use diagnostic system takes 
away some of that anxiety 
it consists of a small plastic disk slightly thicker than a 
camera lens cap that is filled with an absorbent material a 
coneshaped indention on top leads down to a small hole that exposes 
the absorbent material 
a suds test starts with a blood sample obtained from a simple 
finger stick two drops of serum the clear fluid in blood are 
separated from the sample and then combined with two reactant 
solutions the mixture is poured into the cone of the test cartridge 
inside the tester the sample mixture is absorbed and pulled 
through a color reactant if a dot on the bottom of the disk remains 
white there is no aids virus a blue dot means an aids infection 
the whole process takes about 10 minutes 
kelsey said the system works through the use of microscopic latex 
beads that are coated with proteins that react to aids antibodies 
an antibody is a molecule in the blood produced by the bodys immune 
system to attack specific invaders such as bacteria or virus the 
proteins used in suds react to antibodies created by the immune 
system in response to both the outer membrane and the core of the 
hiv virus 
suds is being tested at selected doctors offices sexual disease 
clinics hospitals and blood banks the trials started in july and 
more than 5000 tests have been conducted 
the trials so far have shown an average accuracy rate of 998 
percent said kelsey any specimen that has evidence of aids 
antibody has been detected by the system so we are really achieving 
levels of 100 percent sensitivity 
clinical trials of suds end in october and the food and drug 
administration is expected to approve a license quickly kelsey said 
fda spokesman brad stone said the agency does not announce its 
intentions ahead of time and will have to study the data but he 
noted we recognize the need to get any test for aids out as soon 
as possible 
although the suds test is very simple to conduct kelsey said it 
will not be sold for home use 
everybody is aware that exposure to the hiv is a terminal 
condition he said having that information revealed without 
counseling immediately available could be a traumatic experience

president bush is standing by his opposition to 
a federal ban on assault weapons saying he doubts such a law 
could ever safeguard against a tragedy like the shooting rampage 
in louisville ky 
i have seen no evidence that banning a specific weapon is going 
to guard against it bush said friday referring to the shooting 
spree in a printing plant the day before that left eight dead and 13 
wounded 
the president at a news conference called the shootings the 
work of a deranged individual and said it is terrible and the 
loss of human life is horrible 
but bush a life member of the national rifle association said 
instead of enacting new laws we must do everything we can to 
enforce laws that are already on the books 
bush was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat in camp 
david md before heading west on a twoday trip next week he will 
participate in bicentennial ceremonies in south dakota montana and 
washington on monday 
at the news conference for outoftown reporters bush also 
repeated his opposition to raising federal taxes to pay for the 
war against drugs but said he would not criticize state or local 
governments that did so 
said the nations education system is not making the grade 
and hoped his sept 2728 education summit with the nations 
governors would lead to national educational goals and objectives 
for schools 
rejected a suggestion that the united states divert funds from 
its contribution to nato to pay for the drug war lets not let 
down our alliance guarantees because we are more optimistic about 
peace he said 
indicated he was giving serious and active consideration to 
using former military bases to house prisoners from overcrowded 
prisons 
bush was asked what he would tell the families of victims of 
thursdays shooting spree in a louisville printing plant in which a 
worker with several automatic weapons went from floor to floor 
shooting down former coworkers 
id tell them i feel horrible about the loss of life 
but he added i would tell them i dont think banning weapons 
is going to be the ultimate answer or could ever safeguard against 
that kind of tragedy 
he recalled automatic weapons were not involved in the 1966 
shooting spree by charles whitman who climbed to the top of a tower 
at the university of texas at austin with three rifles two pistols 
and a shotgun he shot 44 people killing 14 before being killed 
himself 
he also said that in the 1960s when he was a member of the house 
of representatives he went to a police station in the district of 
columbia to register my arsenal of a rifle and a shotgun to 
comply with the law 
the guy looked at me like id lost his mind bush said 
adding that only a small percentage of gun owners were complying 
with the law bush said he asked the officer if police were 
getting a lot of criminals to turn their guns in 
he said no its just a bunch of suckers like you from 
northwest washington and it made a profound impression on me 
bush banned the import of foreignmade assault rifles into the 
united states including the ak47 the weapon used in louisville 
however possession of these weapons is not a federal offense 
nor does the import ban prevent them from being manufactured 
domestically

nasa has white house approval to proceed with 
its muchdebated october launch of a nuclearpowered satellite to 
jupiter 
president bushs science adviser d allan bromley signed the 
authorization friday which is required before a nuclear device is 
put into space bromley had the presidents approval said white 
house spokeswoman alixe reed 
nasa administrator richard truly was informed she said the 
mission would have been scrubbed had white house approval been 
withheld 
critics worried about nuclear fallout in case of an accident will 
ask a court to stop the launch and promise to try to put their 
bodies in the way if that doesnt work 
the galileo probe will be sent on its eightyear 14 billion 
mission from the cargo bay of the space shuttle atlantis the first 
time nuclear power has been carried on a shuttle 
the three men and two women who will be on the oct 12 mission 
were in washington today for a breakfast with vice president dan 
quayle at his residence 
quayle who intends to be at the kennedy space center for the 
liftoff heads the national space council and was particularly 
interested in meeting the astronauts because shuttle commander 
donald e williams is from indiana quayles home state 
protesters claim a challengerlike accident could poison earths 
atmosphere with the most toxic substance in the universe they 
are preparing to file suit in federal court to stop the mission and 
a protest march is scheduled to begin at cape canaveral fla on 
sunday 
bruce gagnon a leader in the florida coalition for peace and 
justice said we are going to attempt to enter the launch area and 
sit on the launch pad he has written that plutonium 238 is the 
most toxic substance in the universe if ingested it concentrates 
in the bone marrow where it can cause leukemia if inhaled it 
sticks to the lungs where it can lead to cancer 
the galileo spacecraft was originally scheduled for launch in 
january 1982 but was delayed time and again 
it is outfitted with two radioisotope thermoelectric generators 
to produce the electricity for the spacecraft science instruments 
and engineering support systems of the 22 rtgs used on previous 
missions three have been involved in accidents one releasing 
17000 curies of radioactive material 75 miles high over the indian 
ocean 
the generators use the heat from the radioactive decay of 
plutonium238 dioxide to generate electricity nasa estimates the 
probability of having a launch accident that results in the release 
of plutonium into the atmosphere is one in 2800 
rtgs similar to the ones on galileo provided the power for 
voyager 2 which recently sent back spectacular views of the planet 
neptune voyager 2 launched in 1977 was the last spacecraft 
carrying a nuclear power source

leaves them no choice 
the chairman of the panel investigating abuses at the department 
of housing and urban development said friday he would ask members to 
approve a subpoena next week republicans joined majority democrats 
in saying they would support the request 
pierces attorney paul perito said he would try to convince the 
subcommittee next week to give pierce two weeks to prepare and then 
allow him to testify voluntarily 
in another development rep bruce morrison dconn asked the 
house judiciary committee on friday to ask attorney general dick 
thornburgh to name a special prosecutor and have a grand jury 
investigate actions at hud during pierces tenure there was no 
immediate action on the request 
the house government operations subcommittee on housing and 
employment subcommittee denied peritos request friday for a 
twoweek extension for pierce to testify 
i am at a loss to understand why there is such a concern for 
speed over truth said perito 
pierce told the subcommittee thursday evening he would not appear 
the next morning prompting a number of verbal attacks from the 
panels members 
we have no option but to proceed in teaching mr pierce that 
while he may run he may not hide said subcommittee chairman tom 
lantos dcalif 
not only is silent sam silent apparently today hes also 
invisible added rep donald e buz lukens rohio using the 
derogatory nickname pierce acquired for his lowprofile demeanor as 
secretary during the reagan administration 
the subpoena vote is scheduled for wednesday but it was unclear 
when the panel would demand that pierce appear 
perito said pierce most likely would comply with any subpoena but 
left open the possibility of fighting an order if it gave pierce 
less than two weeks to prepare 
you can be assured that i will consider all options perito 
said 
the panel is investigating allegations that prominent republicans 
and former hud officials got favored treatment from the agency under 
pierce some making huge profits as consultants obtaining 
multimilliondollar federal housing contracts 
the department also is still unable to account for millions of 
dollars in connection with projects and home sales during pierces 
eight years as secretary critics blame poor management 
justice department officials have said more than 1000 
hudrelated cases are being reviewed by us attorneys around the 
country and there have been a handful of criminal and civil cases 
filed in recent months

were built between 1986 and 1988 of those 338000 were equipped 
with a plastic cover that shields the seat belt from contact with 
the metal hinge ms stinson said 
belt fraying is believed to be limited to vans without the 
plastic cover which the company began installing in 1987 to protect 
the hinge and improve the seats appearance she said

the federal government believes its time to 
inspect seafood for safety but two agencies are arguing over just 
who should put the final stamp of approval on the fish 
congress is being asked to resolve the turf battle which comes 
down to the question of whether fish are wild animals or should be 
treated like the chickens and cattle that are raised for food 
almost certain however is that the lowfat food source 
healthconscious americans have been turning to in large numbers is 
going to come under closer government scrutiny 
currently many consumers are wary about the safety of fish 
rep henry waxman dcalif they have heard many stories about 
contamination from toxic industrial and agricultural chemicals 
medical waste products and red tides 
waxmans house energy and commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment began considering legislation friday that would have the 
food and drug administration set up a comprehensive federal 
inspection program of the seafood industry 
contaminants for regular fish and shellfish include the botulism 
toxin ciguatoxin scombrotroxin salmonella bacteria and the 
hepatitisa virus not to mention pcbs and other industrial 
contaminants 
although everyone at the hearing agreed seafood needs to be 
inspected but waxmans plan drew criticism from the agriculture 
department which wants to bring fish under its meat and poultry 
inspection program 
we would not have to start from scratch said lester 
crawford administrator of the food safety and inspection service at 
the agriculture department noting the experience with meat and 
poultry 
the principles of inspection are the same regardless of the 
species he said 
the agriculture department has been named as the inspection 
agency for fish in legislation since 1986 but waxmans fish and 
fish products safety act of 1989 would require the fda to set 
safety standards 
fda commissioner frank young said its simple fish are not like 
chickens and cattle 
here we are capturing wild animals he said i dont do 
this with any kind of turf comparison but when one looks at the 
chicken and beef these are animals that are raised in standard 
ways they are housed and they are brought to the market in a chain 
that is known 
witnesses said that whichever government agency gets the task 
consumer education should be improved because many problems deal 
with errors in handling seafood at home 
ellen haas of public voice a nonprofit group dealing with food 
safety issues said federal statistics indicate the risk of a food 
poisoning outbreak from eating seafood is 25 times greater than from 
beef and 16 times greater than for either chicken or pork 
seafood consumption has been increasing as a result of efforts to 
find lowfat sources of protein young said there have been signs of 
a decline although he said the reason was unclear

the state department is calling on other 
nations to ease the burden on the united states by taking in some of 
the recent surge of emigres from the soviet union 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger issued the call 
friday as he defended the bush administration from criticism that a 
proposal to allow 50000 soviet refugees into the country in the 
next year is too conservative 
i resent the implication that we have some heartless 
niggardly conservative approach to this problem eagleburger told 
the senate judiciary subcommittee on immigration 
but there are limits on the numbers we can take he said 
citing budgetary constraints and the press of refugees worldwide 
seeking to come to the united states 
no budget deficit however large should ever induce the united 
states to abandon or compromise in any way its fundamental values 
and principles of granting safe haven to oppressed peoples 
said sen orrin hatch rutah 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the subcommittee said 
the months of administration deliberations on its soviet refugees 
strategy had given the impression that youre dealing with cans of 
beans rather than human beings 
some 150000 applications for entry mostly from jews and some 
pentacostals are expected in the 1990 fiscal year critics say 
that leaves the administrations quota figure too low 
for nearly 20 years the demand for liberalized soviet emigration 
was a cornerstone of us policy but never was it said that the 
us has an obligation to take them all in if the gates open 
eagleburger said 
he said western europe israel canada and australia should also 
offer entry to the soviets although he conceded attempts to enlist 
the other countries help over the past few months had not borne 
fruit 
i cant tell you there will be a massive willingness on the 
part of other countries he said but well continue trying 
under existing procedures most soviet emigres leave the soviet 
union with israeli visas but change course for the united states 
once they reach processing centers in rome and vienna only about 10 
percent to 15 percent go to israel 
to save money the administration will shut down the rome and 
vienna facilities once it clears up the backlog of an estimated 
30000 applicants there and process all applicants in moscow after 
oct 1 eagleburger said

a federal judges ruling will help ensure that 
presidential records are preserved for future generations says a 
lawyer involved in a suit over reagan administration computer 
records 
us district judge charles richey on friday rejected a bush 
administration motion to dismiss the case saying private citizens 
may go to court to keep the government from erasing computer records 
dealing with the irancontra affair 
fbi agents and congressional investigators delving into the 
irancontra affair used thousands of messages retrieved from the 
system called profs in piecing together the most farreaching 
scandal of the reagan administration 
former white house aide oliver north and former national security 
adviser john poindexter used the system which serves as a 
substitute for the telephone 
richeys decision goes a long way toward ensuring that 
records produced by the president are preserved for future 
generations so that chapters of history are not lost said 
katherine meyer one of the lawyers who filed the case 
richey said the administrative procedures act empowers a private 
group to seek judicial review of the presidents performance under 
the presidential records act and the federal records act he gave 
the government and private groups and individuals filing the suit 
until jan 2 to decide how to proceed 
the national security archive a nonprofit organization went to 
court jan 19 after learning the reagan white house was about to 
dispose of the contents of the profs computer system 
on the eve of the change in administrations a judge temporarily 
enjoined the government from destroying the material it includes 
computer tapes of the nsc and the executive office of the president 
as well as backup computer files 
justice department lawyers argue most of the notes arent 
presidential or agency records but are like telephone messages the 
judge questioned that assertion in a 28page opinion 
were telephone conversations in the executive branch routinely 
taped a good portion would undoubtedly qualify as presidential or 
agency records the judge said

on a sundrenched day exxon pulled out its 
cleanup crews for the winter and the state announced its own plan to 
protect fish hatcheries and untainted areas from the exxon valdez 
oil spill 
its a nice day for the first day of winter isnt it gov 
steve cowper said friday before he announced the states plans for a 
21 million program to continue cleanup work left by exxon 
but for that bit of sarcasm and a crack by his spokesman about a 
dirty dozen of soiled beaches left by exxon cowper was 
conciliatory toward the oil company responsible for the march 24 
tanker wreck that left 109 million gallons of crude oil in prince 
william sound 
the governor thanked the thousands of workers who helped scrub 
the oilfouled shorelines proclaiming friday oil spill workers 
appreciation day in alaska 
exxon pulled the crews out friday saying alaskas early winter 
makes continuing field work too risky 
i think exxon has made a goodfaith effort to clean up the 
beaches cowper said im not going to fault exxon here they 
made some mistakes and frankly some of the things the state has 
done were mistakes 
cowper said the state should have known how to clean up a major 
spill at least we should have known no one else knew how to do 
it he said 
alaskas winter program announced on a warm fall day when 
residents donned tshirts and shorts calls for 
smallscale cleanups when fish and wildlife resources are 
threatened by the remaining oil 
monitoring the oils movement and changes in its composition 
during the regions severe winter months 
research and development of new ways to remove the remaining 
oil most of which lies under the surface of rocky shorelines 
protecting the regions five fish hatcheries with standby 
equipment and crews 
forming a strike force of counselors and mentalhealth 
professionals to help prevent and treat stressrelated problems 
such as drug and alcohol abuse in spillaffected towns 
money for the program will come from the states new 
5centabarrel oilspill response tax cowper said exxon eventually 
will be billed for reimbursement 
while cowper had little negative to say about exxon he showed 
reporters a sevenminute stateproduced video that focused on the 
oiled shores the company has vacated on a nearby table were oiled 
rocks taken this week from what a cowper spokesman said were soiled 
beaches 
exxon spokesman henry beathard said later that the beaches where 
surface oil remains visible were the last treated with a chemical 
fertilizer the fertilizer which stimulates the oileating action 
of microorganisms takes up to six weeks to work 
state environmental officials are worried about the subsurface 
oil they fear winter storms and tidal action will loosen that oil 
resulting in small slicks that will pollute other areas 
although exxon has promised to monitor the oil and respond to 
emergencies during the fall and winter cowper said it remained 
unclear to what extent the company will work with the state 
exxon has said it will reevaluate the shorelines next spring and 
decide then whether to resume the cleanup on a large scale 
the governor noted that some biologists alleged recently that 
exxons cleanup which employed as many as 12000 workers may have 
done more environmental harm than good 
that may be cowper said but what was exxon going to do 
not only was everyone barking at them to get it done including us 
they had a public relations problem

from the united nations 
that change in tactics could contribute to attempts to 
arrange negotiations between the arabs and israel john h kelly

universality kelly said in a speech before a conference on the 
middle east at wye plantation in maryland 
he referred to the step taken last year by palestine liberation

the bush administration has bowed to 
congressional pressure and abandoned its idea of aiding the 
presidential election campaign of nicaraguan opposition leader 
violetta chamorro through a usfinanced private organization 
while the national endowment for democracy should play an active 
role in ensuring a free and fair election the united states will 
not ask the group to go beyond election activities permitted by its 
charter state department spokesman richard boucher said friday 
chamorro is campaigning to defeat daniel ortega the nicaraguan 
president in a national election next february all us efforts 
including past weapons shipments to antigovernment rebels known as 
contras have failed to unseat the sandinista leader 
secretary of state james a baker iii ran into stiff opposition 
when he sounded out members of congress earlier this week about 
providing around 2 million in us funds to chamorro the publisher 
of the leading opposition newspaper la prensa through the 
endowment 
boucher said the groups charter permits it to support election 
activities in a general sense we dont intend to ask it to do 
anything thats beyond its charter

architect im pei and painters willem de kooning 
and david hockney were among the first six winners of the praemium 
imperiale a new award from japan that a leading philanthropist 
compared to nobel prizes 
the other winners of the honor which comes with 100000 were 
italian sculptor umberto mastroianni film director marcel carne and 
conductor pierre boulez both of france 
these prizes will come to be perceived as a supplement to the 
nobel prize and will soon assume in the arts the stature of the 
nobel awards in other fields said david rockefeller former 
chairman and chief executive officer of chase manhattan bank 
chairman of the museum of modern art and a member of an advisory 
panel for the awards 
prince masahito hitachi brother of the emperor and governor of 
the japan art association which gives the awards will present them 
in tokyo on oct 27 
a luncheon to announce the winners was attended by pei a 
naturalized us citizen born in china and lisa de kooning 
daughter of the painter a naturalized us citizen born in holland 
im numb and i really dont know what to think or how to 
feel said pei it has to be the award as far as im 
concerned but it does put a lot of burden on those of us who 
are nominated 
seiji tanaka japan art association coordinator said about 50 or 
60 nominations were received 
tanaka said it was coincidental that all the winners are male and 
american or european in addition he said the award categories may 
be changed next year to make theater and film separate categories 
for instance 
the prize is funded primarily by fujisankei communications 
international a media corporation fujisankei founder nobutaka 
shikanai is chairman of the japan art association founded in the 
19th century 
the association selected the winners based on recommendations 
from the international committee of advisers which included 
rockefeller former prime ministers jacques chirac of france edward 
heath of britain and amintore fanfani of italy and former west 
german chancellor helmut schmidt 
each adviser had his own method of coming up with nominations 
said ned steele a publicist for the event 
in the united states rockefeller asked schuyler chapin former 
dean of the columbia university school of arts to recruit a 
committee to give him recommendations that committee included 
broadway composer stephen sondheim new york times art critic john 
russell yale drama school dean lloyd richards former smithsonian 
secretary s dillon ripley and former cbs president frank stanton

mcdonnell douglas corp says it will make 
changes in its dc10 jetliners to guard against failure of all three 
hydraulic systems the one in a billion condition in a dc10 
crash in iowa that killed 112 people 
the modifications were greeted warmly friday by james b busey 
the head of the federal aviation administration 
the system design changes proposed by mcdonnell douglas are 
a solid step forward in assuring there will be no repeat of the july 
19 accident busey said in a statement issued in washington dc 
once these design changes are in place they will raise the 
already high safety standards required of the dc10 and in effect 
make a good airplane even better 
the three hydraulic systems on the dc10 are designed to operate 
independently and to back each other up in case one fails unlike 
some other plane models the 400 or so dc10s in use around the 
world have no backup system if the hydraulic lines fail to control 
the wing and tail mechanisms that steer the plane 
we view the new enhancements as extra safety equipment similar 
to the installation of air bags in automobiles additional measures 
to protect occupants besides the lap belts shoulder harnesses 
padded dashboards etc said dale warren a vice president of 
douglas aircraft co 
warren who headed the companys investigation of the sioux city 
iowa crash said friday modifications will include 
an electrically operated shutoff valve that will be installed in 
the supply line and a check valve in the return line of the no 3 
hydraulic system 
a check valve installed in the no 3 hydraulic reservoir 
a cockpit light added to alert the crew if the shutoff valve is 
activated 
the new fastacting shutoff valve located just behind the back 
wall of the cabin will close automatically and the cockpit light 
will come on if a sensor detects hydraulic fluid dropping below a 
preset level in the reservoir 
even if all three hydraulic systems are affected by severe damage 
to the tail section as happened in sioux city the valve will stop 
fluid flow through the no 3 system warren said 
with adequate hydraulic pressure preserved in that system the 
crew should have enough control to fly the plane to a safe landing 
he said 
in the july crash the tail engine on the dc10 disintegrated 
knocking out all three hydraulic systems an event with a one in 
a billion chance of occurring according to a mcdonnell douglas 
release friday 
the pilot lost virtually all control of the plane which exploded 
in flames in a corn field after cartwheeling down the runway 
douglas aircraft co a division of mcdonnell douglas based in 
long beach manufactured the dc10s which will eventually be 
replaced by the more advanced but similar md11s 
mcdonnell spokeswoman elayne bendel said in a telephone interview 
that the company had yet to decide whether to make the same 
modifications to its md11s

tamara denise toshiko marler 26 of tulsa was riding in the 
glitzy miss america parade down the famed boardwalk friday night 
when the bottle hit her in the forehead said pageant director

something and obviously he did he said 
miss marler spent friday night at the atlantic city medical 
center where she was being treated for the concussion and a slight 
bruise to her forehead said hospital spokeswoman sherry spatz 
if everything is ok as we expect it to be shell be back for

detective sgt sam rando who was with her in the emergency room 
she was very calm he said she was aware of everything 
that was going on answering the doctors who were asking her 
questions 
but later miss marler became dizzy when doctors asked her to 
walk around the emergency room ms spatz said 
if miss marler is able to compete tonight doctors may 
depending on her condition ask her to refrain from wearing high 
heels ms spatz said 
the incident occurred around 9 pm as the convertible miss 
marler was riding in passed texas avenue miss marler told the 
doctors that she did not black out when struck by the bottle 
pageant officials delivered several large bouquets of flowers to 
miss marlers room her mother spent the night with her in the 
hospital horn said 
miss marler became a likely top10 semifinalist after winning a 
preliminary talent competition on wednesday she sang an 
audiencegrabbing rendition of since i fell for you 
a recent marketing graduate of the university of tulsa she hopes 
someday to become a lawyer 
horn said the decision to switch the parade from tuesday to 
friday did not change the mood of the crowd but he said he might 
reconsider the parades future after the incident with miss marler 
in past years some contestants have been injured in the parade 
by slipping or falling but there has never been an incident as 
serious as the bottlethrowing horn said 
several thousand people turned out to watch the parade

leftist rebels and the salvadoran government 
have agreed to monthly peace talks aimed at ending nearly a decade 
of civil war 
after negotiators announced the agreement in mexico city friday 
an estimated 10000 salvadorans marched in their capital in support 
of the plan 
the guerrilla group farabundo marti national liberation front 
said it hoped that 1990 will be the year of the wars final end 
the blood that has been spilled in the longest and most costly 
conflict on the continent all this blood that has been spilled 
deserves this rebel leader shafick handal said at a news 
conference in mexico city 
since the fighting began in 1979 70000 salvadorans have been 
killed 
in san salvador president alfredo cristiani called the agreement 
important but said while welcoming the dialogue process we dont 
want to create false expectations 
we want to reiterate that our attitude is one of openness and 
flexibility within our constitutional framework we know the road 
ahead is difficult and complex he told an independence day rally 
the rebels and the rightist government agreed to meet next in san 
jose the costa rican capital on oct 1617 and once a month 
thereafter 
they agreed that two representatives from the roman catholic 
church will mediate the talks and that they will also invite the 
united nations and the organization of american states to send 
observers 
the cristiani government initially opposed church mediation or 
outside observers it had also proposed meeting the guerrillas every 
two months instead of once a month 
the pact reached after two days of talks also stipulates that 
neither side can unilaterally withdraw from the negotiations and 
that each delegation will have authority to reach binding accords 
the mexico city talks were the first in two years between the 
government and rebels they were also the first meeting between the 
guerrillas and cristianis administration 
the rebels have already laid out their peace proposal the 
government is to present its plan in october 
the rebels are offering to lay down their arms and form a legal 
political party in exchange for sweeping social and political 
reforms they dropped previous demands for power sharing and for 
merging the rebel and government armies 
most of the civil wars victims have been civilians human rights 
groups and international organizations say many were killed by 
rightwing death squads linked to the military and cristianis 
party links the party denies 
washington has provided more than 35 billion in military and 
economic aid to el salvador this decade making it latin americas 
biggest single recipient of american assistance 
for the first time since the civil war started in 1979 
salvadoran authorities staged an independence day military parade 
through their capital on friday about 3000 troops from the three 
military branches and the three militarized police forces marched to 
music by military bands 
crowds lined the parade route which followed a route different 
from that of the peace march but the peace marchers appeared to 
attract more people who waved white flags and blueandwhite 
national banners and chanted slogans hailing the peace talk 
agreement 
the march was sponsored by the national debate for peace an 
umbrella organization comprising about 70 church union student and 
humanitarian organizations

hundreds of british bird 
spotters headed for the shetland islands after their birdline 
telephone information service reported the presence of a rare great 
knot wading bird 
the bird spotters nicknamed twitchers and armed with powerful 
binoculars telescopes and expensive cameras compete among 
themselves to log sightings of rare birds around britain 
the great knot is an asian bird measuring just over 10 inches in 
length 
birdline reported that one was seen friday at a spot called the 
pool of virkie near sumburgh airport on the southern tip of the 
remote shetland islands 100 miles off scotland 
the british domestic news agency press association reported that 
it was the first recorded sighting of a great knot in britain and 
only the fourth for the whole of europe 
the news agency said previous european sightings were in spain in 
1979 and denmark and east germany in 1987 
birdline said the great knot is thought to have been blown off 
course by easterly winds while migrating from its breeding grounds 
5000 miles away in northeast siberia to its winter range mainly in 
southern china indonesia and australia 
many bird watchers were expected to be frustrated in their bid to 
reach the shetland islands by the weekend 
one veteran twitcher ian mills from whitburn in northeast 
england reported the word has gone round that all flights to 
shetland tomorrow saturday are booked solid so it looks as if the 
majority of us will miss out this weekend 
its very frustrating that such a crowdpulling bird should 
have turned up at such a hardtogetto place 
this is one of those onceinalifetime opportunities if it 
had appeared on mainland britain thousands of people would have 
been along to see it

environmentalists are awaiting gov mario 
cuomos decision on the resettlement of the neighborhood around the 
love canal toxic dump saying his choice could set a national 
precedent 
love canal is not a local new york issue said penny newman 
of californias concerned neighbors in action it will set a 
precedent for the rest of us who are living near these dump sites 
newman was one of about 200 protesters who gathered outside the 
state capitol friday night with hopes of persuading cuomo to stop 
the resettlement 
if the government can get away with resettling love canal one 
of the most notorious dump sites in the country then what do the 
rest of us have to expect she said 
let us learn a lesson from love canal and not repeat our 
mistakes said lois gibbs the former love canal housewife who led 
the fight 11 years ago to get people removed from the area 
the demonstrators sang prayed chanted and listened to speeches 
one of the speakers was former resident luella kenny whose 
7yearold son died of kidney disease 
next tuesday theres young man that shouldve turned 18 
years old that shouldve started college this year said 
kenny he never had that opportunity because he lived in love 
canal he played in his backyard with those chemicals 
the protesters draped the fence of the executive mansion with red 
ribbon adorned with more than 5000 letters to cuomo urging him to 
stop the love canal resettlement planned for next year 
occidental chemical corp owner of the former hooker chemical 
and plastic co which used love canal as a waste dump acknowledges 
that 20000 tons of chemicals were dumped there in the 1940s and 
1950s 
the dump was eventually closed and a school and playground were 
built above it hundreds of homes were built in a surrounding 
suburb which president carter declared a federal disaster area in 
1978 
today about 70 homes in love canal are occupied by people who 
chose not to flee with most of their neighbors in 1978 much of the 
chemical contamination remains in a giant fencedin mound at the 
center of the neighborhood 
last fall dr david axelrod the state health commissioner 
ruled that twothirds of the 10block love canal neighborhood was 
suitable for resettlement after years of work to contain or treat 
the toxic contamination from the dump site

investigators suspect that a blowtorch 
probably caused an explosion that killed 10 miners but the probe 
has been delayed while dangerous levels of methane are cleared from 
the mine authorities said 
state inspectors found the blowtorch friday near the site of 
wednesdays explosion which officials believe to have been fueled 
by methane gas said willard stanley commissioner of the department 
of mines and minerals 
workers may have been using the torch to disassemble a longwall 
mining investigators said 
officials of the us mine safety and health administration 
approved a modified company plan to reduce the methane levels at the 
william station mine that delayed the investigation friday said 
administration spokeswoman kathy snyder 
stanley said one of the mines curtains used to channel outside 
air to mining areas to carry away methane gas appeared to be 
dislodged stanley said he didnt know if the curtain was moved out 
of place before the blast by the explosion itself or during rescue 
operations 
on friday night hours after the first burial of the mine 
disaster scores of area residents gathered for a memorial service 
at union county high school 
in kentucky our families are strong our communities are 
supportive and our courage is abundant gov wallace wilkinson 
told the crowd which packed the 700seat auditorium the events 
are irreversible 
we can only share in the immense grief 
a funeral service was held earlier for 31yearold mark hedges 
the other burials were scheduled for today and sunday 
also friday the head of a publicinterest law firm said the mine 
owner pyro mining co and federal officials had failed to prevent 
the disaster despite abundant warning signs he said the government 
had been too lenient with the mine owners 
theres strong evidence that there was knowledge on the part of 
both company and the government that there was a methane problem at 
the mine coupled with a ventilation problem said j davitt 
mcateer executive director of the washingtonbased occupational 
safety and health law center 
federal inspectors briefly shut down the mine seven times this 
year because of imminent dangers mcateer said 
pyro had reported 267 accidents at the mine since 1985 but failed 
to report several others said mcateer 
msha spokesman frank ogorman angrily denied mcateers claim that 
his agency had not properly policed pyro 
the agency imposed many penalties on the company ogorman said 
company spokesman ed calman refused to discuss pyros safety 
record but denied criticism from area residents that pyro was 
withholding information about the accident this company is not 
hiding anything calman said

gov george deukmejian enacted one of 
the strictest drunken driving laws in the country lowering the 
blood alcohol level at which a person is presumed too drunk to drive 
to 008 percent 
the bill lowering the unacceptable blood alcohol level from 010 
percent will take effect next jan 1 only three other states 
oregon utah and maine have as tough a standard 
this is a very strong signal and message to individuals who do 
drink and do drive that it is more likely that they will wind up 
being convicted of drunken driving and hopefully this will be a 
very strong incentive to prevent them from doing so deukmejian 
told an audience of news reporters and uniformed law enforcement 
officers at a signing ceremony friday in his office 
he said drunken driving deaths had decreased on california 
highways in recent years but were still too high to accept 
i am convinced we are going to save lives under this bill 
said assemblyman bill leonard author of the new law i dont want 
anyone arrested under this bill i want people who drink to stay off 
the road its a health problem its a criminal problem 
although each individuals blood alcohol level is affected by a 
variety of factors such as weight the average person can consume 
about three glasses of beer or comparable amounts of other alcholic 
beverages in an hour before reaching the 008 percent level

former ptl board members testified in jim 
bakkers fraud trial that they didnt know the company was 
struggling to pay its bills when they approved of big bonuses for 
the evangelist and his wife 
prosecutors accuse bakker of diverting more than 37 million in 
ptl money to fund his lavish lifestyle if found guilty of the 24 
counts against him bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison 
and fined more than 5 million 
bakker and his wife tammy faye received more than 3 million in 
bonuses from the ministry in the mid1980s according to evidence 
presented in the trial the bonuses often came during periods of 
financial trouble for the ministry witnesses have testified 
board members testified friday they were kept in the dark about 
the financial condition of the ministry bakker and his former 
deputy richard dortch are accused of concealing ptls deteriorating 
finances from the ptl directors 
the rev evelyn spencer a board member from oakland calif 
said she trusted bakker to inform board members of the ministrys 
finances i just trusted him period she said 
aimme cortese a new york city minister and ptl board member 
testified that she never would have voted for the bonuses had she 
known about ptls financial condition it didnt make sense she 
said how could you give away bonuses while you were floating 
checks 
a former ptl payroll clerk testified that 265 ministry workers 
were laid off in november 1985 a month during which the bakkers 
received 300000 in bonuses 
joanie ames a single mother of two said she called her children 
together and said im sorry to tell you this but we wont have 
christmas until after because the check wont be here 
the prosecution has said that bakker received a 200000 bonus on 
nov 12 1985 and mrs bakker got a 100000 bonus less than a 
year later on nov 3 1986 the ptl board approved a 500000 bonus 
for bakker 
also friday a former ptl attorney testified that he advised 
dortch that the ministry should fight jessica hahns threatened 
lawsuit over a sexual encounter she had with bakker 
los angeles attorney scott furstman testified that he considered 
hahns threatened suit frivolous 
but dortch decided to pay hahn 265000 because he feared 
disclosure of the 1980 encounter furstman said 
a deal finally struck between dortch and ms hahn included a 
115000 payment to ms hahn and 150000 put into a trust account 
for her the trust was never set up but the money was deposited in 
a money market account 
the trust fund money eventually was returned to the trustee in 
ptls bankruptcy proceedings in july 1988 
the federal charges against bakker cite the ms hahn payoff money 
as an example of how he allegedly used ptl money for his personal 
benefit

the judge in zsa zsa gabors 
copslapping trial ordered the outspoken celebrity to quit talking 
to the news media in defiance of a gag order 
i will make a warning but this will be the first and last time 
i say this municipal court judge charles rubin told miss gabor on 
friday 
you are to say to the press no comment 
the judges warning after a contempt of court request from a 
prosecutor was based on earlier statements by miss gabor rubin 
apparently was unaware of miss gabors catty remarks a few moments 
before in the corridor outside court in which she blasted beverly 
hills police officer paul kramer the motorcycle cop who arrested 
her 
the former hungarian beauty queen told reporters she should have 
scratched kramers eyes out 
i think that cop is not too bright miss gabor said i 
think he must be very spoiled because hes very sexy hes gorgeous 
hes sexy but i dont like that man 
miss gabors diatribe had begun at the curb where she alighted 
from her rollsroyce in a blackandwhite anne klein trouser outfit 
and a furious mood 
this man is the biggest liar and the police department is the 
biggest liar in the world miss gabor said ignoring pleas from 
her attorney reminding her of the gag order 
after rubins warning defense attorney william graysen 
complained about a television interview with another beverly hills 
police officer who called miss gabor a foulmouthed cheap 
lawbreaker 
miss gabor remained closemouthed during the proceedings and 
passed time sketching a portrait of the bailiff and displayed it to 
reporters in the court during a brief bench conference 
miss gabor who says the doodling calms my nerves previously 
drew pictures of the judge the clerk and the court reporter 
kramer pulled her over on june 14 for having expired registration 
tags on her rollsroyce as he checked for other violations miss 
gabor allegedly drove off was stopped again and allegedly slapped 
kramers face 
she is charged with misdemeanor battery on a police officer 
disobeying an officers orders driving with an expired license and 
car registration and having an open container of alcohol in her car 
kramer who testified on thursday that miss gabor cursed spit 
and slapped him left the stand in the morning after 
crossexamination by the defense 
kramer was asked if he had worn a free zsa zsa tshirt at his 
recent 38th birthday party and kramer said he had 
asked if it got hot under his helmet kramer said it did 
does it ever fry your brain graysen asked getting a no 
comment from the officer and an objection from the prosecutor it 
was sustained

east germanys hardline 
leadership acknowledged that the exodus of skilled workers to the 
west will hurt the economy but rejected calls for reform that would 
encourage citizens to stay 
hundreds more refugees arrived in west germany today confounding 
expectations that the stream of people would slow to a trickle after 
the initial wave earlier this week 
officials said friday that about 14000 refugees had arrived 
since midnight sunday when hungary decided to empty its crowded 
refugee camps by opening its border with austria and allowing the 
east germans to leave without their governments permission 
hungary coordinated the exodus with west germany where east 
germans automatically gain citizenship 
communist east germany bitterly denounced its warsaw pact ally 
and demanded that hungary close its border hungary however said 
that allowing east germans passage to the west was in line with 
social and political reforms it is carrying out 
hungary began dismantling its border barriers with austria in may 
and 10000 east germans escaped illegally prior to this weeks 
crossings 
west german counterintelligence officials said friday they were 
worried that communist east germany may have slipped a few spies 
among the refugees they promised help to any spies who turned 
themselves in 
a surge of crossings thursday followed news reports that hungary 
would soon close the border 
but comments by hungarian officials friday appeared calculated to 
dispel such fears government spokesman zsolt bajnok said there had 
been no decision on when the border would be closed 
most of the refugees are young educated and skilled people and 
they have left a gaping hole in east germanys work force 
east german central committee member harry tisch said friday the 
goverment will have to find solutions to bridge this gap 
it certainly wont be easy tisch said during a visit to 
stuttgart naturally its not unproblematical for us that skilled 
workers whether young or old from the german democratic republic 
are resettling in the federal republic of germany 
according to statistics released thursday by the west german 
government east germany is suffering its biggest talent drain from 
the nations work force since the berlin wall went up in 1961 
several times in the past few days west german chancellor helmut 
kohl has urged the east german leadership to make political and 
economic reforms to curb the flow of refugees 
but guenter mittag the central committee member in charge of the 
east german economy rejected those calls in a commentary friday in 
the communist party daily newspaper neues deutschland 
the reform proposals of those people contain only one point 
they want the type of reform that does away with socialism mittag 
wrote thanks a lot for that it just wont be that way 
in bonn the foreign ministry said 60 east germans demanding to 
emigrate were holed up at the west german embassy in warsaw poland 
and 170 at the embassy in prague czechoslovakia 
there was little hope they would gain passage to the west 
however polish leaders have urged caution in the matter and prague 
has refused to sanction their departure

the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant will remain 
open over the weekend after federal officials reached a tentative 
agreement on handling the plants wastes a federal official said 
negotiators for the department of energy which owns the plant 
and environmental protection agency in washington dc reached 
agreement on the thorny issue friday said the official who spoke 
only on condition that he not be identified further 
plant operator rockwell international corp had set a friday 
deadline for the doe and the epa to resolve conflicting regulations 
concerning radioactive hazardous and mixed wastes at the plant 
sources had said the plant could have closed as early as 530 pm 
friday if the demands werent met 
doe officials had threatened in july to close the plant due to a 
fear they could face criminal charges over ongoing environmental 
violations stemming from the wastes for which there is no federally 
approved disposal site 
the plant which is 16 miles northwest of denver and employs 
about 6000 people is the only one in the country that makes 
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons and federal officials have 
warned that a shutdown could endanger us defense 
the source said the agreement calls for mixed waste to be stored 
in an environmentally sound manner for doe to launch a program 
to reduce the amount of waste being generated at rocky flats and 
for the agency to do everything possible to improve its capacity for 
treating the waste 
the source said the agreement reached by negotiators still must 
be signed by top agency officials the state of colorado also 
reportedly gave approval to the agreement but rockwell thus far is 
not a party the source said 
this in no way is a grant of immunity for any past 
violations the source said apparently referring to an 
investigation under way into alleged illegal disposal of wastes and 
of a possible coverup fbi and epa investigators raided rocky flats 
on june 6 and a special federal grand jury is reviewing the case 
cathy kaliniak a doe spokeswoman in washington said the agency 
would have no announcement until monday and rocky flats would remain 
open until at least that time she said talks were continuing but 
declined to discuss details 
rocky flats is continuing to operate as normal said dennis 
hurtt a rockwell spokesman 
rockwell later issued a statement that said its officials met 
with representatives of the doe epa and justice department to 
discuss the issue 
rockwell finds itself in a position where one agency of the 
federal government epa says it may take legal action against our 
people at rocky flats and against the corporation rockwell for 
actions that we are required to perform under contract with another 
agency doe the rockwell statement said

a woman whose pain from napalm bomb burns 
became a lasting image of the vietnam war has indefinitely 
postponed a trip to the united states due to health reasons 
phan thi kim phuc decided to put off the trip she had planned 
this month said merle ratner codirector of the committee to 
welcome kim phuc 
a blackandwhite photograph of 9yearold kim screaming with 
agony as she ran nude down a vietnamese road following an air raid 
in 1972 was published throughout the world and was awarded a 
pulitzer prize 
everybody remembers it ms ratner said friday in a telephone 
interview from her office in new york it was the one enduring 
image from the war 
what is not apparent in the photo said associated press 
photographer nick ut who took the picture is that the girls back 
neck and arm were charred like barbecue 
ut who fled vietnam in 1975 and continues to work for the ap in 
los angeles was reunited with kim in havana in july the first time 
they had been together since ut took her to a hospital that fateful 
day 
i would like to see her here ut said but now i think the 
vietnamese government doesnt want her to come here i wish she 
would come here soon 
kim 26 developed diabetes while studying pharmacology in 
havana cuba and has had so much difficulty with her eyesight and 
ability to concentrate that she decided to change her course of 
studies to english ms ratner said 
if she came here shed have to put off her studies in english 
which begin in the fall ms ratner said 
the trip probably has been postponed for a year or more she said 
vietnams communist government already had approved kims trip to 
america and played no part in influencing her decision ms ratner 
said 
they were very interested in having her make it she said 
no one wanted her to jeopardize her health 
uts prizewinning picture was the reason ms ratner and others 
organized kims trip the ad hoc committee to welcome kim phuc was 
formed specifically to bring her here as a gesture of friendship 
and reconciliation ms ratner said 
shes a good representative ms ratner said shes 
articulate shes not a communist party member shes a young 
peasant woman who happened to have become famous because of her 
misfortune and people want to meet her 
last month ms ratner said she spent two days with kim in 
havana where the vietnamese woman has been studying for the past 
three years or so 
she was in good spirits ms ratner said she was 
disappointed she would have to postpone the trip of course you 
could tell she had trouble concentrating

opposition insists its may 7 election victory be honored 
far from being solved the crisis is getting worse the 
church episcopate said contrary to all national and international 
expectations we have a de facto government which is outside the 
constitutional framework 
the only thing that would justify a government that calls 
itself provisional would be the immediate and direct search for

an arab league committee today called for 
an immediate ceasefire in lebanon as a first step toward ending the 
nations 14yearold civil war earlier shelling reportedly killed 
12 people and wounded 72 
there can be no solution to the lebanese crisis by military 
means the foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria 
who make up the committee said in a communique released in those 
countries 
beirut radio stations interrupted programming to broadcast 
reports of the ceasefire call there was no immediate comment from 
lebanese leaders 
the committee appointed by the arab league in may to find a 
solution to lebanons crisis called for an immediate and 
comprehensive ceasefire 
previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pitting 
syrian troops and allied moslem militias against the mainly 
christian troops of army gen michel aoun 
fierce overnight shelling by syrian and christian gunners blew 
gaping holes in apartment buildings in beiruts moslem and christian 
sectors 
police reported 12 people were killed and 72 wounded bringing 
the casualties to 914 killed and 2685 wounded since the clashes 
broke out march 8 
the thuds of explosions accompanied by the whooshing sound of 
rockets echoed across ravaged beirut and fires caused by the 
shelling blazed out of control through the night 
each side blamed the other for the escalation in fighting 
a spokesman for aouns command who refused to be further 
identified said the syrians provoked the barrage friday evening 
it seems they know that the committees decision will condemn them 
again 
the newspaper ashsharq which is close to the syrian government 
of president hafez assad blamed aoun charging that the maronite 
catholic general wants to foil arab efforts 
by 730 am the ferocious shelling subsided into intermittent 
exchanges of mortar rounds across the traditional front lines in 
beirut the wooded mountains southeast of the capital and the 
eastern mountain range 
dont be pessimistic the coming few hours will bring good 
news from the arab league committee the moslem voice of the 
nation radio repeatedly told listeners early in the day 
the prosyrian leftist daily paper assafir said the overnight 
shelling duel which at its peak reached 42 shells per minute was 
the storm that preceded the quiet 
the independent newspaper annahar referred to the barrage as 
the last showdown and said the arab committee would issue a 
binding ceasefire call 
the committee which met wednesday and thursday said in its 
communique that a lebanese security body to be headed by lakhdar 
ibrahimi an algerian who is the committees delegate to lebanon 
would supervise the implementation of the ceasefire 
this body also would supervise ships when information is 
received by the committee that they are carrying arms and ammunition 
to any party the committee said 
as soon as the security body begins its work blockades on ports 
should be lifted and beiruts airport should reopen the committee 
said 
it called on all concerned states and those who supported the 
committee in its task to work by all means to halt the flow of 
arms to any one in lebanon 
the committee invited the members of lebanons parliament to meet 
to prepare and discuss a charter for national reconciliation on 
sept 30 
the committee tried to arrange a settlement once before but 
announced july 31 that it had failed and it blamed syrias refusal 
to withdraw from lebanon 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
mandate to quell the civil war aoun charges the syrians violated 
that mandate by siding with the moslems and has vowed to fight until 
the syrian troops leave 
the latest round of fighting broke out in march after aoun 
blockaded ports run by syrianallied militias syria responded by 
shelling the christian enclave north of beirut home to about 1 
million christians 
syrian gunners also have shelled a 28mile stretch of lebanons 
mediterranean coast controlled by christian forces north of beirut 
to prevent aoun from receiving shipments of weapons and ammunition 
sent by iraq syrias main arab foe

senior leader deng xiaoping today appeared in 
public for the first time in more than three months looking tanned 
and vigorous as he met an american professor at the great hall of 
the people 
dengs 70minute meeting with td lee a nobel prizewinning 
physicist from columbia university was his first public appearance 
since june 9 five days after the bloody military attack on 
prodemocracy students and their supporters in beijing 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people died as troops shot 
their way into the city en route to seizing tiananmen square from 
student demonstrators 
since then chinese and foreign sources have reported deng is 
seriously ill with prostate cancer and may not have long to live 
chinese officials have said deng is in good health and spent part of 
the summer resting at the seaside resort of beidaihe 
speculation that deng was no longer capable of carrying out his 
official functions rose when he failed to meet the president of the 
african state of burkina faso during a recent visit 
the 85yearold party patriarch in remarks audible in an evening 
news report on the meeting said he sometimes swims for up to one 
hour i dont like indoor swimming pools but enjoy swimming in 
nature he told the professor 
the tv report showed the smiling deng wearing a gray mao suit 
grasp lees hand with both of his and then walk steadily 
handinhand with the american he was also shown in animated 
conversation gesturing and laughing 
the recent turmoil has taught us a major lesson deng was 
quoted as saying by the television news and by the official xinhua 
news agency 
some of our comrades just immersed themselves in their specific 
work did not pay enough attention to ideological and political 
developments were not vigilant enough against the serious 
corruption and the measures taken to correct it proved less than 
effective 
deng was apparently referring to ousted communist party chief 
zhao ziyang who has been accused of abetting the prodemocracy 
demonstrators and splitting the party 
deng stressed that china will not change the policies of reform 
that he initiated a decade ago but he also said china must stick to 
socialism 
there would be no new china today without the leadership of the 
communist party he said 
lee was a winner of the 1957 nobel prize for physics

security forces have discovered 52 more 
bodies in central sri lanka bringing to 76 the number killed by 
sinhalese radicals in three days the military said today 
elsewhere soldiers friday fatally shot 11 sinhalese radicals and 
arrested 226 others said military officials 
the officials said the 52 unidentified bodies had been found 
since friday in the villages of kundasala menikhinna and arangala 
in central kandy district about 55 miles northeast of colombo 
the militants killed six sinhalese civilians in three separate 
attacks friday said the officials who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules 
on thursday they said 18 bodies with gunshot wounds were found 
by security forces in the area 
authorities blamed the killings on the radical sinhalese group 
the peoples liberation front which is trying to overthrow the 
sinhalesedominated government and which attacks civilians not 
supporting its cause officials also accused militants of setting 
fire to 30 homes 
sinhalese radicals oppose a july 1987 accord the government 
signed in an attempt to end tamils war for a separate homeland the 
sinhalese said the accord granted too many concessions to the 
minority tamils and compromised sri lankas sovereignty by inviting 
indian soldiers to enforce the accord 
tamils who are mostly hindu make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people they say they are denied jobs and education by 
the mainly buddhist sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the 
population and dominate the government and military 
more than 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
been killed since the tamil insurgency began in 1983 five thousand 
others have died in the sinhalese backlash

usbased investors have contracted with a 
southern china city to produce up to 300000 small cars a year in 
what would be the biggest foreignfunded enterprise in china 
chinese and foreign sources said today 
the official xinhua news agency reported the project but a 
foreign commerical official said it was highly uncertain it would be 
carried out 
xinhua said 250 million is to be invested in panda motors corp 
in huizhou a small city east of the guangdong provincial capital of 
canton and 54 miles from a nearby port to hong kong 
the china news service another official agency said the first 
stage of the project will be finished by 1995 but that the first 
cars will be produced as early as next year all the vehicles will 
be exported it said 
it said huizhou city was preparing to borrow 54 million to build 
power generating plants docks and other facilities needed for the 
factory 
the official reports did not identify the foreign investors 
a foreign commercial official in canton said one of the main 
backers was dr charles kim a koreanamerican who formerly worked 
for the small business administration in washington the companys 
home office is in arlington va 
the official said the company was incorporated in delaware in 
september 1988 and former republican sen paul laxalt of nevada was 
listed as a legal adviser but that little was known about who was 
behind the project or how much of the project they were financing 
officials of the company reached in huizhou referred all questions 
to the home office in virginia 
the commercial official said it did not appear that any major 
american or japanese automaker was involved in the project he said 
south korea which has shown an interest in expanding its investment 
in china has also denied putting money in huizhou 
the whole premise is very very iffy said the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity he referred to the difficulty of 
obtaining quality parts in china and the question of whether there 
is an international market for 300000 vehicles made in china 
the commercial official noted that top leaders in beijing 
approved the decision before the june military crackdown on the 
student protest movement and the ouster of communist party chief 
zhao ziyang and other reformists 
unfortunately the top is no longer there he said adding it 
is not certain the current conservative leadership will let the 
project proceed 
the project also runs counter to attempts to consolidate chinas 
slumping auto industry and bring it under the control of central 
planners in beijing 
the state council or cabinet late last year announced it will 
no longer approve joint ventures involving cars and that passenger 
car production will be confined to six major manufacturers 
they include the first automotive works in northern jilin which 
is making audis in cooperation with volkswagen the second 
automotive works in central hubei province the japanbacked tianjin 
automotive industry corp the shanghai volkswagen auto co the 
beijing jeep corp a chrysler subsidiary and the guangzhou peugeot 
automobile co 
chinese auto officials say they want to produce up to 700000 
passenger cars by the year 2000 only 33000 were made last year out 
of total vehicle production of about 560000 
in the first half of 1989 china produced 290000 vehicles 
including 37800 passenger cars but a tough government austerity 
plan including a ban on most public institutions buying cars has 
led to plummeting sales and huge inventories

get involved in the prickly talks this year recently though she 
joined four secondary principals in sending a letter to the 
superintendent urging a settlement 
i want my staff back she said the subs are working hard 
but they are substitutes 
at riverview the mood was calmer the strikers have a barbecue 
grill in the parking lot the young children often come to them at 
recess to ask when they will come back the teachers said 
the teachers said its hard explaining contracts to 
kindergarteners but they said the children understand the word

associated press writer the bicycle can help 
solve some of the worlds worst pollution and economic problems but 
in many countries only the poor pedal a new study says 
in the united states there is nearly one bike for every two 
people but many americans drive cars to health clubs where they 
ride stationary excercise bikes said researcher marcia d lowe in a 
report published sunday 
in countries that have fewer cars she said bikes carry 
commuters deliver milk haul squealing pigs and deliver the mail 
worldwide 800 million cycles outnumber cars 2to1 
by contrast the united states built 6 million bikes and 8 
million cars in 1987 china in the same year produced 41 million 
bikes and 4065 autombiles ms lowe said in the bicycle vehicle 
for a small planet a worldwatch institute report 
the institute is an independent nonprofit research organization 
that analyzes environmental and economic issues 
many countries that should be producing and using more bicycles 
and tricycles are pouring money into automobile manufacturing roads 
and industries to support a mode of transportation most of their 
population cannot afford ms lowe said at a briefing on the report 
one of the greatest ironies of the 20th century is that around 
the globe vast amounts of such priceless things as land petroleum 
and clean air have been relinquished for motorization and yet most 
people in the world will never own an automobile she said 
nearly 1 billion in us oil imports could be saved if 10 
percent of americans switched to bicycles for at least part of their 
commute to work said ms lowe who practices what she preaches in 
trafficclogged washington 
bicycle promotional groups say less than one commuter in a 
hundred pedals to work in the united states 
some of the poorest countries are hostile to pedal traffic 
because bicycles are viewed as vehicles of the poor said ms 
lowe 
in jakarta indonesia she said city officials confiscated 
100000 cycle rickshaws over the past five years and dumped them 
into the sea 
governments trying to eliminate such conveyances declare them 
unsafe or inhumane but the more likely motive is to clear the 
streets of vehicles that make the city look poor and backward the 
report says 
michael replogle president of the institute for transportation 
and development policy said his organization tries to encourage 
governments to put less emphasis on expensive road building and more 
on producing vehicles people can afford and use 
ms lowes report says many roads in poorer countries are more 
useful for drying beans and peppers than moving traffic 
the netherlands and denmark are the most bicyclefriendly 
developed countries the report says the netherlands has the 
worlds highest density of both cycle lanes and cars it says while 
32 percent of danish commuters cycle to work 
the united states most cyclingconscious communities are davis 
and palo alto calif ms lowe said davis has 30 miles of bicycle 
lanes for every 100 miles of streets palo altos city government 
pays its employees seven cents a mile for business travel by bike 
and the police department has a bicycle squad she said 
palo alto also has found an answer to some of the drawbacks in 
getting employees to bike to work a 1983 zoning ordinance requires 
that larger new building be provided not only with bicycle parking 
but also with employee showers

the state department and congress are in 
disagreement over how quickly the united states should now move to 
seek an international ban on drift net fishing 
with initialing of a tentative treaty with the south koreans 
earlier this month the united states has now concluded scientific 
monitoring and enforcement agreements with the three nations that 
have north pacific drift net fleets 
but the state department doesnt want to consider an outright ban 
until scientists have had time to asses data that will be collected 
under the new agreements with korea japan and taiwan 
it would be premature for the us government to announce a 
policy of seeking to ban drift nets ed wolfe the state 
departments ambassador for oceans and fisheries said in an 
interview 
more than 50 house members however have signed on to 
legislation that would essentially direct the secretary of state to 
seek immediately an international ban and provide congress in six 
months with a list of the nations that refused to negotiate 
its time for action said rep jolene unsoeld dwash the 
principal sponsor of the bill we dont need more studies 
pressure to seek an international end to the use of drift nets is 
coming from two groups us fishermen who believe the high seas 
catch has already depleted us salmon and steelhead stocks and 
environmentalists who believe the nets cause indiscriminate 
slaughter of marine life 
the lighweight monofilament nets which environmentalists have 
likened to walls of death can stretch for more than 30 miles 
snaring any animal that comes in contact on any given day the nets 
can cover an estimated 30000 miles of ocean 
more that 700 vessels from japan taiwan and korea have been 
using drift nets in the north pacific ostensibly to catch squid but 
us fishermen say the foreign fleets have served as a front for 
the illegal harvest of up to 30000 metric tons of salmon and 
steelhead worth roughly 30 million 
fishermen also believe that foreign trawlers using drift nets are 
catching large quantities of albacore tuna in the south pacific 
in addition to the north and south pacific drift nets are now 
being used by fishermen in the mediterranean sea 
environmentalists say use of the drift nets results in the 
methodical destruction of thousands of marine mammals sea birds 
and other marine life every year 
a commerce department study released in may said there was reason 
for serious concern about the incidental catch of marine 
mammals especially northern fur seals but it did not give any 
estimates 
the report did estimate the nets could potentially snare several 
hundred thousand seabirds annually 
us observers will be allowed on drift net vessels from taiwan 
korea and japan under the new treaties and hopefully will be able to 
collect enough data through the end of the 1990 fishing treaty to 
adequatetly assess the impact such harvesting 
under international law anadromous fish such as salmon and 
steelhead belong to the nation in which they originated japan 
korea and taiwan also have their own laws regulating where and when 
their drift net fleets can fish and prohibiting the taking of salmon 
on the high seas 
wolfe said he expected that the drift net issue will eventually 
have to be adressed on an international level 
its my opinion that because of the severity of the problem 
the intensity of the problem and the interest at the highest level 
of our government that the drift net issue will have to be pursued 
in a multilateral forum said wolfe 
unsoeld said she may try to tack her proposed legislation onto a 
bill reauthorizing the socalled magnuson fishing act when it comes 
before the house merchant marine and fisheries committee in the next 
week or so

as exxon suspends its alaska oil cleanup for 
the winter amid sharp criticism from environmentalists congress is 
nearing a vote that critics say could limit how much oil companies 
would have to pay for major spills 
earlier this year environmentalists applauded approval by a 990 
vote in the senate of legislation that would impose unlimited 
liability against a shipper responsible for an oil spill and a 1 
billion oil industry cleanup fund 
but the house version of the bill which is expected to come to a 
vote this week has prompted a letterwriting campaign from a dozen 
environmental groups who say the measure would reduce not 
strengthen protection against oil spills and weaken cleanup 
requirements 
this is an industry bailout bill snapped george frampton 
president of the wilderness society 
it weakens current oil spill law and caters to the oil 
industry charged david gardiner legislative director of the 
sierra club 
the house and senate bills would have to be reconciled before 
final legislation is approved by congress 
in the weeks after the exxon valdez tanker fouled hundreds of 
miles of alaskas pristine shoreline last march members of congress 
clamored to sign onto proposals aimed at making sure industry 
prepares better for future spills and that federal law more clearly 
spells out a polluters liability 
but the legislation that has actually emerged from two house 
committees both often friendly to oil and shipping interests 
contains provisions the environmentalists say fall far short of 
those rhetorical clamors 
oil industry spokesmen have supported the house legislation and 
point out that like the senate version it would establish for 
the first time a 1 billion industry fund to deal with cleanup 
efforts the fund would come from a surcharge on each barrel of oil 
environmentalists argue this would simply pass costs on to the 
consumer and provide no incentive for companies to take precautions 
against oil spills 
the environmental groups ranging from the 58 millionmember 
national wildlife federation to the relatively small izaak walton 
league are alarmed about provisions in the house legislation that 
would 
put a cap possibly as low as 60 million on a shippers 
direct liability for a spill such a level dwarfs the already 
acknowledged 1 billion to 2 billion cleanup costs being talked 
about from the exxon spill 
override stronger oil spill liability laws in effect in 18 
states these state laws have no liability ceiling and allow civil 
suits for damages against the oil companies involved in a spill 
allow for a narrow definition in calculating the value of a 
natural resource such as wildlife fish and birds such calculations 
would let an oil company off the hook by not making them pay for 
longterm restoration of such resources conservationists charge 
the american petroleum institute the oil industry trade 
organization has argued that unlimited direct liability for a spill 
makes it difficult to obtain insurance and that the various state 
laws foster the filing of too many lawsuits the industry has sought 
a federal liability law that would preempt state laws for years but 
each time has been unsuccessful 
rep walter jones dnc chairman of the merchant marine and 
fisheries committee and one of the sponsors of the house bill 
disputes claims that the oil companies would benefit by the 
legislation jones committee approved the bill by a voice vote last 
thursday 
committee staffers point out that a shipper would still be 
directly liable for cleanup costs beyond the ceiling established by 
the bill if gross negligence can be shown and the oil industry still 
would have to pay for up to 1 billion in cleanup costs albeit 
through the special fund fueled by surcharges 
environmentalists maintain that the catch is in proving gross 
negligence on the part of a corporation as opposed to an 
individual that might work for the corporation 
a floor vote is expected on the bill by midweek and 
environmentalists are hoping amendments to be offered by reps 
george miller dcalif and gerry studds dmass will bring it 
more closely in line with the senate version 
this will show which representatives sides with big oil and 
which takes the side of environmental protection said jim maddy 
executive director of the league of conservation voters

scholars agreed that the former president 
of the united states was no intellectual was fond of horses and had 
few close personal friendships they denied that he was a figurehead 
spun around by the whiz kids in his cabinet 
sound like a seminar on ronald reagan guess again 
the panel discussion was a highlight of a threeday conference 
winding up here saturday on george washington and the american 
presidency the event was sponsored by the mount vernon ladies 
association which runs washingtons restored home at nearby mount 
vernon and the american studies center 
the conference was held as part of the observance of the 
bicentennial of washingtons inauguration as president in 1789 
the picture of the nations first president that emerges is of a 
workaholic a demanding taskmaster chillingly formal in his public 
demeanor something of a nitpicker and a charmer with women 
i am not sure that i would really call george washington a warm 
person christine meadows curator of mount vernon said during 
fridays panel 
he had a great sense of the respect that was due to rank and 
position and a strong feeling that if one had attained that 
position then he was due a great deal of respect ms meadows 
said and he conducted himself that way in public 
she said he had few close relationships although family 
members said he could be warm and informal when out of the public 
eye 
john stagg associate professor of history at the university of 
virginia and editor in chief of the papers of james madison 
said washington and his close associates had forged their 
relationships in the politics of colonial virginia and they were 
much more pragmatic more political than they would be purely 
personal 
everything went in his daily life according to clockwork ms 
meadows said nobody entered his study without his personal 
invitation in that sense he was perhaps with alexander hamilton 
sharing an apparent workaholism 
you are almost in awe of his capacity for detail he must have 
driven people crazy who worked for him he was a nitpicker to some 
extent 
dan jordan executive director of monticello thomas jeffersons 
restored mansion near charlottesville va said washington freely 
acknowledged his own lack of a formal education 
some historians have made a great deal of this and suggested 
that he was spun around by the whiz kids in his cabinet and that 
they led him by the hand for their own purposes against his own 
interest jordan said i dont think that argument holds water 
scholars have concluded that jefferson hamilton and madison 
would all score in the genius range if they could take an iq test 
the jefferson specialist said 
in that company washington might appear a bit slow but who 
wouldnt he asked 
he cited jeffersons own judgment of the first president his 
mind was great and powerful without being of the first order 
the panelists did not press any comparisons with reagan but 
critics have also pictured the immediate past president as a man of 
ordinary intelligence who served as a front man for policies worked 
out by his subordinates 
reagans supporters defend him against this criticism and jordan 
defended washington saying there isnt any question from the 
record and from what he accomplished and achieved that he was plenty 
sharp judgmentally jordan argued that judgment and courage are 
more important in a president than intellectual brilliance anyway 
stephen schechter a political scientist who is chairman of the 
new york bicentennial commission was asked about washingtons 
fondness for horses a trait that reagan shares he had his life 
divided into parts public service and home schechter said i 
think washington truly held nothing more valuable than his return 
home and that return had much that went along with it involving 
agriculture and horses and the like 
asked whether washington warmed up in feminine company ms 
meadows replied he enjoyed women and they found him enormously 
interesting he seemed to be more at ease with women

breathtaking change is sweeping eastern europe 
the soviet union and western europe here is a report on the key 
issues the continent encounters as it experiences the second great 
transformation of the postwar era 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fifty years after world war ii europe is again in 
ferment the postpostwar era is dawning 
as the western half of the continent approaches a watershed in 
the long trek toward union its rival bloc beyond the iron curtain 
is falling to pieces for poland and hungary democracy beckons 
east germany having spurned the new spirit of mikhail s gorbachev 
suffers the humiliation of more than 14000 of its citizens fleeing 
west 
these refugees most of them young and skilled are the lifeblood 
of the 40yearold communist state yet they have chosen to cut 
themselves off from roots friends and families and take their 
chances in the west 
the phenomenon is not new hundreds have died attempting to 
breach the 28yearold berlin wall or the watchtowered frontier 
that divides the germanys 
what is breathtakingly different is that they fled via hungary 
once one of the hardline eastern bloc countries now reformed and 
liberalized in a manner that leaves its ally east germany looking 
like a dinosaur 
the whole continent of europe has embarked on an adventure the 
geopolitical order that was imposed after world war ii and defined 
by an iron curtain from the baltic to the adriatic is crumbling and 
no one can say what finally will take its place 
the new europe is not yet born but it is gestating writes 
daniel vernet a senior editor of the french daily le monde 
much depends on whether gorbachev can keep control of the forces 
his reforms have unleashed will moscow allow its satellites to fly 
into new uncharted orbits can it contain the pentup ethnic and 
nationalist rage simmering in latvia georgia armenia uzbekistan 
and other soviet republics can the west afford the kind of aid 
needed to keep the new democracies afloat 
there is widespread rejection of orthodox communism and an 
admission of its political economic and social failures 
meanwhile in western europe the 12 states of the european 
economic community are about to pool their sovereignty and cement 
their political and economic union at the end of 1992 in what some 
will be tempted to call a united states of europe 
a huge bloc of 320 million people untrammeled by frontiers is 
about to emerge fifty years ago they were at war with each other 
europe is rediscovering itself it is now able to put a line 
under the second world war look at itself and see where we are in 
the world says robert elphick an eec spokesman in london 
eastern europeans are also rediscovering themselves and falling 
back on old traditions expressing themselves through their own 
culture and not through something imported from outside by forceable 
means he said in an interview 
east and west compelling images are being etched almost daily on 
european minds an east german woman painting a west german insignia 
onto her car before crossing the border giant machines digging a 
tunnel to link britain to france in poland the east blocs first 
noncommunist premier 
while the unity of western europe is the outcome of a plodding 
painstaking process that began soon after world war ii events in 
eastern europe are provoked by what french analyst eva kulesza calls 
an acceleration of history 
the postwar order so threatening and yet so stable so 
basically unacceptable and yet so reassuringly predictable is 
unraveling at an accelerating pace says francois heisbourg 
director of the londonbased international institute for strategic 
studies 
it may make adjustment difficult and sow the seeds of future 
instability he wrote in the independent newspaper in london 
detlef kuhn director of the bonn governments allgerman 
institute believes the refugee exodus has made german reunification 
a live issue 
in an interview kuhn argued that if east germany were to 
implement the reforms needed to make it attractive to its 17 million 
citizens the country would have to dump communism and then would 
cease to have any reason to exist 
my analysis is that unification would solve so many problems 
that we would have an economic boom which is good not only for 
germany but europe as a whole kuhn said 
but the world may not be ready for an even bigger germany 
dominating the heart of europe with its mighty economic muscle 
if you go beyond the ritual calling for pulling down the berlin 
wall i think there is a feeling that german unification might not 
be desirable says jonathan hydeprice an analyst at the royal 
institute of international affairs in london 
since it is assumed that moscow would tolerate a reunited germany 
only if it were neutral he said in an interview i think theres 
a feeling that west germany is too important for nato and the eec to 
risk losing 
most analysts say its far too early to write east germanys 
obituary the economist calculated that even with the exodus via 
hungary proportionately fewer people have left east germany in the 
past year than emigrate from ireland yet nobody assumes the 
collapse of ireland 
but it concluded unification would be the worlds biggest change 
in 40 years and is no longer a subject from which the eye can be 
comfortably averted 
mrs kulesza head of soviet and east european research at the 
independent french institute of international relations agrees 
what im worried about is whether we are really prepared for it 
do we really wanted a united germany she said in an interview 
in a profoundly gloomy analysis oxford university professor john 
gray writes that the economic odds against gorbachev may be 
insurmountable even with massive western aid 
the danger is that the decay of the totalitarian system built 
up by stalin and lenin will result not in the reconstitution of a 
stable civil society but in mounting chaos economic collapse and 
the destabilization of the experiments in controlled democracy in 
poland and hungary 
if so he wrote then what we are now witnessing in the soviet 
union is not the middle of a reform but the beginnings of a 
revolution whose course no one can foresee 
norman stone professor of modern history at oxford university 
sees the wheel turning full circle to a point where we may 
at long last be realizing the aims with which we went to war 50 
years ago 
there are many problems to come he wrote in the sunday 
times but 1989 is a good year to be alive we may at long last 
have won the war

one dresses like an undertaker and talks like a 
diplomat the other more resembles an exaltar boy neither even 
remotely takes after edward i koch the citys celebrated reviled 
and garrulous mayor since 1977 
but one of them will take his job 
the altar boy is rudolph w giuliani winner of last weeks 
republican mayoral primary his opponent is david dinkins who 
toppled koch in the democratic contest with surprising ease 
whoever wins the general election political analysts say the two 
mark a new era of new york city politics giuliani is the first 
republican in 25 years with a shot at city hall dinkins would be 
the first black mayor 
in a thematic way new yorkers are looking for change the 
voting in both primaries suggested that said raymond harding 
chief of the citys tiny liberal party whose nomination giuliani 
also holds in the general election change is the paramount 
issue 
giuliani hopes so he is the ultimate political outsider a 
republican in an overwhelmingly democratic city a former federal 
prosecutor who made his name chasing corruption in city government 
and wall street a man who never has held elective office 
giulianis principal asset is that he has no background in 
government therefore he can say hes going to change things said 
mitchell moss head of the urban research center at new york 
university he can take the full offense he says ill clean 
house 
true to form in accepting the gop nomination tuesday night 
giuliani described his campaign as a crusade to establish a 
new generation of leadership in this city the next day he 
personalized the attack calling dinkins a clubhouse politician 
tied to a discredited democratic regime 
still giuliani 45 faces formidable odds twothirds of the 
citys 3 million registered voters are democrats it took just 
75000 republican votes for giuliani to overwhelm his primary 
opponent cosmetics heir ronald lauder dinkins to defeat koch and 
two other democrats got nearly 540000 votes 
this is a democratic town with a vengeance said norman 
adler a veteran political consultant youve got to get a whole 
lot of democrats to vote for you if you want to win 
dinkins 62 has promptly seized that advantage making party 
affiliation a prime issue new york will not become a republican 
beachhead in 1989 he declared wednesday at a rally with his 
defeated opponents he personalized his attack as well 
characterizing giuliani as an agent of reactionary republican 
government 
the two are likely to tangle on other issues including legal 
abortion which dinkins supports and giuliani has addressed 
equivocally the death penalty which giuliani supports and dinkins 
opposes and drugs and crime on which dinkins seeks to counter 
giulianis crimefighting image 
but neither is a koch whose acid tongue created issues as often 
as it addressed them giulianis first words tuesday night were to 
congratulate dinkins and pledge a race that unites new york 
city and dinkins called himself the guy that brings people 
together 
the prime challenge for dinkins the manhattan borough president 
is to bring even more voters together than he did in the primary he 
won nine in 10 black voters half the hispanics and roughly three in 
10 whites mainly the young and the liberal but he lost queens and 
staten island the boroughs with the largest white populations 
the same people who said david couldnt win the primary for any 
number of reasons too black too manhattan too liberal now will 
say the same thing about his race against giuliani adler said 
but broadening his appeal was dinkins byword in the primary a 
career officeholder who served 10 years as city clerk he is a 
formal reserved and conciliatory figure so reticent his critics 
call him indecisive 
dinkins principal asset is that he represents a new group 
whose time has come moss said he provides an opportunity for 
blacks and hispanics to take a major leadership role in municipal 
government 
at the same time he said the challenge is for dinkins to 
disassociate himself from the perception that hes the candidate of 
one interest group and to demonstrate that hes a black candidate 
running for mayor who is concerned with all people

yehya mansour could hear the exploding 
artillery shells as he flipped his radio from one station to 
another trying to find which neighborhoods were being pounded by 
the christian guns

his wife grabbed the other they ran down the stairs to shelter in 
the basement of their apartment block in west beiruts verdun 
neighborhood 
mansour a 32yearold bank clerk has learned in six months of 
artillery battles between the syrians and christians that when 
ashrafiyeh gets hit the christians respond by shelling verdun 
thank god for the radios mansour puffed as he settled the 
family in the shelter theyre our lifeline our companion if it 
wasnt for them we wouldnt know what was going on 
in the basement mansour huddled with his family and 
channelhopped between all five of beiruts radio stations 
christian and moslem to keep track of what was happening 
many families use four or five transistor radios tuned to 
different stations for news of the fighting in which more than 800 
people have been killed and more than 2500 wounded since march 8 
beiruts stations also broadcast survival tips such as how to 
minimize the effect of shrapnel or how to keep children amused in 
the long hours in the bunker 
during heavy shelling the radios drop their regular programs of 
music comedy shows and dramas to broadcast messages from residents 
to families and friends to assure them theyre safe 
salami abulmouna is trapped in his office he assures his 
family in verdun he is safe an announcer said on the voice of the 
people run by the lebanese communist party 
thats our son mansours wife munir shouted with joy 
thank god hes alive 
that night the voice of the people read thousands of messages 
from beirutis for four straight hours 
the voice of lebanon run by the rightwing christian phalange 
party has a big audience in the arab world and western europe for 
its daily reunion of the beloved program in which lebanese send 
taperecorded messages to relatives abroad to let them know theyre 
well 
each station has its own distinctive signature tune to announce a 
flash voice of lebanon for instance uses the theme music from the 
movie shaft 
radio reporters risk their lives to hop from one stricken 
district to another feeding onthespot reports to their stations 
by radio telephone 
i feel im providing a humanitarian service said nafiz 
kawwas a sunni molem reporter with the voice of the nation 
people depend on me to know whats happening 
some of the radio stations have gone underground themselves to 
escape the shelling 
the 12story voice of lebanon building has taken six direct hits 
voice of the nations eightfloor building has been hit once the 
staterun beirut radio has been hit several times 
only the voice of the people and the voice of free lebanon run 
by the christian lebanese forces militia have escaped unscathed 
voice of lebanon its main eighthfloor studios badly exposed to 
syrian shellfire has set up a sandbagged emergency newsroom on 
the less vulnerable first floor 
voice of the nation has built set up a newsroom control room 
workshop and library in the basement of its building like the other 
stations it has also set up living quarters for its personnel so 
they can stay at the station for days on end during heavy periods of 
bombardment 
we can take up to 40 people at a time said mohammed 
mashnouk who heads the committee that runs the station weve got 
mattresses refrigerators water and food in the basement 
the station has adapted its work schedules because of the 
shelling so that teams work one week in one week out mashnouk 
noted 
many of the our people have taken their families out of beirut 
for safety and this was the most convenient solution so that they 
will come to work he explained

the dream of some pilots to buy their own 
planes and run an airline is becoming reality for 6326 united 
airlines flyers who will have to learn to operate in the boardroom 
as well as the cockpit 
the federal government wall street analysts aviation experts 
and employees of other airlines are watching closely the 
employeemanagement buyout of united approved last week by the 
airlines parent company ual inc 
some say it should make uniteds advertised friendly skies 
even friendlier but the 72 billion deal that would make united 
the nations largest employeeowned company still faces some 
obstacles and raises some scepticism 
it wont be the first time a pilot has owned an airline or moved 
in with management but it will be the first time employees have 
taken a controlling interest in a major carrier 
the pilots share would be 75 percent with 10 percent held by 
current management and 15 percent by british airways plc 
the deal still faces potential hurdles including participation 
of the machinists and flight attendants unions and approval by 
shareholders and the department of transportation and despite ual 
approval a competing bid by california billionaire marvin davis 
still looms on friday he offered to match the 300pershare deal 
if the pilots plan falls through 
pilots spend more time in the cockpit discussing how theyd run 
the airline than anything else said larry crawford a former pan 
american pilot who joined management and now runs avitas an 
aviation consulting firm 
if anyone is cut out to run an airline its the pilots he 
said but added that doesnt necessarily mean pilots will make the 
best managers for a complex company like united some of them tend 
to see little beyond the aircraft itself he said 
united pilots dont intend to actually run the airline but they 
will have a say in who does and they expect some changes including 
less acrimony between employees and management 
the plan calls for ual chairman stephen wolf and chief financial 
officer john c pope to continue running the company for the new 
employeeowners said pilots spokesman hank krakowski 
he predicted the deal will go through even without participation 
of machinists flight attendants or the companys 26000 nonunion 
employees negotiations are underway to include all 68000 employees 
passengers might expect some changes krakowski said 
pilots are likely to announce over the planes public address 
system that the owner is at the wheel he said 
i think youll see pilots more inclined to walk back into the 
cabin and actually show an interest towards the customer he said 
robert joedicke advisory director of the wall street firm of 
shearson lehman hutton said united could become more attractive 
from the aspect of service because employees who own the company 
are more likely to project a friendly image 
he said the deal also should make united more competitive on 
fares because of the wage and work concessions 
aviation analyst dean stockman said the arrangement should not 
make a difference in safety because united already has a top 
maintenance record but he said it should make a more harmonious 
company 
they wont be arguing with management theyll be arguing with 
themselves he said 
stockman said however the arrangement raises doubts about the 
future of the air line pilots association which represents pilots 
questioning whether pilot owners would want to stay in the powerful 
union 
why should they pay dues to protect the employees from 
themselves he asked were in unchartered waters here 
mark daugherty aviation analyst for dean witter reynolds in new 
york city said the takeover could add to management problems 
management has a tough enough time when you have different 
voices and groups with different interests involved it could be 
even tougher to run the company he said 
but daugherty added that ownership should give employees pretty 
intense interest in making sure the company comes out ok

police confiscated 980 elephant tusks 
weighing about seven tons saturday and arrested six men suspected of 
running an international ivory smuggling operation 
police said the haul was one of the worlds largest seizures of 
poached ivory 
police spokesman kierie du rand said the ivory would sell for 
about 15 million police discovered it when they stopped a truck 
at okahandja 45 miles north of windhoek he said 
the tusks are believed to have come from elephants in southern 
angola and northern namibia 
africas elephant population has fallen from about 15 million in 
1978 to as few as 400000 due mostly to poachers who seek the 
valuable tusks 
several western nations including the united states recently 
have banned the import of ivory and the 102nation convention of 
international trade in endangered species will consider a worldwide 
ban on the ivory trade next month 
angolas 14yearold civil war has made it virtually impossible 
to stop poaching in the southern part of the country 
namibia allows a limited legal trade in ivory 
south africa botswana and zimbabwe hold similar positions 
saying properly managed ivory sales allow them to keep the elephant 
population under control and generate revenue for conservation 
programs

evangelist oral roberts had a dream after 
talking to god in the desert a hospital complex where christians 
could receive medical treatment and bedside prayer but now hes 
shutting it down 
however spiritual one is you cannot do anything without 
money he said last week 
but the cutbacks could save the 4300student oral roberts 
university and other components of his ministry 
roberts had raised the money to pay for his 400acre religious 
empire in cash he built the 150 million city of faith medical 
complex without a mortgage funded 8 million in medical school 
scholarships for two years and paid 11 million in pastdue 
accounts earlier this year 
at its height the south tulsa ministry he founded 25 years ago 
was a 500 million operation 
but donations from the faithful have fallen with each national 
headline about wayward preachers roberts said since the 1987 
scandals of jimmy swaggart and jim bakker roberts ministry has 
seen a drop in monthly donations from 5 million to just over 2 
million 
i dont know why its happened roberts said i guess life 
just seems to be what it is 
it was the first time in roberts 41year evangelical career that 
he publicly acknowledged that expecting a miracle the theme of his 
ministry is not always enough 
the 71yearold faithhealer said he received his vision about 
the medical complex during a 1977 conversation with god in a 
california desert and was assured three years later by a 900foot 
jesus that his dream soon would come true 
last week the minister who earned his reputation as a traveling 
tent preacher offering salvation and healing gave up part of that 
dream he said he was closing his city of faith hospital and the 
147student medical school and selling his home valued at 
500000 in 1987 and other ministryowned property to pay off 25 
million in debts 
it was a tremendous undertaking roberts conceded medical 
education is far different from any other form of education ive 
ever been associated with 
but roberts does not see it as a failure 
i dont think its as bad a day as it seems i think well look 
back on this and think its the right thing he said 
in fact roberts seemed almost relieved as he told reporters 
about his plans to prune his ministry 
looking back now that its made i think its one of the best 
decisions ive ever made 
roberts and those who have followed the ministry agree that the 
cutbacks could work for the better 
the steps that he is taking to stop the flow of money at his 
two most expensive points of loss the hospital and medical school 
will strengthen financially the university and the ministry 
tulsa mayor rodger randle said we have a shortterm loss but a 
strengthened ability to survive in the long term 
the medical school has been a source of many financial problems 
for the ministry in 1987 roberts said he had to raise 8 million 
for it or god would call me home 
the hospital which tapped 24 million from the ministrys 
coffers in its first year of operation in 1981 only recently began 
covering its own expenses roberts built the hospital with a 777bed 
capacity but state regulators approved only 294 beds and the 
highest average occupancy was 148 in 1984 
i have reason to believe that that hospital itself was not 
doing that poorly said james stansbarger president of the tulsa 
hospital council one of that hospitals main purposes was to help 
that medical school you have to make your choices his choices were 
the schools going so the hospitals going too 
roberts said he had no choice but to take immediate action 
weve got to take the religious blinders off our eyes and end 
our holierthanthou attitude and realize that we live in a human 
world and that it takes money to survive roberts told students 
faculty and staff wednesday

the 16 members of the us precision helicopter 
team eagerly swapped war stories and tie tacks with their soviet 
competitors at the world helicopter championships but struck out 
when they tried to trade car license plates 
some guys had these great license plates made up for the team 
and wanted to trade but none of the soviets owned a car recalled 
pilot jon iseminger with a laugh 
iseminger and his copilot and navigator rudolph v hobbs took 
the top individual honors at the competition held last week outside 
paris both army warrant officers are helicopter instructors based 
at fort rucker ala 
as part of the seventeam us contingent they came away with 
the united states third consecutive championship and a lesson in 
the men they could possibly face off against should the superpowers 
ever go to war 
hobbs who admits to being dubbed mushmouth by his comrades 
acknowledged that when words failed hand signals often made do 
but the business of flying wasnt topic no 1 
we exchanged war stories and talked about our ways of life 
hobbs said in a telephone interview from belgium after the 
competition they didnt speak english very well but they 
understood it better 
iseminger who also was the pilot of the winning crew at the last 
world meet in 1986 said the soviets were a lot more open a lot 
more jovial and friendly than during previous years an apparent 
reflection of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs new policy of 
openess toward the west 
however the friendly communication had its limits 
although the military background of the us team was clear it 
was made up of four active army teams and three army national guard 
teams the soviets refused to say whether they were currently in 
the military or not iseminger said 
the level of competence needed in the contest would not easily be 
obtained in the soviet union without a military background 
the international competition is open to civilians and 38 crews 
from six nations participated the soviets came in second the 
british third french fourth and west germans fifth 
the competition is a grueling challenge that requires an immense 
amount of concentration and precision in navigation flying and 
timing 
competitors must fly through four events a 150kilometer 
navigation course a 80kilometer course that must begin and end at 
a specific time with a load dropped off during the exercise a 
precision flying event and a slalom and skill course 
for example during the 80kilometer test a crew is handed a 
packet five minutes before takeoff that contains exact takeoff and 
arrival times and the course route contestants must take off on 
time arrive on time and then thread a glass bottle suspended on a 
20foot rope through a hole in a box without breaking it 
the americans flew the oh58 kiowa scout helicopter used 
primarily to spot targets for other helicopter gunships on the 
battlefield the soviets used the mi2 or hoplite a utilitarian 
transport or combat chopper 
it takes skills but it really boils down to mental toughness 
and who handles pressure best said iseminger 
the pilot who in his job checks on the capabilities of other 
pilots said the testing is useful for a military pilot 
its like money in the bank he said you may not need to 
use these skills everyday but you know inside yourself that you can 
use them when you need them 
hobbs who tattled that his winning comrade was known as the 
ice man for his cool flying under pressure said the soviets 
appeared to have inferior training and that he wouldnt worry about 
meeting such competitors in a war zone 
i dont think so hobbs said really there was just 
something lacking they just couldnt cut the mustard

vice president dan quayle leaves monday on a 
fournation trip to asia with stops scheduled in south korea and 
the philippines where us military presence is embroiled in 
congressional and regional controversy 
quayle also will visit malaysia and japan on the trip which will 
incorporate trade and human rights themes 
he begins the 11day journey with a brief stop at alaskas 
elmendorf air force base there accompanied by transportation 
secretary sam skinner quayle plans to focus attention on the status 
of the cleanup of the exxon valdez oil spill 
they will meet with fishermen and state and local representatives 
regarding cleanup progress since the march spill by the exxon tanker 
that despoiled thousands of miles of pristine shoreline exxon last 
week was packing up most of its crews for the winter following a 
25week cleanup effort 
federal officials have insisted the oil company will return next 
spring to continue the cleanup and quayle will underscore that 
message 
after hearing about the status from the local representatives he 
might call for exxon to conduct some winter cleanup efforts which 
alaska state officials are planning to do themselves said one 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
quayles journey to south korea and japan comes as uneasiness 
over the us trade deficits with each nation continue to fester in 
talks with leaders in those countries the vice president will urge 
them to open their markets to reverse the trade imbalance 
situations said quayles press secretary david beckwith 
the vice president in previewing his trip last week said he 
would focus on the importance of having nonprotectionist 
policies the importance of having open markets and access the 
importance of having a twoway street when it comes to trade 
there are concerns of the american people about access to 
japanese markets about whether the united states is getting a fair 
shake in the trade relationship quayle said in an interview with 
foreign journalists 
additionally in korea where persistent demonstrations are 
evidence of a feisty antius movement quayle is expected to 
stress a human rights message 
some us officials have expressed concerns about the recent 
indictment of opposition leader kim daejung and two lawmakers on 
charges of failing to report an associates secret trip to communist 
north korea 
one source said administration concerns center on possible 
political motivations for the indictments kim daejung a former 
presidential candidate who heads the largest opposition party has 
accused koreas government of trying to undermine his party and he 
denies any involvement with the north korea trip 
asked last week whether he would raise human rights with the 
korean government said he would democracy and freedom and human 
rights go together he said i know in my discussions i will be 
speaking from an ideological and philosophical point of view in 
those terms 
quayle will be greeted in south korea by the newly arrived 
ambassador donald gregg president bushs former national security 
adviser who won senate confirmation recently after rough hearings 
into his knowledge of the irancontra affair 
south korea also figures importantly into us military strategy 
with 43000 us personnel stationed there 
bush is running into congressional roadblocks as he tries to 
strengthen that presence several congress members have called for 
reductions in the us troop strength but quayle said the 
administration is adamantly opposed to any reduction 
the senate on friday virtually wiped out the 863 million bush 
requested for new construction at us bases there the house had 
earlier earmarked 742 million for that purpose and a compromise 
remains to be worked out 
the senate also cut all 408 million bush requested for work on 
its philippines bases pending upcoming negotiations on a new treaty 
to replace the one under which the united states leases clark air 
base and subic bay naval base 
controversy over the bases is certain to be an issue during 
quayles visit at a time when the united states and the philippines 
are preparing to start negotiations on renewing the six military 
base leases that expire in 1991 
many filipino lawmakers are demanding far higher us aid in 
return or a phased withdrawal of american forces 
a move is afoot in the philippine senate to close the bases 
president corazon aquino scheduled to visit the united states in 
november has refused to say whether she favors keeping the bases 
which employ some 70000 filipinos 
quayles visit to malaysia is said by some officials to be an 
effort to nudge manila by courting another potential suitor for the 
base however malaysian leaders have indicated they would not want 
the us bases and have voiced opposition to the position of 
singapore which said it would welcome the bases should manila eject 
them 
quayle is also expected to discuss with asian allies the volatile 
political situation in cambodia where the shape of the future 
government is uncertain as vietnam withdraws its occupying troops 
efforts closely watched by the united states so far have failed to 
organize a power sharing by two noncommunist resistance groups and 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge 
in japan quayle will visit tokyos space center in tsukuba for 
discussions on expanding usjapan space cooperation japan is a 
partner in nasas project to develop a space station and quayle 
who heads the presidents national space council said he wants to 
talk about how the relationship can move forward and be enhanced 
he also will be in japan for the conference of the international 
democratic union an international organization of conservative 
party leaders including great britains margaret thatcher

protesters in nagasaki trampled on a wreath offered 
by a us navy captain who was seeking saturday to commemorate 
victims of the atomic bombing of that city 
about 50 chanting protesters many survivors of the bombing 
refused to allow capt peter roberts of the us frigate rodney m 
davis to approach a large memorial statue in the center of 
nagasakis peace memorial park 
the statue is dedicated to victims of the us atomic bombing of 
nagasaki at the end of world war ii 
roberts and other crew members instead placed a wreath about 100 
feet away from the statue after they left several protesters 
pushed the wreath over and stamped on it 
national television broadcast scenes of the protest 
the japan broadcasting corp quoted senji yamaguchi chairman of 
the nagasaki atomic bomb victims council as saying the group was 
protesting because of the possibility the ship was carrying nuclear 
weapons 
the agency quoted roberts as saying he regretted the incident 
but that it would not affect his friendship with the people of 
nagasaki 
japan forbids the production possession or introduction of 
nuclear weapons into its territory but many people believe us 
navy ships routinely enter japan with such weapons aboard 
kyodo news service reported that nagasaki mayor hiroshi motoshima 
refused to accompany roberts to the park saturday after roberts 
refused to confirm or deny that nuclear weapons were on board the 
ship 
the frigate is the first us navy ship to visit nagasaki since 
the city decided in 1974 not to allow port calls by ships from 
countries that possess nuclear weapons kyodo said 
it said the city agreed to the visit because of the mutual 
security treaty between the united states and japan 
the us military maintains a policy of not publicly confirming 
or denying the presence of nuclear weapons 
an estimated 70000 people died when the united states dropped an 
atomic bomb on nagasaki on aug 9 1945 three days after the city 
of hiroshima became the worlds first victim of an atomic attack

with problems piling up for president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms the mood of the soviet citizenry has taken on a 
dark edge these days public debate now includes such terms as 
coup and civil war 
those onceforbidden words are used only by a minority speaking 
of distant undesirable possibilities but they reflect some of the 
pessimism in the fifth year of gorbachevs reforms 
it has now become obvious that our 70year experiment has ended 
in failure says vladimir a tikhonov far from being a dissident 
tikhonov is a scholar a parliamentarian and the first president of 
the new society of cooperatives 
a semenchenko of tallinn estonia expressed his fears this way 
in a letter published sept 8 by the newspaper socialist industry 
ethnic hostility threatens to spill over into civil war what 
have we come to a crisis in the economy increase in organized 
crime a drop in the authority of the party and the komsomol the 
communist party youth group 
communist maverick boris n yeltsin touring the united states 
said monday that gorbachev has six months to a year to make some 
progress or face the possibility of revolution 
andrei d sakharov nuclear physicist nobel peace prize laureate 
and parliamentarian wrote in the july 30 edition of the weekly 
ogonyok that in soviet society now any tragic horrible thing 
is possible 
i think a military coup is possible in such a situation he 
wrote a rightwing coup is also possible 
indeed problems keep piling up for gorbachev ethnic violence 
strikes sweeping the country empth store shelves a 
nexttoworthless currency 
even optimists such as economist abel aganbegyan say it will be 
three years before the soviet union can regularly stock store 
shelves with basics such as detergent tikhonov for one is much 
more pessimistic 
the only thing we can expect out of this system is ruins and 
on these ruins we have to create something new he said in an 
ogonyok interview published sept 3 this period will take a 
quartercentury not less from the moment we start real 
reconstruction of the system and we havent started yet he said 
soviets watched their television intently this summer when the 
first congress of peoples deputies and a revamped supreme soviet 
met the bodies took on a raft of muchneeded legislation but often 
fell into public bickering and disorganization on nationwide 
television 
a new session opens sept 25 with the pressure on to act more 
like a parliament and less like a debating society 
the communist partys central committee next week convenes a 
longdelayed meeting to discuss deteriorating ethnic relations 
some members of the moscow intelligentsia say that after several 
years of increasingly grim accounts of the soviet past and whats in 
store for the future they yearn for simple lighthearted stories 
on film and in magazines to buoy their spirits 
the only thing that seems secure is the one thing gorbachev has 
been able to tackle directly his place as president and communist 
party chief the soviet leader appears to be solidly entrenched in 
the kremlin able to ride out coal strikes and ethnic violence alike 
without challenges to his supremacy 
those who warn of the possibility of civil war or a coup do so by 
way of warning what will happen if gorbachev fails rather than 
making any appeal to replace the soviet leader 
but it was a somber gorbachev who appeared on television last 
week assuring soviets he was back in moscow after summer vacation 
and steering a firm course between both left and right 
one can hear in this discordant choir voices predicting 
imminent chaos and speculation about the threat of a coup and even 
civil war gorbachev said it is a fact that some people would 
like to create an atmosphere of anxiety despair and uncertainty in 
society 
gorbachev has spent much of his time in power trying to spur 
soviet citizens into political action after years of passivity 
now that theyve begun to act they are more difficult to manage 
but gorbachev still said the increased political activity was good 
because it helped overcome years of alienation 
the community is casting off illusions he said it no 
longer believes that there are simple solutions to be brought 
readymade from above for all our problems 
gorbachev himself has said that reforming soviet society is more 
difficult that it first appeared and the soviet leader reminded a 
society that he says has largely forgotten how to work that they 
have to do more than just talk 
we live the way we work no better and no worse it is said 
more and more often i want to add only one thing that tomorrow 
too we shall live exactly the way we work he said

the us savings rate fell sharply after 
congress slashed tax deductions for most individual retirement 
accounts according to a congressional study released saturday by 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee has called for 
restoring partial tax deductions on contributions to iras instead of 
cutting the capital gains tax he said the new study shows their 
effectiveness in promoting savings 
now if were going to be less dependent on foreign investment 
and foreign loaning of money to us then we have to increase the 
savings rate in this country said bentsen 
bentsen said the study found that after 1986 when use of the ira 
was severely curtailed by cutting back on the tax deductions 
savings rates dropped substantially in this country and they 
were already low and that in addition the iras themselves were cut 
almost in half 
the study by an economist for the joint economic committee of 
congress found the weight of evidence suggests that iras generate 
savings which otherwise would not occur although the precise net 
increase remains controversial 
the study said the personal savings rate averaged 53 percent of 
disposable income from 198286 and has averaged 37 percent since 
then the rate fell to 32 percent in 19871988 the lowest in 40 
years according to the study 
savers contributed 38 billion to iras in 1986 but the amount 
fell to almost half that the following year the study said 
the congressional study also mentions analyses by professors 
steven venti of dartmouth college and david wise of harvard 
university that suggest net national savings is increased by an 
amount up to onehalf the size of total ira deposits 
if true then iras could play a productive role as a complement 
to deficit reduction in efforts to boost us savings investment 
and productivity the congressional study said 
bentsen has proposed a deduction of at least 50 percent for all 
ira accounts his plan would allow the withdrawal of ira funds 
without penalty at the time of retirement for a down payment on the 
purchase of a first home or to finance college costs 
that would help us bring interest rates down in his country 
that kind of an increased savings said bentsen that would make 
us much more competitive and slow down some of the consumer binge in 
this country it would help us with our trade deficit 
bentsen argues his plan would have a much broader base of support 
and would go farther in pulling interest rates down and in 
increasing productivity and investment than a cut in capital gains 
president bush is pressing for a cut in taxes on profits from the 
sale of stocks real estate and other investments the house ways 
and means committee over the objections of the house democratic 
leadership voted thursday for the capital gains cut

the soviet government has prepared an emergency 
1990 budget aimed at cutting the deficit in half within a year and 
slashing capital spending to improve supplies of consumer goods 
but the budget to be introduced to the supreme soviet 
legislature already is coming under attack by at least one leading 
reformminded economist who says parts of it are too austere 
committees begin work monday and the budget will be submitted to 
the full legislature when it goes back to work a week later 
the 1990 budget will seek to cut the deficit from 192 billion to 
96 billion the tass news agency reported saturday 
the plan calls for slashing spending on new factories and 
production equipment by 30 percent while calling for an ambitious 
67 percent increase in production of consumer goods the tass 
report indicated 
some of the countrys most radical economists say many economic 
problems are based in the decadesold practice of setting high 
production targets that are not feasible and ignore the quality of 
the goods produced 
other legislation will call for the establishment of a soviet 
securities market tass said but the report gave no details on that 
or actual figures included in the budget 
in a nationwide television speech sept 9 president mikhail s 
gorbachev said the governments program to work out of the deficit 
consumer shortages and other economic ills may include unpopular 
probably tough and even painful measures 
he said the government led by premier nikolai i ryzkhov would 
have to come up with a practical plan to eliminate consumer 
shortages that now encompass sugar soap meat cigarettes and many 
other basic items many cities are rationing such items in an effort 
to halt hoarding 
it was only a year ago that soviet officials announced for the 
first time the country had any kind of budget deficit and the 
supreme soviet passed a budget with a 58 billion deficit in a 
budget of almost 800 billion 
however much of the deficit was hidden by accounting tricks and 
estimates of the 1989 budget deficit quickly mushroomed 
one leading economist abel aganbegyan said in an article in the 
september issue of the monthly government herald that the plan to 
cut 1538 billion in capital outlays by 30 percent is too severe 
speaking honestly the proposal frightens me he wrote 
i think this could lead to extremely negative consequences you 
cant go from one extreme to the other 
soviet budgets for years have been burdened by huge outlays for 
new factories buildings and equipment at the expense of basic 
consumer goods gorbachev and his economic advisers now say much of 
the equipment and many of the buildings were unnecesary in the first 
place and are operating inefficiently if at all 
but aganbegyan an adviser to gorbachev said the 1990 budget 
plan goes too far in cutting those expenditures the ministry of oil 
and gas construction for example is planning to freeze millions of 
rubles worth of construction equipment and thousands of miles of 
pipeline and discharge 76000 highly qualified workers he wrote 
the economist said the capital budget should be cut by about 20 
percent with 8 billion set aside to help soviets finance private 
housing construction 
the other 24 billion should be used to increase public housing 
construction the number of private garden plots and family resorts 
and set up a program to help consumers buy highly soughtafter items 
such as cars video equipment and personal computers he said 
the budget is likely to come under tough scrutiny by supreme 
soviet committees which under the new government structure 
instituted this year have become much more critical of government 
programs

syrian and christian gunners skirmished 
with mortars and machine guns around beirut on saturday ignoring an 
urgent plea by the arab league for an immediate end to the bloodshed 
police said at least 12 people were wounded in sporadic clashes 
that continued hours after an arab league mediation committee issued 
its latest call for a truce and said it is sending an envoy sunday 
to implement a peace plan 
a police spokesman who by custom is not named said he doubts 
the fighting will abate before the arrival of the delegate algerian 
diplomat lakhdar ibrahimi 
a source at christian gen michel aouns army command accused the 
syrians of maintaining the provocative firing against our 
positions 
our officers have strict orders to practice maximum 
selfrestraint but they cant sit and watch others attacking them 
without defending themselves the source said on condition of 
anonymity 
aoun did not immediately comment on the truce call which was 
welcomed by his chief rival acting prime minister salim hoss 
this is a chance to end the crisis that might not be 
repeated the sunni moslem leader said in a statement 
syria also welcomed the truce call and urged all lebanese 
parties to cooperate with the arab league envoy according to the 
official syrian arab news agency 
the syrian government is convinced that the implementation of 
these security measures will lead to preventing bloodshed and will 
pave the way to solving the lebanese crisis it quoted an 
unidentified official as saying 
in the united states the call was praised by the bush 
administration and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the white house welcomed the declaration as a constructive 
basis upon which all parties to the conflict in lebanon can engage 
in a political process devoid of violence and coercion 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration plans to restaff its embassy in beirut as soon as its 
diplomats can be reasonably safe and effective 
washington evacuated its 30 diplomats in beirut on sept 5 after 
aoun reportedly threatened to take americans hostage the maronite 
catholic general denied making such a threat 
he has accused washington of favoring syria saying any action 
against that nation could harm eight americans held by 
iranianbacked shiite moslem groups in lebanon syria is irans main 
ally and has pledged to help free the americans among 16 westerners 
missing in lebanon 
aoun who is armed by iraq has vowed to drive syrias 40000 
troops from lebanon charging they have betrayed an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate by siding with the moslems syria wants to link 
any pullout to a withdrawal of israeli troops in southern lebanon 
in beirut moslem and christian radio stations interrupted 
regular programming with reports of the ceasefire call which 
followed a night of ferocious shelling duels in beirut and the 
surrounding mountains that killed 12 people and wounded 72 
at least 914 people have been killed and 2697 have been wounded 
in the 6monthold artillery war between aouns forces and syrian 
soldiers 
there can be no solution to the lebanese crisis by military 
means said a communique issued in algeria morocco and saudi 
arabia whose leaders make up the mediation committee 
the statement said the ceasefire call is meant to stop the 
bloodshed and establish an atmosphere conducive to assuring the 
return of security stability and national reconciliation 
it called on all parties to stop supplying weapons to the 
combatants in lebanon and said it already has received positive 
responses in this regard 
it said a lebanese security committee would be set up under 
ibrahimi to supervise implementation of the ceasefire and monitor 
ships reported to be carrying weapons or ammunition 
blockades imposed by the syrians on the 310squaremile 
christian enclave and by aoun on illegal ports run by syrias 
militia allies south of beirut would be lifted as soon as the 
security committee began its work the statement said 
the arab league committee called for a meeting of lebanons 
parliament on sept 30 at a location to be decided later to 
discuss and prepare political reforms the committee comprises 
king fahd of saudi arabia king hassan ii of morocco and algerian 
president chadli bendjedid 
saturdays call for a halt to the fighting is the latest of many 
that have gone unanswered the new initiative follows a july 
deadlock when the committee blamed syria for blocking its mission 
by refusing to withdraw its troops 
prince saud alfaisal foreign minister of saudi arabia told 
reporters in jiddah that syria supports the new peace plan but he 
admitted the committee has no power to enforce its call 
the committee possesses no weapons with which it would impose 
its will in lebanon saud responded to a question 
the current round of violence broke out march 8 over aouns 
blockade of ports run by moslem militias a vain attempt to 
reassert government control in lebanon

at least 31 of the 54 dams operated by the 
bureau of indian affairs pose a serious threat to life and property 
according to the interior departments inspector general 
the report of inspector general james r richards said the dams 
all on indians lands in the west are either in poor or 
unsatisfactory condition as a result of inadequate maintenance 
by the bia 
these unsafe dams which pose a serious threat to hundreds of 
lives and surrounding property could potentially cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars to repair richards wrote in a letter to 
interior secretary manuel lujan 
the report released publicly over the weekend has already been 
seen by lujan who has instructed assistant secretary for indian 
affairs eddie brown to take a look and take the necessary actions 
to have those dams repaired or maintained in proper order bia 
spokesman carl shaw said saturday 
assistant inspector general harold bloom wrote in the report 
these dams have safety deficiencies including serious problems 
with excessive seepage and embankment erosion that are worsening 
each year because of a lack of maintenance most could not withstand 
a major flood and as a result are imminent threats to rural 
communities downstream 
among the worst examples said bloom are the ganado round rock 
and many farms dams in arizona the pablo and lower dry fork dams in 
montana and the ponca dam in south dakota 
failure of the pablo dam the largest in the flathead indian 
irrigation project in montana could cause considerable loss of 
life potentially 400 people and excessive economic loss in the 
towns of pablo dunham and adjacent subdivisions bloom said 
his report noted that the corps of engineers in a 1988 study on 
flood control on the navajo reservation said of ganado and six 
other dams in the area it is virtually certain that these unsafe 
and often undersized dams will fail during a major storm

the bush administration on saturday welcomed 
the call by an arab league committee for a ceasefire in lebanon and 
said us diplomats will be returned to beirut as soon as their 
safety can be assured 
the white house in a statement by press secretary marlin 
fitzwater praised the communique from the arab league tripartite 
committee which called for a halt to the fighting and an end to port 
blockades as well as a sept 30 date to begin national 
reconciliation talks by lebanons parliament 
these are essential first steps on the path to restoring a 
strong central governent in control of all of lebanons territory 
and to achieving the withdrawal of all foreign forces objectives we 
all share said the statement from fitzwater 
we call upon all parties to stop the fighting lift the 
blockades and allow the process of reconcilation to begin it said 
president bush spending the weekend at the presidential retreat 
in camp david md with his wife and friends was in contact with 
his staff on the lebanon situation he has been engaged in meetings 
and contacts with foreign leaders on the matter aides said 
the white house used the occasion saturday to open the door for a 
return of ambassdor john mccarthy and the embassy staff to beirut 
the diplomats were evacuated sept 6 after christian youths loyal to 
the government of gen michel aoun besieged the embassy compound 
the evacuation of our embassy from beirut should not be 
misread the fitzwater statement read our temporary absence 
does not mean we are indifferent to the safety and welfare of the 
people of lebanon 
indeed we redoubled our efforts with the arab league to press 
for a ceasefire and the beginning of a political process to bring 
an end to the suffering in lebanon 
rest assured the united states will return its diplomats to 
lebanon as expeditiously as we are convinced that circumstances 
exist in which our presence can be reasonably safe and effective 
the united states will engage in talks with aouns government on 
the security assurances it would require before they return said an 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
sources in lebanon said aoun considered the departure a move 
directed against his rule 
state department officials have said they considered aouns own 
earlier comments threats on americans he had said in an interview 
that the united states was obsessed with freeing americans held 
hostage in lebanon and indicated perhaps the way to get the 
attention of the united states was to take american hostages 
the declaration saturday by the foreign ministers of saudi 
arabia morocco and algeria who make up the arab league committee 
was viewed by the administration as a clear step in the right 
direction said the administration source 
previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pitting 
syrian troops and allied moslem militias against the mainly 
christian troops of aoun 
but the setting of a sept 30 negotiation date and pledges about 
restricting arms supplies indicated the effort was reasonably 
serious and pragmatic and may have potential the official added 
the arab league founded in 1945 is the chief representative of 
arab interests internationally and mediates disputes among the arab 
states

two weeks before vietnamese troops are to 
withdraw from cambodia the bush administration is in a quandary 
over what it should do to block the resurgence of the khmer rouge a 
group that murdered up to 2 million people in the 1970s us and 
congressional officials say 
basically whats happening is that most people are trying to 
figure out what to do since paris said a senior administration 
official referring to the collapse of a 19nation peace conference 
in paris last month 
people are trying to absorb what went on the official said 
speaking only on condition his name not be used what do we do 
when and if the vietnamese complete withdrawal 
participants at the paris conference failed to come up with a 
political solution for easing tension among warring factions in 
cambodia after the vietnamese leave hanoi has said it will pull its 
troops out by sept 30 ending a 10year occupation 
the vacuum has created the very real possibility that the 
genocidal khmer rouge could battle its way back to power in phnom 
penh said rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs 
fred brown an expert on indochina and former scholar at the 
carnegie endowment for international peace a think tank said the 
administration is in a genuine dilemma about cambodia in the 
wake of the paris conference there are serious questions about 
us policy he said 
a major concern are the ties between the khmer rouge and prince 
norodom sihanouk the former cambodian monarch the united states 
supports with millions of dollars in aid washington would like to 
see sihanouk head an interim government pending free elections 
supervised by the united nations 
although members of sihanouks family were murdered by the khmer 
rouge which ruled cambodia between 19751979 sihanouk has endorsed 
the idea of including the khmer rouge in a transitional government 
in cambodia 
both the khmer rouge and sihanouk receive military aid from 
china other factions in cambodia are the vietnamesebacked 
government of hun sen and a smaller noncommunist faction 
some observers at the paris conference said sihanouk abdicated 
too much of his authority to the khmer rouge is he every going to 
loosen himself from the khmer rouge brown asked nobody can 
come up with a leader to replace sihanouk 
vice president dan quayle who is expected to discuss the 
cambodian situation with asian allies on a trip to the far east this 
week told a group of reporters last week that the noncommunist 
resistance has always been from our viewpoint the best hope to see 
a political settlement occur in cambodia 
members of congress echoed concern about sihanouk 
i think we ought to make clear to sihanouk that either he and 
the noncommunists break all their ties to the khmer rouge or they 
dont get any help from us said rep chester atkins dmass 
rep jim leach riowa suggested pol pot be brought before an 
international tribunal on charges of genocide he said the united 
states should not go along with sihanouks apparent acquiescence on 
the khmer rouge 
the united states does not have the luxury of recusing itself 
on moral issues he said 
the bush administration says its adamantly opposes a return to 
power of the khmer rouge an extreme nationalist group with about 
40000 fighters 
we want to ensure that there are not more cambodian killing 
fields said richard solomon assistant secretary of state for 
east asian affairs 
at the same time state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the administration has noted that sihanouk as well as washingtons 
asian allies have said that the khmer rouge elements should 
participate in the political process 
atkins claimed administration officials used the most twisted 
and distorted logic that ive ever seen in foreign policy in 
defending a policy that opposes the khmer rouge while seeming to go 
along with sihanouks idea of including it in the government 
but solomon said on capitol hill last week that it would be 
selfdelusional to ignore the khmer rouge a force to be 
reckoned with in cambodia 
and one administration official explained the dilemma excluding 
the khmer rouge means the rebels assuredly would launch a military 
offensive to seize power creating a little lebanon in southeast 
asia he said 
by bringing some khmer rouge under the tent theres a 
possibility that peace will break out he said 
as solomon put it the chances of avoiding conflict are not 
very good but they are better with a political settlement 
complicating the situation are the soviets and the chinese 
solomon said the united states believes moscow has stepped up arms 
shipments to the hun sen regime in recent months the soviet 
union as a primary supporter of vietnam and hun sen must restrict 
its increasing flow of arms into cambodia he said 
brown said secretary of state james baker iii is likely to broach 
the issue in talks with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
later this month the united states also wants china to end its arms 
supplies to the khmer rouge 
meantime the administration has asked congress and received 
approval to spend about 75 million in humanitarian aid for 
cambodia in fiscal 1990 up about 25 million from the previous 
year 
but sources on capitol hill said bush administration have not 
requested any covert assistance for military equipment in the 
upcoming fiscal year the sources spoke on condition of anonymity

president mikhail s gorbachev urged the baltic 
republics to compromise with their minorities and settle the 
regions ethnic disputes tass reported 
the soviet president spoke at a meeting with communist party and 
government leaders from lithuania latvia and estonia tass released 
its report on the wednesday meeting late friday 
all our problems should be tackled by joint effort in the 
framework of the federation gorbachev said 
all the countrys 15 republics are tied together economically 
culturally and through human contacts he said 
if we now allowed the situation to deteriorate to the point 
where these ties would start to break up the republics and the 
whole country would be rolled back by decades gorbachev said 
he added that any attempt to infringe on citizens rights on 
the ethnic basis should be regarded as contradicting the principles 
of soviet statehood and humanism 
gorbachevs social reforms including greater tolerance of 
dissent has fueled a wave of nationalism in the baltics and other 
soviet republics 
the baltics are seeking greater autonomy and freedom from kremlin 
control but the growing nationalism also has heightened tensions 
among ethnic russians and other minority groups who live and work in 
those republics and who claim they are targets of discrimination by 
the ethnic majority 
nonestonian workers in that republic struck last month after the 
estonian government passed rough residency requirements for voting 
and running for local office 
gorbachevs conciliatory tone comes after the communist party 
central committee last month warned that separatists were leading 
the baltic republics into an abyss 
estonian radio editor harry tiido said friday that in interviews 
given when he returned to tallinn estonian communist party chief 
vaino vyalyas said gorbachev spoke favorably about the republics 
plans for more economic autonomy 
more than a million baltic residents joined hands on aug 23 to 
protest the 50th anniversary of a nazisoviet agreement that paved 
the way for moscow to annex the baltic states

an arab league committee called 
saturday for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire in 
lebanon but admitted it has no power to enforce the appeal 
the lebanese crisis will not be resolved by military means 
saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal read from the 
declaration of the tripartite supreme arab committee comprising 
saudi arabias king fahd moroccan king hassan ii and algerian 
president chadli bendjedid 
it said the ceasefire is necessary to stop the bloodshed and 
establish an atmosphere conducive to assuring the return of 
security stability and national reconciliation 
the call followed a night of savage shelling duels in beirut that 
killed 12 people and wounded 72 others saud could offer no 
guarantee for the success of this latest in a string of ceasefire 
efforts by the 22member arab league 
the committee possesses no weapons with which it would impose 
its will in lebanon saud said 
but he said syria whose troops are battling the christians in 
lebanon supports the new peace plan 
the declaration called on all parties to stop supplying weapons 
to the combatants and said the committee already has received 
positive responses in this regard 
iraq has been arming the christians syria backs lebanons 
moslems who want a bigger share of power in the country 
traditionally dominated by the minority christians 
a lebanese security committee to be headed by algerian 
diplomat lakhdar will implement and oversee the ceasefire 
monitoring all ships reported to be carrying weapons or ammunition 
saud said 
as soon as the security body begins its work naval blockades 
would be lifted and beirut international airport reopened the 
declaration said 
ibrahimi is expected in beirut on sunday and also is to negotiate 
the location of a sept 30 meeting of the lebanese parliament to 
discuss and prepare the national reconciliation charter 
the arab league has blamed the failure of previous peace efforts 
mainly on syrias refusal to withdraw its 40000 troops from 
lebanon damascus wants to link such a pullout to the withdrawal of 
israeli troops in southern lebanon 
in the final analysis all foreign nonlebanese forces will have 
to leave lebanon said saud

after months of delicately dancing around 
questions about race virginias candidates for governor suddenly 
were confronted by the issue with the labor day rioting by blacks in 
virginia beach 
democrat l douglas wilder and republican j marshall coleman 
though have stuck to their caution steps 
wilder seeking to become the first elected black governor of a 
us state distanced himself last week from any appearance of being 
sympathetic to the unrest and claims by black leaders of police 
misconduct in quelling the violence 
coleman who has said he will not let wilder use race as a shield 
to avoid tough questions has been careful on his part to avoid any 
comment that could be construed as racially inflammatory 
the rioting sept 3 and 4 coincided with a fraternity festival 
that annually draws thousands of students from predominantly black 
colleges along the east coast to the resort city 
rioters looted more than 100 businesses and police arrested 
about 220 people afterward many of the students visiting the beach 
complained that they were harassed by police and sometimes beaten as 
authorities imposed a curfew after the looting and tried to clear 
the oceanfront strip 
the state naacp chapter has asked gov gerald l baliles to 
appoint a commission to conduct a state investigation the us 
justice department and the fbi are already reviewing the matter 
violence of this type of any type will not be condoned or 
tolerated while doug wilder is governor wilder said monday in a 
visit to norfolk just a few miles from virginia beach i will 
take whatever measures are necessary to enforce this promise 
wilder the states lieutenant governor has been fighting 
republican efforts to make him appear soft on crime he made no 
mention of the allegations against police 
instead he supported baliles a fellow democrat who by law 
cannot run for a second consecutive term in calling out state 
police and national guard troops as backups for virginia beach 
officers during the rioting 
wilder is trying to be fair said laura dillard his press 
secretary he steered clear of the complaints against police 
because it is still under investigation she said 
coleman a onetime moderate from the shenandoah valley whose 
1989 campaign has taken on a more conservative slant also called 
baliles response necessary and appropriate under the 
circumstances 
such lawlessness can never be justified or condoned coleman 
said adding that he saw nothing racial about the episode 
given the volatility of the situation and the intense 
emotionalism that surrounds it it is absolutely essential that 
public officials and private citizens refrain from politicizing this 
regrettable incident he said 
polls show the two sides about even 
in 1977 when coleman won the race for attorney general he 
received substantial support from black voters 
but wilder is expected to draw 90 percent or more of the states 
minority vote this year partly because he is black and partly 
because coleman does not have the advantage as he did 12 years ago 
of having a former segregationist as an opponent 
wilders lawandorder comments apparently have not hurt his 
standing among blacks who comprise 17 percent of the states 
population 
what hes saying is consistent with what the naacp has been 
saying said jack w gravely president of the virginia chapter of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
we have condemned the looting we have condemned the violation 
of the law gravely said we dont feel hes turning his back on 
us 
patrick buchanan a conservative newspaper columnist and onetime 
aide to former president reagan sees the virginia beach rioting as 
damaging to wilder 
i think this racial violence in virginia beach and the fact 
that its been nationalized by the tv media are really going to 
finish him off in virginia buchanan said on a syndicated 
television program last week 
however tom morris a university of richmond political analyst 
said neither side can do anything to turn the event to his 
advantage particularly coleman 
but it was unfortunate for wilder because its a reminder that 
there are racial tensions in our society lurking below the surface 
and they can break through at any time he said

activists pledged to expand their 
antiapartheid campaign saturday as they buried victims of election 
night violence in black and mixedrace townships outside cape town 
police were present at the four funerals saturday but kept a low 
profile as part of a new government policy not to disrupt peaceful 
demonstrations and gatherings 
death will not deter those struggling for a free south 
africa the rev lionel louw told about 4000 mourners at st 
augustines anglican church in the mixedrace township of grassy 
park 
do you see the blood of our martyrs can you hear them speak 
these are atrocities committed against our people we cant allow 
police brutality and call it law and order any longer louw said 
at the service for pedro page 
page 18 was one of at least 23 people of black and mixedrace 
that activists say were killed the night of sept 6 in violence 
instigated by police 
police gradually have raised their figures in recent days and now 
say there were 10 deaths in blackonblack faction fighting and nine 
killings in which police may have been responsible 
the mourners traveled two miles from the church to the cemetery 
guided by young activists serving as volunteer traffic marshals 
the only visible police were traffic officers and some gave 
their bright orange vests to the marshals and watched from afar 
asked how he felt about the marshals taking over his job one 
mixedrace policeman said i think its wonderful 
in the past police have placed tight restrictions on the 
funerals of activists and prohibited political speeches at the 
ceremonies 
two funerals were held in the black township of khayelitsha and 
prominent activist rev allan boesak led a funeral service for 
13yearold patrick muller in the mixedrace township of bellville 
boesak said activists would resume marches on whitesonly 
beaches beginning sept 30 and would extend major protest actions to 
the southern cities of the eastern cape province he called on the 
government not to act against a huge antiapartheid convention set 
for oct 7 in johannesburg 
the mass democratic movement a looselybased antiapartheid 
coalition launched a nationwide campaign of defiance on aug 2 the 
organized demonstrations aimed at segregated schools hospitals 
beaches buses and other facilities have been peaceful 
however spontaneous clashes have erupted repeatedly between 
young activists and police particularly in the townships 
surrounding cape town 
presidentelect fw de klerk in a major policy shift announced 
tuesday that the whiteled government would not block peacful 
protests which previously had almost always been banned 
more than 20000 people joined a cape town march wednesday 
against police brutality the largest such demonstration ever 
authorized by the government 
about 15000 chanting protesters marched through the heart of 
johannesburg and 2000 took over the central square of the capital 
pretoria on friday 
all the demonstrations have been peaceful and the only reported 
police action has been against white hecklers 
de klerk who will be sworn in for a fiveyear term wednesday 
has portrayed himself as a reformer who wants to bring the 28 
million black majority into the national government on a limited 
basis within five years 
he has said he wants to begin negotiations with black leaders on 
a new constitution but boesak said conditions for such talks would 
include lifting the 3yearold state of emergency releasing 
political prisoners such as nelson mandela and legalizing 
organizations such as mandelas african national congress guerrilla 
movement 
de klerk announced saturday that gerrit viljoen a former 
minister of black education will spearhead the negotiations for the 
government the cambridgeeducated viljoen 63 has a reputation as 
a bookish softspoken political moderate close to de klerk 
in another development law and order minister adriaan vlok will 
meet early this week with 40 mixedrace policemen including lt 
gregory rockman 
rockman has become a folk hero among township youths since he 
began accusing police riot units of causing violence by beating 
protesters bystanders and shoppers during antielection 
demonstrations 
police are going to tag me as a terrorist and a communist 
rockman 30 said friday at a memorial service for one of the 
victims of the election violence 13yearold leonard ras 
but he added other policemen have the same ideas and views as 
me and this is a sign of hope for us in south africa i know i am 
not alone

florida already is in its worst dry spell since the 
1950s and its annual sixmonth dry spell is less than two weeks 
away meaning little relief can be expected before spring 
with most of the state already under voluntary or mandatory 
wateruse restrictions the outlook of water managers farmers and 
environmentalists has turned from caution to concern 
we may go into the dry season with one of the lowest reservoir 
storage levels in recent history said broward county water 
resources management director roy reynolds 
on thursday the south florida water management district board 
declared a water emergency and urged voluntary water cutbacks by 
almost 4 million people in dade broward and palm beach counties 
lake okeechobee a principal source of drinking water for 
residents of southern florida is about 3 feet below its normal 
level for this time of year 
to boost the lakes level the water board decided to pump farm 
water runoff into it that runoff normally would flow south through 
the everglades 
environmentalists attacked the socalled backpumping saying 
the phosphorusrich runoff promotes algae growth that robs marine 
life of oxygen 
the restrictions which may become mandatory next month include 
limiting car washing and lawn watering to three times a week between 
4 am and 8 am said tilford creel the deputy director of the 
district which covers 16 counties from south of orlando to the keys 
during the 12monthold drought responsible for extensive brush 
fires in the everglades last year that occasionally shrouded miami 
in smoke rainfall has been below normal in all sections of the 
state except the panhandle 
this is the alltime low in what we have for total surface 
water storage said creel 
in the 16county southwest florida water management district 
which includes st petersburg and tampa mandatory water 
restrictions have been in effect since february 
the tough measures have generated some spirited vigilantism 
in bonita springs for example the local newspaper has printed 
the names and addresses of residents ticketed for water violations 
penalties for violating the mandatory restrictions in the 
palatkabased st johns river district could go as high as 500 and 
60 days in jail although most people receive only a warning for a 
first violation said spokesman ed albanesi 
people just assumed the water was going to be there but 
attitude is slowly beginning to turn around he said

former president jimmy carter said 
saturday that nicaraguas relations with the united states will 
improve if the sandinistas hold free and fair elections next year 
carter came to this central american country as head of a 
delegation that is to observe the electoral process here and the 
balloting on feb 25 
the former president also observed panamas may 7 elections and 
called them fraudulent panamanian leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega had the elections canceled when according to carter and 
other international observers the opposition candidate won by a 
landslide 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government the 14party 
opposition coalition and the supreme electoral council sent an 
invitation for observers to the council of freely elected heads of 
government based at the carter center at emory university in 
atlanta ga 
the supreme electoral council is to organize and supervise the 
balloting 
former president raul alfonsin of argentina a member of the 
delegation sat next to carter and his wife rosalynn at a news 
conference at managuas international airport 
if president alfonsin and i and others can certify in february 
that the elections have been honest and fair and that the successful 
candidates are the legitimate leaders of nicaragua this would 
almost ensure in my opinion an immediate improvement in relations 
between the united states and nicaragua carter said in answer to 
a question 
he said he knew of existing differences between the 
opposition and president daniel ortegas government but he said it 
would be premature to address those issues until he had a chance to 
speak with all sides 
asked what lessons he had learned during the panamanian elections 
that could be applied to his current task carter replied from 
what i know to date those means used to have a fraudulent election 
in panama have been carefully avoided for nicaragua 
referring to an aborted bush administration plan to channel 3 
million in aid to opposition presidential candidate violeta barrios 
de chamorro carter said any campaign contributions should be open 
and overt in nature and comply completely with the laws in 
nicaragua 
the project which would have channeled the money through the 
national endowment for democracy was canceled because of opposition 
in congress 
mrs chamorro publisher of the opposition newspaper la prensa 
is being fielded by the national opposition union coalition 
carter also denied speculation that he may be representing the 
us government and said his delegation would remain impartial in 
its observations 
observers from the united nations and the organization of america 
states also have been invited to monitor the process 
the united states has not had an ambassador in nicaragua since 
richard melton was expelled in mid1988 along with several other 
embassy officials accused by the government of instigating unrest

an assailant opened fire saturday on an israeli 
army patrol from the jordanian side of the border slightly injuring 
two soldiers in the third such attack this month 
in the occupied territories clashes between palestinian youths 
and israeli soldiers reportedly injured four arabs and a 
palestinian man shot in a clash with troops last week died of his 
injuries 
leaders of israels two main parties met saturday to discuss a 
middle east peace plan offered by egypt two meetings last week 
failed to bridge differences over the plan which calls for 
israelipalestinian peace talks 
the border incident occurred in predawn darkness near the 
communal settlement of ashdot yakov three miles south of the sea of 
galilee 
israel radio said the assailant apparently was a jordanian army 
soldier who ran to the border and ambushed the israeli patrol 
firing about 30 rounds while hiding behind a bush the israelis 
returned fire 
a jordanian army spokesman told jordans official news agency 
petra that a jordanian soldier fired at an unusual movement 
along the jordan river and that israeli patrol cars fired in 
the same direction and that resulted in a slight injury to one of 
our people 
another jordanian official told the associated press the 
firefight appeared to be an accident 
it was night and when you are on the ceasefire line you 
know how alert you are to any unusual movement he said 
the israeli soldiers suffered slight shrapnel wounds 
it was the sixth attack this year on israel from along the 
jordanisrael border and the third this month the most recent 
attack occurred sept 7 when several sovietdesigned katyusha 
rockets were fired from jordan into israel there were no injuries 
in the occupied territories palestinians paralyzed the west bank 
city of nablus with a general strike to protest the deaths friday of 
two palestinian youths shot by israeli troops 
another palestinian 45yearold samir al akhbar died saturday 
of wounds suffered in a clash with troops last week officials at 
anglican hospital in nablus said 
arab reports said akhbar was shot in the back while trying to 
keep soldiers from beating his son 
israeli officials said he was shot when he tried to grab a 
soldiers gun 
his death raised to 571 the number of palestinians killed in 
clashes with israelis in the 21monthold uprising against israeli 
rule of the west bank and gaza strip forty israelis have died and 
114 arabs accused of collaborating with israel have been killed by 
other arabs 
arab reporters said four palestinians were wounded in clashes 
saturday the army said it was checking the reports 
egyptian president hosni mubarak proposed a 10point peace plan 
that includes palestinian elections in the west bank and gaza strip 
and israelipalestinian peace talks in cairo that would include two 
arabs deported from the occupied lands 
that aspect of the plan is designed to satisfy israels demand to 
talk only to palestinians from the territories and the plos 
insistence that palestinians living abroad be included in talks 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc and the 
leftleaning labor party led by finance minister shimon peres are 
deeply divided over the plan 
labor leaders have indicated their willingness to talk to a 
delegation including deported arabs but likud officials view it as 
an attempt to bring in the palestine liberation organization through 
the back door

senior leader deng xiaoping appeared in public 
saturday for the first time in more than three months looking tan 
and healthy despite recent reports he was seriously ill or even near 
death 
national television news showed the 85yearold leader laughing 
gesturing animatedly and walking steadily at the start of a 
70minute meeting at the great hall of the people with td lee a 
nobel prizewinning physicist from columbia university 
he displayed his bronzed hand to lee and said he had been 
swimming for up to an hour a day in the sea i dont like indoor 
swimming pools he was heard to say but enjoy swimming in 
nature 
deng reportedly spent part of the past three months among the 
most traumatic in communist chinas history at beidaihe a favorite 
resort for top officials along the northeast coast 
deng chinas most powerful leader has cut down on his public 
duties in recent years and has often disappeared for long periods 
each time sparking rumors he is seriously ill 
but this time both chinese and foreign sources consistently 
reported that he was being treated for prostate cancer and may not 
have long to live the lively hong kong press in recent weeks 
reported deng to be in a coma or already dead 
dengs last public appearance was on june 9 when he 
congratulated martial law officers for their leadership in quelling 
what he called a counterrevolutionary rebellion intent on 
overthrowing the communist party and the government 
troops stormed beijing june 3 and june 4 killing hundreds and 
perhaps thousands of people as they shot their way to 
studentoccupied tiananmen square 
deng also is believed to have had the ultimate say in the 
decision announced june 24 to purge communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang and accuse him of splitting the party by 
supporting the prodemocracy goals of the student protesters 
zhao the top advocate of economic reforms initiated by deng 10 
years ago has not been seen in public since may 19 he is believed 
to be under house arrest while the party decides whether to press 
criminal charges against him 
deng in an apparent reference to zhao said saturday that some 
of our comrades just immersed themselves in their specific work did 
not pay enough attention to ideological and political developments 
were not vigilant enough against the serious corruption 
the recent turmoil has taught us a major lesson deng said 
after the turmoil all of us have become soberminded 
deng whose support of economic reforms has generally been 
tempered by a hard line against political dissent said china will 
not change its policies of reform 
but he added that china must stick to socialism there would be 
no new china today without the leadership of the communist party 
he said 
deng also echoed the conservative line on reform by saying 
production must develop at an appropriate pace rather than the 
rapid pace preferred by zhao that is now being blamed for inflation 
and corruption 
dengs comments as carried by television news and the official 
xinhua news agency did not specifically mention zhao 
in 1987 deng retired from all his official posts except the 
powerful chairmanship of the central military commission however 
he is still regarded as the only man powerful enough to maintain a 
truce among the partys different factions and rumors of his death 
invariably raise fears of a destabilizing power struggle 
in recent days chinese officials have suggested deng was about 
to emerge in public possibly to reassure the chinese people before 
oct 1 the 40th anniversary of the peoples republic that the 
government leadership is intact 
lee a chineseamerican who won the nobel prize for physics in 
1957 and is a frequent visitor to china was not available for 
comment on his meeting with deng or a luncheon afterwards 
lee also met later with zhaos successor as party chief jiang 
zemin who spoke of current efforts to help students enhance their 
political awareness and make a clear distinction between right and 
wrong those efforts include heavy doses of political education 
xinhua said jiang also told lee that chinese leaders have shown 
much concern for civilians injured or killed during the military 
takeover of the city 
china says about 300 people were killed during the clashes but 
chinese leaders have made no public statements of remorse for the 
bloodshed and the official media have not reported on civilians who 
lost their lives

a railroad track abandoned 21 years ago 
will carry paying passengers again beginning monday with restoration 
of service to grand canyon national park 
the 64mile grand canyon railway originally a spur serving 
people crossing the high country of northern arizona on the santa fe 
railroad will carry tourists arriving in this town of 2500 on 
interstate 40 which largely replaced old us 66 
the developers hope the romance of their steam locomotives and 
the scenery along the tracks will persuade tourists to park their 
cars and pay the fare rather than drive to the canyon fars for the 
round trip will be 37 for adults and 21 for children under 12 
a ceremonial trip for public officials and other railroad guests 
was scheduled sunday the 88th anniversary of the first passenger 
service on the original line 
the rail line passes through dramatic scenery including 
ponderosa pine forests near williams the sparse plains of the high 
plateau and steep canyons near the northern terminus in grand 
canyon village only 200 yards from the grand canyons south rim 
grand canyon national park spokesman chuck lundy said train 
travel could help the environment of the south rim visited by 
810000 private vehicles and 3 million people last year 
a northern arizona university study found that enough people 
would opt for a train ride to the canyon to reduce road traffic by 
41 percent lundy said

fugitive chinese student leaders and china 
scholars gathered saturday to assess the impact of the bloody 
crackdown on student demonstrators in beijing and prospects for 
democracy in china and to remember 
the conference at brandeis university on the june massacre in 
beijing began with a moment of silence led by shen tong who was on 
the chinese authorities mostwanted list when he escaped from 
china he is attending brandeis on a scholarship 
my feelings were almost frozen shen said recalling the 
night of june 3 when government troops came to clear out student 
protesters who had taken over tiananmen square in the chinese 
capital he said he was trying to negotiate with the soldiers when 
they opened fire 
when i was speaking to one of the soldiers on a truck that had 
stopped the officer of the truck shot a girl standing next to me 
she was shot in the face he said 
hundreds perhaps thousands of people are believed to have been 
killed 
how the massacre happened and what can be done to keep the 
democracy movement in china going were the focus of the twoday 
conference titled perspectives on tiananmen 
participants included rep stephen solarz dny who warned of 
stiffened us sanctions against china if the repression there 
continues li lu second in command among the student demonstrators 
in beijing and wuer kaixi who made a dangerous 10day journey to 
escape his country 
saturdays conference opening had the feel of a reunion as many 
chinese students who had not seen one another since the 
demonstration embraced and exchanged news 
yuan liu president of the newtonbased china information center 
which has dispensed news to and from china all summer was busy 
passing on the latest information from his contacts in china among 
other things he said the number of students at beijings major 
universities allowed to take courses in humanities has been halved 
and that many students will be required to spend a year in the army 
for what he called brainwashing 
shen 21 told of his escape saying that after being hidden for 
days by friends he went to the beijing airport and presented his 
passport which had been issued earlier because he was already 
planning to study at brandeis in an apparent mistake by 
authorities he was ushered on board his flight 
i think that change in china is inexorable shen said but 
what i really care about is after there is a leadership change 
what can we do he said students in china and out must continue to 
work toward gradual change 
li lu who marshaled demonstrators as the deputy student leader 
at the tiananmen rally said the future of the prodemocracy 
movement depends on breaking through the propaganda the chinese 
government disseminated after the massacre 
information is power said li in the future the democracy 
movement in china must be a cooperative effort between students 
inside and outside of china 
solarz chairman of the house subcommittee on east asian and 
pacific affairs said the prodemocracy movement must continue to 
emphasize nonviolence i do not think that armed violence is a 
solution to the problems of china he said 
but he did say the united states would be willing to impose 
tougher sanctions on the chinese government if repression deepened 
solarz criticized president bushs reaction to events in china as 
a tepid response 
the president seemed to have trouble finding his own voice 
solarz said there were times indeed when he seemed more in 
sympathy with the difficulties of the party leaders than he was with 
the aspirations of the people

calm has returned to the dusty streets of 
this port for the first time since the wreck of the exxon valdez 
but the tranquility belies the social friction caused by the big 
spill big oil and big bucks 
valdez was flush this summer with millions of dollars spent in 
cleaning up the nations largest oil spill thousands of jobseekers 
came here for a chance to earn more than 16 an hour sopping up oil 
the motels were full business was good 
last week exxon halted its summer cleanup pulling its laborers 
off the shores of prince william sound and sending them home saying 
the shortening daylight hours and worsening weather made further 
work illadvised this time of year now valdez faces a long winter 
of problems they left behind 
the 16bed jail is full and the court docket is backed up because 
of a record number of summer arrests theres a housing shortage a 
cleanupcaused labor shortage persists but some employers are 
reluctant to rehire workers who abandoned their jobs last spring for 
exxons high wages 
it was shortterm bucks and in the end its going to do a lot 
of damage to this town said roger smith manager of a local 
hardware store 
the small town at the foot of the chugach mountains was the end 
of the rainbow for the laborers who came in the spring but most 
will spend their pot of gold elsewhere even many of the cleanup 
workers who were valdez residents are returning only briefly before 
taking off on extended vacations to warmer locales 
that has sparked tensions among the towns 3700 residents 
theyre not sticking around smith said wed like to 
expand but we cant seem to get anyone to work most of these guys 
made so much money theyre leaving town 
still smith and other merchants said they profited from the boom 
that came from the effort to clean up 11 million gallons of north 
slope crude oil that spilled when the tanker exxon valdez hit a reef 
in prince william sound on march 24 
business has been real good smith said it was crazy we 
normally would deal with 200 to 300 people a day we were dealing 
with over a thousand we sold stuff we never dreamed of selling 
business remains brisk at the pipeline club a popular watering 
hole since the days of the construction boom for the transalaska 
oil pipeline which terminates at port valdez 
bill lee manager and coowner said he extended the bars hours 
because of the demand it opens at 8 am and closes at 5 am 
its even better than the pipeline days lee said as long 
as the spill had to happen it certainly helped the economic picture 
of this town 
the towns economy is expected to remain strong with more than 
200 new longterm jobs created by the cleanup city officials are 
most concerned about the prospect of a winter of social problems 
generated by so many people with bulging wallets and time on their 
hands 
were going to have a fair amount of our residents who are 
going to have a lot of money in their pockets to spend city 
planner gary hennigh said in the middle of winter boredom sets 
in cabin fever and thats the time when tempers get shorter there 
probably has to be some sociological downside to this 
police chief bert cottle already has seen the downside 
the calls that were getting now are of a more serious nature 
as far as violence is concerned he said its been a long 
summer more people are stressed out 
alcohol figures in more than 70 percent of the complaints valdez 
police are responding to cottle said some cleanup workers are 
drowning their sorrows after spending gambling or otherwise losing 
their summer riches 
were seeing people who have been sending their paychecks home 
all summer expecting to come back to 20000 in the bank instead 
theyve got a dear john letter waiting cottle said 
the demand for housing caused by the influx of new residents 
shows no sign of letting up lynn wolf publisher of the valdez 
vanguard said people still line up at the front desk on tuesdays 
for an advance peek at the few housing ads that will appear when the 
weekly newspaper is published on wednesdays

hundreds of people packed a church in a 
black suburb saturday to pay tribute to anton lubowski a leader in 
the namibian nationalist movement who was assassinated outside his 
home 
in a racially divided country such as ours comrade antons 
role as a bridge builder will be sorely missed said theoben 
gurirab foreign affairs chief of the southwest africa peoples 
organization 
lubowski 37 was shot in the head with an ak47 assault rifle 
outside his windhoek home tuesday night police are holding 
50yearold irishman donald acheson in connection with the killing 
but no one has been charged 
lubowski was the only ranking white member of the namibian 
nationalist guerrilla movement against south african rule 
the lutheran church in the katutura neighborhood was overflowing 
and about 200 people listened from outside the church doors to the 
service for the man to be buried this week 
lubowskis parents his exwife and two children were there 
along with several diplomats such as robin renwick britains 
ambassador to south africa nothing can justify so callous a 
murder of a man who devoted the best part of his time to 
fighting for a truly nonracial namibia gurirab said did it 
really have to happen now at a time when his country and people 
needed him most 
namibia which has been ruled by south africa since 1915 is 
having elections in november expected to lead to independence early 
next year 
south africa agreed to implement independence under un 
supervision after signing a regional peace treaty last year that 
also calls for the withdrawal of cubas 50000 soldiers from angola 
the southwest africa peoples organization which waged a 
23year bush war for black majority rule is favored to win the most 
votes 
lubowski a prominent human rights lawyer in 1984 became the 
first white to publicly declare his support for the guerrillabacked 
organization he joined its legal political wing and served as the 
groups unofficial spokesman in windhoek while most of the 
leadership was in exile 
rightwing newspapers often ridiculed lubowski for belonging to 
the leftistoriented organization 
lubowski studied at two of south africas best universities 
stellenbosch and cape town and at one point was an officer in the 
south african army 
his law practice was based in windhoek but he represented many 
antiapartheid activists on trial in neighboring south africa 
lubowski helped represent 14 blacks sentenced to death for the 
mob killing of a black policeman in 1985 four days before 
lubowskis death the 14 won an appeal to have their case retried

sharp cuts in the use of fossil fuels like oil 
gas and coal are necessary to help prevent climate change that could 
cause dangerous overheating of the earth a leading scientist warned 
saturday 
george m woodwell director of the woods hole research center 
told a conference at the smithsonian institution that restrictions 
on the use of fossil fuels an end to deforestation and a start on 
reforestation are essential 
we are failing foolishly and dangerously to deal with 
environmental threats woodwell said at the conference on the 
global environment are we overreacting 
woodwell focused largely on the socalled greenhouse effect the 
threat of global warming which many scientists fear will result from 
the continued introduction of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 
a colorless odorless gas carbon dioxide allows warmth from the 
sun to continue heating the earth but keeps portions of the earths 
warmth from radiating out into space 
the result many researchers fear will be an overheating of the 
planet changing climate and possibly seriously damaging crops and 
other forms of life 
asked for a solution woodwell said well you do some pretty 
straightforward things you reduce the release of fossil fuel carbon 
into the atmosphere by restricting the use of fossil fuel how much 
maybe all of it you stop deforestation and you start 
reforestation 
paul r ehrlich of stanford university suggested that americans 
should be paying at least 230agallon for gasoline since 
automobiles and trucks are a major carbon dioxide source 
if it didnt cut consumption it would at least reduce the 
deficit said ehrlich referring to the additional money that 
would be raised by taxing gasoline to raise the price to that level 
while scientists have measured a 25 percent increase in 
atmospheric carbon dioxide over the last century debate continues 
about the greenhouse warming and whether it can yet be measured 
several scientists have urged a waitandsee attitude contending 
that natural fources such as increased cloudiness could restore 
balance to the planet 
most of the projections about the future are not verifiable 
without performing an experiment and it gets performed on guess 
what laboratory said stephen schneider of the national center for 
atmospheric research in boulder colo 
gene e likens of the new york botanical gardens pointed out that 
dangerous air pollution has become so common that scientists have 
begun speaking of pollution climates in some areas particularly 
parts of the united states europe and asia 
chemicals released into the air come back to us in the form of 
rainout or fallout the point is what goes up does come down and 
sometimes it travels great distances before it does so added

ethnically troubled republic of azerbaijan killed three people and 
injured other passengers the official tass news agency said 
in the republics capital baku the azerbaijani parliament ended 
an emergency session with a call for direct control of an enclave 
disputed with neighboring armenia the tass news agency said 
in its report on the explosion tass said the bus was traveling 
from the georgian capital of tbilisi to baku on the caspian sea 300 
miles to the southeast 
the news agency did not link the explosion to the ethnic strife 
between armenians and azerbaijanis it said the kgb secret police 
were investigating 
tass did not say how many people were injured nor did it say how 
many passengers were aboard the bus or give other details 
about 100 people have been killed in ethnic violence during the 
past 18 months in the conflict over control of the enclave of 
nagornokarabakh which is predominantly christian armenian 
the armenians want the mountainous area which is within 
azerbaijans borders to be transferred to their control 
nagornokarabakh was in mainly moslem azerbaijans jurisdiction 
until february when moscow moved in to rule the enclave directly in 
an effort to stem the violence 
the conflict has forced hundreds of thousands of armenians and 
azerbaijanis in the region to flee their homes 
tass reported the azerbaijani parliaments resolution on saturday 
claimed that nagornokarabakh is legally part of azerbaijan and 
asked moscow to reconsider its central rule over the area

republics legislature was convened to discuss the azerbaijani 
resolution the news agency also said

ways to calm ethnic quarrels like the one between azerbaijan and 
armenia 
the azerbaijani lawmakers will soon submit for public discussion 
a proposed law to provide sovereignty of the republic or 
independent exercise of legislative executive and judicial power 
over the whole of the territory of the republic in the interests of

outwardly mildmannered war of words half of them prefaced by 
mc 
the burger giant professes itself pleased with the pizza huts 
advertising countercampaign even though it goes so far as to

topping said mcdonalds spokesman chuck rubner who said he was 
mcdelighted with the attention 
pizza hut launched the campaign in newspapers and on television 
after mcdonalds added pizza to the menu at 24 outlets in southern 
indiana and western kentucky this summer the burger colossus hopes 
to lure families and couples during the dinner hour a slack time 
for much of the fastfood business

the rev jesse jackson said saturday that his 
rainbow coalition will go the districts of six democratic 
congressmen who voted to cut the capital gains tax to alert their 
constituents to the benefits the rich will gain 
there is no justification for further subsidizing the rich 
through the capital gains tax by abandoning the poor said 
jackson the capital gains tax is unfair it is immoral it must 
be challenged 
on thursday the house ways and means committee approved the tax 
cut in an amendment to a larger tax bill the reduction sought by 
president bush would lower the maximum tax rate on profits from 
sales of assets from the current 33 percent to 196 percent for 2 
years 
the rate then would be raised to 28 percent but assets would be 
indexed to eliminate taxes based on increased value created by 
inflation 
the six including rep ed jenkins dga who cosponsored the 
amendment joined with 13 republicans to pass the proposal 
but in so doing the six democrats incurred the wrath of 
democratic leadership 
jacksons action was supported at a news conference which was 
attended by democratic national committee chairman ron brown and 
rep charles rangel dny a ways and means member 
brown called the tax unethical immoral and it doesnt make 
political sense for the democratic party to give a tax break to 
the wealthiest in our country at a time when the poor continue to 
suffer 
i think this is clear this is the worst example of robin hood 
in reverse brown said 
former president reagan attempted his version of trickle down 
economics jackson said in the belief the rich would help america 
by reinvesting tax savings 
they did not do that and the rich today probably wont 
either jackson said this is a payoff for the very elite of the 
bush campaign its not good for america 
thus jackson said the campaign was targeted at the six 
democrats who jumped ship and abandoned the party 
im concerned that these congressmen who broke rank have not 
informed their constituents of their actions and the poor and the 
farmers are not aware of this jackson said 
besides jenkins the democrats include reps jj pickle of 
texas mike andrews of texas beryl anthony of arkansas andy jacobs 
of indiana and ronnie flippo of alabama 
rangel said his party was in a fight for its principles and that 
the democraticcontrolled congress had helped pass republican 
legislation the congressman said was bad for americans and bad for 
the partys principles 
certainly no six monkeys on the ways and means committee are 
going to direct where my party is going rangel said

a former sears roebuck and co store clerk has 
settled his dispute with the retail giant over profits from a 
popular socket wrench he invented more than 25 years ago 
peter roberts of tennessee was 18 years old in 1964 when he 
invented a quick release wrench that eventually sold by the 
millions 
on friday the 44yearold roberts settled an 82 million patent 
infringement case that alleged sears had cheated him out of his 
rightful royalties from the device 
sears spokeswoman kathy gucfa declined to give any details of the 
agreement saying part of the settlement is that neither side will 
comment on it 
roberts was believed on his way home to the chattanooga suburb of 
red bank and couldnt be reached for comment his attorney john 
davidson declined to comment 
roberts was a clerk at a sears store in gardner mass when he 
invented the wrench in his spare time the wrench has a push button 
that permits removal of sockets from the tool with one hand 
roberts obtained a patent for the wrench design in 1965 and 
sears paid him 10000 for rights to the patent 
he then joined the air force while stationed in england he saw 
a sears catalog and was astounded at the display the wrench got 
because he said the company had led him to believe the tool had 
only minor sales potential 
but from 1965 to 1975 sears sold more than 19 million of the 
wrenches for a net profit of more than 44 million according to 
documents in the case 
i was real young and when youre young you may tend to trust 
people too much roberts once said of his decision to take sears 
offer 
roberts sued in 1969 seeking to rescind the agreement under which 
he assigned the patent to the company a federal jury in 1978 
awarded him 1 million after finding that sears fraudulently 
obtained the patent 
roberts also asked for damages for the estimated 14 million 
socket wrenches sold after 1977 he had estimated sears earned 172 
million from sales of the wrench between 1977 and 1982 but 
attorneys for the retailer said the profit was closer to 5 million 
in april 1982 a federal jury found that sears violated the 
patent and awarded roberts 5 million an award later increased to 
82 million by the judge on the grounds the infringement was 
willful 
that decision was overturned in 1983 by an appeals court which 
ordered a new trial 
roberts said after the appellate court decision that he kept 
pursuing the case more for the principle than the money 
im right theyre wrong he said ive wrapped up a 
majority of my life around the thing im just trying to get what is 
justly and rightly mine 
the new trial was in its fifth day friday when the settlement was 
reached

the utah board of pardons relied on 
statements made out of context false information and jailhouse 
gossip in denying clemency to death row inmate william andrews 
his attorneys contend 
andrews who at nearly 15 years has been on death row longer than 
anyone in the nation has asked the board to vacate its decision and 
grant him an unprecedent second commutation hearing 
andrews 35 of jonesboro la was convicted for his part in the 
torturekillings of three people during a 1974 robbery five people 
were forced to drink a caustic liquid drain cleaner and all were 
shot but two men survived pierre dale selby who admitted firing 
the shots was executed in 1987 
the defense petition filed friday claims the board didnt divulge 
some information it used in making its decision including a prison 
psychological report that apparently branded andrews as a 
sociopath 
the petition also contends that in testimony during andrews 
commutation hearing a prison official alluded to information 
obtained from prison informants tying andrews to an escape plot 
information the prison branded jailhouse gossip 
the boards decision was also influenced by statements andrews 
made in a taped interview with a prison social worker without a 
lawyer present in violation of andrews constitutional rights the 
attorneys said

five animal rights activists were arrested 
saturday after as many as 60 protesters chased bow hunters through 
the woods of a state park at the beginning of deerhunting season 
a sixth activist also was cited for violating marylands hunter 
harassment law but was not taken into custody maryland natural 
resources police said 
the activists gathered before dawn near the mckee veshers 
wildlife management area about 50 miles southwest of baltimore and 
traveled to the stateowned land when hunters began arriving about 5 
am said organizer wayne pacelle of the fund for animals 
the demonstrators then broke into groups of five and each group 
followed a hunter from the time he stepped from his vehicle pacelle 
said 
we didnt raise our voices but we did let them know in measured 
tones we were there to protect the deer and to prevent them from 
cruelly killing these animals said pacelle the hunters dashed 
through the cornfields to escape but generally we stayed with them 
the activists originally had planned to spread human hair around 
the tree stands used by bow hunters when they lie in wait for their 
prey but the rainy weather prompted them instead to focus on 
establishing a presence around the hunter that would deter the deer 
from approaching pacelle said 
natural resources police sgt william schuller said police and 
other officials were prepared for the protesters estimated by 
pacelle at 60 and police at 40 
no violence was reported 
one hunter was pointing an arrow at a group of activists 
repeatedly and there were lots of threats of violence but 
nothing seems to have been done pacelle said 
pacelle said the group plans to challenge the states hunter 
harassment law on the grounds that it violates the first amendment 
right to freedom of expression a similiar connecticut law was 
declared unconstitutional in a federal court in february 1988 and 
that ruling was upheld by a federal appeals court in december 1988 
pacelle said 
first offenders of marylands hunter harassment law face fines up 
to 500

premier mouloud hamrouche on saturday 
appointed mainly westernoriented technocrats and people viewed as 
reformers to a new cabinet 
hamrouche named to the job a week ago by president chadli 
bendjedid picked sid ahmed ghozali former head of the state oil 
and gas monopoly sonatrach as foreign minister 
bendjedids announcement on sept 9 that premier kasdi merbah had 
been fired for opposing a reform program briefly led to a 
constitutional crisis as merbah tried to retain his post but he 
gave way later the same day 
the nomination of ghozali as foreign minister was the most 
significant of hamrouches new appontments ghozali 52 is a main 
partisan of bendjedids reform program which includes introducing a 
multiparty political system and increasing the role of private 
enterprise in the statedirected economy 
he headed sonatrach for 12 years building it into a massive 
state enterprise 
later ghozali became minister of hydraulics in what was widely 
regarded as a demotion he then was named algerian ambassador to 
brussels he returned to the government as finance minister in 1988 
ghozali is considered a westernoriented technocrat advocating 
economic and financial reform 
his appointment was a signal that bendjedid is determined to push 
ahead despite obstacles from the old guard of the ruling party the 
national liberation front has held power since algeria won 
independence from france in 1962 
other ministers considered enlightened technocrats were ghazi 
hidouchi economics minister hacene kahlouche minister of heavy 
industry smail goumeziane minister of commerce hamid sidi said 
minister of posts and telecommunications they have long worked 
closely with hamrouche formerly the governments secretarygeneral 
in the new cabinet the ministries of information culture 
tourism and veterans affairs were abolished in another move seen as 
signaling transformation of an autocratically ruled state into 
something closer to a westernstyle democracy 
the ministry of information headed by a succession of party 
stalwarts was widely criticized for maintaining rigid controls over 
the algerian press and radio introduced by the late president houari 
boumedienne 
after octobers riots in algiers and other cities bendjedid 
promised to free the press radio and television from state control 
he also announced his program of political pluralism 
hamrouches cabinet keeps just three ministers from the previous 
government in their same jobs

polands roman catholic primate jozef 
glemp has called for mutual understanding to resolve conflict over 
a convent next to the auschwitz concentration camp 
in an interview published in the catholic weekly tygodnik 
powszechny glemp said it might be possible to renegotiate 
agreements to relocate the convent farther from the former nazi 
death camp 
the carmelite convent is at the center of a controversy between 
some catholics and jews over an agreement reached in 1987 under 
which catholic negotiators agreed to move the convent to a nearby 
interfaith prayer center by feb 22 
glemp continues to back the convent which was established in 
1984 in a building the nazis used to store gas to kill jews and 
other deathcanp inmates he has said the agreement signed in 
geneva was not negotiated by competent people 
in the interview published friday glemp said jews should help 
catholics become better acquainted with jewish views on the issue 
let mutual understanding be the common intention he said 
on friday glemp met with the head of a fund that restores jewish 
monuments in poland to discuss a possible resolution to the 
international controversy the state news agency pap reported no 
details were provided but pap said a draft of a satisfying 
solution of the auschwitz conflict was shaped 
zygmunt nissenbaum with whom glemp met maintains a family 
philanthropic fund the proposals worked out by the two will be 
carried further by an appropriate group that will handle concrete 
realization of building the interfaith center pap said 
in the interview glemp spoke of his earlier remarks that were 
considered antisemitic by some jewish leaders 
some of the press reactions to the sermon made me realize 
that several of my opinions were interpreted contrary to my 
intentions he said i thought the whole of my enunciation on 
the need for friendly dialogue between catholics and jews is 
sufficently clear 
some jewish groups and others consider the convent to be an 
intrusion of christian symbols at the former concentration camp 
where 25 million of the estimated 4 million people killed were jews 
at one point during the interview the interviewer said it is 
better to move it the convent 13 of a mile away in tune with 
the geneva settlements it is no tragedy and the lord will hear 
their prayer from a new place as well glemp replied of 
course

the uss iowa was being used as a floating 
laboratory for highexplosive experiments and crewmen were using 
improper gun powder when the no 2 turret exploded and killed 47 
men a news service reported 
transcripts from the navy investigation into the april 19 
battleship explosion showed also that the commander capt fred b 
moosally had not authorized the firing with experimental loads when 
the explosion occurred media general news services reported sunday 
the investigation also showed that the navy command that 
requested the experiments was the same command that performed the 
tests that led the navy to conclude that the explosion was likely an 
act of sabotage by a sailor 
the pentagon released a report in early september that said 
circumstantial evidence indicated gunners mate clayton hartwig of 
cleveland intentionally sparked the explosion however the report 
said it would be impossible to prove because all those nearby died 
in the explosion including hartwig 
the navy when contacted by the associated press on saturday 
stood by its conclusion everything was very carefully 
considered said cmdr mark baker a navy spokesman at the 
pentagon 
according to the 7007page report which was available to the 
public the navy found that gunners were firing an experimental load 
from the iowas no 2 turret with powder not approved for the weight 
of the projectile 
the powder was clearly marked that it not be used with the 
heavyweight projectiles being fired the report said 
the experiments were at the request of researchers at the naval 
sea systems command at the naval surface warfare center at dahlgren 
va 
according to the transcripts the tests were designed to improve 
the accuracy and range of the ships antiquated 16inch guns 
commander eugene j kocmich who was the iowas weapons officer 
between 1986 and 1988 told navy investigators that the experiments 
alarmed a number of officers on the ship who didnt think a fully 
manned battleship was meant to be a research and development vessel 
they argued that tests should be conducted under safer conditions 
to fulfill the experiments iowa gunners tried reducing the 
powder load by using five bags instead of the normal six master 
chief sp skelly who was in charge of the experiments had 
discovered that using just five bags improved the accuracy of the 
guns 
i knew they didnt have any authorization said lt cmdr 
kenneth m costigan the iowas gunnery officer i think there 
were big signs down in the magazines you cannot use d846 with 
heavyweight projectiles it was pretty clear what the rules were 
but costigan said he never did anything about it 
moosally said that on the day of the explosion he did not know a 
fivebag charge was going to be used in turret 2 or that turret 3 
which never fired because of the explosion was loaded with an even 
more innovative fourbag charge 
moosally told investigators he approved the use of a reduced 
charge but said he thought that meant six 55pound bags of powder 
the combination of experimentation on the iowa and the high 
turnover inexperience and poor management on board initially 
attracted the attention of investigators looking into the explosion 
the investigators had been pursuing the theory that hartwig who 
took over as gun captain in a lastminute roster change perhaps was 
confused by seeing only five bags of powder pop out from the powder 
cars instead of six and that somehow in the confusion the powder 
got rammed into the barrel too quickly splitting a bag open when it 
crashed into the projectile its volatile powder set off by friction 
the friction theory was eliminated by a series of technical tests 
under the direction of the naval sea systems command 
the discovery of a 100000 life insurance policy taken out by 
hartwig naming a shipmate as beneficiary put the investigation on 
a new course

anything after the ceremony but consoled wibles family members and 
friends

wesbecker said in an interview friday with the lexington 
heraldleader i dont want to say much about the company about 
the people at the top maybe they didnt know what was really going 
on im not sure 
but i feel like over the years the company created my dad 
he continued james wesbecker 22 is one of wesbeckers two grown 
sons by his first marriage 
wesbecker was on longterm disability from the company because of 
his mental problems relatives have told police he was a manic

planned with wesbecker and refused to comment on what he called 
the speculaton rumors and innuendo about wesbeckers 
relationship with the company where he went to work in 1971

regulations on assault weapons of the type wesbecker used when he 
entered the printing plant wesbecker was armed with a chinesemade 
ak47 semiautomatic rifle two mac11 semiautomatic weapons a 
revolver and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol 
two louisville legislators said they will introduce a bill in the 
1990 general assembly to ban the sale of ak47 rifles and similar 
assault weapons kentucky lawmakers are in general so strongly 
against gun controls that there is a state law that bars cities and 
towns from passing gun control ordinances 
state rep mike ward acknowledged that passage of a guncontrol 
law would be difficult but i think we owe it to the families of 
the victims and the surviving victims to try to make it at least 
harder to obtain assault weapons ward said

common markets policies might hurt american companies 
but frans andriessen the chief trade official for the european 
commission the blocs executive body said the community intends to 
remain open once it forms a single market in late 1992 
there has been concern in the united states about proposals that 
appear to place protectionist barriers around the europeanwide 
market in 1992 when trade barriers restricting the free movement of 
money goods services and people will be removed 
but after talks in five other european cities mrs hills said 
i am of a more positive frame of mind today than i was last

as the navys new 12 billion destroyer 
arleigh burke was launched saturday officials took turns firing 
return salvos at a congressman who called the ships construction a 
procurement nightmare 
irresponsible attitudes like that hurt but dont take them 
too seriously rep joseph e brennan dmaine told a crowd 
estimated at more than 10000 people who attended the launching at 
bath iron works 
the burke is named for an 87yearold retired admiral and world 
war ii hero who arrived at the launching in a 1930 packard burkes 
wife roberta broke a bottle of champagne over the bow sending the 
8500ton destroyer sliding toward the kennebec river 
construction of the ship considered the most technologically 
advanced surface combat vessel has prompted complaints of cost 
overruns by rep john dingell dmich 
dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on oversight and investigations told the navy that the program is 
18 months behind schedule and that the ddg51 destroyer is only 38 
percent complete 
the acquisition of the ddg51 has turned into a procurement 
nightmare his letter said 
bath iron works rejected dingells assertions which were based 
on a draft report from the general accounting office which is 
conducting an inquiry into the program 
dingells numbers are wrong his facts are wrong and his 
socalled news in nearly two years old said brennan that 
number of errors in not good even for congressional work 
william e haggett chairman and chief executive officer of bath 
iron works said thursday that the ddg51 is 47 to 51 percent 
complete a higher level than we launched our previous prototype 
ship 
the ship is ready in every respect to be launched said 
haggett 
gov john r mckernan who declared saturday arleigh burke day in 
maine said i dont care what dingell says this is a great day 
for bath iron works and a great day for the state of maine and a 
great for the united states of america 
the guidedmissile destroyer is designed with a steel 
superstructure instead of one that is part aluminum and more prone 
to splintering and fire damage it will be equipped with 
sophisticated aegis computers and tomahawk cruise missiles 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii said the ship represents 
the very future of surface warfare the ship is scheduled to be 
delivered in february 1991

explorers recovering gold that may value 
more than 400 million from a sunken ship off the south carolina 
coast said saturday they also may have found two previously unknown 
species of marine life 
researchers using remotecontrol equipment gathered samples of 
the two organisms apparently invertebrate animals attached to 
remnants of the ss central america at a depth of 8000 feet said 
barry schatz a director of the columbusamerica discovery group 
the creatures will be studied on board and later taken ashore for 
further study said schatz who spoke with the associated press in a 
shiptoshore telephone conversation from the arctic discoverer 
research vessel 200 miles offshore 
the central america sank during a hurricane sept 12 1857 en 
route from panama to new york it was carrying a monthly shipment of 
gold from the san francisco mint to new york banks by way of the 
panamanian isthmus the sinking claimed 425 lives 153 people 
survived 
remnants of the wood and iron ship discovered three years ago 
lie on a section of ocean floor that schatz said is a biological 
oasis in the midst of an otherwise barren area 
charles herdendorf an oceanographer from ohio state university 
who heads an onboard research team said scientists have been trying 
to informally catalogue marine life seen around the wreck through 
television cameras 
but these two were just total mysteries to me he said in a 
shiptoshore conversation these looked really new 
conversations with specialists at the smithsonian institution in 
washington heightened belief that the creatures were previously 
unknown herdendorf said 
both appear to be invertebrate animals similar to sponge or 
coral they grow on stalks about eight to 10 inches long and may be 
part of the same family he said 
one consists of a narrow stalk that ends in plumes or polyps the 
other has a coinsized fleshy growth extending off a central stalk 
it may be the same organism in various life stages or it may be 
two different species he said 
the group planned to spend saturday on scientific research 
schatz and herdendorf said 
in addition to collecting the two organisms schatz said the 
group hopes also to catch other animals with traps baited with 
lobster from the groups dinner scrape animals from the wreck hull 
and take a core sample of the sea floor 
though the first of the gold was found in august 1988 the arctic 
discoverer and its 21member crew did not find the main gold deposit 
until aug 27 this year after about a month at sea 
schatz said the team may be at sea for another month and hopes 
to have the bulk of the gold up by then 
as an offshoot of the commercial enterprise of recovering the 
gold the group established an adjunct sciences program headed by 
herdendorf 
more than a dozen researchers are now involved in the project 
including scientists from the smithsonian 
the economic payoff is what pays for the science schatz said 
herdendorf said the group hopes to produce educational films and 
distribute their findings throughout the scientific community 
its really a dream i guess the dream of all biologist is to 
find new life forms and advance the horizons of science were 
probably just beginning herdendorf said

the communist party newspaper saturday said 
the soviet invasion of poland in 1939 led to repression and crimes 
against millions of poles 
the paper trybuna ludu said the truth about the invasion must 
be told before polishsoviet relations can be put on a new basis 
the date of sept 17 is deeply rooted in the consciousness of 
the polish nation especially because the entering of soviet troops 
was followed by growing repressions and even mass crimes which 
involved millions of poles the paper said 
on sunday poland marks the 50th anniversary of the soviet 
invasion which came more than two weeks after the nazi army entered 
poland at the outbreak of world war ii 
germany and the soviet union had agreed to divide poland into 
spheres of influence under secret protocols in the 
ribbentropmolotov nonaggression pact on aug 23 of that year 
soviet troops are thought to have killed tens of thousands of 
poles during the war another 15 million were deported to siberia 
during the soviet occupation 
the crossing by the red army into the eastern borders of poland 
belonged for decades in our country to the most taboo 
subjects the paper said if sept 1 was the beginning of a 
cataclysm for poland and later for the world then sept 17 that 
year symbolizes a secondary blow that fell on our nation and the 
consequences of which were also enormous and tragic 
although nazi aggression has been well publicized the soviet 
invasion was rarely mentioned in the official press for decades it 
was however well documented in the unofficial or underground press 
the truth about those events is deserved not only by the 
victims of the repressions their descendents the whole nation but 
it is one of the important tasks in freeing polishsoviet 
relations trybuna ludu said 
ceremonies were planned sunday at the tomb of the unknown soldier 
in warsaw and there will be other smaller commemorations nationwide 
two years ago a joint polishsoviet commission was set up to 
investigate blank spots in history such as the massacre of 
polish officers at katyn the soviet invasion of poland and the 
1920 polishsoviet war 
last aug 23 deputies in the lower house of parliament passed a 
resolution condemning the molotovribbentrop pact as shameful 
earlier the communist party had condemned the secret protocols as 
a flagrant violation of international law

congressman barney frank says he would consider not 
running again if a house ethics probe of his relations with a male 
prostitute damages the causes he considers important in congress 
do other people who share my values pay a price if i am here 
said the massachusetts democrat if thats so then i would not 
run for office 
frank conceded in an interview with the boston globe conducted 
in washington and published saturday that disclosures about his 
relationship with stephen l gobie have already diminished his 
influence on some of the liberal causes he has supported 
a newsweek poll released saturday showed 46 percent of americans 
said frank shouldnt be reelected because of the scandal 
fortyfive percent said they would vote against any homosexual 
candidate for office according to the poll of 600 adults 
interviewed sept 14 and 15 
the same poll found 60 percent of americans believe that being a 
homosexual shouldnt keep a person from being a member of congress 
and 50 percent said homosexuality shouldnt keep a person from being 
president the poll has a 4 percent margin of error 
franks disclosure of his homosexuality in 1987 didnt prevent 
him for gaining 70 percent of the votes in his 1988 reelection bid 
he represents a predominantly democratic district that encompasses 
parts of southeastern massachusetts and some boston suburbs 
the boston globe in an editorial in sundays editions urged 
frank to resign for his own good and for the good of his 
constituents his causes and congress 
the globe noted that it had enthusiastically endorsed frank 
throughout his public career but said revelations about frank and 
his relationship with gobie had led it to conclude barney frank 
must go 
the issue of franks conduct is not homosexuality but 
prostitution which is illegal and which has always been a 
destructive element in heterosexual and homosexual life the 
newspaper said had the issue been heterosexual prostitution 
feminist groups would not have been silent so far frank has 
enjoyed more than the benefit of the doubt he has enjoyed a double 
standard 
in the interview frank said that if he retired he would 
practice law and do some writing but would continue to be involved 
in such issues as housing aids and homosexual rights 
frank said he believes most people will agree with his contention 
that his activities with gobie involved only his personal life and 
did not spill over into his work as a member of congress 
my impact on people who dont know me has been diminished 
some frank said as public spokesman there will be a period 
that i will have to reestablish 
frank said he has decided to step back from the issue of the 
scandal in the department of housing and urban development on which 
he has worked recently 
on that one i think it is appropriate that i pull back until i 
get my own ethics matter resolved he said 
the house committee on standards of official conduct has begun a 
preliminary inquiry that is expected to take up to three months 
the study centers on franks hiring of gobie whom he once 
patronized for paid sex as his aide and chauffeur allowing gobie 
access to his apartment franks writing of several letters on 
official stationery to gobies virginia probation officer and 
gobies contention that frank fixed up to 100 parking tickets for 
him

a newspaper reported sunday that former president 
richard m nixon tried to organize a mission to rescue 52 american 
hostages in iran in 1980 shortly after president jimmy carters 
attempt failed 
however the sunday telegraphs report said it was not clear if 
nixon intended to launch an independent mission or an official one 
that would be carried out under the presidency of ronald reagan 
in any event the newspaper said the idea was dropped in october 
1980 when iran announced that the hostages at the us embassy in 
tehran would be released after the inauguration of a new president 
the weekly newspaper said nixon held secret talks with british 
helicopter pilots and exservicemen only three months after the 
first attempted rescue in april 1980 
he met the chairman of bristow helicopters alan bristow and 
several former members of the special air service according to the 
newspaper the sas is britains elite military assault force 
nixon was absolutely serious the newspaper quoted bristow as 
saying we had a long and detailed discussion about the chances of 
success of a second strike i told him it could be done but the 
strike force would suffer at least 30 percent casualties 
a rescue attempt authorized by carter ended in disaster april 25 
1980 when a helicopter collided with a tanker aircraft in an 
iranian desert killing eight servicemen 
the sunday telegraph quoted unidentified security sources as 
saying the second mission was conceived by the republican party 
because it feared its presidential candidate reagan might inherit 
the hostage crisis if he won the election 
the american hostages where freed in january 1981 after 444 days 
in captivity 
the british account reported a nixon aide said we will neither 
confirm nor deny this story we have nothing to say it did not 
identify the aide 
the newspaper said nixons plan was inspired by the sas assault 
on gunmen holding hostages at the iranian embassy in london on may 
5 1980 four of the five gunmen were killed in the operation which 
succeeded in freeing the hostages

the university of south carolina told 
opponents marching bands not to play the song louie louie at 
its football stadium out of concern the structure could be damaged 
by dancing fans 
south carolinas marching band last played the song at the 
nebraska game in 1986 fans in the east upper deck of the 
williamsbrice stadium caused the stadium to sway and those below 
the deck became alarmed 
engineering studies performed after the nebraska game showed the 
stadium to be safe 
structurally if youve got the whole student body out there 
jumping up and down constantly for 75 years you might have some 
metal fatigue said john trussell assistant director for the 
insurance reserve fund which insures the stadium but with only 
six or eight games a year it will fall down from old age long 
before that 
jerry t brewer dean of student life wrote to james k 
copenhaver director of university bands that the insurance reserve 
fund has specifically mandated that louie louie not be played 
i know this request may seem unusual to band directors but a 
swaying stadium is definitely not a usual occurrence 
trussell however said the fund which gets its marching orders 
from the state had not outlawed any songs 
theres no provision in a policy saying thou shalt not play 
louie louie he said

british agents planted propaganda in american 
newspapers harassed political enemies in congress and labor unions 
and waged economic warfare in this country in the years before pearl 
harbor according to a secret history quoted by the washington post 
in sunday editions 
agents headed by sir william stephenson celebrated in the 1976 
book a man called intrepid waged their campaign out of an 
office in rockefeller center in new york known as british security 
coordination the history said 
the post said 10 leatherbound copies of the 423page document 
prepared in 1945 were said to have been distributed but that none 
have surfaced until now the newspaper said it was allowed to take 
extensive notes on a copy of the history but did not name its source 
several american newspaper publishers as well as columnists 
walter lippmann walter winchell and drew pearson were described as 
helpful to the british effort to discredit isolationism and harass 
nazi sympathizers 
the history portrays america on the eve of world war ii as easy 
to manipulate these people though fully conscious of their 
wealth and power in the aggregate are still unsure of themselves 
individually still basically on the defensive the post quotes 
the history as saying 
it quotes the history as detailing a media campaign against 
gerhard alois westrick allegedly a german agent in the united 
states with close ties to torkild rieber the president of texaco 
a first class news story was written by bsc and placed 
through an intermediary in the new york herald tribune under 
headlines such as hitler agent ensconced in westchester the 
history said 
westrick was deluged with threatening telephone calls it 
said a hostile crowd gathered outside his house his american 
contacts deserted him according to the document 
the history said a british front group called fight for freedom 
passed out 25000 handbills at a september 1941 speech in boston by 
isolationist sen gerald p nye attacking him as an appeaser and 
a nazi lover it said british agents tried unsuccessfully to sow 
confusion at an america first rally at madison square garden a month 
later by distributing duplicate tickets 
the history said the british started a rumor mill objectives 
ranged all the way from publicizing misleading information about 
allied strategy to undermining the prestige of an individual nazi by 
encouraging salacious gossip about his private life

pan american world airways is trying to head off 
government fines for lax security measures found after last years 
bombing of a jet over scotland according to a report sunday 
pan am chairman thomas g plaskett went to washington last week 
to argue to federal officials that results of a special government 
investigation which found security flaws do not warrant penalties 
the new york times reported 
the security flaws are not believed to be tied to the bombing of 
flight 103 but did involve violations of rules about screening 
passengers and baggage the newspaper said the flight originated in 
frankfurt and made a stop in london it was headed for new york 
investigators say a bomb disguised in a radiocassette player was 
put aboard the plane in a suitcase at frankfurt the plane exploded 
over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 killing all 259 people aboard 
and 11 others on the ground 
abc news reported in january that baggage handlers and others at 
londons heathrow airport were not passing background checks and 
that one pan am security guard in frankfurt said he had received 
only minimal training before going to work for the company 
a routine investigation in october 1988 found pan am security at 
frankfurt generally acceptable the times reported but in the weeks 
after the explosion the special investigation by the federal 
aviation administration found several violations 
the newspaper quoted unidentified aviation officials as saying 
that any flaws found in that special inquiry were corrected months 
ago

farmstate senators said friday they hoped the 
senate would act quickly on a committee proposal that could mean 
larger disaster payments to winter wheat and cotton farmers who 
started a second crop after weather destroyed their first 
legislation approved by the senate agriculture committee thursday 
night would change the way disaster assistance payments are 
calculated 
lawmakers have complained that an agriculture department formula 
will penalize those producers and in some instances mean farmers 
could receive no disaster payments even though they earned little or 
no profit on their second crops 
the proposal is part of a broad budgetbalancing package the 
senate is expected to consider soon but some farmstate members 
hope the disaster relief measure can be acted on separately 
the problem stems from a nearly 900 million disaster relief 
package enacted last month in an effort to prevent farmers from 
reaping double benefits it required the department to reduce 
assistance payments to farmers by the value of any crop that 
replaced one ruined by bad weather 
the legislation did not spell out how to determine the 
replacement crop value the department decided to deduct 75 percent 
of the gross value of the replacement crop from the disaster payment 
a farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop 
the formula is supposed to account for production costs of the 
replacement crop in effect coming up with a net value figure 
however lawmakers contended the does not account for regional 
differences in production costs 
under the agriculture committee proposal farmers would have no 
payment reductions if their replacement crops failed to produce more 
than 40 percent of the average yield in their county those farmers 
harvesting more than that would undergo the 75 percent deduction 
only on the value of their replacement crops above the 40 percent 
yield threshold 
other provisions would require quick payment for acres not 
replanted for which farmers would have to apply before oct 1

ethiopia and the eritrean peoples liberation 
front have agreed to meet in africa to discuss an end to their 
28yearold war but former president jimmy carter said friday 
significant disagreements remain over the framework for the 
talks 
carter said the two sides made progress in negotiations in 
atlanta to set an agenda for peace talks agreeing on such items as 
the official languages publicity recording and procedural rules 
for the next talks 
still unresolved after a week of meetings at the carter center 
are who would serve as cochairmen for the peace talks who would be 
allowed as observers and what would be the duties of the meetings 
staff carter said 
the talks would be held at one or more of these african nations 
north yemen egypt sudan kenya tanzania and zimbabwe carter said 
no date for the peace talks has been set 
representatives of the ethiopian government and the rebel eplf 
have met daily except last sunday since sept 7 with carter as a 
neutral observer to draft an agenda for future substantiative peace 
talks 
carter is leaving saturday for a threeday factfinding mission 
in nicaragua and the ethiopiaeplf talks here will conclude upon 
his return tuesday 
observers of african affairs had said at the outset of the 
atlanta talks that carter had accomplished something by merely 
getting ethiopia and eritrea to sit down together 
carter himself said he feared the animosity between the two sides 
might doom the talks before any progress was made but he told 
reporters friday both sides have gotten along well 
i would tell you the determination on both sides successfully 
to resolve the differences that have caused the war has been very 
obvious 
the leaders of the respective delegations ashegre yigletu head 
of the government central committees foreign relations department 
and alamin mohamed saiyed an eplf politburo member appeared with 
carter at the news conference but neither took questions from 
reporters 
carter said he hoped a cease fire or an improvement in the 
delivery of relief services in the region might be undertaken before 
the peace talks but he said he has not tried to suggest what either 
side should do 
he did not rule out the possibility that he would be involved in 
the next round of talks but said at least one cochairman from 
africa must be selected before he would consider joining the talks 
ethiopia and the eplf have been at war since 1961 over the 
independence of eritrea a northern province in the horn of africa 
the two were joined in a federation that eritrea opposed 
an estimated 1 million people have been killed in the fighting 
and famine directly related to the war

a judge agreed friday to block the states 
bid to close tent city the makeshift outdoor county prison camp 
where 100 inmates have spent the last month officials said 
state corrections officials wanted saturday to be the last day 
for the secaucus camp opened as a courtordered measure to relieve 
severe overcrowding in the hudson county jail 
but the prisoners will stay at least another week under an order 
by judge burrell ives humphrey in superior court in hudson county 
there is no way tent city is closing tomorrow said cas 
rakowski a spokesman for the county jail it would be a near 
impossibility to take those 100 state prisoners 
humphrey said the state cannot close the tent city without his 
approval and without giving at least seven days notice rakowski 
said 
the state argued that it had satisfied the original court order 
that forced the quick assemblage of tents and barbed wire on a site 
in the hackensack meadowlands 
state lawyers said the temporary order covered a 30day period 
ending saturday while county representatives said it was in force 
long enough for them to complete the new jail which is scheduled to 
open oct 9 
county officials say they cannot find room for the 
minimumsecurity tent city inmates until they complete the 
prefabricated 336bed jail at kearny 
the inmates are convicted of crimes that would have them in state 
prisons if not for a backlog that has forced an overflow of 
statesentenced prisoners at the county jails 
while the tent jail has been popular with inmates and has largely 
been judged a success corrections department spokesman james 
stabile said it would be unwise to start relying on such stopgap 
measures in the future 
this is a temporary measure he said cold weather is 
coming its worked with minimum security inmates but its not 
something we wanted to do its something we had to do 
the inmates have praised the prison camp saying its spaciousness 
and fresh air are superior to the cramped quarters of the 
overcrowded 63yearold hudson county jail which has a population 
near 900 
prisoners love it out there rakowski said they have more 
freedom more recreation its like camp to them

diverted enormous sums to the parent company and benefited 
american continental and its executives at lincolns expense 
american continental was not named in the complaint because it 
filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
in april and received an automatic stay 
the 11 billion sought in damages surpasses a 500 million claim 
against sunbelt savings and loan federal racketeering laws allow 
the government to seek triple damages from defendants 
federal regulators seized lincoln on april 14 the day after 
american continental filed for protection from creditors 
american continental attorney a melvin mcdonald said we will 
vigorously defend the case and we fully believe that once all the 
information comes out we believe that all of the individuals named 
will be vindicated 
the lawsuit contends that beginning in 1983 keating and four 
other american continental officers schemed to divert funds from the 
thrift for their own use the five are accused of racketeering the 
lawsuit names a total of 20 individuals and 17 business enterprises 
the implementation of this scheme involved concealing from the 
regulatory authorities first the true intentions for acquiring 
lincoln savings and next the actual operation of the thrift 
the suit states 
the lawsuit states that prior to 1984 the defendants operated an 
american continental enterprise comprised of about 17 corporations 
primarily focused on speculative real estate transactions 
it alleges that around 1983 american continentals enterprises 
needed additional funds to expand its real estate transactions 
the lawsuit claims that american continental acquired lincoln 
savings by making material misprepresentations to the federal 
home loan bank board the former agency regulating the nations 
savings and loans 
it also alleges that once lincoln savings became a subsidiary 
money was diverted to the parent insider loans bad loans and bad 
investmests were made and transactions were manipulated to enhance 
the american continental and its insiders 
a recurring element in the transactions the lawsuit claims was 
that lincoln savings turned over cash for american continental 
allegedly to pay the thrifts income taxes even though no taxes 
were currently due 
keating and his advisors also face a dozen classaction suits 
filed by about 23000 bondholders american continental has 
responded by suing the fhlbb and federal deposit insurance corp to 
remove lincoln from federal conservatorship

with a simple test that takes only 10 minutes 
the test now undergoing trials at nine centers will enable

status and still retain anonymity said jarel r kelsey president 
of murex corp a norcross ga firm that developed the test 
once this method is widely available it will encourage more 
people to determine their status

badshow fans will find much to like when alien 
nation bows tonight with a twohour premiere that marks fox 
broadcastings expansion to monday night jousts with abc cbs and 
nbc 
only the first hour of alien nation was available for review 
but i will count my blessings even though im no good at fractions 
this hour isnt very apt in writing and direction and odds are the 
second is equally to the left of whoopee 
based on the movie of the same name the new nation series 
combines cops and family life and heres the hook highly 
intelligent humanlike refugees from another galaxy who now find 
themselves in los angeles 
the show stars gary graham a fine young actor as matt sikes a 
streetwise cop when will tv get a streetdumb cop whose black 
partner was killed by an outerspace alien during a holdup 
matt is bitter at slags as he and other racist or maybe 
its alienist humans call the refugees no matter that most of the 
refugees just want to join the american mainstream and be decent 
hardworking citizens 
problem is the newcomers tend to stand out they have strange 
heads that resemble coneheads blown backwards and given a rash 
but of course our angry plainclothes cop is assigned a new 
partner an alien named george francisco eric pierpoint and of 
course matt is not at all happy at this even though the new guy is 
decent hardworking and offers him bran muffins and prune juice 
when he comes to work 
but if you dont think matt will come to respect george and other 
decent aliens you probably dont believe in the tooth fairy 
the new partner is solidly middleclass and has a family a 
brilliant wife a lovable daughter and a rebellious teenage son who 
represents wayward alien youth and hates earthlings particularly 
cops 
the son is sort of a skinhead who hangs out with similar alien 
teens and only wants to speak in his native tongue his native 
tongue is not morks cheery nanonano it sounds more like a tv 
producer discussing a tv critic but at least you get english 
subtitles 
in time matt even has dinner with georges family at georges 
home save for the son the family is warm and gracious matt 
doesnt even have to eat raw beaver as they do their bodies cant 
tolerate cooked food you see 
this gradual comingtogether is part of the shows underlying 
theme of tolerance and acceptance of living things regardless of 
race creed or galaxy 
the stage for all this is set at an ugly early scene of alien 
hatred a small mob of humans one with a sign that says america 
for humans gathers at the little alien girls school demanding 
that the slags get out of their neighborhood 
matt the supposed slaghater fires his gun in the air then 
shames them all away good matt 
among other digressions the opening hour has a mysterious case 
for the new partners to solve it concerns a dead wino covered with 
rashes and slime whose corpse has been spirited away for some 
mysterious alien surgery 
there also a potential love subplot for matt that involves his 
beautiful alien neighbor terry treas a biochemist one can only 
wonder what kind of amour scenes this will lead to in later episodes 
for as we learn in a bedroom scene with george and his wife 
michele scarabelli the alien method of foreplay is humming 
tuesday night marks the premiere of a more humdrum cbs series set 
in hawaii island son it stars richard chamberlain the 
compassionate idealistic dr kildare before he became a miniseries 
idol 
well he is back as a compassionate idealistic doctor one named 
dr daniel kulani sort of a hawaiian kildare the chief difference 
other than the new setting in a honolulu hospital is that this doc 
has a lady friend who plays cello 
the debut show opens with a car crash caused by a drunk driver 
and witnessed by kulani and his sweetie leslie bevis the crash 
leaves a young girl braindead and the plot centers on the anguish 
of the doctor and the childs mother over a heart transplant that 
could save another child 
medical moral and legal issues are raised and resolved all 
predictably true chamberlain often emits lines that baddialogue 
collectors will treasure forever 
but that may not prove sufficient to keep this medicine show from 
soon being told to pack its satchel leave hawaii and move to the 
tiny tv island of cancelcancel

if a proposed capital gains tax cut would benefit 
mainly the very rich as critics claim then its benefits must be 
broadened if it is to receive popular support 
thats not the only major problem facing the proposal which last 
week won approval from the house ways and means committee the 
senate is considering a different approach somehow a compromise 
must be reached 
with these and other considerations in mind thomas ohara 
chairman of the national association of investors corp whose 
membership includes 6832 investment clubs decided to write 
president bush and rep dan rostenkowski dill 
his proposals 
permit the first 25000 of an individuals capital gains each 
year to be taxfree 
grant a lifetime exemption of 500000 in capital gains from 
stocks to an individual this would be in line with the precedent 
set for profits on home sales 
allow an individual to rollover capital gains from securities 
into new investments without tax on capital gains until retirement 
age is reached and then tax only half those gains 
index capital gains to inflation 
these ideas might help said ohara because compromise must be 
reached not just in congress but between the white house and 
rostenkowski bush feels a cut would encourage longterm investing 
rostenkowski ways and means committee chairman thinks that over 
time it would deprive uncle sam of funds 
the platform from which oharas proposals are made is an 
interesting one most naic clubs began with little money in august 
these clubs averaged 162 members and 65000 in assets to which 
they added 45277 per club in contributions 
as a group therefore they might have a smallinvestor view but 
they also have some biginvestor credentials some clubs have been 
very successful helping members to buy houses and pay tuitions as 
individuals apart from their club membership some members have 
portfolios that run into the millions of dollars 
the associations viewpoint is further broadened by inclusion of 
48000 individual members in a lowcost investment program in which 
investors buy their first share in a company through naic and 
thereafter buy directly from that company on a monthly or quarterly 
basis average investment 75 a shot 
from naic headquarters in royal oak mich ohara said we 
asked our members why they were not as active as individual 
investors as they had been in the past 
the common response he says was that members were discouraged 
by the change congress made in 1986 by taxing capital gains plus 
they felt there was a lack of consistency in taxing policy 
that struck at the naics foundation it was created to attract 
ordinary folks into becoming investors to get them to save and win 
rather than spend and lose yet its own members showed a growing 
reluctance to invest 
in short though interested in stocks members were becoming like 
the rest of the public thirty years ago the individual investor 
accounted for 80 percent of new york stock exchange trading now 
its less than 20 percent 
this situation he feels greatly reduces liquidity in the 
securities markets reduces capital needed for smaller businesses 
and deprives individuals of the advantages that come with economic 
participation 
moreover he says america faces growing international 
competition the cost of raising capital is much lower in many 
nations with which we compete one reason being that some have no 
capital gains tax at all 
it is clear to us that the less we have in the way of a capital 
gains tax the lower the cost of capital will be in this country and 
the more competitive our industry will be ohara wrote 
he added a personal observation 
i am 74 years old and have spent most of my life working with 
individual investors encouraging them to save more and invest more 
i write with the strongest personal conviction that there are 
only two things that can turn our nation of consumers into a nation 
of investors 
one he said is a meaningful reduction in capital gains 
taxation the other depression the latter he said would be an 
incredibly painful lesson the first he wrote will work beyond 
our greatest expectations

like two jumbo jets thundering down opposite 
runways the bosses of texas air corp and ual corp have taken 
strikingly different approaches to survival one fighting its 
workers the other offering to make them owners 
the contentious defiant strategy invoked by texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo was on display this past week as the company staged 
its longdelayed shareholders meeting in a houston hotel with union 
pickets chanting antilorenzo slogans outside 
meanwhile in chicago a labormanagement coalition pressed its 
bid to buy ual with the companys blessing proving there is no 
standard operating procedure for running an airline 
lorenzo has carried an antiunion stigma for the past several 
years starting with a confrontation at texas air subsidiary 
continental airlines which he took into bankruptcy court to nullify 
union contracts and lower costs 
now out of bankruptcy court continental flies with mostly 
nonunion help and often leads the way in lowering ticket prices 
because the airline is cheaper to operate than many of its 
competitors 
although lorenzo denies he opposes organized labor his image as 
a unionbasher grew over much of the past year largely because of a 
strike at texas airs other airline eastern which he also has 
hauled into bankruptcy court 
in the eastern case lorenzo has hired nonunionists and 
picketline crossers to replace the strikers he has plans to make 
the airline a lowcost smaller more efficient operation regardless 
of what happens in the strike 
lorenzo reiterated those plans at the texas air annual meeting 
where questions abounded about his own future as well as those of 
eastern and continental which have enormous debts 
he denied speculation he might sell whats left of eastern and 
walk away from a business in which he has played a major role for 
more than a decade on the contrary lorenzo predicted eastern would 
start making money next year 
a different drama was unfolding at ual one of the nations most 
profitable airlines unlike texas air ual has long been seen as an 
attractive takeover target because it has low debt lots of 
airplanes that can be used as collateral and a highly prized route 
network into fastgrowing asia that could defray the impact of a 
domestic economic slowdown on the airline business 
perhaps more important a change of ual management in 1988 has 
gained the confidence of pilots who struck four years ago in a 
bitter dispute over pay 
that confidence has translated into their joint 675 billion bid 
with management to buy ual an offer that makes important labor 
concessions including pay cuts and a nostrike clause 
as of late last week their bid seemed to have a good chance of 
succeeding although california investor marvin davis offered to 
match the bid without demanding concessions from the unions 
if the labor bid succeeds ual would become the largest 
employeeowned company in the country and could displace texas air 
as the lowcost trendsetter 
in other business and economic news this past week 
junkbond repayment problems by canadian property company 
campeau corp jolted the market and incited widespread anxiety about 
the financial health of other companies that have sold the highrisk 
debt securities some junk bonds tumbled in value and their yields 
rose to 30 percent 
the government dumped a load of economic statistics on the 
financial markets that suggested the economy is slowing and 
inflation remains subdued but the information did little to 
encourage the purchase of stocks and bonds the labor department 
said wholesale prices dropped in august for the third straight 
month and the commerce department said the july trade deficit hit a 
fiveyear low of 758 billion it also said retail sales rose in 
august but that was mainly due to a surge in auto buying thats not 
expected to last 
drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street investment bank 
that pioneered the use of junk bonds for takeovers and corporate 
growth formally pleaded guilty to six felonies and fines penalties 
and other costs exceeding 650 million the plea closed a chapter in 
an insider trading scandal that began with the arrest of speculator 
ivan boesky nearly three years ago

after the stock markets long summer rally many 
analysts and money managers fear it is heading for an autumn fall 
the fears started to rise even before the debt problems of 
campeau corp roiled the market for highyield junk bonds in the 
past few days 
they intensified when the news about campeau raised the question 
of whether stocks might catch a chill should takeover fever die down 
but a vocal group of optimists persists in predicting new highs 
for the market above the peaks reached at the beginning of this 
month junk bond worries they say may prove nothing more than a 
convenient excuse for stocks to undergo a correction that sets 
the stage for a renewed advance 
memories of past octobers have stirred up fears in almost every 
analyst we have heard in the past several weeks said stephen leeb 
in his investment advisory letter indicator digest 
while admittedly few are predicting a crash many if not most 
feel that a correction of 10 percent or more is likely by the end of 
october yet not one of these pundits is predicting a concomitant 
rise in interest rates or big uptick in economic activity 
this is akin to predicting that a rocket ship will blast off 
without any fuel in it it just doesnt work that way 
for a significant decline in stock prices to occur leeb argues 
you must have at a minimum a sharp rise in interest rates and 
that is simply not in the cards 
many people who make the decisions at investing institutions such 
as pension funds came back from the labor day holiday in a wary 
mood seeking ways to preserve the gains they racked up over the 
first eight months of the year 
the most obvious way to do this is to raise cash in wall 
street parlance by selling some stocks and putting the proceeds in 
shortterm money market investments 
but john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc argues that the 
supposed safety in such a strategy could be illusory in a business 
where money managers are measured against their counterparts 
performance and the market indexes 
the problem with trying to duck a correction today is that 
there appears to be very decent potential left on the table he 
maintains a decent bond outlook a stable dollar and an economy 
without excesses is hardly the environment that makes stocks 
particularly dangerous 
a correction may occur given the sharp summer advance but we 
view it as essentially unplayable the fundamentals are too solid 
and the potential too high to try to sit on a lead 
wariness prevailed over enthusiasm in the past week however as 
stocks recorded their second straight loss after nine consecutive 
weeks of gains 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3496 to 267458 
on top of a 4255point loss the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 236 to 19159 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market lost 374 
to 46757 and the american stock exchange market value index was 
down 446 at 37964 
big board volume averaged 16552 million shares a day against 
15531 million in the previous week 
emphatically not among the bulls on the stock market outlook is 
james grant editor of the advisory service grants interest rate 
observer who says 
stocks in general are strong yet junk bonds are markedly weak 
how to explain the divergence 
as always the correct and certain answer is unknowable 
however we happen to have a hypothesis in the form of a prejudice 
or guess the stock market is kidding itself and is riding for a 
fall

companies controlled by billionaire texas 
investor harold c simmons are cutting their stake in georgia gulf 
corp and putting on hold a plan to oust the chemical concerns 
board 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on friday 
the dallasbased simmons consortium headed by nl industries inc 
said it was cutting its georgia gulf holdings to 89 percent of 
common stock outstanding 
nl also said it wants to work with georgia gulf in its pursuit 
of alternative transactions 
previously nl industries said it would seek written consents 
from shareholders to oust the board after it rejected an offer to 
acquire the atlantabased company or help it recapitalize which 
would give shareholders at least 55 per share in cash 
no further meetings between nl and georgia gulf are scheduled 
the sec filing said 
georgia gulfs board announced on thursday that it had asked 
investment banking firm goldman sachs amp co to explore alternative 
transactions such as an acquisition or joint venture 
meanwhile nl industries and another simmons affilate nl 
chemicals inc have sold off 230000 georgia gulf shares over the 
last two weeks cutting their holdings from 99 to 89 percent nl 
controls 56 percent of georgia gulfs outstanding common stock 
whicle nl chemicals has 33 percent 
the shares were sold in blocks ranging from 6300 shares to 
33500 shares for prices between 5850 and 5950 per share 
the two simmons companies said they will continue selling shares 
if they stay above the 55 price they believe could be obtained 
through leveraged recapitalization merger or other transaction 
but nl and nlc also said they would resume their dumptheboard 
plan in georgia gulf takes steps not reasonably calculated to 
realize at least 55 per share for stockholders

treasury secretary nicholas brady says 
investors shouldnt be worried about price drops in the junk bond 
market spreading to the stock market 
i dont think thats going to happen brady told a luncheon 
marking the 50th anniversary of the national association of 
securities dealers on friday 
brady also defended the proposed cut in capital gains taxes but 
said he favored a reduction longer the 27 months contained in a 
house bill that passed through committee this week 
the market in highyield highrisk bonds has been in tailspin 
since wednesday when retailing giant campeau corp said it might 
not be able to make a major loan payment for one of its affiliates 
to avoid defaulting on its junk bond debt 
since then panicky investors have dumped issues they deemed 
especially risky 
but brady said junk bonds have a substantial assets base this 
isnt just equity in disguise there literally are assets behind 
it 
so i dont think itll have an effect on the stock market he 
added 
after a brief speech brady answered several questions at the 
luncheon for nasd the selfregulatory group that oversees the 
overthecounter market of securities that arent traded on nations 
major stock exchanges 
he defended the proposed cut in capital gains profits from the 
sale of capital assets such as stocks or real estate approved by 
the house ways and means committee on thursday the plan still must 
clear the full house as well as the senate 
the plan approved by the committee would reduce the tax rate of 
33 percent to 196 percent for the next 27 months the tax rate then 
would rise to 28 percent but would be indexed to tax only 
increases exceeding the annual inflation rate 
brady said he wished the terms of the proposed tax were longer 
but lets take what we can get and keep working on it he said 
critics have called it a tax break for the rich while supporters 
say it would help the economy by encouraging investment 
people are beginning to understand that this not only benefits 
people who are in our industry purchasing and selling securities 
brady told the crowd of about 300 stock and bond dealers industry 
regulators and reporters 
it benefits the guy who who starts a steel distribution 
business with his 10000 savings in his garage and 38 years later 
sells it to somebody else for 750000 bucks he said theyre 
starting to understand that this isnt some sort of wall street 
benefit plan
