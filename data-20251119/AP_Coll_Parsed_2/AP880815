worshipers screamed and lifted their hands 
toward the sky as a ray of light burst through the clouds monday 
evening during an outdoor mass where thousands came expecting a 
miracle 
shortly after the 6 pm mass began at st john neumann catholic 
church throngs of pilgrims stood and applauded as many spectators 
pointed skyward crying that they saw jesus and the virgin mary and 
calling it a miracle 
i saw the sun pulsating a lot and saw jesus about 10 times 
said mamie fertitta then i saw jesus above and the doves below 
a dozen priests standing on a rooftop altar and 600 eucharist 
ministers turned their backs to the crowd to look at the sky and 
wave after minutes of silence st john neumann pastor monsignor 
joseph james began to sing amazing grace 
people in the audience whipped out cameras to photograph the 
clouds and light 
i saw baby jesus for an instant in the sky said koreth 
vargahese of houston 
the texas national guard estimated the crowd for the service at 
about 12000 people 
to some in the crowd the shape they saw in the sky was the 
miracle they had been hoping for their shouts alerted others some 
then reported seeing the same apparation and others did not 
im positive other people saw things and they took 
photographs said father albert meyer a benedictine monk from 
pecos new mexico 
i didnt see anything but some of the other priests on the 
altar did joe richard a deacon of the lubbock parish 
monday was the catholic feast of the ascension of the virgin 
mary into heaven the crowds were drawn to the charismatic parish 
in west texas by national attention given to three parishioners 
reports that they received messages from the virgin mary this 
spring including tidings of miracles on the feast day 
earlier monday parish members and priests laid hands on the 
pilgrims and said prayers for the scores of handicapped people 
present 
hundreds of people in wheelchairs and walkers settled on the 
grassy hillside beneath a 60footlong altar built atop the church 
office 
i heard that marys crown was spinning on the statue inside 
the church last night so i believe anything can happen said 
marilyn oliver as she stepped off a bus with 43 other catholics 
from east texas 
parish officials did not confirm the rumor about the crown 
james said he did not know whether attendance would reach the 
20000 people he said mary told him would come it doesnt matter 
how many are here some beautiful spirtual things are going on 
the reported messages at the church came after james and several 
parishioners returned from medugorje yugoslavia where six youths 
claimed they began seeing apparitions of mary in 1981 and two say 
they still see them daily 
one group skeptical of the reports said the trip and the 
beginning of the messages was too coincidental to be believable 
while we are certainly open to any verifiable paranormal 
events so far the only amazing thing that has happened here is the 
fact that thousands of people would flock here from all over 
against common sense on the unverified claims of one man said 
harvey madison spokesman for west texans to promote rational 
thought a group that investigates claims of paranormal behavior 
the three parishioners say mary and god speak to them during 
monday night recitations of the rosary the trio write the 
messages in notebooks and read them aloud after the service 
i feel her love her joy her sorrow and thats what i write 
down said one of the three mary constancion a former hospital 
therapist who quit her job to devote more time to prayer and church 
work

more than 75 israeli troops 
broke into yakub zeitoons home one recent morning stayed about a 
half hour and took two cars two television sets a stereo a 
vacuum cleaner and an electric drill 
zeitoon was the target of a tax sweep the latest method 
used by israels military government in the occupied territories to 
crack down on palestinians who refuse to pay taxes 
the eightmonthold palestinian rebellion has largely moved from 
daily violent protests to a determined battle of wits and wills 
with arabs striving for independence and israel seeking to maintain 
its administrative hold on the territories 
that struggle for control is epitomized in the tax war 
for the moment the palestinians appear to be winning 
israeli roundups of cars and electronics have had limited 
success in convincing palestinians to pay personal or sales taxes 
israeli officials acknowledge about a 50 percent drop in tax 
collection in the west bank and gaza strip zeitoon himself still 
refuses to pay 
in addition the association for civil rights in israel has 
filed a complaint with the army arguing that some methods used to 
try to convince palestinians to pay taxes such as confiscating 
identity cards are illegal 
army officials deny the charges of illegality and say the 
palestinians will suffer in the long run for their protest 
we are going to have to cut services to the occupied lands 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told parliament this month 
for their part palestinians contend that in 20 years of israeli 
occupation they have never gotten back in services as much as they 
paid in cash to israel 
for 20 years we lived like chickens laying eggs that the 
israelis took zeitoon said in an interview were tired of 
being treated like animals now we want our pride 
the palestinians contention is supported by israeli researcher 
meron benvenisti who publishes annual studies of the occupied 
territories funded by the ford and rockefeller foundations 
israel collected 80 million in direct and indirect taxes from 
the west bank and gaza in 1987 and returned 30 million to the 
occupied lands and southern lebanon keeping 50 million for 
israeli coffers benvenisti told the associated press 
the tax war has intensified since king hussein of jordan began 
cutting ties with the west bank which he lost to israel in the 
1967 middle east war 
hussein stopped salaries for 21000 palestinians and abandoned a 
fiveyear 13 billion development plan leaving an administrative 
void 
but even as early as january underground leaders of the 
palestinian uprising called on arabs to stop paying taxes to 
israel and many complied 
palestinians who paid taxes often were identified by graffitti 
scrawled on neighborhood walls or on arab radio broadcasts and 
their shops or homes were sometimes set afire or vandalized 
in ramallah about 70 percent of the 2000 to 2500 merchants 
have stopped paying taxes according to zeitoon even though many 
have lost more in confiscations by the israelis than they would 
have had to pay in taxes 
zeitoon said he owes the israeli military government about 
20000 but the goods confiscated from him were worth about 
75000 
ahmed abu rawan who owned a stonecutting factory before the 
uprising began in december said he stopped paying businessrelated 
taxes in january and owes the israeli military administration about 
750 
when he refused to pay they confiscated his 7500 car he said 
but rawan 36 has another problem since january he has lived 
on the run sleeping in the homes of friends because he says 
soldiers told his wife he would be arrested if they could catch him 
when i know the israelis have a holiday i try to sneak home 
and see my wife and two children rawan told the ap in the home 
of a relative during the week i try to meet them at different 
places 
rawans factory has been closed down he now earns small sums as 
a handyman and receives money monthly from a relative in the united 
states 
rawan thinks the underground leaders called for a ban on tax 
payments before they thoroughly thought about how seriously this 
would hurt palestinians 
but he says he will nevertheless obey the directive 
we will give up what they ask us he said i have 
sacrified yes but compared to some the dead the imprisoned 
it is little when i think of them how can i pay my taxes

in a cramped gondola dangling beneath 
an 11story helium balloon with clouds obstructing any view below 
the disembodied voice of the radar operator seemed scarcely to be 
believed 
you have crossed the coast of ireland the voice told three 
american balloonists on that stilldark early morning 10 years ago 
larry newman asked if the message was indeed that which had eluded 
others for 105 years 
silence 
then crisply sir my radar is never wrong 
newman along with ben abruzzo and maxie anderson whooped with 
joy sunburned and weary after five days aloft the 
businessmenadventurers had made the first transatlantic crossing 
in a balloon 
the three landed their blackandsilver double eagle ii later 
that day aug 17 1978 in a wheat field west of paris 
today newman is the only one of the three still alive 
anderson was killed in 1983 at age 48 when his balloon crashed 
in a west german forest during a race abruzzo then 53 died in 
1985 when his twinengine airplane crashed shortly after takeoff in 
albuquerque 
newman now 40 and a commercial airline pilot in phoenix ariz 
said he has no specific plans to celebrate wednesdays anniversary 
but he said his thoughts often drifted back to that summer 10 
years ago 
newman recalled that after the initial jubilation anderson went 
to sleep while he and abruzzo looked down through the clearing 
clouds on the lights of dublin ireland 
the silent 112foot balloon 15000 feet up caught sounds that 
drifted skyward newman and abruzzo could hear dogs barking and 
trains rumbling along tracks nearly 3 miles below 
tears came to my eyes newman said i put my arm around 
ben hed always been somewhat like a father to me i hadnt felt 
that close to another human being for as long as i can remember 
the men began the flight six days earlier when the double eagle 
ii lifted up from presque isle maine and headed toward europe 
more than 3000 miles away 
newman says the flight was not without problems including a 
clash of personalities 
maxie anderson later stated that he wished he could have flown 
the flight by himself newman said i dont know what bens 
feelings were but i wanted someone to share this with i didnt 
want to be charles lindbergh 
newman said conflicts arose when anderson and abruzzo both began 
making key decisions 
any aircraft can only have one captain and we had two ben 
abruzzo and maxie anderson he said 
but newman said conflicts were overshadowed by the hardships of 
the flight in the 12by6foot living space crowded with tv cameras 
and navigational equipment newmans hang glider dangled beneath 
the gondola and 5500 pounds of sand and lead for ballast hung over 
the sides in bags 
there were many times the flight was in question newman 
recalled but how close it came to failure at each moment was 
interpreted different by each of us 
they lost altitude rapidly at one point when ice chunks crusted 
the top of the balloon they jettisoned valuable ballast when they 
dropped to 4000 feet the ice melted 
later in the flight they dumped more ballast including an 
expensive navigation system that had failed on the second day they 
tossed oxygen bottles anything they could 
newman said that at one point a bit delirious from the 
altitude he chucked a 4000 radio and only later noticed a jar 
of peanut butter that weighed as much 
plans were for newman to fly the glider down once they made it 
to paris 
but 400 miles from ireland it came down to a choice of dropping 
the glider their last oxygen and food or a propane tank for a 
heater to battle abruzzos frostbite the glider went 
radios also failed during the flight and the men had to 
communicate by ham radio 
the first guy i talked to wouldnt talk because i didnt have 
a license said newman and he didnt believe i was in a 
balloon over the middle of the ocean 
finally newman reached an old man confined to a wheelchair in a 
home for the elderly somewhere in england 
his call sign was g4jy i dont think ill ever forget 
that he said he talked to me until the last day of the 
flight he was like the good shepherd 
newman said the rough times were offset by the excitement 
a high point he said came over ireland when a jumbo jet 
relayed a message from the smithsonian institution the museum had 
asked to display the gondola and balloon in the national air and 
space museum that houses the apollo 11 moonship lindberghs spirit 
of st louis and the wright brothers plane 
in the final few hours the men believed they would make it to 
paris where lindbergh had landed 51 years before after the first 
solo transatlantic airplane flight but over evreux france they 
realized they could not go on 
the last of the ballast was gone save for a bottle of 
champagne they were 60 miles west of paris 3107 miles and 137 
hours from maine where the heliumpacked balloon had taken off 
the swiftly draining balloon envelope carcass and its gondola 
settled gently to earth as cheering spectators abandoned their cars 
along a nearby highway and rushed to the balloon 
hundreds tried to take a piece of history 
its hard to chew rubberized cloth newman said people 
were trying to tear little shreds off but i think they were 
probably losing their teeth more than damaging the balloon 
the french press dubbed them the new lindberghs 
but newman says the only time he thought about lindbergh was 
when the adventurers drew straws that evening to see which would 
sleep in lindberghs bed at the american ambassadors residence in 
france 
newman and his wife won 
and i ended up on the floor after 30 minutes because i 
couldnt sleep he said the bed was like a banana the springs 
were shot

israeli officials have stirred arab protests 
with plans to dig an opening that will allow tourists to walk along 
the entire western wall of the ancient jewish temple which was 
destroyed by the romans in ad 70 
caretakers of the al aqsa mosque complex built on the 36acre 
plateau that once held the temple fear any digging will serve as a 
pretext to start excavations under the islamic holy site 
palestinians in jerusalems old city rioted in july forcing 
israeli workers to halt digging an entrance in a narrow side street 
off the via dolorosa where tradition says jesus carried the cross 
to his crucifixion 
israeli officials say they will press ahead with the project 
once tensions subside 
the controversy illustrates the deep suspicions and acute 
sensitivities that surround the site which is holy to the worlds 
three major monotheistic religions 
our desire to open the tunnel is purely cultural and 
touristic dany bahat chief archaeologist of jerusalem told 
reporters during a recent tour 
part of the 350yard tunnel which follows the temples western 
wall for most of its route was the main commercial thoroughfare in 
the days of king herod 
folded pieces of paper with the prayers of modern jewish 
visitors who walked in the tunnel can been seen in the cracks 
between the huge smooth stones which have remained in place since 
herod rebuilt the temple in the first century bc it was first 
destroyed by babylonians in 586 bc herods second temple lasted 
until the romans sacked it in 70 
testifying to the greatness of islamic architecture are vaulted 
chambers built by the mamelukes in the 13th century to support a 
bridge linking the al aqsa complex with the city al aqsa was built 
in 536 
the tunnel excavated after israel captured the old city in the 
1967 middle east war cannot be opened for tourists unless an exit 
is built bahat said 
moslem officials say they do not believe israeli intentions are 
innocent and underground leaflets call for palestinians to be on 
their guard to prevent attempts to excavate under the al aqsa 
complex 
hassan tahboub a member of the supreme moslem council in 
jerusalem said moslems feared the tunnel would be used to burrow 
under the al aqsa complex in 1981 israeli militants dug a 25yard 
shaft before moslem guards stopped them 
the purpose of the tunnel opening is political to make the 
supporters of israeli religious parties happy before the nov 1 
elections said tahboub 
their ultimate target is to take all of the area 
gershon salomon head of a group of militant jewish nationalists 
called the temple mount faithful agreed that the tunnel was the 
front line in a battle for control of the holy site 
salomon said if moslems were able to stop the tunnel they would 
try to expand their influence to other areas 
the group met earlier in august with rightwing prime minister 
yitzhak shamir to press demands to open the tunnel immediately 
shamir spokesman yossi achimier said the premier saw jerusalem 
primarily as a jewish city and supported jewish rights to the 
old city and the temple mount but he said shamirs first 
priority for jerusalem was calm and coexistence and nothing would 
be done to stir up the situation 
bahat said any further attempts to dig beneath the al aqsa would 
be unlikely because two shafts leading from the tunnel under the al 
aqsa complex are blocked by huge stones 
bahat defended earlier excavations saying they helped improve 
health standards he said the underground chambers had been used as 
sewers before 1967 and that seepage had leaked into the citys 
water supply 
but adnan husseini chief engineer of the moslem trust fund that 
administers al aqsa said israeli excavation caused the ground to 
shift resulting in serious damage to modern houses and to islamic 
buildings of the 13th 14th and 15th centuries 
from the time digging started cracks began to appear in 
buildings over the tunnel said husseini this important 
israeli tunnel comes at the expense of our important moslem 
buildings 
to jews the temple mount is the holiest of all sites the site 
of the temple that held the tablets on which moses wrote the ten 
commandments 
to moslems it is the haram al sharif or noble enclosure in 
arabic where the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven to receive 
the word of god from the angel gabriel jerusalem is the holiest 
islamic site after the saudi arabian cities of mecca and medina 
to christians the temple was the site where jesus threw out the 
money changers christian crusaders based themselves at the temple 
as well converting al aqsa into a church for the knights templar

after years of being scorned as 
ineffective and antiamerican the united nations is making a 
comeback as a potent instrument of international peacemaking an 
old idea whose time has come again 
bluehelmeted un peacekeeping troops are peering through 
binoculars from the beaches of cyprus to the mountains of 
afghanistan about 350 soon will monitor a ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war and they are likely to be deployed in southern 
africa and cambodia under emerging peace pacts 
the united nations owes its revitalized role to the superpowers 
improved relations and their interest in redirecting resources from 
regional conflict to economic development if the organization is 
on a roll it is because the superpowers have decided the time has 
come to exploit it 
recent mediation between iran and iraq leading to a planned 
ceasefire aug 20 in their 8yearold war has been the major 
accomplishment of secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and the 
security council 
it followed a unbrokered settlement in april between 
afghanistan and pakistan providing for the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan after nearly nine years 
the afghan settlement was the culmination of years of patient 
diplomacy when the soviet leadership decided to cut its losses and 
withdraw the united nations was there a force of 50 unarmed un 
observers is monitoring the withdrawal which is to be completed by 
feb 15 
as rarely before we can see the organizations potential for 
peace its utility as a trusted good officer perez de cuellar 
said last week its peacemaking and peacekeeping can yet bring 
hope to those afflicted by endless violence 
the momentum is building a major un role is forseen in 
cyprus where un troops are separating greek and turkish 
communities on the divided island and in cambodia to end the 
vietnamese occupation 
un troops are also expected to monitor a troop withdrawal from 
namibia occupied by south africa in defiance of un resolutions 
and a transition to independence in the territory 
for years massive un work in refugee aid family planning 
economic and agricultural development childhood innoculation 
teacher training and other areas was overlooked as the world 
focused on the organizations inability to end conflicts suddenly 
years of diplomacy seem to be bearing fruit 
for all the fanfare the united nations is desperately short on 
funds 
the soviet union the first of the superpowers to rediscover the 
united nations as a tool of foreign policy is now paying its back 
dues and peacekeeping arrears moscow now hails the organization as 
a forum for new political thinking 
the united states by contrast is the biggest un debtor it 
has been withholding about 467 million in regular budget payments 
over several years and about 70 million in peacekeeping dues 
for years the united states denounced the organization as an 
intrusion upon its sovereign right to act unilaterally and said it 
didnt like leftist un politics it charged the body with 
squandering funds on third world causes and refused to pay until 
reforms were promised 
now washington praises un accomplishments in afghanistan and 
in the persian gulf but the money is not forthcoming 
now we face a new irony perez de cuellar said at the 
very time when the pursuit of peace quickens its pace throughout 
the united nations bankruptcy threatens to close the 
organization 
if the united states and other debtor nations do not come up 
with funds soon the organization could close this fall 
the united nations successor to the league of nations was 
created in 1945 as an organization of peaceloving states repelled 
by world war ii its aim was to maintain peace and security and 
work for social progress 
one of the organizations most enduring problems in the last 40 
years has been the search for a resolution of the arabisraeli 
conflict 
each time the region has been threatened by war the united 
nations has sent impartial observers or peacekeeping forces it has 
launched five peacekeeping operations since israel was created in 
1948 during which time six wars have broken out 
the first un observer operation in the middle east was the 
un truce supervision organization created in the 1948 
arabisraeli war to supervise a truce untso has remained to 
monitor armistice agreements between israel and its neighbors 
another un success in the region was the creation in 1956 of 
its first peacekeeping force the un emergency force when 
israeli british and french forces moved into egypt the force was 
essential in bringing about a ceasefire and the withdrawal of 
invading forces 
un troops sent to cyprus in 1964 maintained peace before and 
after the turkish invasion of 1974 the un operation in the congo 
from 1960 to 1964 helped restore peace but it was criticized for 
partisanship during a provincial secession and the intervention of 
belgian troops

asking about a sexual partners health or sexual 
history is not a reliable means of avoiding aids because many 
people lie to have sex a researcher says 
onethird of sexually experienced male college students and 10 
percent of women admitted in a study that they have told a lie of 
some sort to get someone to sleep with them the researcher said 
asking partners about risk factors is probably not a very good 
strategy for reducing the risk of aids said susan cochran 
associate professor in the psychology department of california 
state university at northridge 
she described results of her survey saturday at the annual 
meeting of the american psychological association 
cochran said she began the study after noticing that many women 
were asking sex partners about past behavor that carries a risk of 
aids infection as a way to reassure themselves about having sex 
with the man 
people can get infected with the virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome by having sex with an infected person or 
using an infected needle or contaminated blood products 
questioning partners about their drug use and sexual history is 
not an effective substitute for taking precautions such as using 
condoms she said 
the study focused on 422 unmarried sexually experienced college 
students at two southern california campuses ages ranged from 18 
to 25 with an average of 19 fortysix percent were men 
thirtyfive percent of men admitted to telling a lie to have 
sex in addition 47 percent of men and 60 percent of women 
reported that somebody had lied to them in order to have sex 
the study did not specify what the respondents had lied about 
other questions asked what the person would do if honesty 
threatened the chance to have sex or to maintain a desired dating 
relationship 
asked if they would falsely claim to have taken a blood test to 
detect exposure to the aids virus and claim the result was 
negative 20 percent of men and 4 percent of women said yes 
fortyseven percent of men and 42 percent of women said they 
would report having had fewer sexual partners than they really did 
still 52 percent of the women said they ask sex partners about 
sexual and drug histories and 23 percent ask if partners had taken 
an aids test 
if you ask somebody if they have risk factors and they say 
yes you can be reasonably assured theyre not lying cochran 
said but if they say no youre not really any further along 
than not asking 
june reinisch director of the kinsey institute for research in 
sex gender and reproduction said the results make sense 
in the dating situation you cant believe and act upon 
information that comes from the partner she said you have to 
take care of yourself

barty quickly responded and arranged a visit to the sunburst 
production center in hialeah shortly after the release of 
willow in which he plays a high priest 
but he immediately showed us that furniture for little people 
and children are very different said michael buzzella arranging 
three chairs side by side 
the childrens chair was smaller but in the same proportions as 
the adult version the little peoples model was modified with a 
low seat and elevated armrests to accommodate their shorter limbs 
and torsos 
it was a real learning experience for us buzzella said 
you just cant put a little person in childrens furniture it 
doesnt work and they are not comfortable they have their own 
special dimensions 
sunburst a division of metaltech inc unveiled the rainbow 
collection in july at a convention in des moines iowa attended by 
about 600 little people 
buzzella took about 80 furniture orders many had special 
requests such as an extra narrow seat for a woman with a rare 
acute form of dwarfism 
the profit for sunburst in the venture is also small he said 
to be candid a big manufacturer would not touch this 
project buzzella said its not smart business its not a 
bigvolumetype deal but this company has been fortunate and wed 
like to give something back and not just think about the dollars 
involved 
sunburst which had sales of about 5 million last year scored 
a success in 1964 with the patent of an aluminum umbrella designed 
to withstand harsh weather and high winds the umbrellas are used 
in most fastfood franchises and many hotels worldwide buzzella 
said 
i know theyre never going to make money on making furniture 
for little people barty said thats what makes it so special 
they have gone beyond money and done something for people who have 
become accustomed to being ignored

leaked campaign strategy memos laced with 
coarse remarks threaten to ignite racial tensions in the early 
stages of a mayoral campaign that pits a jewish city councilman 
against black incumbent tom bradley 
the memos were prepared by a consulting firm associated with 
39yearold city councilman zev yaroslavsky who is seeking to 
become the citys first jewish mayor and poses by many accounts the 
first real challenge to bradley in a decade both are democrats 
the race is nonpartisan 
the documents by veteran strategists michael berman and carl 
dagostino whose firm is known as bad campaigns berate 
yaroslavsky about his grim demeanor mock bradleys intelligence 
refer to environmentalists as tree huggers and slowgrowth 
advocates as crazed homeowners 
the strategists urge yaroslavsky who represents a chunk of the 
citys largely affluent and liberal west side to skip city council 
meetings and focus his energies on fundraising efforts among 
jewish contributors 
what we do know is that jewish wealth in los angeles is 
endless said one of the memos which were leaked anonymously 
elsewhere the advisers wrote the reason why bad thinks you 
can beat bradley is youve got 50 iq points on him and thats no 
compliment 
berman and dagostino after the memos release last week 
announced their regrets that our private irreverent attempts at 
humor might have caused embarrassment or offense 
yaroslavsky quickly divorced himself from the consultants 
saying i do not agree with many of their ideas and i find many 
of their statements to be insulting insensitive and not reflective 
of my views 
mark ridleythomas executive director of the southern christian 
leadership conference of greater los angeles said the memos 
contents come perilously close to being blatant racist remarks 
at the absolute minimum theyre highly insensitive he said 
he said the memos threaten to inflame black resentment over a 
perceived lack of jewish support during bradleys failed 1986 
campaign for governor and over tensions that emerged between jews 
and blacks during jesse jacksons democratic presidential bid 
earlier this year 
the mayor who at age 70 is seeking an unprecedented fifth term 
as mayor of the nations secondlargest city denounced the memos 
as unprincipled and potentially racially divisive 
talking about the relative intelligence of candidates is of no 
consequence bradley said i think ive demonstrated over the 
years my intelligence and my ability to handle the publics 
problems 
bradley has become politically vulnerable because of his 
protracted tenure of 16 years and position on environmental issues 
he has switched from opposition to approval of a proposed onshore 
drilling project near pacific palisades an exclusive canyon 
enclave overlooking the pacific 
despite its name bad campaigns is a highly regarded firm 
dagostino and berman are extremely wellrespected as very 
capable and talented and winning consultants said former 
republican us rep bobbi fiedler 
berman said bradley found his advice amusing when berman 
submitted similar pointed comments during bradleys unsuccessful 
1969 mayoral campaign and in 1973 when he was elected the first 
black mayor of a major us city 
when its excerpted it becomes a bit embarrassing berman 
said of the memos we dont mean to offend anybody we had no 
intention of offending the mayor on the iq 
fiedler summing up the controversy said i think whats 
happened is that the voters have been given a glimpse into what 
politics is really like 
political consultants in general tend to see themselves as the 
movers and shakers and the candidate as the vehicle she said 
so they often will seem somewhat arrogant and paternal to this 
woeful candidate

in his northern philippine stronghold 
ferdinand marcos remains a pervasive respected figure more than 
two years after a manilabased uprising toppled his 20year 
authoritarian regime 
i tell you that if he ran again he would win hands down 
here said rafael benemerito mayor of the town of pagudpud in 
the province of ilocos norte where marcos was born in 1917 you 
know we ilocanos are very clannish 
in most of the philippines the marcos years are associated with 
massive corruption economic mismanagement and oppression 
president corazon aquino has refused to allow marcos to return from 
hawaii where he fled after the february 1986 uprising that 
propelled her to power 
but in his native province marcos still enjoys widespread 
respect among his fellow ilocanos 
marcos rewarded the province which has a population of about 
440000 with roads and development projects ilocanos are strongly 
represented within the armed forces although precise figures are 
not available 
rep roque ablan a promarcos congressman says allegations of 
massive corruption and embezzlement of up to 10 billion have not 
significantly dented support for the ousted leader 
in spite of all the accusations and charges we still look up 
to mr marcos ablan said we would like to see him come home 
which is the right of every filipino 
the spirit of marcos looms over this province about 250 miles 
north of manila rural bus stops and walls of buildings in laoag 
the provincial capital still bear graffiti such as no to cory 
or marcos once more his slogan in the fraudtainted 1986 
election 
most provincial and municipal officials elected in regional 
balloting in january are members of or have been aligned with 
marcos new society movement party which has virtually 
disintegrated elsewhere in the country 
in the town hall of batac the marcos family ancestral home 
pictures of marcos and his wife imelda hang on the walls of the 
bureau of internal revenue office there is no picture of mrs 
aquino 
people here still respect mr marcos said the rev ruben 
abaya a roman catholic priest in batac they would like to see 
him come home although not necessarily as president they respect 
him for his intelligence 
promarcos politicians insist they are no longer anxious for 
marcos to return as president but as a private citizen marcos 
claimed he won the 1986 election against mrs aquino and left 
manila only after having himself sworn into office 
marcos loyalists were linked to at least three major attempts to 
topple the aquino government 
in all our conversations with mr marcos he always told us to 
cooperate with the aquino government and join hands to fight the 
communists ablan said 
but not every ilocano is a dedicated marcos loyalist communist 
rebels have made strong inroads in ilocos norte since 1981 and by 
military estimates there may be as many as 500 ilocanos in the 
communist new peoples army 
promarcos sympathies were whipped up three months ago when 
supporters of the former president spread reports he would come 
home for the funeral of his mother josefa who died may 4 
mrs aquino refused to allow him to return and the mother is 
still unburied still rumors persist that marcos will return soon 
the provinces association with marcos has not been a handicap 
under the new administration provincial gov rodolfo farinas said 
the aquino government has not discriminated against ilocos norte in 
the allocation of state funds 
but the laoag international airport which once received charter 
flights from hawaii taiwan and hong kong has been closed to 
foreign traffic since september 1986 to prevent marcos from 
slipping into the counry 
airport manager numeriano ramones said only three flights a week 
come in from manila security guards doze on the tables next to 
xray machines and goats cattle and stray dogs wander over the 
tarmac 
residents of a nearby village have erected a makeshift 
basketball court at the southeastern end of the tarmac 
the closing of the laoag airport to international traffic has 
severely curtailed business at fort ilocandia a 196room resort 
built to host the wedding reception of marcos daughter irene 
it was hoped the resort and its casino would attract high 
rollers from hong kong and filipino immigrant families from the 
united states wishing to vacation in their homeland last week the 
hotel had only three guests

the phone has been ringing off the hook with 
calls from ordinary citizens at the embezzlement and bribery 
reporting center ever since it opened in the east district of 
beijing 
the office is a sign of the times in china as the government 
tries to control corruption all over the country 
the response of the people has been excellent said a 
frazzled wu yuhua the 35yearold station head a week after the 
center opened july 29 they are very curious and have many 
complaints 
housed in a cramped 19th century mudandmortar dwelling capped 
with the traditional sweeping eaves of a chinese home the center 
is in a beijing alley next to a butcher shop 
we wanted the people to be at home wu said if we stuck 
it on the fifth floor of a government building no one would come 
see us 
the station is manned six days a week for eight hours a day and 
is equipped with a telephone answering service for afterhours 
calls 
in all the station is responsible for about 6000 government 
employees serving 15 million people 
all reports are taken in secret to protect the callers and all 
investigations are handled by the reporting station 
too much corruption is investigated in china by the corrupt 
bureau itself said wan songching the 50yearold director of 
the east districts investigative wing but this reporting 
station will do its own work we are eager to see results 
similar corruption reporting centers are opening all over the 
country and the government says that by september every province 
will one in addition a telephone corruption hotline opened in 
beijing in early august ready to take calls from across the nation 
wu said such devices are necessary if china is going to reform 
its government 
in the past the government always policed itself he 
explained now weve got to have the support of the masses we 
cant clean up the government alone 
china has always tolerated a certain level of official 
dishonesty guanxi or connections are the grease upon which 
the wheels of society run but lately corruption has been getting 
out of hand 
i am shocked at the change in my country said wang poming 
who returned in july after eight years in the united states 
corruption is everywhere school teachers force their students to 
buy breakfast from them to make more money students steal tests 
and sell them for a profit 
corruption and inflation thats all we chinese are talking 
about said liu yuanshang a bookstore owner in beijing we are 
worried that all the dirt will stop the reforms 
the reforms pushed for the last decade by national leader deng 
xiaoping have helped to double chinas gross national product in 
five years to 295 billion in 1987 
but by creating a twotrack pricing system of low stateset 
prices and higher free market prices the reforms have created vast 
opportunities for illegal deals 
in late july 75 staterun businesses in the industrial city of 
wuhan were exposed for making illegal profits off peasants the 
firms bought state goods at fixed low prices and sold them to 
farmers at large profits 
the reselling scheme has become so bad in the cigarette and 
liquor market that on july 28 the government raised the price of 
chinas best brands by as much as 790 percent 
the official press said the move was made to crush a black 
market that has gained a monopoly on highquality cigarettes and 
spirit sales 
in battling corruption the governments policies have been 
unclear lax in one city harsh in the next and creative somewhere 
else 
in shenyang a northern city the city government recently 
imposed a tax on banquets cars and firecrackers three items that 
officials often use public funds to buy 
in beijing qiao yonghang 35 who had been working for several 
years at the stateowned beijing communications and electrical co 
was executed july 25 for taking bribes in exchange for color 
television sets the official xinhua news agency reported 
in all he received bribes worth 120000 yuan 32400 which 
amounts to 125 years of the average urban salary 
still because of guanxi a great percentage of official 
corruption continues 
chinas leading paper the peoples daily renmin ribao 
recently told of gu chengju a forestry official in hunan province 
who stole 300000 yuan 81000 in state funds to build an office 
building and a highclass guest house 
almost two years after his case was exposed gu has yet to be 
brought to justice 
the reason is that gu has been greasing the hands of local 
officials who were supposed to investigate him the paper said 
this feudalistic practice of officials shielding one another 
must end it said in a strong editorial 
some western analysts notably tony kane a china expert with 
the asia society in new york view the growing corruption as a sign 
that china is becoming more democratic 
during the cultural revolution the dirt and sleaze was just as 
widespread but it was being perpetrated by only a few 
individuals kane said now at least you have a situation 
where more people are being allowed to participate that is not 
necessarily bad 
wu yuhuan and his colleagues at the embezzlement and bribery 
reporting station in east beijing do not agree 
when a rat crosses the street the people run to beat it wu 
said citing a popular proverb to me corruption is the rat and 
i must kill it

night snacks with a zoo elephant as their rollicking preconvention 
weekend wound down 
the very important pachyderm at the elephant romp welcome at 
audubon zoo was ellie mae who drew adoring attention from the herd 
of 3600 partiers its a wonderful elephant obviously 
republican said joan milke flores a california delegate and los 
angeles city councilwoman 
ellie maes handler james holston said the 1200pound 
elephant was named the conventions official mascot and had a full 
schedule of national television appearances for the entire week 
new orleans city councilman mike early who took credit for the 
zoo party idea said the goal was to stuff a 3week new orleans 
experience into three hours 
a philosophy of this party i think would be that in new 
orleans we believe that throwing a party hosting a party really 
is an art it really is a science said early a democrat 
new orleans chef paul prudhomme stirred chicken etoufee under 
one of four airconditioned zoo tents and pat obriens which 
claims to dispense more alcohol than any bar in the world prepared 
2000 potent hurricanes in 15ounce paper cups this is the 
official drink and we want the gop to try it said obriens 
spokesman lou reynolds 
sunday was filled with dancing and dixieland from the french 
quarter to private homes in the fashionable garden district 
jazz musicians had plenty of work at the sheraton hotel a 
threepiece group entertained incoming guests while another combo 
imparted dixieland flavor to a congressional brunch 
across the street at the marriott alaska sponsored a 
20000plus feast featuring 1000 pounds of seafood flown in for 
the occasion and exotic treats like moose and reindeer sausage 
seafood flown into a city known for its seafood 
thats your kind of seafood not necessarily our kind said 
jim crawford the alaska gop chairman but i dont think theres 
a better party town in the united states than new orleans 
some delegates got a head start on the festivities saturday 
night with a rollicking river boat race mardi grasstyle parade 
and samplings of turtle soup au sherry 
at the new orleans convention center delegates tasted the 
citys finest cooking and danced behind a fastmarching city high 
school band and miniature mardi gras floats the floats carried 
costumed partygoers who pitched plastic beads and doubloons 
touting the carnivals sponsor the timespicayune newspaper 
al bullock an alternate delegate from maryland who has attended 
three conventions scoffed at decorum and danced in the parade 
this is the greatest party ever said bullock swaying in a 
navy blazer and purple beads 
whiteuniformed servers from commanders palace ladled 138 
gallons of turtle soup au sherry into white styrofoam bowls at the 
105yearold restaurant an appetizer portion runs 450 on a 
night of freebies there were very few leftovers 
the foods a big hit and sos the parade said mark moses 
a copelands supervisor one nice thing about new orleans it 
opens you up and brings you back to a childhood state folks start 
out saying about the dancing that its really stupid but five 
minutes later they are out there chasing the band 
jefferson parish sheriff harry lee a democrat watched the 
republicans eat drink and dance then said with laughter well 
party with them now and then well slug it out this november

in a unique farewell political role 
president reagan is taking the offensive as he campaigns for george 
bushs republican ticket 
reagan is center stage tonight for the address that will be the 
true keynote of the republican national convention it also will be 
his grand finale at his fourth convention as a dominant gop figure 
but its only the start of his planned campaign no modern 
president has conducted a parting campaign to match the one reagan 
has promised bush and the republicans he expects to appear at 
least twice a week in behalf of the ticket and republican 
fundraising efforts from labor day to election day 
reagans tone so far has been tough sometimes contrasting with 
the reassuring style that became typical of his personal 
campaigning over the past dozen years 
not since dwight d eisenhower has a departing president been in 
a position to campaign for his partys nominee to succeed to the 
office eisenhower served two full terms and left office as a 
popular figure but vice president richard m nixon the republican 
nominee in 1960 did not seek extensive campaigning from eisenhower 
popularity is not transferable of course and there can be a 
down side for a vice president who relies heavily on the campaign 
favors of the president to whom he has been understudy the vice 
president has to make his own imprint on the minds of voters and 
he has a relatively brief time to do it 
bush and his managers believe they can make the breakthrough 
beginning in new orleans aided not inhibited by an active reagan 
campaign 
hell be a great surrogate said campaign manager lee 
atwater he said reagan will be especially helpful to the bush 
ticket in sun belt states and in california 
furthermore reagan may be able to help turn on and turn out 
conservatives who never have counted the vice president as one of 
their heroes 
bush and reagan have carefully designed roles in new orleans so 
that the departing president wont overshadow the arriving nominee 
the twain will meet once on tuesday as bush arrives for the 
convention and reagan leaves new orleans for a vacation at his 
ranch near santa barbara calif 
from that point bush is supposed to have the starring role 
the tandem campaign began in the buildup to the convention in 
washington reagan and bush spoke to the administrations political 
appointees the president telling them that the voters wont gamble 
the future on a blind date with the democrats in his weekly 
radio address on saturday the president said the democrats are all 
talk while we deliver 
then in a new orleans arrival preview of his convention 
address reagan hammered the democrats with periodic plugs for 
bush he denounced the narrow agenda of the liberal elites and 
special interest groups said the democrats dont want the voters 
to find out what they intend to do and called their atlanta 
convention the biggest masquerade since mardi gras 
in all of that he pressed a theme designed by the bush 
campaign the argument that democrats are hiding from specifics and 
from comparison of their offerings with those of the republicans 
the stealth candidacy has to come out from under cover said 
reagan its time to talk issues to use the dreaded l word to 
say the policies of our opposition are liberal liberal liberal 
that l word is going to echo through the superdome convention 
hall all week long it is part of an attack strategy campaign the 
republicans intend to make central to their campaign

more than 1200 salvadoran refugees 
returned from honduras to their homeland sunday after being delayed 
at the border in a dispute over us church people accompanying 
them a radio report said 
roberto rodriguez of the un high commissioner for refugees 
said by telephone that the refugees and more than 150 vehicles were 
allowed to enter el salvador at 530 pm 730 pm edt after the 
15 church workers agreed to stay in honduras 
salvadoran government officials say many refugees sympathize 
with leftist guerrillas and have accused church workers of similar 
leanings 
rodriguez said the refugees were on their way to hometowns in 
northern chalatenango province 
there was no immediate comment from the salvadoran government 
members of the us church organization that had aided the refugees 
could not be reached for comment 
late saturday the convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks carrying 
the refugees and their belongings were halted in honduras about 500 
yards from the border 
they had left the mesa grande refugee camp 30 miles to the north 
under an accord worked out among the refugees the salvadoran 
government and the un organization which is overseeing the 
repatriation 
some of the salvadorans spent up to eight years in the mesa 
grande camp 
jose maria mendiluce the un agencys central american 
director said the presence of the us church workers members of 
the going home organization was not contemplated in the accord 
earlier sunday interior minister edgar belloso funes told 
reporters at the border that his government welcomes with open 
arms the salvadoran refugees 
but the socalled internationalists among them are using our 
brothers for strictly political ends they the foreigners are 
coming here to break our laws and i have orders from the highest 
level that they not be permitted entry he said 
amadeo lopez a returning refugee had said the group was 
insisting the us church workers be allowed to enter he said the 
refugees were determined to wait in their milelong convoy until 
their demand was met 
but the 1230 refugees including hundreds of infants and 
children had little food and appeared unprepared to spend days 
waiting on the road two pregnant women among the refugees were 
expected to give birth in coming days 
louis vitale a roman catholic priest from oakland calif and 
spokesman for the going home delegation blamed the salvadoran 
government for the dispute 
this is part of the salvadoran governments continuing efforts 
to obstruct the refugees return he said adding that all 
members of his delegation had visas for el salvador 
going home is an interfaith organization supporting salvadoran 
refugees it participated last october in the first big 
repatriation of salvadoran refugees from honduras 
the return of refugees is a highly charged issue in this small 
central american country torn by nearly nine years of civil war 
the armed forces consider the three salvadoran refugee camps in 
honduras part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas fighting the 
ussupported government about 4300 refugees returned last year 
and about 15000 salvadoran refugees remain in the camps 
the salvadoran government is concerned about their political 
sympathies and the burden they may place on an economy devastated 
by war and so it is reluctant to collaborate with that project 
but a regional peace accord signed last august underscored the 
right of refugees to return home and the government eventually 
cooperated with the return 
the terrorists use mesa grande as a refuge to recover from 
wounds and to rest the people there generally sympathize with the 
subversives their return could be detrimental to us militarily 
army col ciro lopez roque told the associated press at the border 
saturday he is commander of the 4th brigade in charge of the 
northern frontier province of chalatenango 
but he also said that as a salvadoran i recognize that every 
salvadoran has a right to be in his country and should be here 
the refugees intend to return to three towns in chalatenango 
from which they fled in the early 1980s 
sofia enriquez who left her town of los ranchos in 1982 stood 
beside a bus and held her infant daughter while another daughter 
clutched her skirt both girls were born in mesa grande 
asked why she left she said we were persecuted they were

the republicans who are about to nominate 
george bush for president see some 200 shortcomings in the 
candidate 
they say hes too liberal or too conservative too nice or too 
honest too rich or too loyal a few uttered the word wimp but 
others defended bush against such a label 
hes a lousy campaigner carped james proctor a north 
carolina lawyer whose favorite candidate sen bob dole of kansas 
lost out to bush in the race for the nomination 
he hasnt been elected to a major office for quite a few 
years and im a little worried about that i guess gene 
warkenthien of south dakota said of the man who was elected vice 
president in 1980 and 1984 
proctor and warkenthien were among 1215 delegates to the 
republican national convention who responded to an associated press 
survey in all 2277 delegates will attend the convention which 
opens today in new orleans 
when asked to identify bushs major strengths and weaknesses 
delegates responses fell into 228 categories on his weaknesses and 
127 on his strengths 
sixtythree percent of the delegates said bushs experience in 
government especially his work in foreign policy would be his 
greatest asset in the fall election 
in all the years that i have been attending national 
conventions there has not been a single aspirant who has the 
congressional executive and leadership experience of bush said 
george hering of delaware who has been attending conventions since 
1964 
in addition to serving as vice president bush has been director 
of the cia the us ambassador to the united nations a member of 
congress and us envoy to china 
bushs biggest problem according to those who are about to 
nominate him for president is his image and speaking style nearly 
32 percent of the delegates cited these as the obstacles he needs 
to overcome in his race for the white house 
many said bush had been unfairly labeled as a wimp and 
blamed the news media for pinning that on him 
he is perceived as being weak the wimp factor a charlie 
brown character said edwin j guillot jr a delegate from 
puerto rico it isnt weakness its decency integrity but 
people see it as weakness and it could cost him the election 
pennsylvania delegate charles sexton was direct they dont 
put wimps in as head of the cia 
the delegates see being vice president as both a blessing and a 
curse allowing bush to be a part of the reagan administrations 
successes but also forcing him to take the heat for its failures 
while keeping his opinions to himself 
hes the vice president which is a weak office someone said 
it aint worth a cup of warm spit and he has proven how true that 
is said howard clement a delegate from north carolina 
he will end up apologizing for reagan on civil rights issues 
ethics issues economic issues clement said hes got a lot of 
baggage 
while there was no shortage of criticism almost all of the 
delegates also had nice things to say about their nominee 
when he tells you something you can believe him said david 
osteen of north carolina 
his greatest strength is the fact that hes been part of an 
administration that has seen the country come from the brink of 
disaster to a very solid stable situation in about every aspect 
said rudy munro of missouri 
i dont think he would have been made head of the cia if he 
wasnt intelligent said marguerite armstrong of vermont 
and finally there was a piece of advice 
if he can appear as the allamerican boy scout thatll be his 
strength said arizona delegate evan mecham who was impeached 
and removed from office as the states governor in april

david letterman fans will watch a butter 
sculpture of guest jack hanna melt making more of a mess on the 
set than most of the columbus zoo directors animal friends have 
left 
hanna has taken many of his animals on nbctvs late night 
with david letterman and they dont always display the best 
manners 
a crew from the letterman show last weekend searched the ohio 
state fair for acts and selected the butter sculpture of hanna 
holding a lion cub it will deteriorate over a oneweek period on 
the show starting tonight 
the statue was sculpted by dan ross of columbus 
last years statue of race car driver bobby rahal was displayed 
intact on the letterman show

at first glance the republicans appear to 
have gathered in hostile political territory but an overwhelming 
democratic registration edge masks growing republican strength in 
louisiana 
new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy a jesse jackson democrat 
and a vice chairman of the national democratic party leads a city 
where registered democrats outnumber registered republicans 189741 
to 34853 
statewide there are 2146867 registered voters and only about 
322000 of them 15 percent are republicans 
in the legislature there are 23 republicans among the 144 
members 
republicans have been scarce in louisiana since reconstruction 
populist democrats like huey long who taxed oil companies to 
provide free state services further cemented the democrats hold 
on the state when blacks became a voting force as a result of the 
civil rights movement democrats broadened their base despite 
occasional defections by white voters to states rights candidates 
but things are looking up for the louisiana gop republicans 
have won five of the last eight presidential races in the state 
half of louisianas eight us house members are republicans now 
ten years ago republican registration was just 79900 and the 
longstanding joke was that they could hold the state convention in 
a telephone booth 
chinks in the democrats louisiana fortress first were seen more 
than 30 years ago when the state went for dwight d eisenhower in 
the 1956 presidential race in later years louisianas electoral 
votes went to republicans barry goldwater in 1964 richard nixon in 
1972 and ronald reagan in 1980 and 1984 
in 1972 dave treen after three losing campaigns became the 
first republican to win a congressional seat in louisiana since 
reconstruction 
treen later became the first republican governor since 
reconstruction when he was elected to the post in 1979 ironically 
he was helped by a law the democrats had pushed to help themselves 
the unique open primary law 
all candidates from all parties run in one election if no 
candidate wins a majority the top two finishers regardless of 
party face a runoff 
the law was designed to keep democrats from exhausting their 
energies and campaign funds in volatile primary battles against 
each other only to face a single wellfinanced republican in a 
general election 
but since anyone could vote regardless of party registration 
it allowed conservative democrats to cross party lines and vote 
for republicans 
 
in addition to gop house gains former republican rep henson 
moore forced democrat john breaux to wage a tough comefrombehind 
battle in 1986 to keep democratic control of the senate seat left 
vacant by the retirement of russell long a powerful democrat and 
son of huey long 
all is not roses for the republicans in louisiana even with the 
open primary 
for example democrats remain so strong that the planners for 
the 1988 gop convention yanked democratic mayor barthelemy off the 
schedule for their nationally televised opening night ceremonies so 
his welcoming remarks would be made during a less conspicuous 
morning session 
after his 1986 loss to breaux moore said he did not think a 
republican could beat a democrat in a headtohead match 
that was three years after treen was overwhelmingly defeated 
when popular twoterm governor edwin edwards a democrat returned 
to politics after a fouryear hiatus 
and although edwards political fortunes fell with the price of 
oil and the states poor economy it took another democrat buddy 
roemer to drive edwards out of office in last years election 
roemer came from the back of a fiveman pack to beat edwards and 
rep robert livingston the republican who had been considered a 
sure bet for a runoff with edwards 
treen believes the louisiana gops growing strength results in 
part from the tenacity of republicans like him who ran against 
enormous odds in the 1950s and 1960s 
if i had the wisdom of my present age which is 60 when i ran 
for congress i probably would not have run for congress back in 
1962 he said but he does not regret it 
that race led to the 64 race and the 68 race and 
eventually to the race i won in 1972

new hampshire gov john sununu is leading a 
republican national convention assault on his neighbor michael 
dukakis saying the democratic nominee has displayed an absolute 
incapacity to manage 
sununu a frequent critic of the massachusetts governor 
conducted a spirited denunciation of the dukakis record on the eve 
of the gop convention and sununu who will speak to the convention 
tuesday night added im saving the good stuff 
it takes an absolute incapacity to manage to have reached the 
fiscal chaos that massachusetts has today sununu said at a news 
conference sunday following a meeting of republican governors and 
former governors 
he was joined by a halfdozen other governors as he attacked 
dukakis management of the massachusetts budget in the face of a 
severe deficit this year 
he said dukakis failed to take steps that other governors did to 
head off a deficit when they saw indications of an economic 
slowdown to deal with the resulting shortage dukakis resorted to 
borrowing from the retirement fund for state employee pensions as 
well as tax increases sununu said 
the fact is that michael dukakis had no handle on his budget 
michael dukakis had no capacity to deal with a tough situation that 
he created on his own sununu said michael dukakis had no 
management understanding in a timely way of what should have been 
done and what michael dukakis has done since then in order to deal 
with next years deficit is absolutely irresponsible 
he used the word steal to describe the states borrowing 
from its pension system and said the action ought to strike fear 
in the hearts of anyone who draws a social security check 
at a brunch earlier former gov lamar alexander of tennessee 
delivered a plea for the gop not to forget that states need to take 
action to deal with problems even while the republicans put a 
harness on the government in washington 
somebodys got to fix the schools and save the outdoors and 
fix the roads and clean the streets he said and you dont get 
to be a governing conservative majority by voting no in 
washington alone most of the work thats done on schools and jobs 
and the outdoors is done by governors 
gov michael castle of delaware chairman of the gop governors 
urged a close examination of dukakis record during his three terms 
as governor of massachusetts saying the state had merely benefited 
from an economic boom throughout new england 
there is some concern that the massachusetts miracle which 
has been presented by michael dukakis may not be quite a 
miracle castle said referring to the dukakis campaign slogan 
for the states economic health perhaps its a massachusetts 
mirage 
at dukakis campaign headquarters in boston spokesman steve akey 
did not immediately return a reporters call seeking comment

december but those purple walls will be a thing of the past they 
will be repainted to a peach tone to go with the new red rug 
these colors are all wrong said sen donald moe who heads 
a subcommittee in charge of the restoration the purple should 
not be here we cant find anyone who will admit recommending it

police in orange county say theyve 
found an almost foolproof way to reduce the number of raucous 
parties in their cities bill the hosts for the time it takes to 
break up the noisy gettogethers 
eleven orange county cities have approved ordinances within the 
past year enabling police to take such action 
under the ordinances if police have to return after issuing a 
warning the host will be billed for personnel and equipment costs 
its worked beyond our wildest dreams fullerton police sgt 
gary miller said 
since it went into effect i guess that there are 1000 
parties weve gone to and i think weve gone back a second time 
10 times miller said 
hosts however have not been overly thrilled about paying up 
mike lasater of la habra said he has no intention of paying his 
bill even if it is only 1644 
i aint paying it he said they can take me to jail for 
16 
lasater who threw a party for his daughters high school 
graduation in june said he immediately broke up the party after 
his first warning but some guests lingered in the street and 
police had to disperse them 
the city hasnt chosen what to do if people ignore the 
billing said capt john rees of the la habra police department

police on monday broke off a student march to the north korean 
border to press for reunification police arrested and beat scores 
of protesters 
about 2500 students holding red and blue banners tried to march 
out of yonsei university to go to the border truce village of 
panmunjom about 30 miles away 
hundreds of riot troopers in green combat fatigues and 
blackvisored helmets confronted students as soon as they exited 
the main gate 
some officers were seen beating students with riot shields and 
making flkying karate kicks at fleeing protesters 
the students did not fight back and most were unarmed except for 
a few carrying clubs some students hurled a few stones but the 
protesters only fought back with clubs and rocks when the police 
charged into the campus 
dozens of students seized by police huddled on the ground 
clinging to each other as police hit and kicked them some students 
cried with pain and senior police officers hit some of their own 
troopers to try and stop the beating 
the students made three atrempts to march out of the main gate 
each time they were driven back by charging police and armored 
vans firing tear gas 
the students marched out after a rally to call for reunification 
with communist north korea they wanted to go to panmunjom for 
talks with north korean student delegates on reuniting the divided 
korean pensinsula 
the government banned the march and deployed more than 20000 
riot police to stop it 
on sunday hundreds of students at yonsei and another college in 
central seoul battled riot police with firebombs and rocks and 
furious residents demanded a halt to the protests to protect the 
olympics 
fewer students appeared to be involved than in clashes on 
saturday the few thousand radicals involved in the protests have 
virtually no public support and clashes were confined to two or 
three small areas 
students tried to stage a number of demonstrations in downtown 
seoul but handfuls of protesters were dispersed quickly by 
hundreds of riot police police said more than 5000 riot troops 
were deployed to block the protests

rocks near seoul national university medical school before being 
driven off by police 
president roh taewoo warned friday that violent protests were a 
threat to the olympics and had to be stopped 
radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try 
to mobilize public support for their antigovernment campaign the 
radicals a small but powerful minority on campuses have failed to 
gain support because of violent tactics and open advances to the 
communist north 
the students say they are not communists but insist the 
peninsula be reunited immediately with political differences to be 
worked out later most south koreans fear the north is determined 
to conquer them 
the radical students also demand removal of the 42000 us 
troops in south korea

world war ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the 
korean war

citing the potential of terrorist attack 
members of congress are putting the reagan administration on notice 
that they will strongly oppose any move to permit sea shipment of 
plutonium from europe to japan 
here you have an administration that is supposedly waging a 
war on terrorism but promoting a policy that could make terrorism 
easy said rep howard wolpe dmich a member of the house 
foreign affairs committee 
the issue stems from a recently signed usjapan nuclear 
cooperation treaty that authorizes shipments by air of plutonium 
from reprocessing plants in europe back to japan where it will be 
used to fuel nuclear power plants 
the plutonium which also could be utilized for nuclear weapons 
is controlled by the us government because the nuclear fuel 
originated in the united states 
proceeding with the air shipments was made contingent upon 
development of crashproof shipping casks which so far has proven 
unachievable 
in the face of that the japanese have been seeking to amend the 
nuclear cooperation treaty to give 30year advance approval for 
shipment by sea such a subsequent arrangement must be reviewed 
by congress 
wolpe said late last week that amending the usjapan accord 
would face significant opposition on capitol hill 
congress will have a 15day review period when it will be very 
difficult for the reagan administration to explain how if we are 
not shipping plutonium by air because it is not yet safe we can 
consider shipping plutonium by sea which is a proven danger he 
said 
the michigan democrat joined with 13 other house members and 
four senators in sending a letter this month to president reagan 
expressing their concern over reports that his administration has 
agreed in principle to allow sea shipment 
they cited a march 1988 pentagon study which said the office 
of the secretary of defense joint staff and services have 
concluded that air shipment via the polar route is preferable to 
sea shipment 
the study warned that during sea shipment the vessel is 
accessible and vulnerable throughout the voyage particularly when 
the vessel is passing through channels straits and other 
restricted waterways choke points or when it is near the 
coast 
even if the most careful precautions are observed no one could 
guarantee the safety of the cargo from a security incident such as 
an attack on the vessel by small fast craft especially if armed 
with modern antiship missiles it said 
the only previous sea shipment of plutonium from europe to japan 
took place in 1984 when the cargo ship was escorted by us 
french and japanese naval vessels and monitored constantly by 
satellite 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead dealt with the 
plutonium issue in a may 30 letter to members of the house foreign 
affairs and senate foreign relations committees 
in the letter whitehead said the administration will 
consider programmatic shipment of plutonium under adequate physical 
security pursuant to the implementing agreement such an 
arrangement would be treated by the administration as a subsequent 
arrangement in accordance with section 131 of the atomic energy 
act 
a state department official who spoke on condition that he not 
be identified said the government of japan approached the us 
government on this issue and requested discussions officials of 
japan and the united states met in july to begin the discussions 
and further discussions are taking place in japan 
he said there was no indication how long the talks would 
continue 
the department of energy has said it expects that each sea 
shipment would involve more than 200 kilograms or 440 pounds of 
plutonium 
according to the nuclear control institute a washingtonbased 
nuclear nonproliferation policy group approximately 15 pounds of 
plutonium would be enough to make a nuclear weapon 
this transportation controversy underscores the very real 
dangers of civilian plutonium commerce said alan kuperman the 
institutes issues director it should prompt japan to reconsider 
its commitment to recycling plutonium 
along with wolpe house members signing the aug 4 letter to 
reagan were reps don bonker dwash ted weiss dny gary l

should you give money to a beggar 
some people who work with the down and out say you should while 
others believe the most charitable response is to say no 
last week new york city mayor edward i koch announced an 
advertising program to discourage people from giving money in 
most cases in my judgment the money that you give in the street 
to beggars goes for booze and drugs said koch 
a person or persons unknown rented four billboards last month in 
el paso texas to say please dont give to beggars they cause 
traffic problems many of the beggars cross from ciudad juarez in 
mexico 
in washington the downtown seattle association distributes 
brochures advising give a hand not a handout 
the main reason people are panhandling is to support alcohol 
and drug problems said jean demaster director of burnside 
projects which runs a shelter for street people in portland ore 
i am absolutely convinced that if people didnt give money to 
panhandlers the matter of panhandling would be drastically 
reduced and more people would be forced to come in for alcohol and 
drug treatment 
lisa thomas project director of health care for the homeless in 
cleveland said money given to beggars may only encourage a drug or 
alcohol habit 
i dont give money to people in the street and i tell my 
friends not to ms thomas said you never know where the money 
is going 
gloria guard director of the peoples emergency center a 
shelter in west philadelphia said there is no right or wrong 
response it really has much more to do with my own wanting to 
take the opportunity to give something to somebody 
kevin hooper social services secretary for the salvation army 
in philadelphia said an encounter with a beggar could be positive 
even if no money is given i would hope people would internalize 
that and ask themselves why are people on the street asking for 
money 
i think its important to make a decision about whether or not 
youre going to give someone money not just to walk away or assume 
theyre going to use it for a drink or something harmful said 
mark baker director of community relations and advocacy for the 
pine street inn shelter in boston 
you just cant ignore people baker added the tip is to 
look at a beggar as another person with real needs

defense secretary frank carlucci should 
receive a report this week from a navy board that investigated the 
downing of an iranian passenger airliner by the uss vincennes the 
pentagon says 
navy cmdr mel sutton confirmed on sunday that the panel has 
completed its work but he refused to discuss a published report 
saying the board recommended disciplinary action against only one 
officer aboard the ship 
all 290 people aboard the plane were killed when it was shot 
down over the persian gulf on july 3 the vincennes had 
misidentified the plane as an f14 fighter 
the report went up and if not already will be in the hands 
of the defense secretary this week sutton said we expect a 
public report in the near future 
sutton refused to discuss a story in sundays editions of the 
washington post which said the boards report calls for 
disciplining only the ships operations officer the story said 
that officer who has not been identified publicly drew most of 
the blame for his role in misinterpreting information that resulted 
in a decision to fire on the plane 
the newspaper said the report reaches the general conclusion 
that the tragedy resulted from a series of human errors not from 
any major malfunction in the ships sophisticated aegis radar 
systems 
the post quoted defense department officials as saying the 
report of the investigating team headed by rear adm william n 
fogarty could be changed before it is made public 
however the story added the officials said there is little 
inclination to go hard on any navy personnel connected with the 
downing of the jet from rear adm anthony a less commander of 
the naval task force in the persian gulf to the sailors who 
misinterpreted the radar data 
the proposed discipline against the operations officer would be 
one of the lightest available to the navy a letter of reprimand 
that would not made a part of the officers permanent record

he is an honest open ethical person who has high standards 
for himself and the people around him said iowa gov terry 
branstad 
another midwesterner gov michael hayden of kansas said bush 
can insulate himself from ethical criticism by building a wall of 
credibility around himself as a first step hayden said bush 
must select aides and associates whose behavior is beyond reproach 
bush has stressed his openness by releasing financial data 
including his tax returns and a statement from his doctor about his 
medical condition 
the vice president also suggested that meeses conduct did not 
meet the standards he would set for his cabinet members though he 
never called for meeses resignation meese who left office last 
friday said he strongly supports bushs nomination but planned to 
take a vacation with his family this week 
independent counsel james mckay investigated meeses conduct 
while in office mckay said he would not bring charges against 
meese although meese probably violated conflictofinterest and 
tax laws meese denied any wrongdoing and compared his case to 
that of former labor secretary ray donovan who was acquitted on 
fraud charges 
the republicans have touched briefly on ethics in their 
platform focusing exclusively on activities of the 
democratcontrolled congress primarily the house 
in congress outright offenses against ethical standards and 
public laws are treated lightly and members protect their 
cronies charged with personal misconduct or criminal activities 
the document says 
while more than a dozen reagan administration officials have 
left under a cloud indiana gov robert orr doubted the democrats 
would make a big deal about the issue during the 1988 presidential 
campaign its a bum issue for the democrats to pursue they 
could find themselves hoist by their own petards he said 
in the house speaker jim wright dtexas is the subject of an 
investigation by the ethics committee the panel has hired an 
independent counsel to look into large royalties wright received 
from a book published by a campaign contributor 
there is sleaze on both sides said clopha deshotel of the 
american freedom coalition a conservative lobbying group that is 
selling the oliver north videotapes for 25 along with pictures of 
north for 5 and bumper stickers that say pardon ollie and 
two wrongs make a wright 
north and his exboss john poindexter are awaiting trial on 
charges of conspiracy to defraud the united states for their role 
in the irancontra affair north also is charged with accepting 
gratuities and destroying documents 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel has hit the lecture 
circuit receiving as much as 25000 a speech he also has 
campaigned for republican candidates in california and florida 
but republican officials say they have no word that north will 
appear at the convention said deshotel it would be like elvis 
he would upstage the event 
the allegations against administration officials vary widely 
deaver the former deputy chief of staff was convicted of perjury 
in an ethics investigation 
others convicted were rita lavelle former head of the 
environmental protection agencys toxic waste cleanup program who 
was found guilty of lying to congress paul thayer a deputy 
secretary of defense who served 19 months for lying about insider 
stock trading and c mcclain haddow a top official at health and 
human services who pleaded guilty to pocketing 55330 from a 
nonprofit foundation he started 
others who ran into trouble were richard v allen a former 
national security adviser who resigned amid questions about his 
acceptance of gifts from the japanese anne gorsuch burford a 
former epa administrator who resigned amid allegations of agency 
mismanagement and possible conflict of interest and j lynn helms 
former administrator of the federal aviation administration who 
resigned after reports that he was involved in questionable 
business dealings

an ordinance aimed at aggressive beggars seems to 
have reduced the number of confrontations between panhandlers and 
pedestrians but didnt prevent the death of a passerby who said no 
seattles law went into effect nov 27 after years of attempts 
by some officials and downtown businessmen alarmed by pushy 
beggars the law has served as a model for at least two other 
cities 
there has been a significant reduction in the amount of 
aggressive behavior along with panhandling said capt jim 
deschane commander of the citys west precinct which includes the 
pioneer square district where many confrontations took place 
before the ordinance went into effect 
some of them were pretty frightening said john gilmore 
executive vice president of the downtown seattle association i 
dont see them there anymore 
still on july 9 a man who told a woman panhandler to get a job 
was knocked unconscious by the womans boyfriend and died two days 
later authorities said james nightwolf who had a record of 
violent behavior was charged with second degree murder said 
homicide sgt joe sanford 
the ordinance which prohibits panhandlers from intimidating or 
blocking passersby carries a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail 
and a 500 fine 
minneapolis enacted an ordinance in february making it illegal 
to use offensive language grab or follow someone if it 
reasonably tends to arouse alarm or anger violations are 
punishable by up to 90 days in jail and 700 fines 
it really hasnt been as effective an ordinance as it could 
be said van white the councilman who sponsored minneapolis 
ordinance if police would just begin to arrest and take them 
off the street and get them a warning that they can go to court 
minneapolis police lt michael fisher said he could not say how 
many arrests had been made because begging is lumped with public 
drunkenness and similar offenses the ordinance made it easier to 
prosecute it didnt make it easier to enforce he said 
a similar ordinance enacted in portland ore in april 1987 
wasnt specifically aimed at begging but prohibits interfering with 
pedestrians or with people leaving and entering public or private 
property the law has been used to arrest antiabortion protesters 
as well as street people 
that particular ordinance has been a failure as far as doing 
what i expected it to do said lou wachsmuth owner of dan amp 
louis oyster bar in downtown portland the panhandlers have no 
fear of the police i tell them to leave and they tell me to go 
jump in the lake 
portland police capt roberta webber acknowledged that the 
ordinance has been used sparingly the problem is that we have to 
see an offense occurring most people who are harassed dont 
report it she said 
the city commission in tulsa okla approved an ordinance july 
15 based on seattles that makes it a violation to repeatedly beg 
more than once an hour for money or to obstruct a pedestrians 
passage while begging violators can be fined 100 
seattle police made 121 arrests under its law in the first half 
of this year but deschane said the threat of arrest has been most 
important for officers 
they can simply warn people which works remarkably well he 
said 
aggressive panhandling which was the most frequent complaint in 
the precinct last summer has dropped below onthestreet narcotics 
dealing and public drinking this summer deschane said 
bill hobson director of the downtown emergency services center 
said official concern is overblown in five years working downtown 
he said he never witnessed such panhandling 
it seems to me most of it is done in an almost polite 
ingratiating fashion he said adding many of downtowns beggars 
are impaired by mental illness and alcoholism 
a municipal court judge in may ruled that seattles ordinance 
was unconstitutionally vague but deschane said other municipal 
judges have not embraced that view until a higher court rules he 
said were still enforcing the law 
gilmore said the business association is trying to persuade 
those who give to beggars to donate instead to shelters serving the 
homeless in new york where there is no ordinance against begging 
mayor edward i koch made a similar suggestion last week 
the seattle association publishes a brochure that gives this 
advice give a hand not a handout

black and hispanic republicans had kind words 
for president reagans minority hiring record but grumbled about 
the opening today of a national convention overwhelmingly dominated 
by white men 
what we have to do is start making ourselves known at the 
local level said george smith a black delegate from san diego 
hopefully four years from now the dismal small number will be 
increased 
i dont want anyone taking me for granted he said 
more than 1000 delegates and activists gathered on the 
outskirts of the sweltering convention city sunday night for an 
eveninglong tribute to reagans role in naming minority group 
members to his administration 
they also gave him credit for boosting the economy which they 
called the best possible program for the poor 
youve got a tremendous record here said bill wilson a 
spokesman for the council of minority americans the group 
organizing the tribute you cant get any economic clout if you 
cant get a job 
but there was an undercurrent of unhappiness about this weeks 
convention with just over 92 percent white delegates compared to 
68 percent at last months democratic national convention roughly 
3 percent of the gop delegates are black 
its too low we all know that said clarence thomas 
chairman of the us equal employment opportunity commission and a 
black reagan administration appointee honored at the meeting the 
party has to do more than just passively sit back we want to be 
critical without being antagonistic 
the gathering was held in a sprawling corrugated metal building 
miles from the superdome where the convention kicks off today the 
building houses floats used in mardi gras parades so activists 
milled about under giant papiermache caricatures of kings and 
revelers and occasionally posed for pictures next to the more 
outrageous examples 
at one point activists argued that republicans can lure more 
black voters while the strains of dixie wafted from the 
bandstand the song which expresses nostalgia for the old south 
is considered offensive to some blacks 
neighbors in the heavily black section of the city looked on 
curiously from across the street the republican convention city is 
551 percent black 
 
there has been criticism over the past week about the tiny 
minority population to be seated in the superdome today 
alan keyes a senate candidate in maryland who is black said 
republicans are too leery of newcomers regardless of race 
i think there is a problem with the representational structure 
of the party he said 
keyes was in an earlier flap with convention organizers that 
underscored the occasionally tense relations between the gop and 
minorities he is scheduled to address the convention wednesday 
and publicly complained that organizers wanted him to emphasize his 
race in the speech 
another criticism of gop organizers came earlier in the day from 
john rondeno a new orleans financial planner running a reception 
center for delegates favoring vanquished presidential candidate pat 
robertson 
i think the republican party right now is limited said 
rondeno unfortunately the republican party has been the party 
of keep it small and keep it all blacks in the republican party 
were totally excluded from this convention 
most attending sunday nights dinner and reception however 
preferred to stress the potential gain for both minorities and 
republicans in a stronger relationship but they made it clear that 
the partys establishment must extend a hand in welcome 
thats what the republican party has to do open up its 
doors said californian smith the party has to have more 
blacks at all levels at all echelons 
this is designed to let the convention know there are 
minorities who do support the ticket said lawrence king an 
omaha neb businessman who organized the group 
king shrugged off questions about the number of blacks and other 
minorities at the convention 
i think thats basically the way things are he said 
there are not a lot of black republicans

here is a transcript of president reagans 
remarks sunday at a welcoming rally on the eve of the republican 
national convention 
thank you 
its great to be in new orleans 
you know i always feel at home here in louisiana because you 
know im the fellow that talked tom jefferson into buying it 
im really looking forward to tomorrow night in the superdome 
its going to prove something ive always suspected that when i 
finally got to the home of the saints it would be filled with 
republicans 
i can understand the opposition rejecting new orleans as their 
convention city though they really would have had trouble 
readjusting here after all they think the sugar bowl is located 
in washington and is known as the united states treasury 
but i can guarantee one site here would have made them feel at 
home we republicans love our bandwagon but all that other partys 
got is a streetcar named desire 
this may surprise you but today i want to point out 
similarities between myself and both of the nominees at the top of 
the other ticket 
you see in one way im just like their vice presidential 
nominee neither one of us shares the political views of their 
presidential nominee 
well come to think of it i do have one thing in common with 
the fella at the top of their ticket come this january neither 
one of us will be holding a federal office

but i confess to all of you i did miss that other convention 
this summer i did read though all about it those great issues 
and ideas and ive got to admit i found them pretty interesting 
when i first heard them back some years ago 
but believe me i know better than to even mention their 
platform in a city that takes such pride in its cuisine its 
cooking who would dare discuss in front of the proud people of new 
orleans anything so rehashed so reheated and so often rejected 
but ladies and gentlemen the truth is that platform was one of 
the most artful dodges in american political history it was an 
outright refusal by the liberal leadership of the other party to 
level with the american to deal with the issues to tell the 
american people especially independents and rankandfile 
democrats what the liberal leadership really has in store for us 
should they be victorious 
and they gave us one huge glaring clue to all that when they 
said at the atlanta convention this was a campaign about 
competence not ideology 
now lets be honest if they really were a campaign about 
competence if they were really a battle of the resumes i just 
happen to think that the former captain of the yale foot baseball 
team the youngest flier in the navy with 58 combat missions the 
former texas wildcatter who turned down a soft job on wall street 
to make his own way the former member of the house of 
representatives from texas the former republican national chairman 
hang on theres more the former ambassador to the united 
nations the former de factor ambassador in china the director of 
central intelligence and the current vice president of the united 
states whos handed every tough issue from deregulation to drugs 
to terrorism frankly i think the fellow with that resume has it 
all 
so crowd chants george bushs name youre right thats 
his name 
so why did they say it well you see when they came right out 
at that convention and said this is a campaign not about ideology 
but about competence they were really telegraphing their greatest 
weakness the very thing that worries them and their advisers most 
to every state in the union to every voter in america and thats 
their liberal record and that of the liberal leadership of their 
party in congress

they know what they intend to do once in office but they dont 
want the american people to find out until after the election 
and thats where we come in you and me 
we republicans know the truth that convention in atlanta was 
the biggest masquerade since last years mardi gras here in new 
orleans 
and so were here this week for one purpose to get our message 
to the american people to prove to the liberal leadership of the 
other party starting here and starting now their attempt to hide 
their stand on the issues isnt going to work 
the masquerade is over the stealth candidacy has to to come 
out from cover its time to talk issues to use the dreaded l 
word to say the policies of our opposition and the congressional 
leadership of his party are liberal liberal liberal 
the choice before the american people this year is just as clear 
as it was in 1980 and 1984 a choice a choice between on the one 
hand the policies of limited government economic growth a strong 
defense and a firm foreign policy and on the other hand policies 
of tax and spend economic stagnation international weakness and 
accommodation and always always always blame america first 
yes the choice this year is between the policies of liberalism 
or the policies of americas political mainstream

but you and i understand that just having republicans know all 
this isnt good enough our great victories of 1980 and 84 were 
based on millions of independents and rank and file democrats who 
came our way their votes especially those of traditional 
democrats is the key battleground 
and here we have an advantage because on economic social and 
foreign policy issues those conservativeminded democrats agree 
with us 
and you know you know some people and ive been a little 
flattered by this refer to this group as reagan democrats well 
well if its true that i have an in with those democrats 
heres what i want to say to them today and what i hope youll say 
to them when you get back home youre right to feel 
uncomfortable about the leadership of the party you and i once 
pledged loyalty to a party that once stood for the broad interests 
of americas working men and women has become a party fixated on 
the narrow agenda of the liberal elites and special interest 
groups the power of liberal pressure groups in the party has grown 
so great that the rest of their candidates this year the ones who 
voted for strong defense or tax cuts didnt even dare to get into 
the primaries 
yes i would say to rankandfile democrats a onceproud 
party of hope and affirmation has become dominated at the top by 
strident liberalism and negativism the party of yes has become 
the party of no no to holding the line on taxes no to 
spending cuts no to the lineitem veto no to the 
balancedbudget amendment no to the death penalty no to 
toughminded judges no to enterprise zones no to the school 
prayer amendment no to the right to life no to adequate 
defense spending no to a strategic defense system that protects 
america from nuclear missiles central america no to help those 
for fighting for keep central america safe from communism no 
to liberating grenada no to a policy in the persian gulf thats 
helped ending war in that region no to a negotiating stance that 
has brought us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history 
no to the foreign policy of strength and purpose that has told 
the truth about communism and helped bring the first signs of 
change to the soviet union in seven decades 
and i would also say to those rankandfile democrats in all 
these ways the liberal leadership of your party has been saying 
no to you and now its time for you to start saying no to 
them and the best crowd chanting just say no all right 
the best way to do that is by saying yes to george bush and 
yes to a new congress a congress that will work with the new 
president not against him a republican congress 
my fellow republicans this is the message we must carry to 
america this week and beyond for too long the control of the 
congress has been in the hands of the liberal leadership so let us 
say to conservative democrats and independents dont cancel out 
your vote for george bush by voting for a senator or representative 
who will go along with the liberal leadership of the democratic 
party and fight all the good the new president will try to do

but even beyond that my fellow conservatives beyond 
identifying our sharp differences on the issues and exposing the 
oppositions attempt to hide its liberalism there is something 
else we have to do as time has gone by the memory of the economic 
and foreign policy nightmares that we faced when we took office has 
faded and so we have to remind the american people of the record 
of how far we have come 
now you can be sure the opposition party isnt going to help us 
here theyre even trying to pretend those economic and foreign 
policy nightmares they gave us never happened one political 
commentator noticed this at their recent convention and believe 
me i just dont think i can improve on this paragraph let me read 
to you what mark helprin said and remember this is from him now 
not me because you know i might be accused of being biased 
laughter after eight years of ronald reagan a dozen new or 
incipient democracies in south america the philippines and south 
korea after russian or proxy withdrawal in process in afghanistan 
angola and cambodia the winding down of the iraniraq war 
halfadozen treaties and summits with a marvelously chastened 
soviet union after the longest peacetime economic expansion in 
american history record employment and a twopoint drop in the 
unemployment rate a significant drop in the crime rate a 12point 
drop in the prime rate and a 10point drop in the rate of 
inflation not to mention tax reform and an economy that has 
succeeded in making the stock market crash almost inconsequential 
the democrats trotted out jimmy carter to say i told you so 
end quote and you know something when i saw that happen in 
atlanta forgive me but i couldnt help but think there he goes 
again 
and you know we didnt just see at that convention the desire 
to forget about the record of chaos their policies gave america in 
the seventies we also heard them openly saying theyre going to 
steal our words and slogans words like community family 
values and even more amazing after eight years of prophesying 
gloom and predicting doom every night on the evening news they now 
want to be and are you ready for this optimistic and hopeful 
you know that reminds me of a little story its about mark 
twain one dark day mark twain went through shirt after shirt after 
shirt and just couldnt get one with all the buttons on it and 
finally losing his patience he flew into a rage and then used a 
string of some very choice words and then as the story is told 
when he was through he turned and was startled to see his wife 
standing in the doorway carefully slowly and without a trace of 
emotion she repeated every naughty word just uttered by her 
husband that took several minutes and when she was through she 
stood impassive in silence hoping her display would shame twain 
instead there was a twinkle in his eye he said my dear you 
have the words you dont have the music 
well thats true about the socalled leaders of the other 
party they can try and adopt our words but as long as we 
republicans get out there and give the american people the music 
there isnt a chance theyll get away with it 
so thats the job ahead of us and you tell me when the 
liberals try to tell the american people they wont raise taxes but 
fail to mention the new spending programs theyve promised every 
liberal special interest group in washington are we going to stand 
by and let them get away with it crowd yells no 
when the liberal leadership tries to portray themselves as the 
newly ordained champions of law and order but forgets to mention 
theyve given a virtual veto power over the supreme court 
appointments to fellow liberals like the civil liberties union 
crowd boos im with you are we going to stand by and let them 
get away with it crowd yells no 
when the liberal leadership tries to tell the american people 
that theyre the party of peace but forgets to admit they 
jeopardized the chance for peace and tried to tie my hands in arms 
negotiations by favoring a nuclear freeze cutting defense and 
gutting sdi are we going to let them get away with it crowd 
yells no 
i thought you might object you know when they start using our 
words and slogans and then try to tell us thats how theyre going 
to make the american people vote for them in november it reminds 
me of that little kid at school who the day after getting his 
reports card went back to school and said teacher i thought 
somebody should warn you my dad says that unless my math grades go 
up somebodys going to get a whipping you know what theyre 
right about one thing the american people just like that young 
fellows dad really are in a mood to settle some important 
questions this november and it wont be president bush and a new 
republican congress but those liberals from the other party that 
the american people take out behind the barn 
so ladies and gentlemen we have to get our word out about our 
own great record but one other thing too nobody votes for you 
just to say thank you americans can be appreciative about the past 
but believe me americans vote for a vision of the future

so we must talk to america about her future we conservatives 
must go to the american people and tell them even 68 months of 
economic growth and 17andahalf million new jobs isnt good 
enough for us we want more more growth more opportunity more 
jobs crowd chants more right 
and we intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right 
through the 90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the 
federal government can never again spend and tax the american 
people into another economic nightmare well do it by passing the 
lineitem veto the balancedbudget amendment and limits on 
congressional taxing power 
so too we never want to see the day when the supreme court is 
more interested in criminal rights than in the rights of the victim 
and of society itself you know the next president may have the 
opportunity to appoint three and possibly four new justices shortly 
after taking office we want to tell the american people what it 
will mean for their future if its george bush making those 
appointments 
and finally finally there is this one last issue yes more 
important than even all the other crucial matters ive discussed 
with you today ladies and gentlemen when we were together in 
detroit in 1980 and dallas in 1984 i wonder how many of us could 
really have believed then that so many of our fondest hopes and 
dreams for america would come true and of all those things that 
have happened how many of us could have imagined eight or even 
four years ago that one day i would have the opportunity to stand 
as i did a few months ago there in the lenin hills at a podium at 
moscow state university and tell the young people of russia about 
the wonder and glory of human freedom 
and here is the here is the crux the heart of the matter 
with the beginnings of change weve seen in the eastern bloc and 
with the developments of concepts like sdi that destroy weapons 
not people it is just possible just possible that we have a 
chance now to end the two great nightmares of this century and give 
our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear 
terror 
my fellow republicans we have proved that what works in foreign 
policy is exactly the opposite of the policies of our opposition 
we have demonstrated time and again that plain talk a strong 
defense and tough diplomacy bring peace 
what a great moment we have before us and oh how future 
generations will dishonor us if now in a moment of sudden folly 
we throw it all away and this is what is now at stake we must 
hold to this moment of hope and i tell you with every ounce of 
energy and every fiber of my being only electing george bush 
president of the united states can accomplish that 
so so let us go forth this week to tell the american people 
whats really at stake the fate of generations to come the hopes 
of peace and freedom for our children for all the children of the 
world 
dont let anyone tell you this is just another campaign dont 
let anyone tell you that were just good administrators out to 
renew our management contract instead remember this this isnt a 
campaign its a crusade a crusade for americas future and this 
too we arent just good conservative managers we are the keepers 
of the flame the protectors of the dream the american dream that 
someday freedom will be the blessing and the birthright of every 
people in every nation across gods greening earth 
this is a dream worth protecting and one believe me that needs 
protecting protection from those who would squander it away with 
special interest spending for those who would tax the american 
people into servitude those who would make leniency not justice 
the hallmark of our courtrooms and those who would risk a soviet 
base camp in central america those who would cut defense or end 
sdi or return us to weakness and accommodation abroad 
no my fellow republicans this is not the future our fellow 
americans want 
so let us go to the american people let us tell them of our 
vision of the future we offer a future of economic growth and 
opportunity and democratic revolution and peace among nations and 
let us remind them too of americas destiny of our great calling 
as a people 
and let us take them to a place where they can see with us that 
hilltop just now being glimpsed through the dark but dispersing 
clouds of 20th century tragedy let us help them look from there 
upon that shining city we have seen and labored for and loved so 
long a city aglow with the light of human freedom a light that 
someday will cast its glow on every dark corner of the world and on 
every age and generation to come 
my fellow republicans america needs the strength the vision 
and the true grit of george bush and almost and after almost 
halfacentury of democratic congresses america needs a republican 
congress and you and i are going to give her both lets do this 
for america 
thank you and god bless you all

they were warned about its dangers psychologists say 
were looking at this as an approach to prevention of 
problem drinking said researcher renelle massey of the university 
of south florida at tampa 
study results support a theory that one reason people drink is 
because they think it will make them funny brave more sociable 
sexier more assertive or better in some other way she said 
levels of such expectancies have been linked to alcohol 
consumption in previous studies she said in an interview sunday at 
the american psychological associations annual meeting 
her study done with mark goldman of the university included 
female college students who said they drank moderately 
after the students recorded their normal alcohol consumption for 
three weeks 25 were assigned to a program to lower their alcohol 
expectancies 25 others to a more traditional program that focused 
on dangers of excessive drinking and 27 to receive no training at 
all 
for one activity in the expectancies program students of legal 
age were given either an alcoholic beverage or a placebo but they 
were not told which afterward the group played charades 
then those students and the underage members of the group were 
asked to guess who had gotten alcohol on the basis of their 
performance 
everybody made mistakes massey said 
their inaccuracy led to a discussion of how people have been led 
to believe through television advertising and everyday 
conversation that alcohol can make people sexy funny and so on 
participants also were asked to look for songs advertisements 
and other places where they may be told alcohol is going to do 
good things for you she said 
the impact on their drinking habits a month after the program 
shows that examining expectancies and demonstrating how misleading 
they are is a lot more potent than just telling people about the 
potential hazards of excessive drinking massey said 
to analyze the effect of the experimental and traditional 
programs researchers divided the students into 36 lowlevel and 41 
highlevel drinkers depending on whether they had drunk fewer or 
more than eight drinks per week before the training 
the expectancies training made both groups cut back 
significantly highlevel drinkers went from an average of 97 
drinks a week to 61 while lowlevel students dropped from 55 
drinks to four 
in contrast the traditional program affected only the lowlevel 
drinkers significantly reducing their consumption from 64 to 
three drinks a week highlevel drinkers changed only from 109 
drinks to 94 drinks weekly 
future programs may be able to target particular expectancies 
and provide an alternative to alcohol massey said for example 
people who think alcohol would make them more social could be 
taught social skills like how to meet people she said 
peter finn assistant professor of psychology at indiana 
university and an alcohol researcher said masseys experiment was 
well done and the results make sense 
but such research must look at changes in other expectancies 
besides just positive ones he said 
people also hold notions that alcohol can be bad for their 
health and their selfcontrol and those ideas also play a role in 
how much people drink and whether drinking becomes a problem he 
said

for 298 and ryans irish pub poured republican cocktails 
strong drink at conservative prices busch on tap 
new orleans costumed itself in gop finery for conventioneers 
wandering its sultry streets it stuffed its shop windows with 
elephants and its visitors with oysters and like a mardi gras 
reveler it kept a part of itself under wraps 
i think they mightve put some of the bums in jail said 
kathy hastings a waitress at the original old absinthe house on 
bourbon street where the likes of mark twain and andrew jackson 
once bellied up to the bar i havent seen the usual prostitutes 
either 
off st charles avenue the heaps of trash longtime resident 
gary esolen described as an urban horror had disappeared more 
dramatic to french quarter gallery owner joseph sutton was a 
transformed railroad overpass between the airport and downtown new 
orleans 
for 364 days a year its got the most disgusting graffiti 
youve ever seen sutton said now they have it painted pastel 
colors peach lavender and aqua suddenly it is to die its 
under 24hour guard to make sure it stays that way 
the city has never looked better added sutton whod even 
heard that mint was being dumped into city sewer lines to further 
sweeten things up for the visitors i dont know if its true 
but it does show the extent to which we feel the eyes of the world 
on new orleans 
on bourbon street the carousing capital of the city waitress 
hastings thought the party was getting off to a slow start shed 
been looking forward to the republicans arrival for weeks now 
that theyre here theyre turning out to be cheap 
taxi driver bob kendall on the other hand had hung a stuffed 
elephant from his rear view mirror in tribute to some excellent 
tipping 
and sutton a kennedy democrat was keeping his bases 
covered with a 6800 gold and ivory elephant prominently 
displayed in the front window of his shop 
it was there in the heart of the french quarter that the 
republicans congregated sampling the rich gumbo of cultures 
french spanish caribbean italian they took in the jazz 
musicians the voodoo dolls and the crabs 
but esolen says the more subtle qualities of the quarter must be 
appreciated 
as you wander the streets theres a sense of scale that is 
such that a human being is welcome said esolen you can 
imagine yourself in every nook and cranny in the light of a 
balcony window the glimpse of a patio 
at the same time much of its architecture looks inward the 
french quarter is a place of secrets

there are no rats empty crack vials or 
gang members outside at elyse sanchez apartment but the former 
new york welfare mother whos on a graduate fellowship at the 
university of iowa still locks her door 
ms sanchez who is working on her phd and has her sights on a 
career in academia jokes about her new suburban life here 
i have to contend with a whole new set of problems like 
getting grass stains out of my laundry said ms sanchez 35 
but three years ago while living in the bronx in a ratinfested 
apartment building frequented by drug users and gangs members her 
problems were much bigger 
her husband left leaving her to raise their four children on 
950 a month in welfare payments and food stamps 
ms sanchez who dropped out of new yorks hunter college after 
one year when she was 17 decided on an impulse to return to 
college 
she enrolled at lehman college relying on her oldest daughter 
rochelle now 17 to watch the three other children while she took 
classes and studied at night 
it was horrible it was terrifying for me to leave them in 
that apartment she said there were leaks from the ceiling 
the second bathroom had collapsed we had the usual assortment of 
rats mice and roaches 
it was just ugly and dirty and horrible mrs sanchez said 
in her living room in iowa city strewn with boxes of unpacked 
books all the time it was just fear shaking fear 
her other children damian 11 hope 10 and kim 9 were 
kept indoors while she went to classes 
they looked imprisoned pale and sickly ms sanchez said 
i at least had the advantage of being in school having my nose 
in a book 
at lehman she studied english and the humanities in the adult 
degree program carrying up to 52 credits a year 
she earned straight as graduating phi beta kappa in june 
her accomplishment attracted national attention which she found 
irritating 
they implied that well this is it poor bronx mother on 
welfare makes good end of story the way i look at it that was 
just the first act she said 
fellowship offers for a graduate degree poured in and ms 
sanchez knew she didnt want to stay in new york 
kim would point out these little plastic things shed see on 
the porch and say see mommy thats a crack vial when an 
9yearold knows what a crack vial is its time to get out she 
said 
after considering offers from most of the schools in the big 
10 ms sanchez accepted iowas where she will pursue a phd in 
english literature 
i knew of iowas reputation because of its writers workshop 
which is world famous she said ive always wanted to be a 
creative writer 
she still marvels at the direction her life has taken 
i never thought id get to graduate school ms sanchez 
said it never occurred to me that i could go to graduate school 
because i never thought i could support myself and my children 
but people kept encouraging me at lehman to try out they said 
i was just born to be a teacher 
in addition to a 17000 salary stipend and tuition waiver 
included with the teaching fellowship iowa agreed to waive the 
tuition for rochelle who has enrolled as a freshman 
despite her achievements ms sanchez is afraid 
im scared here because i was a big fish in a little pond at 
lehman she said im a little scared because i want to see 
what the competition is going to be like 
what frightens me is not living up to the promise the english 
department sees in me ms sanchez said i want to do well as 
much for them as for myself

striking submarine builders at electric 
boat could torpedo their futures if they dont acknowledge the 
increasing competitive marketplace and tightening military budget 
analysts say 
despite a low unemployment rate and shortage of skilled workers 
conditions that should favor the union defense industry analysts 
say electric boat holds the upper hand in the 6weekold strike by 
the 10000member metal trades council 
the union struck over electric boats demand that employees 
accept lumpsum bonuses instead of wage increases in a threeyear 
contract 
the company says it needs to bring down labor costs to become 
more competitive with its virginia rival newport news shipbuilding 
and dry dock co the union said the offer doesnt take into account 
connecticuts higher cost of living 
in only the second negotiating session since the strike began 
the company thursday offered bonuses of 5 percent and 4 percent in 
the first two years and a 3 percent wage increase in the third 
year in addition to a 600 bonus 
the union which said the offer was not even worth putting to a 
vote has asked for wage increases of 5 percent the first year and 
4 percent the final two years of the contract 
the company said that as of friday 668 workers had crossed 
picket lines during a fivemonth strike in 1975 only 150 workers 
were reported to have done so 
electric boats efforts to hire replacement workers which have 
included placing fullpage ads in newspapers have produced meager 
results only 20 people have signed up about the number of workers 
the sub builder loses each week through attrition 
electric boat could hurt itself more by acceding to the unions 
demands and settling quickly than by holding out despite the low 
jobless rate and shortage of skilled workers analysts say 
electric boat a division of general dynamics has lost six 
attack submarine contracts in the last two years to newport news 
electric boat was awarded only one of three this year newport news 
had bid on only two 
in all electric boat has contracts for seven trident subs and 
nine attack subs the company is the only builder of the trident 
firstclass mechanics a job classification covering more than 
85 percent of electric boats sub builders earn 1202 an hour 
the same workers at newport news earn 124 less an hour in wages 
and benefits according to electric boat 
the navy is going to the lowest bidder and that has 
predominantly been newport news i dont know what the union 
expects the navy to do said paul nisbet analyst for 
prudentialbache securities 
while electric boat is making money on the production of trident 
submarines it has not been making money on attack subs for some 
time which is a further reason for them to hold out longer 
nisbet said 
i dont think the union has much bargaining strength said 
gary reich an analyst at shearson lehman brothers 
also working in the companys favor is the tightening military 
budget said phil friedman of drexel burnham lambert 
electric boat has reassigned about 1800 salaried workers to 
jobs performed by strikers it has also shifted work to yards in 
quonset point ri where all sub construction begins and in 
charleston sc 
while certain vendors and small groceries around the shipyard 
here have suffered the heavy tourist trade has kept business brisk 
elsewhere said audrey golub head of the regional chamber of 
commerce 
no one has said to me yet god the strike is really 
hurting if the strike continues into the fall and winter then we 
would begin to be able to see an impact she said

about 3600 republicans went to the zoo to 
mix it up with ellie mae the very important pachyderm 
its a wonderful elephant obviously republican said joan 
milke flores a california delegate and los angeles city 
councilwoman 
in a city that never stops partying todays events include a 
fete for republican lawmakers at the bourbon street home of a 
democratic congresswoman and a salute to diehard delegates still 
pledged to pat robertson for president 
ellie mae an orphaned african elephant got gushing attention 
at the threehour elephant romp welcome a lavish affair for which 
corporations contributed 150000 to foot the bill 
all this attention has kind of spoiled her said handler 
james holston of ellie mae shes just a 3yearold baby but 
she weighs 1200 pounds he said 
revelers beat steamy heat in four airconditioned zoo tents 
where they twostepped to cajun music and traded quips with paul 
prudhomme the popular new orleans chef 
well throw them a helluva party as long as theyre paying 
prudhomme said as he hacked chunks of butter for chicken etoufee 
max richter jaunty in rainbowcolored suspenders and a white 
cap twirled his wife mel to encourage others to get on the 
woodenplank dance floors this is a waltz and we just did a 
twostep easy dances he said 
pat obriens which claims to dispense more alcohol than any 
bar in the world prepared 2000 potent hurricanes in 15ounce 
paper cups the usual dose is 28 ounces and the hardy guzzler keeps 
the glass this is the official drink and we want the gop to try 
it said spokesman lou reynolds 
the mission of the elephant romp welcome was to provide a 
threeweek dose of new orleans in three hours said city councilman 
mike early a democrat

is an art it really is a science early said 
rep lindy boggs dla planned to open her 193yearold french 
quarter home today for gop senators and members of congress 
theyre not overrunning my house theyre most cordially 
invited she said with a laugh 
i have a great spirit of being partisan for the city of new 
orleans this is a real lift in spirits and the economy as well 
mrs boggs said 
at sundays jazz brunches palates were tickled by seafood and 
spicy recipes but alaska offered offbeat fare like moose and 
reindeer sausage at its 20000plus feast 
alaska gop chairman jim crawford said he liked his native fare 
better than local delights but i dont think theres a better 
party town in the united states than new orleans

left for sylvester stallone

toys to stallones home saturday although he didnt see the star

graciously received than in a previous visit to a stallone 
residence during that trip he was doused with water 
on saturday rubins wife marissa two friends reporters and 
some camera crews watched as he delivered the 3foot pizza to 
stallones home and presented the pizza to a housekeeper 
to accommodate a tv crew that arrived after the presentation 
rubin got the pizza back from stallones housekeepers so he could 
reenact the presentation at one point the unwieldy pizza slipped 
onto the driveway 
after his first bite in 63 days rubin said he was looking 
forward to watching movies with popcorn again

thirtyfive salvadorans spent five 
hours inside a sweltering boxcar with almost no ventilation and 
would likely have died had they not been discovered authorities 
said 
it was well over 100 degrees outside when we found them 
us border patrol agent ramiro gonzalez said of the illegal aliens 
found sunday morning it was probably another 20 to 30 degrees 
hotter inside the car 
officials said the aliens could have suffered the same fate as 
18 found dead last summer inside a locked boxcar near the west 
texas town of sierra blanca about 65 miles southeast of el paso 
when we opened the car up the people were pale and real 
sweaty and then we transported them to the border patrol station 
in kingsville and gave them water and we fed them gonzalez said 
the 35 were being held sunday night along with a honduran man 
and 19 mexicans who were found outside the locked boxcar gonzalez 
said 
the salvadorans including two 14yearold boys had been locked 
inside since boarding the houstonbound freight train in 
brownsville at 5 am 
those found inside the boxcar said the door was to have been 
kept open to allow ventilation but someone closed and locked it at 
brownsville gonzalez said 
in july 1987 only one of 19 aliens survived after more than 12 
hours inside a boxcar where the temperature reached 130 degrees 
authorities said the aliens had been locked inside the car by a 
smuggler who tossed in railroad spikes for the aliens to chip 
through the airtight cars heavy wooden floor 
on march 21 border patrol agents pulled 46 dehydrated aliens 
from a sealed boxcar during a sweep of northbound traffic 6 miles 
north of harlingen 
on sunday border patrol agents stationed at harlingen reported 
the aliens aboard the train said cruz mcguire of the border patrol 
in kingsville 
we followed the train from sarita to kingsville and saw a 
number of the aliens riding on gondolas and some riding on grain 
hoppers mcguire said 
officials checked the train boxcar by boxcar when it arrived at 
the kingsville freight yard the aliens were discovered by an agent 
who heard voices inside a car with fiberglass insulation gonzalez 
said 
the aliens told authorities a man in brownsville offered to get 
them to houston for 300 to 600 gonzalez said 
officials said the aliens did not know the smugglers name 
some of the aliens told the agents they had contacted relatives 
who had sent them money for transportation to california

in one of the harshest official condemnations to 
date of a russian ultranationalist group an editorial in izvestia 
accused pamyat of fomenting ethnic strife and demanded a crackdown 
on its leningrad chapter 
pamyat which has branches in many soviet cities has been 
holding outdoor rallies every thursday in leningrad and official 
and unofficial sources say local authorities have done little to 
stop them 
the editorial in saturdays editions of the government newspaper 
called for a crackdown on pamyat saying it opposes mikhail s 
gorbachevs wideranging reform program 
the paper also published a quarterpage letter under the 
headline unclean play on clean feelings from a group of 
leningrad scholars who called pamyat a deadly threat to our 
future 
this month the weekly moscow news published letters from 
soviets blasting pamyat as racist and fascist one quoted a speaker 
at a july 7 rally as demanding deportation of jews and other 
alien races 
the izvestia editorial and letter took the condemnation one step 
further calling for a legal crackdown against pamyat in leningrad 
in the letter 59 staff members of the leningrad branch of the 
institute of oriental studies appealed to the countrys prosecutor 
to break up the group because it violates an article of the soviet 
constitution forbidding propaganda of ethnic and racist strife 
pamyat distorts the history of our country the scholars 
wrote it often uses peoples lack of information in matters of 
history and speculates on their natural and nobel feeling of love 
of their homeland and on their wish to make a contribution to the 
restoration of monuments of russian culture and to nature 
conservation 
the scholars said the group advocates militant nationalism and 
antisemitism 
the izvestia editorial noted that pamyat often complains about a 
jewish predominance in soviet science and culture to provoke 
people 
the result the editors said is damage to gorbachevs program 
of perestroika the soviet leaders restructuring program embraces 
social economic and cultural reforms 
pamyat is trying to separate out peoples national 
differences to sow the seed of destructive hostility and has come 
to be directed against and working against perestroika the 
newspaper said 
the scholars in their letter complained that communist party 
and government authorities in leningrad and the local press had 
taken a passive attitude toward the group 
the editors of izvestia a centrally controlled newspaper 
apparently felt they had to step in saying they had received many 
letters protesting pamyats activities in leningrad 
the editors quoted government officials in leningrad as saying 
party officials pressured them into granting pamyat permission to 
hold the rallies but that the order was reversed on wednesday 
izvestia said pamyat ignored the ban and held a rally the next 
day 
abraham demin a jewish activist in leningrad who opposes 
pamyat told the associated press that police detained and beat him 
after he showed up at the rally earlier last week another 
leningrad dissident was arrested for trying to unfurl antipamyat 
posters at an aug 4 pamyat rally

african national congress leader is responding well to treatment 
for a lung ailment and his condition is very satisfactory a 
doctor said today 
dr jgl strauss medical superintendent at tygerberg 
hospital said mandelas left lung was inflamed but that there was 
no evidence of malignancy 
he said that unless there was a change in condition no further 
bulletins would be issued on mandela 70 who was transferred from 
pollsmoor prison to the hospital on friday 
strauss said mandelas windpipe and lung area had been examined 
and doctors had performed a biopsy and drainage operation 
mandelas wife winnie and youngest daughter zindzi flew from 
johannesburg to see him saturday and returned without making any 
public comment 
mandela who has been in prison since 1962 is serving a life 
term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the whiteled 
government 
he is widely considered the paramount leader of south africas 
black majority and his hospitalization has prompted antiapartheid 
groups to renew calls for his release 
on sunday health minister willie van niekerk said mandela was 
receiving the best possible treatment and described tygerbergs 
lung unit as comparable to the worlds best

governor losing a reelection bid in 1978 and returning to office 
in 1983

elmo r zumwalt iii who died of 
cancer two decades after his father ordered use of agent orange in 
vietnam once swam through water doused with the defoliant to 
collect weapons from viet cong boats 
he won over his crew but that swim may have marked the 
beginning of his last battle with the cancer that ended his life 
saturday at age 42 
retired adm elmo r zumwalt jr the american naval commander 
in vietnam who ordered the spraying of the defoliant then thought 
to be harmless said his sons death will only push him to work 
harder to force the government to compensate veterans who suffered 
from agent oranges effects 
there are still many hundreds of veterans who do need help 
zumwalt said the day his son died i believe very strongly now 
that the evidence is clear that the agent orange is responsible for 
the problems many veterans are having 
his son was diagnosed in 1983 as having nonhodgkins lymphoma 
two years later doctors found he had lymphoma hodgkins disease 
his son elmo russell zumwalt iv suffers from a congenital 
dysfunction that confuses his physical senses 
the zumwalts chronicled their battle with cancer in 1986 with 
the book my father my son which they wrote with author john 
pekkanen the book was made into a television movie in may 
zumwalt said his son was strong until the end even joking and 
teasing with relatives during friday evening he died in his sleep 
saturday morning 
i do not second guess the decisions dad made in vietnam nor 
do i doubt for a minute that the saving of human life was always 
his first priority in his conduct of the war the younger zumwalt 
once said i have the greatest love and admiration for him as a 
man and the deepest respect for him as a military leader 
zumwalt was commanding a swift boat along the rivers of the ca 
mau peninsula when his father the youngest man ever to serve as 
chief of naval operations ordered the spraying of agent orange to 
save servicemen from being killed by enemy ambushes along the 
waterways 
before the spraying us forces had a 6 percent casualty rate 
each month afterward that figure dropped to less than 1 percent 
since the war the elder zumwalt and his son had pushed for 
government assistance to veterans affected by agent orange 
on june 30 the us supreme court removed the last legal 
obstacle to a 180 million settlement between vietnam veterans and 
the manufacturers of agent orange the justices let stand rulings 
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged a 
1984 settlement

a riot at the overcrowded 144yearold 
jail here left eight people injured and much of the institution 
destroyed while three prisoners escaped during a revolt at a 
prison 15 miles away authorities said 
two of the escapees were at large today 
inmates at the essex county jail and house of correction 
aggravated by sundays heat and upset about overcrowding and food 
quality twice set fire to the granite jail the second blaze 
destroyed an entire wing containing 36 cells about a quarter of 
the prison 
about 500 people many relatives and friends of inmates watched 
the disturbances 
they chanted feed us give us food said barbara martin 
45 who had come to visit her inmate husband the conditions in 
there are deplorable it stinks 
nearly 200 of the 250 inmates were relocated to other prisons 
around the state said jail superintendent william mageary 
late sunday inmates at the billerica house of correction set 
fire to a work shed and three inmates escaped after a scuffle with 
a guard one was recaptured quickly three inmates and at least two 
guards sustained minor injuries said middlesex county sheriff john 
mcgonigle 
billerica was one of the prisons where inmates from lawrence 
were to be transfered but those plans were dropped because of the 
disturbance there 
in lawrence a group of inmates set the first fire at about noon 
on a wooden floor in the east wing the more serious fire broke out 
in the same wing about an hour later and raged for 1 hours 
prisoners pelted firefighters and police with debris as flames 
poured through the roof during the threehour uprising 
no escapes were reported but two inmates were caught attempting 
to slip out said essex county sheriff charles reardon 
cops got hit firefighters got hit lawrence fire lt james 
campbell said they threw pipes long pipes i dont know where 
they got them from bricks bottles 
when it was over at least eight people including five inmates 
were treated at hospitals for minor injuries or smoke inhalation 
officials said 
the melee drew about 150 state and local police and riot squads 
plus 100 firefighters 
the immediate cause of the uprising wasnt known reardon said 
but he said the prison was filled to twice its capacity of 127 
prisoners 
the lawrence house of correction holds inmates convicted of 
misdemeanors with maximum terms of up to 2 years officials said 
it also serves as a jail for persons awaiting trial 
state correction commissioner michael fair said the fire 
certainly puts a tremendous strain on an already overcrowded 
system 
however plans already were under way for a new essex county 
house of correction in middleton to replace the lawrence prison 
according to state human services secretary philip johnston the 
prison in the design stage is expected to cost 30 million to 40 
million 
fair said it would be difficult to find room in the state system 
to relocate the scores of prisoners displaced by the lawrence fire 
i dont have any room fair said this is a major loss

more than 1200 refugees were allowed 
to return home from honduras after 15 us church workers 
accompanying them agreed to stay behind ending a daylong impasse 
a united nations official said 
the government which claims many refugees living in honduras 
back leftist salvadoran guerrillas had accused the church workers 
of exploiting the returning refugees for political ends 
the refugees and more than 150 vehicles held on the honduran 
side of the border since saturday night were allowed to cross the 
border sunday evening said roberto rodriquez of the un high 
commissioner for refugees 
the church workers were conscious that by not coming they 
would create no type of problems for the returning salvadorans 
he said by telephone 
rodriguez said the refugees from el salvadors nearly 9yearold 
civil war were on their way to hometowns in northern chalatenango 
province which they left in the early 1980s 
in the honduran capital of tegucigalpa a foreign ministry 
spokesman said the refugees were being escorted by officials from 
the un agency 
there was no immediate comment from the government and the 
church workers could not be reached 
the salvadorans lived in the mesa grande refugee camp 30 miles 
north of the border before leaving under an arrangement between the 
refugees the salvadoran government and the un group which is 
overseeing the repatriation 
their convoy of 36 buses and 116 trucks was halted in honduras 
about 500 yards from the border late saturday salvadoran 
authorities refused to permit 15 us church workers of the going 
home organization to accompany them 
interior minister edgar belloso funes told reporters at the 
border sunday his government welcomes with open arms the 
refugees 
but the socalled internationalists among them are using our 
brothers for strictly political ends they the foreigners are 
coming here to break our laws and i have orders from the highest 
level that they not be permitted entry he said 
amadeo lopez a returning refugee and member of the communitys 
directorate said earlier sunday that the group of 1230 refugees 
was insisting the us church workers be allowed to enter 
jose maria mendiluce the un groups central american 
director said the presence of the church workers was not 
contemplated in the accord 
louis vitale a roman catholic priest from oakland calif and 
spokesman for the going home delegation blamed the government for 
the standoff 
this is part of the salvadoran governments continuing efforts 
to obstruct the refugees return he said adding that all 
members of his delegation had visas for el salvador 
going home is an interfaith organization supporting salvadoran 
refugees 
the armed forces consider the three salvadoran refugee camps in 
honduras part of the rear guard of leftist guerrillas that have 
fought the ussupported government about 4300 refugees returned 
last year and about 15000 salvadoran refugees remain in the camps 
the majority of the 65000 people killed in the war have been 
civilians 
human rights groups blame security forces and rightist death 
squads for most of the political murders in the early 1980s such 
killings dropped off dramatically after 1983

amnesty international says witnesses 
tell it burmese troops have killed and tortured rice farmers and 
other shan tribespeople in suppressing an insurgency among burmas 
largest ethnic minority 
the report by the londonbased group received in bangkok today 
was the second documentation that amnesty says shows a consistent 
pattern of gross violations of human rights by the burmese 
military in trying to suppress minorities fighting for autonomy 
in recent days amnesty and other private foreign organizations 
have also expressed concern over mass arrests and killings of 
antigovernment demonstrators in rangoon and other parts of the 
country 
the protestors most from the burman majority group are 
demanding a restoration of democracy after 26 years of 
authoritarian rule 
the latest 25page report said shans interviewed by amnesty 
described 46 alleged extrajudicial executions and 58 alleged cases 
of torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment in burmas 
shan state 
the information gathered amnesty said also implicated soldiers 
of 10 burmese infantry units as well as intelligence and police 
personnel most of the victims were said to be ordinary villagers 
suspected of cooperating with various insurgent groups 
they ranged from a 43yearold villager bayoneted to death on 
suspicion of aiding the insurgents to four men impressed as porters 
for the army who had their skulls crushed by rifle butts for 
failing to to keep up with a moving troop column 
in may amnesty released a 71page report detailing nearly 200 
victims among the karen kachin and mon ethnic minority groups 
among whom insurgency has also been rife for several decades 
amnesty said the rangoon government apparently has not carried 
out any of the steps the organization suggested in may to prevent 
human rights abuses 
the information available to amnesty international remains 
limited by the unwillingness of the burmese government to grant 
independent human rights investigators access to the country the 
report says the shans and others interviewed sought refuge in 
thailand 
the shans who number some 42 million out of the countrys 38 
million people began armed opposition to rangoon in the late 
1950s operating in the rugged hills of eastern burma 
some of the insurgent groups are described as mere traffickers 
in opium which is grown in great quantity in shan state but the 
tribespeople also have a long tradition of seeking cultural and 
political independence from the more powerful burmans 
a number of sources in recent years have reported that the 
burmese army has forced thousands of villagers into service as 
porters for troops battling the shans and other rebels 
josef silverstein an american author of several books on burma 
said recently that about 13000 peasants were recruited as porters 
for a major offensive against kachin insurgents last year 
they were forced to walk ahead of troops in order to test for 
mines they were forced to carry munitions and supplies and if 
they refused or fell they were beaten and often killed the 
professor at rutgers university said 
amnesty cited several examples of alleged brutal mistreatment 
and killing of porters including a 30yearold villager who fell 
while climbing up a steep slope and was stabbed to death in the 
back by an enlisted man 
the captain didnt reprimand the corporal who killed him the 
captain said it was a good thing becausenow there was one fewer 
of the shan bastards another porter who said he saw the 
killing told amnesty 
despite similar reports emerging from isolationist nonaligned 
burma in recent years there has been little protest from 
governments around the world and only few official comments about 
the recent use of armed force against civilian demonstrators 
the united states last week said it deplored the shooting of 
unarmed demonstrators and urged that nonlethal means should be 
employed to deal with such demonstrations five us senators 
introduced a resolution condemning the suppression of protest 
there has been no known reaction to the alleged human rights 
abuses by japan and west germany the two major aid and loan donors 
to burma 
american officials say privately the united states has normally 
refrained from sharp criticism of the rangoon government for fear 
of jeopardizing its antinarcotics program in the country the 
united states has supplied aircraft and chemicals which the burmese 
use to destroy opium fields by aerial spraying

israeli troops shot 
and killed a palestinian in the west bank today hospital officials 
said and the army confined 650000 arabs to their gaza strip homes 
after three days of violence 
soldiers sealed off the entire gaza strip with an indefinite 
curfew barring visitors and journalists for the third time since 
the palestinian uprising began dec 8 
the move followed clashes in gaza on sunday in which the army 
said its soldiers shot and wounded 12 palestinians arab reports 
put the figure at 25 wounded 
also sunday a firebomb hurled at a car traveling to a jewish 
settlement injured six israelis including an 8monthold burned on 
the face and arms 
witnesses said soldiers went doortodoor in some areas of gaza 
city ordering residents to go out and paint over slogans on walls 
take down palestinian flags and clean up debris from demonstrations 
some slogans said strike and confrontation we will never 
kneel before the zionists and deportations and arrests will 
never scare us 
journalists were stopped by soldiers at the erez checkpoint 
leading into the gaza strip army officers said knots of protesters 
set burning tires along the road from the checkpoint to gaza city 
as a result of the curfew the 50000 arab workers from the gaza 
strip were unable to go to their jobs in israel 
arab reporters and hospital officials said jamal odeh 21 was 
shot through the heart today after nightlong demonstrations at the 
tulkarem refugee camp in the west bank where youths set up 
roadblocks and burned tires 
his death brought to 244 the number of palestinians killed in 
the 8monthold uprising against 21 years of israeli occupaiton 
four israelis have also died 
palestinians attributed the outbreak in gaza to the burning 
deaths of two arab workers near tel aviv police said jewish 
extremists may have torched a hut where three arab builders slept 
near a construction site 
no one has been arrested 
defense minister yitzhak rabin speaking on israel radio 
attributed the sudden upsurge of violence to a show of strength by 
moslem fundamentalists who had called for demonstrations to mark 
the start of the new islamic year 1409 
rabin said israeli authorities adopted a new stategy to choke 
off the violence uprooting village and neighborhood palestinian 
committees which have sought to run community affairs and 
coordinate antiisraeli activities 
he also said the army had been ordered to shoot to hit 
firebombthrowers and if one is caught to demolish his home 
without granting him right of apppeal 
palestinian leaders protested the israeli clampdown that 
confined the entire gaza population to their homes as an attempt to 
terrorize civilians 
what the israelis are doing is really inhuman and they keep 
doing it despite all the protests from all over the world it seems 
that israel translates the protests into a keep going message 
said dr hayder abdul shafi head of the red crescent red cross 
in the gaza strip 
jewish settlers called on the government to take tougher 
measures after the firebomb attack in which four israeli children 
and two adults were burned while en route to the neve dekalim 
settlement 
the army met with us and conveyed they would take a series of 
severe decisions uprooting orchards destroying houses 
deporting whoever did it said menachem beithalachmi a 
spokesman for the jewish settlement movement in the gaza strip 
with that report we were able to ask our people not to go out 
to the area themselves he said referring to the settlers 
threat to take vigilante action 
israeli officials meanwhile gave a mixed reacton to statements 
by salah khalaf the no 2 man in yasser arafats fatah faction 
he told the weekly french magazine journal du dimanche that the 
plo was considering forming a provisional government that would 
drop its demand for the elimination of the state of israel 
a foreign ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said officials would study attentively the text of the 
interview which officials expected to receive later in the day 
privately sources close to israels liberal foreign minister 
shimon peres said they welcomed the debate among palestinians 
its a positive thing when people talk politics instead of 
war said a source who demanded anonymity 
however yossi ahimier a spokesman for rightwing prime 
minister yitzhak shamir noted the firebomb attack on israeli 
civilians in gaza and said we have to watch what they do not what 
they say 
he said khalafs proposal was a tactical move and was not based 
on a sincere desire for coexistence

wanted a new king of the wild frontier 
being born on a mountaintop in tennessee helpful but not required 
walt disney studios and nbc are bringing back davy crockett and 
held an open casting call sunday to expand the search for an actor 
to fill the role played on television by fess parker in the 1950s 
william blinn the executive producer of the show that will be 
part of the magical world of disney said the search has gone 
on for more than five months and has auditioned more than 800 
people 
its a quality of strength and intelligence and a kind of 
implied humor that fess always brought to it and a kind of droll 
warmth thats hard to find blinn said 
the producer said he wasnt interested in a rambo sort of 
hero or the musclebound characters played by arnold schwarzenegger 
they dont offer humor in their portrayal nor do they offer 
to me a guy that is at ease with himself they have a great deal

a governmentrun newspaper says iran will do 
all it can to secure the freedom of british hostages in lebanon but 
is requesting in return that britain help find iranians missing 
there 
the word came in a sunday editorial in the englishlanguage 
tehran times and coincided with a visit by british diplomat david 
reddaway who said foreign ministry officials told him he will be 
able to meet this week with an englishman being held on spying 
charges 
in london a senior aide to archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie said today he is cautious about a quick release of hostages 
following talks with an iranian diplomat in london 
the tehran times editorial said undoubtedly the islamic 
republic of iran will spare no effort to press ahead with the 
release of british hostages particularly terry waite referring 
to runcies envoy 
yet what iran legitimately expects of britain is to provide 
iran with all the information possible about the fate of four 
iranian hostages believed held by christian militia under the 
influence of britain it added 
four iranians disappeared in a christiancontrolled area of 
lebanon in 1982 no group ever claimed to hold them and some 
reports have said they were killed 
waite and two other britons are among 18 foreigners believed 
held by groups affiliated with the proiranian and shiite moslem 
hezbollah or party of god in lebanon the 18 include nine 
americans 
the editorial also follows talks in britain last week between 
runcie spiritual leader of the anglican church and mohamed reza 
said mohamedi an iranian foreign ministry official 
john lyttle runcies senior assistant said in london today 
that whether iran chooses to pressure for the release of the 
british captives remains to be seen 
i dont think this is the time to talk about either assurances 
or promises lyttle said in a british broadcasting corp radio 
interview 
im optimistic that he terry waite is alive and that the 
other british hostages are alive as to whether anything is going 
to happen quickly im rather more cautious he said 
lyttle said he and the archbishop made clear to mohamedi that 
the church has a limited role as far as the hostages are concerned 
we want to make it quite plain that the church cannot be an 
alternative diplomatic channel but that its interest is a 
humanitarian one and a rather particular one we may be able to oil 
a wheel here and there but we certainly cant act as an 
alternative diplomatic channel he said 
reddaway said he met with foreign ministry officials twice on 
sunday and they told him he would be able to meet jailed englishman 
roger cooper this week he gave no other details 
cooper 52 a nephew of the late british poet and novelist 
robert graves was arrested in december 1985 and has been held in 
tehrans evin prison 
before leaving london on friday reddaway said he would speak 
with officials about the foreign hostages in lebanon 
in july an anglican bishop went to lebanon to initiate 
inquiries among christians about the fate of the four iranians 
missing in lebanon 
iran has been making conciliatory statements about relations 
with western nations since it announced july 18 it was accepting a 
un call for a ceasefire in the 8yearold iraniraq war 
the ceasefire is scheduled to take hold saturday 
last summer britain withdrew all its diplomats from iran and 
virtually severed ties after a british diplomat was detained and 
beaten in apparent reprisal for british police arresting an iranian 
envoy on shoplifting charges one iranian diplomat remains in 
london 
waite disappeared in january 1987 while trying to secure the 
release of american hostages the other two british citizens 
believed held in lebanon are journalist john mccarthy kidnapped on 
april 17 1986 and university professor brian keenan kidnapped 
april 11 1986 keenan also holds an irish passport 
britain says it also seeks word on alec collett a new 
yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him his body was never found 
the foreigner held longest is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was abducted 
march 16 1985

the police department is training police 
dogs to bark instead of bite but a civil rights activist says 
many people will never forget the news images of protesters being 
mauled in the 1960s 
unfortunately the 25yearold image of police dogs in 
birmingham still lives said the rev abraham woods pastor of 
st joseph baptist church 
sgt cameron guy said the program is part of the departments 
minimalforce arrest policy under which a suspect will be given 
every chance to surrender peacefully 
a felon breaking into a business deserves to be off the 
street but he does not need to be dogbitten said guy who 
directs the canine unit 
guy said the policy is a move to boost professionalism in the 
department 
during civil rights protests in birmingham in the 1960s newsmen 
filmed snarling police dogs biting protesters those films have 
been shown frequently since then 
woods said he has been invited to watch the department 
demonstrate its new policy 
the dogs are being trained to sprint toward the suspect and 
instead of sinking their teeth into the suspects arm veer off at 
the last moment blocking any escape attempt while barking loudly 
and baring their teeth 
guy said the dog will bite if a suspect tries to attack the 
accompanying officer or the animal

of pigolo pigolo pigolo pig in an operatic baritone

unidentified women slain in san diego county no 
longer will be cremated in order to preserve evidence for police 
investigating links between a serial killing spree here and 
washingtons green river slayings 
county coroner david stark also said his office will perform 
more extensive tests on the bodies of unidentified women that may 
be linked to the deaths of at least 10 other women in san diego 
county since 1985 
the policy was prompted by criticism last week from homicide 
detectives detectives from both states have been studying 
similarities between the two murder cases for at least 18 months 
but said no conclusive link has been made 
one body was cremated before being linked to the san diego 
county case stark said 
we will change our procedure stark said when the 
circumstances of a death clearly indicate that a homicide situation 
has occurred even though we cant establish a cause of death in 
the future we will request that the person will be buried 
in san diego unidentified bodies normally are cremated after 
three months in king county wash where the green river 
investigation is based unidentified remains are held in an office 
or buried after extensive body xrays 
unidentified remains that are buried or stored can be exhumed 
later for future examination 
the green river case has been described as the nations worst 
unsolved serial murder case 
the remains of 40 young women have been found around seattle and 
portland ore and eight missing young women are thought to have 
been slain by the killer who mostly preyed on women linked to 
prostitution or other street life 
the last slaying linked with the green river killer occurred in 
1984 
since june 1985 30 slain women have been found near freeways in 
san diego county authorities say between 10 and 18 are the work of 
the same killer

more than 150 secret navy documents including 
decoding materials and details of sensitive electronicwarfare 
equipment were lost by engineers and officers at an installation 
here a newspaper reported 
no evidence was found that the documents were sold to or 
obtained by hostile agents but it cannot be discounted that the 
unaccountedfor secret material may have been subjected to 
compromise said a navy report obtained by the san diego union 
navy officials declined comment because the report is under 
review the newspaper reported sunday 
in march thenacting navy secretary lawrence garrett blamed the 
lost documents on poor bookkeeping and lax supervision 
navy investigators discovered that 158 documents were missing 
after an audit of recordkeeping last year at the naval electronic 
systems engineering center at air force plant 19 the report said 
among the missing materials were manuals on sea nymph submarine 
sensors designed to pick up enemy radar and conversations and data 
about antimissile earlywarning devices the newspaper said 
also unaccounted for were key cards or cryptography keys to 
encoding and decoding military communications 
the missing documents were from 1979 through 1984 
the report strongly criticized capt kirby w hansen commander 
of the center during much of that time but recommended no 
discipline against him he retired in 1986 
however disciplinary action is pending against john e hassett 
of chula vista a civil servant who was supervisor of the 
classified mailroom vault at the command from 1981 until 1987 the 
newspaper said 
hassett said he noticed documents were missing but added i 
didnt think there was anything clandestine just poor accounting 
of the publications by the various departments 
the report called for a new computer system for tracking 
classified documents the system already has been implemented navy 
officials said

george bush intentionally staying behind as 
the opening spotlight plays on president reagan said today that 
pressure is mounting on him as time grows short before his 
thursday night acceptance speech as the republican presidential 
nominee 
however the vice president indicated he felt no pressure to 
reveal the one big secret of the partys convention the name of 
his running mate 
making the rounds of the morning network interview shows he 
said he was still getting it clear in my mind and reiterated 
his vow to tell no one his choice in advance after he does decide 
campaign aides insist that bush will withhold the announcement 
until thursday morning partly to build suspense and coax a larger 
television audience for the thursday night speech 
he said there are still multiple contenders for the no 2 spot 
i have not decided and i probably will say when i have 
decided he said on abcs good morning america 
on cbs this morning bush said i have not told a soul 
what im thinking and i literally mean that not jim baker his 
new campaign chairman not barbara bush nobody 
bush told nbcs today show that once he does make up his 
mind i think my choice will be widely accepted at the 
convention 
he said that he feels pressure as the night of his speech nears 
a night that both republican and democratic leaders say will be 
important for the fall campaign but he also said im an 
athlete and can handle pressure 
bush was working on his acceptance speech again today he 
arrives in new orleans on tuesday 
asked if he was concerned that people would compare him with 
reagan bush said such comparisons were inevitable 
but he told abc ive got to be what i am and im not going 
to try to be somebody else he called the convention a big 
moment for me the culmination of a lot of years of politics 
he told cbs that he planned to have his entire family with him 
at the convention gov dukakis did a good job on that showing 
off his family at the democratic convention but weve got a 
stronger bench and weve got a great family 
spokeswoman sheila tate said sunday that bush already had been 
through three drafts of the speech written with speechwriter peggy 
noonan and had practiced it sunday afternoon at his official vice 
presidential residence with media consultant roger ailes 
bush also had lunch sunday with baker the outgoing treasury 
secretary 
aides said bush still hopes to delay a final announcement of his 
vice presidential choice until thursday morning however one 
source said aides are considering whether to unveil the choice 
wednesday night 
names being most frequently mentioned are senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas and his wife former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole rep jack kemp of new york sen alan 
simpson of wyoming sen dan quayle of indiana attorney general 
dick thornburgh of pennsylvania and sen pete v domenici of new 
mexico 
many of the wouldbe candidates made the rounds of television 
talk shows sunday simpson on nbcs meet the press disclosed 
he had asked bush to remove his name from the list 
i would be a liability for george simpson said citing his 
support for limiting social security benefit increases and his 
belief that the next president will have to increase taxes to trim 
the federal deficit as among the positions he had taken that would 
fail the litmus test 
however a top bush campaign official who insisted upon 
anonymity said on sunday that simpson was sending mixed 
signals and that his comments were not necessarily an indication 
that he would be dropped from bushs short list 
bush in making his final selection is not necessarily limiting 
himself to those whose names have been frequently mentioned the 
official said 
in a separate appearance on abcs this week with david 
brinkley quayle at 41 the youngest of those believed to be 
under consideration said i would like to believe that i would 
be acceptable to the whole party 
and dole declared i am not running for vice president 
then referring to his wife he added im not campaigning for 
anyone but she would be a great addition to the ticket 
thornburgh meanwhile said it was very flattering to be 
mentioned but i have a job to do for this president 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said on meet the press 
that thornburgh would make a good attorney general but quickly 
added i didnt say for how long suggesting his remarks 
shouldnt be interpreted to suggest thornburgh was no longer under 
consideration 
meanwhile the vice president not generally known for his 
prowess as a public speaker continued to focus attention on his 
acceptance speech in addition to his practice in washington time 
has been set aside in new orleans for a rehearsal in the superdome 
aides said

charging riot police today broke up 
radical students who tried to march to the north korean border for 
reunification talks and troopers brutally beat and kicked 
protesters 
waves of troopers in green combat fatigues and black visored 
helmets charged the students as they tried to march out of yonsei 
university in western seoul police armored vans also fired salvos 
of tear gas bombs into the screaming students 
unite the fatherland and yankee go home students yelled 
police dragged away about 200 students some of them screaming 
with fear and pain the unresisting students huddled in groups on 
the ground clinging to each other as troopers beat them with fists 
and even riot shields 
senior police officers hit and slapped their own men to try to 
stop the beatings 
president roh taewoo in a speech today to mark independence 
day called radical students a threat to next months summer 
olympics and said disorder would not be tolerated 
the people and the government will not forgive anyone who 
spoils the olympic festival through mob action or the throwing of 
firebombs he said 
the students tried to march out of the college three times but 
were beaten back by police marchers did not try to fight back 
except when police pushed deep into the campus and students 
attacked them with clubs and rocks 
they apparently decided not to resist initially and let 
themselves be arrested departing from their normal tactic of being 
first to start violence some said they volunteered to be arrested 
about 3000 students had assembled on the campus to try to march 
35 miles north to the border truce site of panmunjom for talks with 
north korean student delegates on reuniting the divided korean 
peninsula the government banned the march and deployed 25000 riot 
police in seoul to stop it 
the north korean students waited for two hours in panmonjum 
today but left when the south korean students failed to arrive 
according to a report by the norths official korean central news 
agency it was monitored in tokyo 
the south korean radical students a small but powerful minority 
on campuses have virtually no public support and protests last 
week attracted just a few thousand people still koreans fear that 
violent protests by the radicals could cast a shadow over the 
olympics 
after the march was blocked students regrouped on the campus 
and surged out with firebombs and rocks to battle the 7000 riot 
police around the school police vans blasted tear gas bombs and 
both sides pelted each other with rocks 
police had few problems containing the students students were 
unable to get past troopers surrounding the university 
hundreds of students tried to stage protests in other parts of 
seoul or get to train stations to reach the border but riot police 
quickly broke up protests and seized scores of radicals 
roads leading to the border were also blocked by riot police 
a similar attempt to march to panmunjom on june 10 was blocked 
by police and the turnout for todays march appeared considerably 
smaller 
student leaders told a rally before trying to march out of 
yonsei that the radicals would not stop trying to oust the roh 
government and reunite the two koreas 
dozens of students cut their fingers with razors and wrote 
slogans in blood 
we will never give up until we have destroyed the military 
dictatorship and reunited our nation one leader said 
the radicals also denounced the united states saying washington 
supports military rule in south korea they demanded the withdrawal 
of the 42000 us troops based here under a treaty 
two american leftists sue bailey of washington dc and 
charles scheiner of white plains ny told the rally they brought 
messages of support from radicals in the united states they told 
the students millions of americans support their struggle and want 
us troops out of south korea 
president roh called for greater efforts to ease tension between 
north and south korea he proposed reunification talks with north 
korean president kim il sung 
similar proposals in the past have not led to talks but the two 
koreas are considering parliamentary talks on easing tension a 
first meeting may be held at panmunjom on friday 
radical students have seized on the reunification issue to try 
to mobilize public support for their antigovernment campaign 
the students say they are not communists but insist that the 
peninsula must be reunited immediately with political differences 
to be worked out later most south koreans fear the north is 
determined to conquer them 
the peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of world 
war ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean 
war which ended three years later without a political solution

george bush aware of the warm images of 
hearth and home evoked by michael and kitty dukakis in atlanta last 
month promised today to show america exactly how much my great 
strong big family means to me 
bush who has four sons and a daughter concedes dukakis did a 
good job at the democratic national convention with his speech and 
showing those wonderfully warm pictures of his family 
now the vice president said it is his turn 
you know on family ive always tried to hold that a 
little bit close he said on abctv and yet i think i have to 
share now with the american people exactly how much my great 
strong big family means to me 
earlier the vice president said the bushes come out of a 
little more conservative tradition we havent been able to speak 
as glowingly and as warmly not because we didnt believe because 
it was different somehow 
marvin bush one of bushs sons said today on nbctv mike 
dukakis has nothing on george bush when it comes to real family 
in atlanta dukakis voice caught as he talked about his 
deceased father and there were warm words for his mother euterpe 
an introduction from his cousin olympia and fond embraces between 
the massachusetts governor and his wife 
bushs children all of whom are delegates are making the 
rounds in new orleans talking to other delegates attending 
receptions working behind the scenes generally stoking the fires 
for dad 
grandson george prescott bush will lead the pledge of allegiance 
on tuesday son jeb bush will address the convention on wednesday 
night and on thursday bushs wife of 43 years barbara will speak 
all told there will be more than 60 bush relatives here

texas delegate and a top strategist in his fathers campaign will 
announce the delegations 111 votes that will put bush oer the top 
to have his son of the same name put him over the top speaks 
about family and the commitment of our family to work hard for the 
person we love george jr said in an interview 
issues such as day care health care for the elderly parental 
leave and other familyrelated concerns have become important in 
the 1988 campaign and the republicans dont intend to concede that 
ground to the democrats 
great pains will be taken to portray the nominee as a family 
man much of that testimony will come from his children all 
actively involved in the campaign and some of them expert 
campaigners in their own right 
up to now george bush has been reluctant to talk about his 
family his religion things of a personal nature george jr 
says obviously the american people are demanding more than just 
issues part of the convention will be george bush opening up his 
family speaking out about love 
george jr 42 admits to being a seasoned politician he ran 
for congress unsuccessfully and now is a bush campaign strategist 
jeb bush 35 is secretary of the florida department of commerce 
and worked in his fathers 1980 presidential campaign 
neil bush 33 lives in denver and worked on his brother 
georges congressional campaign and on the 1980 presidential 
campaign marvin bush 31 has his own investment consulting firm

conn bushs first cousin who is also a delegate a lot of us 
have been working for this for a long time 
george bush jr says the family display at the convention 
choreographed though it may be wont be put on 
itll be a very sincere expression of love he says 
but as for bush and his wife conventionviewers should not 
expect to see the kind of embraces or affectionate moments the 
dukakises are fond of once they were spotted dancing at an 
airport in the absence of music the bushes arent given to that 
type of display and seem to be a bit touchy about the subject 
im not going to dance with her with no music im not 
going to go that far the vice president said i dont like to 
dance anyway and she knows im lousy at it

production at the nations factories mines 
and utilities surged 08 percent in july the biggest increase in 
nine months the government reported today 
the federal reserve said the large july advance was double the 
04 percent increase in june 
it marked the tenth consecutive month that the index has risen 
without a decline and it was the largest advance since a 11 
percent increase last october 
analysts had expected a big advance given the fact that 
employment at manufacturing plants climbed at the fastest pace this 
year according to the labor departments july employment report 
however the consensus forecast was for a rise of around 06 
percent 
the manufacturing sector has been the star of the economy this 
year as american producers aided by a weak dollar have enjoyed 
strong foreign sales 
however concern that the economy might be growing too rapidly 
with demand outstripping production capabilities was one of the 
reasons cited by the federal reserve when it raised the discount 
rate last week 
the increase in industrial production came despite the fact that 
auto output actually fell during the month autos were assembled at 
an annual rate of 71 million units down from junes pace of 75 
million units the production of light trucks also decreased during 
the month 
the strength came from a continued surge in the production of 
business equipment including computers which jumped 1 percent in 
july following an equally strong 09 percent rise in june 
production of consumer goods rose 03 percent during the month 
reflecting gains in appliance production and nondurable consumer 
goods as well 
output of construction supplies fell for the second consecutive 
month dropping 03 percent following a 01 percent decline in 
june reflecting a strike in the lumber industry 
overall manufacturing production rose 08 percent in july with 
durable manufacturing and nondurable manufacturing posting 
identical 08 percent increases 
production at utilities rose 06 percent on top of a giant 25 
percent increase in june the big gains were attributed to high 
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave 
output at the nations mines including oil and gas drilling 
activities rose 06 percent in july this sector is now producing 
at a rate 49 percent higher than a year ago 
total output stood at 1377 percent of its 1977 base of 100 and 
is 54 percent higher than a year ago

visiting plo officials said jordan agreed 
to maintain its remaining ties with the israelioccupied west bank 
including the granting of jordanian passports to residents and 
maintaining open bridges across the jordan river 
the plo officials ending three days of talks with this 
kingdoms leadership repeated a call for an eventual confederation 
with jordan in a palestinian state 
the talks which ended sunday were the first between top plo 
and jordanian officials since king hussein announced two weeks ago 
that he was severing legal and administrative ties with the west 
bank 
the delegation arrived in egypt today for talks with president 
hosni mubarak 
a top plo representative at the talks abdullah horani said the 
two sides had passed over irritation his group felt because it 
was not consulted before husseins announcement 
hussein challenged the palestine liberation organization to 
create a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza strip 
captured by israel during the 1967 middle east war 
the territories have been plagued by an 8monthold palestinian 
rebellion during which more than 240 palestinians and four 
israelis have died 
in the days preceding and following his speech the jordanian 
monarch canceled a 13 billion west bank development plan fired 
thousands of civil servants there and ended west bank 
representation in jordans parliament 
the moves prompted speculation that hussein might be trying to 
set up the plo for failure or pressuring it into admitting it needs 
jordan to achieve a palestinian state 
in a communique issued late sunday the plo delegation praised 
husseins moves in the west bank which he ruled from 1948 to 1967 
it said jordan had agreed to maintain current ties to the west bank 
horani told reporters those ties included the granting of 
jordanian passports to west bank residents maintaining open 
bridges across the jordan river supervision of west bank schools 
and economic links jordan om serves as a lifeline to the west bank 
by handling exports and funneling in money 
a jordanian statement after the meeting made no direct mention 
of those links or any agreement relating to them it said only that 
the two sides agreed that the national unity between both sides 
is a stronghold and pledged continued support for the palestinian 
cause 
jordan has long had uneasy relations with the plo and it fought 
in 197071 to expel palestinian commandos from its territory 
most of the 850000 west bank residents and many of the 650000 
residents of the gaza strip hold jordanian passports although gaza 
was under egyptian control until 1967 
husseins recent moves have caused anxiety among west bank 
residents as well as jordanians of palestinian origin who are in 
the majority in jordan they fear their rights in jordan might be 
curtailed 
the plo statement sunday said the kingdom made clear jordans 
decision that jordanians of palestinian origin are jordanian 
citizens and have full rights of citizenship and full duties 
also sunday a senior plo leader was quoted as saying the plo is 
seriously considering creating a provisional government that would 
recognize israels right to exist 
the weekly journal du dimanche quoted salah khalaf plo chief 
yasser arafats main deputy in the fatah guerrilla group as 
saying my solution for peace is for a palestinian state a 
discussion to establish the borders of this state and mutual 
recognition of israel and palestine 
khalaf was quoted as saying we are thinking seriously of 
creating a palestinian state with a provisional government 
legitimately established whose political program would be 
completely different from the plos current charter he gave no 
details 
the 20yearold charter calls for replacement of the jewish 
state with a democratic secular state it has been a roadblock 
to us and israeli relations with the plo 
the khalaf interview received wide media coverage in israel and 
the daily hadashot said today that it might herald a significant 
change in the plo which israel has banned as a terrorist group 
we cant ignore what is happening to the plo today the 
paper said in an editorial it said a move by the plo to set up a 
government recognizing israel could change the status quo the 
argument that we dont speak to the plo loses its force when we 
are talking about an organization which claims it is ready to 
negotiate on the basis of mutual recognition 
khalaf said a decision might be taken by the palestine national 
council at its meeting next month in algeria

despite calls for continued 
antigovernment demonstrations returning travelers reported calm 
in burmas capital today analysts predicted few dramatic changes 
in its authoritarian system 
legislative and political party meetings are scheduled on 
friday presumably to choose a successor to president sein lwin 
who resigned last week after violent nationwide demonstrations 
travelers returning from rangoon said throngs of people waited 
to withdraw money from the national bank and others read a list of 
the dead and wounded pasted at the entrance of rangoon general 
hospital 
there were heaps of names said kate meehan a teacher from 
sydney australia on another wall was a cartoon showing a headless 
president and vice president with the caption in burmese reading 
burma is being run by no one 
by official count at least 95 people were killed and 240 people 
wounded in last weeks protests unconfirmed reports say hundreds 
of people were killed 
travelers quoted burmese as saying they were anxiously awaiting 
the friday party meetings 
there are many things to be done by the new president an 
italian tourist antonella mantica quoted residents as saying 
sein lwin was widely held responsible for ruthless suppression 
of dissent over the past quarter century 
leaflets over the weekend had called for more protests for full 
democracy from the government and japans kyodo news agency had 
reported that demonstrations were set for today but the returning 
travelers and burmas official radio rangoon reported no protests 
in a bangkok conference on burma analysts predicted few 
dramatic changes from the 26year authoritarian rule of ne win 
ne win will probably pick a second sein lwin who will not be 
such a hardliner but still do everything commanded by ne win 
said zaw wai a burmaborn businessman and a spokesman for the 
large burmese emigre community in bangkok 
chayachok chulsiriwongse a thai expert on burma said he 
believed former strongman ne win remained as the elder 
statesman working behind the political scenes 
ne win was succeeded as chairman of the burma socialist program 
party on july 26 by sein lwin a retired army general 
on july 30 burma detained 10 people including a prominent 
government critic gen aung gyi also detained was sein win the 
burmese correspondent of the associated press 
chayachok and others said a successor to sein lwin might be more 
acceptable to some burmese but would be picked from among the top 
military or retired military officers who were part of the former 
ne win hierarchy 
students demands have included a multiparty system restoration 
of basic human rights the release of political prisoners and the 
right to set up their own organizations 
burmas stateowned official media meanwhile said leaders of 
student demonstrations are promising to avoid similar acts in the 
future 
the guardian newspaper said in its editorial today that it was 
satisfying to see the situation in rangoon improving day after 
day

the rebel brother of afghan president 
najib said today the communist leader knows he cannot rule 
afghanistan without help from soviet troops 
najibs brother siddiquallah 35 met with reporters for the 
first time since defecting to moslem guerrillas 11 months ago he 
arrived in this pakistani border town this month reportedly to 
seek political asylum in the west 
he najib knows he cannot rule afghanistan without the 
soviets siddiquallah told a news conference at the 
heavilyguarded headquarters of the afghan guerrilla alliance 
the news conference was timed to coincide with the aug 15 
deadline for moscows withdrawal of half of its estimated 100000 
troops in afghanistan the deadline was set in a unbrokered 
accord in april 
the kremlin said it had met its deadline military officials 
said their troops remained only in a few afghan provinces mainly 
from the capital kabul to the north 
the rest of the soviet troops are to be out by feb 15 1989 
the kremlin began its pullout in may 
some western pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted 
kabuls communist government will fall quickly after the soviet 
troops leaves a former soviet military adviser in afghanistan 
maj gen kim m tsagolov has expressed doubt the afghan army can 
hold its own after the pullout 
siddiquallah refused to comment on whether he was seeking asylum 
in a third country but guerrillas who harbored him said he was 
trying to obtain entry to the united states 
the us embassy in islamabad declined comment on the report 
siddiquallah said he was a committed member of the communist 
party in the late 1960s but grew disillusioned over the next 
decade as the party became the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan 
the party seized power in a bloody 1978 coup sparking 
widespread moslem resistance soviet troops intervened in december 
1979 replacing one communist regime with another 
sidiquallah said he tried to escape to the west in 1981 but was 
drugged in west germany and hauled back to afghanistan 
he said najib 43 a physician and former chief of the afghan 
state security police had him imprisoned in 1987 after failing to 
squelch his criticism of the government he was released a few 
months later 
siddiquallah said he defected to the moslem guerrillas in 
september 1987

a former detective who was the 
basis for gene hackmans character in the french connection 
says hes making a sequel on how heroin seized in the bust was 
later stolen from new york police vaults 
the tale will unfold in a twohour 8 million movie eddie egan 
plans to start filming in fort lauderdale in the fall he said 
egans role in helping crack the french connection heroin 
trafficking scheme was portrayed in the 1971 academy awardwinning 
movie in which hackman played a character named jimmy popeye 
doyle 
now egan wants to tell the rest of the story how 112 pounds 
of heroin he and his partner recovered in 1962 were discovered 
missing a decade later from the police property clerks office and 
ended up on the streets of southern florida 
it was what i have to term as the perfect crime egan said 
nobody was watching the store 
he said the film internal affair will show how criminals 
got on the police force and over several years smuggled heroin out 
of police department vaults replacing it with worthless powder 
egan has formed a movie company gold shield productions inc 
to produce internal affair which he bills as being more 
intriguing than the french connection 
the stars have not been selected but egan said they must have a 
drugfree background 
the french connection arrests capped an investigation filled 
with tedious surveillance and routine police work it was the 
highlight of egans 20year police career 
after the arrests egan was demoted and suspended for failing to 
catalog drugs seized as evidence he retired in 1971 to make movies 
egan 58 has spent the past 15 years as a character actor in tv 
and movie police stories such as badge 373 police story

guerrillas took a key provincial capital in 
afghanistan and a district near kabul as the soviet pullout neared 
its halfway mark staterun media said today in reports indicating 
red army troops now are deployed only along escape routes 
the official tass news agency the communist party daily pravda 
and radio moscow today heralded the soviet fulfillment of an 
agreement signed in geneva in april that required the kremlin to 
pull out half of its more than 100000 soldiers by aug 15 
afghanistans radio kabul reported sunday that halfway point was 
reached over the weekend when a motorized rifle regiment of 200 
vehicles and 3000 troops left for the soviet union from the 
western city of herat 
those soviets still in afghanistan must leave the wartorn 
country within six months according to the geneva agreements 
pravda carried an article by afghan leader najib in which he 
thanks the kremlin for its support during the war that has divided 
afghanistan since the april 1978 revolution 
soviet troops intervened in december 1979 to support a 
promoscow regime 
the article was accompanied by a graphic showing where the 
remaining soviet soldiers are deployed it indicates kremlin troops 
are located only along two evacuation routes to the soviet border 
from kabul in the northeast and from shindand via herat in the west 
soviet military officials have said the pullout cleared soviets 
from 25 of afghanistans 30 provinces and the graphic accompanying 
najibs article showed soldiers are deployed in only a narrow 
ribbon through the remaining five provinces 
tass said in the dispatch from kabul that guerrilla activity is 
the rise 
in the first 10 days of august extremists carried out 142 
bombardments and attacks on populated areas around the country as 
a result 31 peaceful residents were killed and 113 wounded 
tass said two guerrilla groups the islamic party of afghanistan 
and the islamic society of afghanistan had captured the skakardar 
district about 20 miles north of kabul it said the groups had a 
supply of 1500 rockets they planned to fire at the afghan capital 
the news agency said rebels were planning to send other forces 
to districts of the kabul province to put further pressure on the 
capital 
lt gen boris gromov commander of soviet forces in 
afghanistan on sunday confirmed western reports that the northern 
provincial capital of kunduz had fallen to the rebels 
he contended he had no doubt that in the very near future 
the sovietbacked government would retake the strategic northern 
city 
kunduz which lies beyond the hindu kush mountains north of 
kabul was a government stronghold until late 1986 when 
ussupplied stinger missiles were brought to the mountainous area 
by the rebels and used to down numerous soviet and afghan planes 
it is located near a fiveprovince northern zone created earlier 
this year in which afghan officials appear to be establishing an 
economic buffer zone between the rebelcontrolled southern 
provinces and the soviet border 
the mountainous region north of kabul and east of the strategic 
economic area where afghanistans best natural resources are 
concentrated has been repeatedly harassed by guerrillas over the 
past year rebels hiding in the hills and mountains through which 
the kabul evacuation route traverses have used their higher vantage 
points to fire on the departing soviet convoys 
soviet media have not disclosed the number of troops killed or 
wounded during the pullout which began may 15 
officials of the afghan government say their armed forces were 
capable of defending the country without soviet troops but some 
western pakistani and guerrilla sources have predicted kabuls 
communist government will fall soon after the soviet soldiers are 
gone 
reports reaching islamabad pakistan said almost all provincial 
capitals remain in the afghan governments control however 
guerrillas control most of the rural countryside and have made 
repeated seizures of the cities 
they have been forced out of the provincial capitals by heavy 
soviet aerial bombardment

the first shark patrols in six 
years continue off stinson beach after a great white shark was seen 
eating a seal 
sharks may be entering the area to feed on sick or dead sea 
lions and seals which have been stricken in an epidemic of a 
kidney disease said dr ray deiter a veterinarian with coast 
watch which monitors marine mammal life 
last week a surfer survived a shark attack near eureka about 
300 miles north of stinson a popular beach just north of san 
francisco 
lifegaurds are cruising the area once or twice a day for signs 
of sharks said lifeguard steve hills no sharks have been spotted

the legislature today began the sixth day 
of a special session called to abolish a centuryold system of 
local government purchasing a reform prompted by an fbi probe of 
corruption 
the house and senate reconvened this morning in an effort to 
settle differences that deadlocked conferees late sunday night 
rep hl sonny merideth said he would recommend today that 
the legislature adjourn and go home 
im sure the house will be disappointed as i know the senate 
would merideth said but the houses position is that unless 
you can get something that is reasonable and workable and doesnt 
have the potential to selfdestruct we can wait until another day 
for a better bill 
senate negotiators had no immediate comment 
the 1988 legislative session ended in may with conferees failing 
to agree on reform legislation 
gov ray mabus remained optimistic were of the belief that 
nobody is interested in going home without resolving the matter 
mabus spokesman cliff treyens said 
the fbis operation pretense probe resulted in the arrests of 52 
supervisors in 24 counties fortythree were convicted or pleaded 
guilty and 23 received prison sentences the charges ranged from 
extortion to mail fraud 
the house has approved a bill that would require counties to 
adopt central purchasing systems 
currently county supervisors oversee all purchasing in their 
districts the new system would give an appointed administrator 
power over daytoday purchasing for the entire county while 
keeping policy in the hands of supervisors 
supervisors would still award contracts but the administrator 
would be responsible for purchasing materials and overseeing 
projects 
the senate wants to exempt some small counties from the new 
plan arguing they cant afford to hire an administrator the house 
wants no exemptions 
as state auditor for the four years before he was elected 
governor in 1987 mabus assisted the fbi in its investigation

the republicans whose only task this week is 
to take a foregone conclusion to a footstomping anticlimax found 
it necessary today to hold a morning session to start things off 
this is what they meant by morning in america 
there even were delegates in the cavernous superdome when the 
opening gavel fell at 10 am attracted possibly by the routine 
business at hand but more likely because the superdome is the 
coolest place in town the weather in new orleans is such that 
flies have been known to faint from the heat 
did the morning session really count since dan tom and peter 
were not peering down from their anchor booths 
the program to be charitable seemed to have come out of files 
marked not ready for prime time or america isnt it 
wonderful 
the schedule was drawn to pay homage to japaneseamericans 
hispanicamericans college americans black americans teenage 
americans female americans jewishamericans and americans abroad 
there also was a salute to youth 
all this in barely two hours along with the call to order two 
rotc color guards the national anthem the invocation and the 
pledge of allegiance led by soviet expatriate comic yakov smirnoff 
he was introduced by party chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr as 
a man who came to the united states seeking freedom and like so 
many americans has given more than he received hes given us the 
gift of laughter 
smirnoff did his stint and ended with his trademark what a 
country 
the bestknown of the speakers were alexander haig the former 
secretary of state who made it almost to the first primary before 
dropping out of the presidential race and former gov pete du pont 
of delaware who pocketed two delegates in the first primary and 
then gave up 
for their efforts the two men were penciled in for 1040 am 
to 11 am which is about as far out of the spotlight as you can 
get at a political convention 
maureen reagan the outspoken daughter of president reagan and a 
republican party stalwart didnt fare much better she had an 
early starting time when she could be as blunt as she likes 
without offending too many 
this was all a warmup for the big finale at high noon speeches 
by candidates for the senate and house from virginia new jersey 
tennessee north dakota vermont montana new york and new mexico 
a far piece from prime time yes but you can bet that their 
campaign commercials will take full advantage of those clips of 
glory without showing the clock of course

campaigning for the republican vice 
presidential nomination reached a fever pitch today in this 
convention city as the oneman audience back in washington 
george bush declared he has still not made up his mind on a 
running mate 
the republican nomineetobe stuck to his vow of silence on the 
choice which he described as very important but not the 
decisive factor in the fall election 
no i have not decided the incumbent vice president said on 
abcs good morning america i probably will say when i have 
decided 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said a bit later in the 
morning that bush may well have made his decision 
i think he felt like going into this weekend that he had 
received the input he wanted to atwater told reporters 
sometime over the weekend i include today in the weekend he 
was going to make his decision before he got down here tuesday 
morning 
bush said he would be making a decision in private and then 
presenting it at the appropriate time 
the timing for bushs announcement of his choice may be moved up 
from thursday morning a source said aides are discussing unveiling 
the choice wednesday night with bush and his running mate coming 
to the superdome after bush formally wins the presidential 
nomination that evening 
asked if he were leaning toward one person bush said yes of 
course but some people id say 
he brushed aside suggestions from sen gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire that conservatives could be upset by his decision 
i think my choice will be widely accepted when i decide on 
who that choice is he said on nbcs today show 
but at the moment the choice is a mystery the only one left as 
the delegates gathered in the superdome today for the conventions 
start 
the woman and men on the list of contenders were waiting for the 
telephone call from bush even as they rushed from reception to 
interview to rallies amid the trappings of fullfledged campaigns 
those thought to be under consideration included sen bob dole 
of kansas sen pete domenici of new mexico sen dan quayle of 
indiana former transportation secretary elizabeth dole former 
white house chief of staff howard baker and attorney general 
richard thornburgh 
kemp of new york made it crystal clear he wants the job even as 
others took a different tack 
if i were to be asked i would be a terrific campaigner and a 
terrific candidate and a terrific vice president kemp said 
today but i came here not expecting it i dont expect it today 
im not sitting by the telephone 
i do not expect to be asked to be vice president i do 
expect to help said mrs dole on cbs this morning 
others joked about the call to come 
communication is very important in fact if the system breaks 
down nobody will get a call and bush will run alone joked sen 
dole 
with both him and his wife on the list of possibilities their 
telephone is especially crucial 
we finally had to leave washington to come down here so we got 
a recording on the machine at home just in case they got the wrong 
number it just says i accept dole said at a breakfast 
quayle on his way to speak to the ohio delegation told 
reporters i havent gotten any phone calls except from home 
sen alan simpson of wyoming tried to take himself off the list 
saying i would be a liability for george in an interview on 
nbcs meet the press on sunday 
but bush said today that such public statements from prospects 
may not indicate he has taken them off his private list i 
wouldnt say that at all he said on nbc i havent made up my 
mind yet 
former tennessee gov lamar alexander mentioned as a 
possibility flew out of the city sunday saying if im on 
anyones list its a list no ones told me about 
but tennessee still was not out of the running republican 
insiders have been urging bush to consider former white house chief 
of staff baker the former tennessee senator was due here today 
the choice may not be any of these warned new jersey gov 
thomas kean a friend of the vice president after talking to bush 
on saturday kean said the vice president is thinking about some 
other names 
i know there are some people who have not been on those lists 
who are still in his mind so it could be a surprise said kean 
who will give the convention keynote speech on tuesday night 
dole and domenici denied seeking the no 2 spot while kemp had 
a campaign minirally attended by former presidential hopeful pete

the governor has asked state officials to 
review a program that has allowed john zaccaro jr to spend his 
fourmonth prison term for selling cocaine in a 1500amonth 
luxury apartment with maid service 
gov madeleine kunin feels the overall program is outstanding 
but believes people should be treated equally regardless of 
personal circumstances spokesman louis berney said today 
the son of former vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro 
is staying in one of 12 units in a building designed for 
expenseaccount business people on short assignments the new york 
daily news reported sunday 
zaccaro 24 was convicted in april of selling a quartergram of 
cocaine to an undercover police officer while a student at 
middlebury college in 1986 judge francis mccaffrey sentenced him 
to four months in prison 
zaccaro was determined eligible for the state corrections 
departments house arrest program under which nonviolent 
convicts can find their own housing and live under supervision by 
corrections officials 
his apartment comes with maid service and cable tv among other 
amenities the daily news said 
we like to think of it as a cross between an apartment and a 
hotel with the advantages of both a spokeswoman for the 
buildings owners told the newspaper 
addison county states attorney john quinn who prosecuted 
zaccaro said of zaccaros accommodations this guy is a drug 
felon and hes living in conditions that 999 percent of the people 
of vermont couldnt afford 
with the attention on the luxuries of the apartment it is 
important to remember zaccaro does not have freedom in any sense 
of the word berney said 
he works most of the time and is restricted to his apartment 
for the rest of the time with the exception of one hour a week in 
which he has to go grocery shopping 
the department doesnt provide the apartment said john 
perry director of planning for corrections the prisoner does 
that we are only concerned that it meets minimum standards no 
drugs no guns no college kids hanging around 
obviously some people mr zaccaro among them have more money 
than others and they can afford a better place the aga khan 
probably wouldnt think much of his apartment its a matter of 
standards of living and we are not paying for it so we cant 
decide a place is too luxurious if it meets the other criteria 
corrections officials however did say there was concern that 
dissatisfaction in the law enforcement community with the 
comfortable way in which zaccaro is serving time may threaten the 
future of the house arrest program 
its a disgrace to put a drug dealer into the program quinn 
said im not happy about it and neither are other states 
attorneys

the army plans to erect a 
14mile electrified fence along a section of the botswana border 
following renewed complaints of guerrilla infiltrations 
military headquarters said the fence would be built near the 
pontdrif border station in farnorthern transvaal province 
pontdrif is close to the point where the borders of south africa 
botswana and zimbabwe intersect 
there have been several encounters in the area in recent weeks 
between south african security forces and alleged guerrillas of the 
outlawed african national congress including a shootout in which a 
suspected guerrilla and a policeman were killed 
the government has reiterated charges that botswana is major 
infiltration route for guerrillas entering south africa to carry 
out sabotage and bombings 
south africa two years ago erected an electrified fence along a 
section of its border with mozambique primarily to cut down on the 
number of mozambicans entering south africa illegally through 
february 46 people had been killed trying to scale the 36mile 
highvoltage fence 
six people have been killed from contact with a shorter 
electrified fence on a section of the zimbabwe border in 1985

gov michael dukakis may not invoke executive 
privilege to keep documents from the public the massachusetts 
supreme court ruled today 
the unanimous decision came in the case of two homosexual men 
who are challenging the dukakis administrations decision to remove 
two young boys from foster care in their boston home but it could 
affect other issues 
the democratic presidential nominees administration has cited 
executive privilege in a number of areas to avoid having to 
disclose internal memos and other sensitive papers opponents of 
plans to put a new prison in new braintree are seeking to force 
disclosure of documents showing how the site was chosen 
there is no such privilege in massachusetts the court said 
in an opinion written by chief justice edward f hennessey 
the justices said they found no justification in the state 
constitution or state law for withholding government documents 
they said the creation of laws rights or privileges was a policy 
issue best left to the legislature 
had the framers of our governments structure intended to 
recognize in our constitution an executive privilege it is 
reasonable to expect that they would expressly have created one 
they said 
its a victory for accountability and open government said 
anthony m doniger attorney for donald babets and david jean 
the public now has a right to know how its government comes to 
its decisions that is a good thing in a democracy 
spokesmen for dukakis were traveling with him to central 
massachusetts and were not immediately available for comment 
the case began in 1985 when the dukakis administration removed 
two youngsters then aged 3 and 22 months from babets and jean 
after a study the department of social services promulgated rules 
for placing foster children that gave lowest priority to homosexual 
individuals who lacked experience as parents and gave first 
priority to married couples with children 
babets and jean filed suit in suffolk superior court in january 
1986 challenging the legality of the rules the suit named dukakis 
human services secretary philip johnston and dss commissioner sandy 
matava as defendants although dukakis was later dropped as a named 
defendant 
babets and jean argued that the policy discriminated and 
violated their constitutional rights to equal protection free 
association and privacy 
during the trial lawyers for babets and jean asked judge james 
p lynch jr to order the dukakis administration to divulge certain 
documents relating to the policymaking process after hearings and 
an inspection of the documents lynch ordered the government to 
surrender them but lynch stayed his order and referred the 
constitutional questions to the appellate courts 
todays ruling specifically affirms lynchs order apparently 
forcing the state to release the requested documents

the police chief today dropped the word 
black from a directive ordering officers to stop and question 
black teenagers at random to reduce crime in a raciallymixed 
neighborhood 
chief martin felker said in a statement that the policy which 
is under attack by a black lawyers association in federal court 
unfortunately has been perceived as racially motivated 
to correct this misconception i have modified this 
directive he said lafayette tolliver of the thurgood marshall 
law association said the group will press ahead with its suit to 
prevent police from carrying out the policy announced july 8 the 
policy applies to the old west end neighborhood 
a 430 pm hearing was scheduled in us district court on the 
groups request for a temporary restraining order and 1 million in 
damages the attorney said 
the association sued on friday on behalf of walter wade jr a 
black teenager who was followed and then stopped by police in 
front of his house wednesday wade 19 was questioned but not 
charged with any offense the suit said 
this policy has given police carte blanche to do what they 
wanted in the old west end we are not only talking about black 
teenagers being stopped but also some black adults too 
tolliver said this morning 
the policy followed complaints by residents who had reported 
three violent incidents involving black youngsters about 17 
percent of toledos 340000 residents are black 
the suit said the policy violates civil rights law and the 
constitutions guarantee of freedom of association and protection 
against unlawful search and seizure 
felker defended the policy as necessary to stop violence in the 
neighborhood

riot police used tear gas and beatings 
monday to disperse thousands of radical students trying to march to 
the border for unification talks with north korea at least 1300 
were arrested 
president roh taewoo told the nation his government will not 
tolerate violent campus protest he said unchecked student activism 
would endanger the olympic games which open sept 17 in seoul 
officers were seen taking away hundreds of protesters who tried 
to march from seoul to the border truce village of panmunjom 35 
miles north of the capital for talks with north korean student 
leaders 
witnesses saw dozens of protesters and policmen injured but no 
injury statistics were available authorities said they arrested 
1300 students but released many after warnings 
riot police fired tear gas at yonsei university in western seoul 
and charged into a crowd of students they kicked protesters beat 
them and dragged about 200 away 
in a speech marking the 43rd anniversary of koreas independence 
from japanese colonial rule roh said we cannot any longer 
tolerate activities which destroy free democracy our way of life 
he said the olympics will bring east and the west together and 
peoples around the world are praying for the success of the 
games therefore the people and the government will not forgive 
anyone who spoils the festival through mob action or the throwing 
of firebombs no matter for what plausible cause 
roh delivered a similar warning friday accusing radical 
students and dissidents of siding with north korea and trying to 
overthrow the government 
in the speech monday he also proposed a summit with president 
kim il sung of north korea to discuss the future of the peninsula 
which was divided at the end of world war ii similar proposals in 
the past have led nowhere but the two koreas are considering 
parliamentary talks on easing tension 
a few hours after the speech thousands of radical students 
rallied at yonsei and tried to march into the streets on their way 
to the border 
troopers in green combat fatigues and blackvisored helmets 
fired tear gas and charged the protesters who shouted unite the 
fatherland and yankee go home 
students who did not resist huddled in groups on the ground 
clinging to each other as policemen beat them with fists and even 
riot shields 
senior officers hit and slapped their own men in an attempt to 
stop the beatings one commander slashed at troopers with a riding 
crop 
many students apparently decided to let themselves be arrested 
a change from their normal tactic of violent resistance about 100 
members of the unification vanguard tied themselves together so 
police would have to arrest them as a group 
among those detained were 12 leaders who were to have 
represented south korea at the talks monday in panmunjom 
police blocked a similar march to panmunjom on june 10 about 
3000 radical students tried to march monday a much smaller number 
than in june and there was virtually no evidence of public support 
the radicals a small but powerful minority on campuses have 
seized on national unification in their campaign against the 
government 
south korean authorities declared mondays march illegal and 
deployed 25000 riot police in seoul to stop it they insist that 
all dialogue with north korea be conducted through government 
channels 
when their march from yonsei was blocked monday students 
regrouped on campus and surged out with rocks and firebombs to do 
battle for an hour with about 7000 riot police volleys of tear 
gas were fired from armored police vans 
about 600 protesters were arrested downtown and in other parts 
of seoul in one confrontation in the heart of the capital 700 
students lay down on the pavement with their hands interlocked as 
police charged and 200 were taken away 
student leaders told a rally at yonsei they would not stop 
trying to oust the roh government and reunite korea dozens of 
students cut their fingers with razors and wrote four korean 
letters meaning national unification in blood 
they denounced the united states saying washington supports 
military rule in south korea and demanded withdrawal of the 42000 
us troops based here under a mutual defense treaty

estonians have been told for the first 
time by staterun media of the secret agreement between nazi 
germany and josef stalin that paved the way 49 years ago for soviet 
takeover of the three independent baltic states 
activists who have been pressing for an independent estonia 
claim publication of the molotovribbentrop pacts secret protocols 
portends a change in kremlin policy 
the only normal and acceptable situation for us is complete 
independence eve parnaste an activist with the unofficial 
estonian independence party said in an interview i am 
personally convinced that within two years estonia will again be an 
independent country 
advocates of a lessradical change say the public airing of the 
pact is a long overdue result of reform but one that will allow 
open discussion of estonias turbulent history 
the resurgence of nationalist feeling in estonia latvia and 
lithuania poses a thorny problem for soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev who also faces ethnic unrest in armenian and azerbaijan 
and elsewhere 
details of the molotovribbentrop pact signed on aug 23 1939 
were disclosed by the newspaper voice of the nation on wednesday 
and thursday and during a friday broadcast of estonian radio 
the first official disclosure of the secret agreement in the 
estonianlanguage daily makes clear that the states of estonia 
latvia and lithuania were forcibly occupied by soviet troops 
according to tallinn residents who translated part of the newspaper 
report for the associated press 
the disclosure has stirred up nationalist sentiments among some 
estonians who say it nullifies moscows political hold on the 
republic 
activists in the republics demonstrated last year on the 48th 
anniversary of the signing of the pact demanding that its 
provisions be made public 
nationalist sentiment is likely to surface again on the 49th 
anniversary ms parnaste and other activists said they have 
notified authorities that they will demonstrate in tallinns 
central square and lay flowers in tribute to the victims of 
stalinism 
thousands rallied last year on the anniversary here and in riga 
while the memorial in the lithuanian capital of vilnius drew about 
500 people 
janis liegzdins of the latvian club for environmental protection 
and ainars vilcens of the movement for latvian national 
independence were in tallinn over the weekend to meet with 
activists about anniversary plans liegzdins said 20000 latvians 
are expected to turn out for an unsanctioned rally in riga on aug 
23 
the pact that was an official secret but generally known among 
residents of the baltic states instituted a nonaggression policy 
between moscow and berlin while the soviets occupied the baltics 
and hitler invaded poland 
the first article about the pact was accompanied by a photograph 
of stalin toasting the agreement with its signatories soviet 
foreign minister vyacheslav molotov and german foreign minister 
joachim ribbentrop 
the newspapers were obtained here by the ap and many tallinn 
residents reported hearing the radio broadcast during a popular 
program friday 
for the first time people here got to know of the secret 
additional treaty between molotov and ribbentrop dividing spheres 
of influence between the soviet union and germany said 
journalist andres raid now for the first time historians admit 
this was aggression 
felix undusk a leader of the first unofficial political party 
sanctioned by communist party officials said many estonians have 
known for years of the secret agreement but official airing of the 
pact will allow open discussion for the first time 
there was happiness that finally there has been official 
recognition of this that theyve come to this point undusk 
said 
his group known as the peoples front was formed earlier this 
year to work for broader implementation of the reforms outlined by 
gorbachev 
undusk says his organization which claims 60000 members is 
not separatist but wants to give estonians more control over their 
republics affairs 
one prominent tallinn resident who is familiar with the 
organizations policies and supports them said the groups ultimate 
aim is to return power to citizens of estonian nationality and 
close the borders to nonestonians 
the native populations resentment of russian domination has 
surfaced in repeated demonstrations this year and has been 
addressed to some degree by party officials 
estonian party leader karl vaino was replaced by a native 
estonian vajno vaelaes one party official who did not want to be 
identified said vaino is a russian whose name orignally was vainov 
party officials also lifted a 48yearold ban on public display 
of the blue black and white flag of independent estonia and 
growing number of residents of this capital city are sporting 
ribbons and pins with the national colors small flags are sold at 
a cooperative store in tallinns old town for about 840 
the 1977 soviet constitution allows the population of a region 
to secede from the union although all past attempts have been 
halted quickly by moscow 
a referendum for secession of an entire republic has never been 
put to a vote however the unofficial political parties in estonia 
plan to present candidates for next years contested elections to a 
new governmental body which in turn will choose the membership of 
the republics legislature and executive body which are empowered 
to present issues for public vote

republicans opened their 34th national 
convention today with an unusual morning session as 
nomineeinwaiting george bush revealed from afar he has narrowed 
his list of potential running mates the first order of business 
was an attack on democrat michael dukakis as a champion of the 
failed liberal policies of yesterday 
what a country exclaimed comedian yakov smirnoff after 
reciting the pledge of allegiance to a surprisingly large 
midmorning gathering of delegates in the cavernous louisiana 
superdome 
bush remained in washington as president reagan prepared a 
primetime farewell address to republicans who twice launched him 
to landslide victories 
i think the president will be very personal and the crowd 
reaction may be emotional said kenneth duberstein the white 
house chief of staff its going to be a grand salute to the 
president 
reagans remarks also were intended to arouse political passions 
for bush his loyal lieutenant 
with bush trailing dukakis in most national polls the attacks 
on democrats began early with speeches by former secretary of state 
alexander haig and former delaware gov pete du pont two of the 
five men bush defeated en route to wednesday nights nomination 
the vice president spent his morning in a round of television 
interview shows fending off questions about his running mate 
i think my choice will be widely accepted when i decide on who 
that choice is bush said 
ive not decided bush said asked if he were leaning toward 
someone bush replied yes of course but toward some people 
id say his campaign manager lee atwater said he thought bush 
might have actually decided on someone 
meanwhile the rhetoric began in earnest in new orleans 
our party has brought america back to economic strength and 
george bush a man with unequalled experience in government is the 
man who will put its newest ideas to work said du pont 
looking back at last months democratic convention du pont 
said the most interesting thoughts of that gathering came not 
from its presidential candidate who represents the failed liberal 
policies of yesterday no the most interest thoughts came from the 
rev jesse jackson 
to a bare sprinkle of applause du pont argued that the 
republican party was more suited to jackson and invited him to 
switch his allegiance 
haig putting aside the harsh criticism of bush he sounded 
during the primary campaign said the vice president represents 
safe and progressive change for america safe in that george bush 
will build on the solid accomplishments of the reagan presidency 
americans know that michael dukakis will trash them haig 
declared 
unlike du pont haig did not spare jackson from criticism 
noting that jackson frequently says a bird needs two wings to fly 
haig said maybe he forgot some birds with two wings cannot fly 
at all like the extinct dodo bird that was too stupid to defend 
itself or the ostrich which prefers to live with danger by ignoring 
it 
amid intense speculation about bushs running mate former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole said on cbs this 
morning i do not expect to be asked to be vice president 
her husband sen bob dole of kansas also a prospect said i 
think elizabeth would be an excellent choice 
the vice president his understudy days nearing an end will 
arrive here tuesday just as reagan leaves town for a long vacation 
at his california ranch in a symbolic passing of the baton the 
two men will meet briefly at the airport before bush heads downtown 
for a big welcoming rally 
its a big moment for me its the culmination of a lot of 
years of politics bush told one interviewer it feels like 
this is it 
speaking about his selection of a running mate bush said i 
think its a very important choice and theres a lot of very good 
people from whom to make a selection i think my choice will be 
widely accepted when i decide on who that choice is 
are people who have asked not to be considered actually off his 
list well i wouldnt say that at all i havent made up my mind 
yet bush said 
aides said bush may depart from his plan to make his decision 
known on thursday and instead unveil his choice wednesday night 
then make a dramatic appearance before the convention the same 
timetable reagan employed eight years ago when he named bush as his 
vice presidential choice 
dole sen dan quayle of indiana and rep jack kemp of new york 
acted like they were auditioning for the job appearing on sunday 
talk shows to bash democratic presidential hopeful michael dukakis 
sen alan simpson of wyoming took himself off the list of 
potential candidates saying i would be a liability for george 
as a result of advocating curbs on social security veterans 
funding 
the newest name in the fastchurning gossip mill was howard 
baker the former white house chief of staff republicans outside 
the campaign were urging bush to take another look at the former 
senate leader a source said 
attorney general dick thornburgh sworn in only friday made 
clear he was available i have a job to do for this president and 
until ive heard anything from the vice president im ready to go 
to work as attorney general 
many delegates seemed content to wait for bushs decision it 
adds a little cajun spice to the convention said rhode island 
gop chairman j michael levesque otherwise it would be dull 
this fabled party town seemed anything but dull with delegates 
packed into parties and brunches from the french quarter to the 
private homes in the fashionable garden district visitors could 
barely go anywhere without hearing jazz the new orleans anthem 
the president eager to pass on power to his loyal lieutenant 
used his welcoming rally sunday to give a preview of his primetime 
convention address tonight 
he called last months democratic convention in atlanta the 
biggest masquerade since last years mardi gras 
the masquerade is over reagan said its time to talk 
issues to use the dreaded l word to say the policies of our 
opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are 
liberal liberal liberal 
the crowd chanted four more years four more years for the 
president a reminder of the difficulty bush faces in trying to win 
the same enthusiastic support that reagan enjoyed in two landslide 
victories 
bush is not reagan said sen james mcclure ridaho i 
wouldnt say he would enjoy as lopsided victories as reagan did 
in the aftermath of the democratic convention polls showed bush 
trailing dukakis by as much as 17 points more recent surveys show 
bush has narrowed the gap but his own staff believes he still is 
behind by about 8 to 10 points

here is the transcript of the speech by 
former secretary of state alexander m haig jr to the republican 
national convention on monday 
mr chairman fellow republicans ladies and gentlemen 
i am honored to address the opening session of our partys 
convention for me this occasion is also a reunion with my former 
colleagues from the republican primary debates we had our 
differences then but we are all agreed on one thing now we are 
dedicated to making george bush the next president of the united 
states 
i am confident that in november the people will choose george 
bush because he represents safe and progressive change for america 
safe in that george bush will build on the solid accomplishments of 
the reagan presidency 
americans know michael dukakis will trash them 
thanks to the reaganbush achievements of the past eight years 
americas international standing has been literally transformed 
when i last spoke to a republican convention in 1980 we saw a 
nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom the soviets were on 
the march everywhere afghanistan had been seized soviet 
surrogates were triumphant in kampuchea southern africa and 
central america a cruel war raged in the persian gulf our allies 
were disheartened and freedom was in retreat and all the democrats 
could offer was indecision and malaise 
today eight years later the policy of peace through strength 
has begun to pay off the russians are leaving afghanistan their 
surrogates in africa and asia are in trouble the persian gulf 
conflict is drawing to a conclusion 
the soviets are negotiating our arms control agenda of reduction 
and cuts designed not to increase soviet superiority democracy 
not communism is on the march george bush helped make this happen 
and he is indeed the safe candidate for america 
but he also knows what changes are needed to strengthen the most 
successful administration in recent history the bush team has made 
progressive change central to our party platform at this convention 
in contrast hard evidence confirms that governor dukakis is not 
the candidate of safe progressive change but the candidate of 
radical and dangerous change 
he does not believe in peace through strength as chief 
executive of the state of massachusetts he has steadfastly refused 
to permit the critical warning and communication facility the 
ground wave emergency network gwen to be built in his state 
leaving a serious gap in our nations defense 
he will turn over our global peacekeeping obligations 
exclusively to international organizations the un or the oas in 
the third world he will resurrect the sterile policies of george 
mcgovern

you think you know your favorite beatles songs 
right but can you remember all the lyrics and can you get all the 
correct words in the correct places psychologists want to know 
for example in the song rocky raccoon what comes after the 
opening line now somewhere in the black mountain hills of 
dakota answer the second line is there lived a young boy 
named rocky raccoon 
researchers asked 76 duke university students to recall and 
write down all the words to 32 beatles songs they were given only 
the title and the first line of each 
the purpose was to gain insight into how the mind remembers say 
researchers david rubin of duke and ira hyman of emory university 
in atlanta 
half the students were assigned one group of 32 randomly chosen 
songs the others were given a different group of 32 tunes 
researchers analyzed the students performance on the 25 
bestremembered songs multiplying the number of lines in those 
songs times the 38 students assigned each song gave a maximum 
possible score of 16416 recollections 
the students achieved only 3378 with any degree of accuracy 
but the interesting thing hyman said sunday at the annual 
meeting of the american psychological association is that recall 
for details of the lines they remembered was remarkably good 
of the 3378 lines students wrote down they recalled 2371 
without error 454 more with only one error and 227 with only two 
errors 
and even the flawed lines generally followed the meaning rhythm 
and poetic features of the original suggesting people use those 
characteristics to recall such material hyman said 
for example rhythm and rhyme were preserved in such errors as 
remembering the phrase and you know you should be glad as and 
you know you cant be sad from the hit she loves you 
only four of 32 students in one group remembered that rocky 
raccoon was carrying a gun to shoot off the legs of his rival 
but some guesses were close such as to shoot off the head or hands 
or shoot out the lights of the man who stole his woman 
rhyming words at the end of lines were well recalled but 
sometimes there was some unintentional editing one student turned 
wonder how you manage to feed the rest from lady madonna 
into wonder how you manage to be caressed 
sometimes a flubbed phrase didnt even rhyme with the original 
having read the book from the song a day in the life became 
having read the play in one students version 
other errors kept the same sounds within lines as when the 
phrase always know sometimes think its me from strawberry 
fields forever became always though sometimes think its 
free 
in another case from yesterday the line i said something 
wrong now i long for yesterday became i must move along but i 
long for yesterday 
and as for the student who wrote for efficient finger pies 
while trying to recall a four of fish and finger pies from the 
song penny lane maybe he just never heard it right in the 
first place

cardinal jozef glemp on monday 
condemned abortion pornography and sexual promiscuity in a speech 
that ignored the nations pressing social and economic problems 
the primates address to 150000 pilgrims who had gathered at 
the jasna gora monastery outside czestochowa marked a significant 
departure from sermons in recent years that have taken polands 
communist leadership to task on a variety of issues 
the sermon came three days after glemp met with polish leader 
gen wojciech jaruzelski to discuss ways to speed up economic and 
political reforms 
glemp made no reference to the banned trade union solidarity 
which this month marks the eighth anniversary of the strikes that 
launched the outlawed federation but scores of redandwhite 
solidarity banners covered the iron gates below the monastery 
a white flag with solidarity lettered across it in red was 
raised by warsaw solidarity activist seweryn jaworski the homemade 
banner flew in full view of church dignitaries seated on a 
temporary outdoor platform and could be seen by the pilgrims massed 
in a field below 
throngs of polish pilgrims from across the nation come together 
for the feast day of our lady of czestochowa regarded as polands 
patron saint they huddled under umbrellas for protection from the 
heat but dozens fainted 
the 14th century monastery is the home of the black madonna 
icon an agedarkened painting of the virgin mary dating to the 8th 
or 9th century which some believers credit with miraculous powers 
it is polands most revered religious symbol 
in the 20minute sermon glemp made no mention of the event many 
poles consider the miracle of the 20th century the aug 15 1920 
victory by jozef pilsudski over the red army in a battle known as 
the miracle on the vistula referring to the river which cuts 
through warsaw that the soviets failed to crossthe victory then 
saved poland from soviet rule 
glemp in june attended celebrations marking the 1000 
anniversary of christianity in the soviet union and he hopes to 
visit the soviet union again perhaps as early as this fall 
in the past glemp has used the feast day sermon as an occasion 
to deliver major polish church policy statements 
last year the primate urged the polish government to work 
toward establishing diplomatic relations with the vatican in 1986 
glemp warned polish leaders not to embark on a campaign to teach 
atheism in the nations schools 
in mondays sermon however glemp followed church teachings 
against abortion pornography and sexual promiscuity and urged the 
pilgrims to practice sexual purity 
his strongest attacks were leveled against the practice of in 
vitro fertilization and abortion 
every destruction of joined human cells is the killing of a 
human being glemp said 
the church estimates that 94 percent of the nations 375 
million people are catholics

peasants in southern china have cut down and 
stolen more than 10000 trees from a staterun forest since the 
beginning of this year an official newspaper said monday 
the legal daily said thousands of peasants have entered the 
wugong mountain forest in jiangxi province felling and stealing 
trees to be used in construction and for fuel in one incident in 
april the falling trees injured forest rangers 
the report said illegal logging has been increasing because 
officials fine only the most serious offenders while others are 
asked to write selfcriticisms 
last year 247100 acres of forests in china were destroyed by 
illegal logging and 245 million in trees stolen the china daily 
reported in march 
in a related incident aug 6 about 30 farmers were injured when 
they tried to stop 20000 peasants from picking clean a field with 
almost 600000 worth of watermelons the legal daily said

alexander haig a former gop presidential 
candidate today contrasted george bushs safe and progressive 
policies with those of michael dukakis whom he called the 
diminutive clerk from massachusetts 
in a morning adress to the republican national convention haig 
said bush would pursue reagan administrations policies that have 
put the united states in a stronger position worldwide 
haig who served as president reagans first secretary of state 
dropped out of the republican presidential race on feb 12 four 
days before the new hampshire primary 
at the time he endorsed sen bob dole of kansas for president 
and made little effort to conceal his dislike of vice president 
bush the partys designated presidential nominee 
today haig backed bush saying the vice president represented 
safe and progressive change safe in that george bush will build 
on the solid accomplishments of the reagan presidency 
he said americans are in a better position now than they were 
eight years ago before reagan was elected 
when i last spoke to a republican convention in 1980 we saw a 
nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom haig said 
today eight years later the policy of peace through strength 
has begun to pay off 
haig stressed the differences between dukakis the massachusetts 
governor chosen as the democratic presidential nominee and his 
running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
you have to admit atlanta was good theater haig said 
referring to the democrats convention last month it was an 
offbroadway revival of the odd couple starring the diminutive 
clerk from massachusetts and the tall stranger from texas 
but when you look at the real dukakisbentsen foreign 
policies you have to ask are they running against us or against 
each other the two men differ on some foreign policy issues 
including military aid for the nicaraguan contra rebels dukakis 
opposes the aid bentsen supports it 
haig also compared the democratic party to a bat flying 
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down 
for extended periods in dark damp caves up to its navel in guano

jack kemps friends gave him a football 
jersey that had the number 2 on its back not the former 
professional quarterbacks playing number but the one of the job he 
seems to be seeking 
could i be a good vice president you bet kemp the new 
york congressman said monday as the republican national convention 
was opening 
i was a good second string quarterback and i can be a good 
second string quarterback for george bush 
like the rest of the convention kemp is awaiting bushs word on 
a running mate for the republican ticket this fall 
kemp who dropped out of the race for the republican 
presidential nomination after failing to win a primary is taking a 
highly visible role in new orleans during the convention all the 
while insisting hes not campaigning for the vice presidential 
nomination not expecting it not sitting by the telephone 
but kemps enthusiastically loyal conservative followers have 
been campaigning on his behalf and hundreds of them jammed a new 
orleans hotel sunday night to cheer wildly his every word and 
present the jersey to the former quarterback for the san diego 
chargers and buffalo bills 
hey my number was 15 he said feigning surprise 
speaking to reporters a day later kemp said he wasnt 
campaigning for the job while with his usual enthusiasm suggesting 
hed really like it 
if i were to be asked i would be a terrific campaigner and a 
terrific candidate and a terrific vice president kemp said 
but i came here not expecting it i dont expect it today im 
not sitting by the telephone 
im going to campaign just as vigorously for george bush off 
the ticket as i would on the ticket kemp said 
if he asks i would want it if he doesnt ask said 
kemp not finishing his thought 
kemp who likes to deliver a message that combines economic 
conservatism with an appeal to broaden the party to include 
minorities never won more than 13 percent of the vote in the 
initial republican primaries that was in spite of his emergence as 
a favorite of many of the partys conservative wing 
conservative activists pushing his candidacy point to his 
youthful appearance his appeal to blacks and other minorities and 
to his background in california where he was born and educated as 
potential boosts to the ticket 
some supporters acknowledge however that kemp might not be 
best suited to the role of a negative attacking campaigner if that 
is what the bush campaign decides it wants in a vice president 
kemp suggested that himself when he said i do not believe the 
purpose of the vice president is to tear down to diminish to show 
disdain to show disrespect to bash 
one leading kemp booster around new orleans has been sen gordon 
humphrey rnh who has led a campaign pressuring bush to pick a 
running mate that is from the partys most conservative wing kemp 
would fill that description 
if bush was watching tonight or the bush operatives theyd 
have to be impressed humphrey said as he left the huge reception 
kemp sponsored it was almost climactic 
with bush keeping silent on his choice much of the speculation 
has centered around other names one questioner asked kemp if it 
didnt appear that bush seemed to be suggesting he wants to pick 
someone like kemp but not kemp himself 
kemps answer recalled democrat jesse jacksons measured 
response after he was passed over for the no 2 spot on that 
partys ticket last month 
i am too cool im too collected im too qualified to answer 
that question kemp said who knows

china soon will give its workers a large raise 
and link further pay increases to its inflation rate to stave off 
growing unrest in its cities sources said monday 
the move marks a step back from ambitious price reforms 
undertaken in the last few years but the plan still should be 
considered a victory for liberalminded reformers such as communist 
party leader zhao ziyang the chinese sources said 
the sources said premier li peng vice premier yao yilin and 
other conservatives have called for a freeze on reforms which are 
slowly opening the economy to market forces 
both sources who spoke on condition of anonymity recently 
attended meetings of top government officials in the resort town of 
bedaihe 
the sources said the new plan to link pay with price rises would 
be announced in about a month 
it will allow the reforms to continue and that is the critical 
point said one source 
he estimated that the average workers annual salary of 246 
would go up at least 8 percent the other said urban workers could 
be getting a 28 percent raise 
if prices rise they said the workers would be given further 
wage increases 
the sources said the pay increases would replace subsidies of 
about 270 a month that the government has been giving urban 
workers to offset inflation the highest in chinas 39year history 
as a communist nation 
prices in june were 19 percent higher than they were in june 
1987 according to the state statistical bureau 
the inflation has hit urban workers the hardest peasants who 
make up 75 percent of chinas 107 billion people generally have 
missed some price increases because they produce their own food 
inflation has been rising in china because the government has 
pushed farreaching economic reforms aimed at ending state controls 
over prices and allowing the value of goods to be controlled by the 
market 
in may the government raised the stateset prices of 
vegetables pork sugar and eggs by about 60 percent in late july 
it increased the price of brandname cigarettes and spirits by as 
much as 790 percent 
the elimination of governmentfixed prices has caused the cost 
of some goods to soar as the economy fails to keep up with rising 
consumer demand 
in addition interest rates in chinese banks are much lower than 
the inflation rate so consumers want to spend now before their 
money loses too much value 
the chinese sources said that under the plan banks will also 
raise their interest rates to encourage saving the economic daily 
ran a frontpage editorial monday calling for such a move 
in may the official xinhua news agency quoted li peng and other 
chinese officials as saying riots and other signs of social turmoil 
were on the increase in china 
the sources said that in addition to placating workers the 
goverment was raising salaries to increase worker productivity 
we cant continue with the reforms if the economy isnt 
growing said one source 
the chinese sources interviewed separately described 
themselves as members of zhaos liberal camp

rangoon was quiet monday and burmese 
crowded in front of a hospital to search for names of friends and 
relatives on a list of the casualties in last weeks violence a 
western tourist reported 
there were calls for more protest and thai officials said 
burmese authorities closed a crossing between thailands ranong 
province and the market town of victoria point in burmas 
southernmost province of megui 
last week security forces in victoria point were said to have 
turned against the authoritarian military government and allowed 
thousands of protesters to march unhindered

to be chosen friday will make dramatic changes in the oneparty 
system ne win installed 26 years ago

chairman of the burma socialist program party after five days of 
rioting in rangoon and two dozen other towns and cities across the

17 days in office produced a popular uprising against the 
quartercentury of repression economic disaster and isolation 
rangoon radio said at least 95 people were killed and 240 
wounded last week but western diplomats believe the toll was 
several times greater they said it appeared most victims were 
unarmed hit by bullets fired into crowds by soldiers and police

press he visited the hospital saturday and saw about 300 people who 
were wounded in the rioting

appealed for peace and the rule of law the radio said it reported 
a similar meeting sunday involving islamic leaders 
on sunday western diplomats reached by telephone in rangoon 
said students were handing out leaflets calling for prodemocracy 
protests now that they had achieved the resignation of sein lwin a 
former general hated for brutally suppressing dissent during the ne 
wins rule 
student demands include a multiparty system restoration of 
civil rights release of political prisoners student unions and 
control of inflation

community of burmese emigres 
chayachok chulsiriwongse a thai scholar said ne win remains as 
elder statesman behind the scenes and sein lwins successor 
probably would come from the serving or retired military officers 
who formed his hierarchy

michael dukakis will weaken america by withdrawing support for 
the mx and the migitman missiles and reduce sdi to a constrained 
research and development program until recently he has even 
opposed the b1 and stealth bombers 
of course the democrats know that people would reject the real 
michael dukakis so as president reagan has said he is traveling 
incognito you have to admit atlanta was good theater it was an 
offbroadway revival of the odd couple starring the diminutive 
clerk from massachusetts and the tall stranger from texas 
but when you look at the real dukakisbentsen foreign policies 
you have to ask yourself are they running against us or are they 
running against each other 
and then theres the reverend jesse jackson who likes to say a 
bird likes to fly on two wings maybe he forgot some birds with 
two wings cant fly at all like the extinct dodo bird that was 
too stupid to defend itself or the ostrich which prefers to live 
with danger by ignoring it 
in fact the more you look at it the less the democratic ticket 
looks like a bird at all its more like a bat blind as a bat 
endowed with the sophisticated sensing mechanisms we saw in atlanta 
but totally unable to differentiate flying erratically for brief 
periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods 
in dark damp caves up to its naval in guano 
lord america doesnt need any more of that and so my friends 
you and i know that next novembers election may be the most 
important since world war ii our efforts this week may be decisive 
in its outcome 
we are in new orleans 
to unify our party 
to endorse our worthy candidate george bush 
to dedicate america to safe and progressive change 
to dedicate ourselves and in behalf of mankind to a world 
guided by rule of law and peace through strength i thank you

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis proclaiming that the us space effort has lost its 
sense of purpose vision and pride under president reagan today 
proposed the creation of a cabinetlevel post to direct the 
nations space program 
despite an annual nasa budget of over 10 billion per year 
our space program is in disarray it suffers from a lack of a 
clearly defined purpose and ineffective top management and our 
space policy is lost in a maze of bureaucratic committees 
dukakis said in a statement issued at a luncheon he attended with 
local elected officials and labor and business leaders 
dukakis echoing comments made earlier in the day in houston by 
his running mate sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said he would also 
back continued development of a permanent manned space station and 
would reestablish a cabinetlevel national aeronautics and space 
council to be chaired by bentsen 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts was in worcester as part 
of a twoday visit to the central part of the state arriving here 
dukakis was met by about 100 protestors about half antiabortion 
and half opponents of his plan to locate a prison in central 
massachusetts 
he was also hosting an event marking the start of the first 
phase of implementation of massachusetts universal health care 
law which will guarantee health insurance to virtually all workers 
by 1990 
dukakis will spend the night at home in brookline outside 
boston and return to several other central massachusetts 
communities tuesday

activists opposed to the governments aids 
policies lay down on the steps of city hall today in a protest at 
the republican national convention where demonstrations have 
resulted in five arrests 
overall organizers say fewer protesters than expected have 
shown up at the convention 
todays demonstration which attracted about 50 people was 
peaceful unlike sundays incident when five gay activists were 
arrested at president reagans welcoming party following a shoving 
match 
before lying down in a symbolic diein protesters at city 
hall called for more government support for social and medical 
programs for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome or 
aids 
on sunday the gay activists were booked on charges of 
disturbing the peace after a scuffle with bystanders during 
reagans welcoming speech at the new orleans convention center 
other demonstrations came off peacefully including one sunday 
at which protesters confronted roman catholic archbishop philip n 
hannan and criticized church policy on homosexuality 
mark schneider a spokesman for care an umbrella group for 
various activists said he had expected 12 national groups to join 
nine local ones for convention protests 
but he said turnout from the national groups was lower than 
that although he was not sure how many groups had shown up 
groups scheduled to demonstrate today the official opening of 
the convention included food emancipation anarchists against 
republicans and democrats and friends of the homeless hope house 
on sunday five protesters with the gay rights group act up were 
arrested after they showed up at reagans speech with signs 
criticizing his aids policy 
a shoving match ensued and fighting broke out police spokesman 
john bryson said he said the protesters started the fight but gay 
activist morris kight of los angeles denied the charge 
a group of young men physically attacked them kight said 
the secret service tried to intervene to protect them but the 
police arrested them 
police said today that all five had been released from jail 
at one end of the french quarter on sunday about 150 women 
representing some 20 feminist groups gathered at armstrong park 
we are here to tell the world that the republican party has 
turned its back on womens rights said molly yard president of 
the national organization for women but this does not let 
the democrats off the hook 
in the incident at jackson square where the archbishop appeared 
the demonstrators staged a homosexual kiss in 
we kiss in an aggressive demonstration of affection said a 
statement demonstrators read through a bullhorn we kiss to 
protest the cruel and painful bigotry that affects the lives of 
lesbians and gay men 
some of the 40 to 50 protesters surged around archbishop hannan 
after he came out of st louis cathedral between morning masses 
were used to demonstrations jackson square is where 
everything happens hannan told a man in a sunday suit as he 
shook hands with parishioners 
two protesters went into an extended clinch just behind hannan 
all i can say is god bless you hannan said when asked for 
comment 
at the democratic convention in atlanta a similar kissin 
led to a shoving match between demonstrators and police but a 
handful of the big easys officers just stood and watched 
thats what we are here easygoing said officer j parker

scientists testifying before congress agree 
the greenhouse effect assures the earth is in for rising 
temperatures and ocean levels they dont agree on when where and 
how severe 
the greenhouse effect is caused by the emission of such gases as 
carbon dioxide and methane trapping heat in the atmosphere 
scientists say steamy weather and crop losses are two of the 
problems people can expect in coming decades 
sen bennett johnston dla chairman of the senate energy and 
natural resources committee and sen tim wirth dcolo have 
pledged to make the greenhouse effect a legislative priority in 
1989 
scientific testimony before the committee last week indicated 
the sharply opposing views being presented to congress 
do nothing until there is less scientific uncertainty said 
policymakers from the reagan administration such as donna 
fitzpatrick associate undersecretary of the department of energy 
get moving now to reduce production of greenhouse gases said 
people such as stephen schneider a climatologist from the national 
center for atmospheric research a boulder colo operation run by 
a consortium of universities 
greenhouseeffect gases come from a variety of sources from the 
burning of coal and other fossil fuels production of such 
chemicals as chlorofluorocarbons the escape of huge amounts of 
methane from rice paddies and the release of carbon dioxide from 
the destruction of forests 
some scientists have cautioned that even if the world reduced 
its production of greenhouse gases those already in the atmosphere 
mean that within 30 to 50 years the planet will have its highest 
temperatures in 10000 years 
fitzpatrick said more knowledge is needed before congress 
commits the nation to combatting the greenhouse effect through the 
type of program proposed in a comprehensive bill introduced by 
johnston wirth and 16 colleagues 
significant gaps exist in our knowledge of the greenhouse 
effect gaps that must be filled if we are to address the concerns 
raised by potential climate change in a scientifically supportable 
manner she said 
these scientific uncertainties must be reduced before we 
commit the nations economic future to drastic and potentially 
misplaced policy responses she said 
schneider characterizing this position as political value 
judgments not scientific opinions said we should not use 
platitudes about scientific uncertainty as an excuse for inaction 
theres a scientific concern that we are assaulting the 
environment much faster than we are understanding it 
more research will certainly put policymaking on a firmer 
scientific basis but it is my opinion that credible details 
about specific winners and losers will not be available before we 
may have committed ourselves to potentially dangerous large 
atmospheric changes he said 
officials from the national aeronautics and space 
administration environmental protection agency and national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration told lawmakers of greenhouse 
research in their agencies 
they stopped short of seconding fitzpatricks stand that nothing 
should be done to combat greenhouse gas production until more 
scientific certainty is attained 
schneider said highleverage actions are long overdue he 
called for steps that would combat greenhouse gases while attacking 
other environmental problems such as acid rain lowlevel ozone 
pollution and destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer by 
chlorofluorocarbons 
he said his first priority would be greater energy efficiency 
and conservation to reduce emissions from power plants and 
vehicles no step he said should be considered too small because 
slowing down the greenhouse effect makes good sense

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen said today that he and running mate michael dukakis support 
continued development of a permanent manned space station as part 
of an allout effort to restore american leadership in exploring 
the universe 
bentsen speaking after a visit to nasas houston spaceflight 
center said he and dukakis had discussed the space station in a 
sunday night telephone conversation and that dukakis had promised 
an intensive review of the space station program in order to 
ensure the success of this important effort 
we will stand behind an allout effort to restore american 
leadership in exploring the universe bentsen said in the midday 
speech which was made available to reporters beforehand 
as part of that effort dukakis said in worcester mass that 
if elected he would create a cabinetlevel position to direct the 
nations space program 
dukakis said in a statement that the space program suffers 
from a lack of a clearly defined purpose and ineffective top 
management our space policy is lost in a maze of bureaucratic 
committees 
president reagan came out for a permanent station in 1984 under 
current plans the 16 billion station is to be assembled in orbit 
beginning in 1995 more than 5 billion in contracts have been 
awarded the house in june approved and sent to the senate 
legislation authorizing spending of 902 million on the station in 
the next fiscal year 
bentsen campaigning through texas while dukakis is in his home 
state of massachusetts recalled the early years of the space 
effort and said one reason we overcame the initial soviet lead 
in space was good organization and strong leadership 
at that time he said a cabinetlevel national aeronautics and 
space council was established chaired by the vice president 
unfortunately the council was abolished by president nixon 
and the reagan administration vetoed an attempt by congress to 
put in back in business he said adding 
one of the reasons i accepted mike dukakis offer to be on the 
ticket was the understanding he would give the vice president a 
major policy role in his administration we agreed that in a 
dukakisbentsen administration the space council would be 
reinstated and i would serve as chairman 
the timing of the announcement in houston gave bentsen an 
opportunity to promise more jobs and more federal spending for his 
home state which will be a major battleground in the fall campaign 
my friends that nails it down bentsen said there should 
be no doubt in houston or anywhere else in the world where a 
dukakisbentsen administration will stand in space 
from houston bentsen was scooting across the state line into 
arkansas for a rally in little rock and then returning to beaumont 
texas for a rally 
he spent sunday resting with a visit to his fathers home near 
mcallen texas reporters were kept away but bentsen spokesman 
mike mccurry said the major event was a gin rummy game won as 
usual by the 94yearold lloyd bentsen sr 
besides recharging the 67yearold senators batteries the stop 
underlined the campaigns effort to point out that bentsen is a 
native texan vice president george bush who receives the 
republican nomination this week claims texas as his home but was 
raised in new england 
dukakis plans to join bentsen in the state later in the week 
and bentsen points out that before he was on the ticket the 
republicans were cocky 
they thought they had this state locked up he told 
reporters 
bentsen speaks confidently of winning texas and houston the 
city both he and bush have called home 
i think well carry houston sure do he said 
bentsen beat bush in texas once before in the 1970 election 
that first put him in the senate he chuckled when reporters asked 
if he was concerned now that bush was moving part of his national 
campaign organization to the state 
no it doesnt worry me he said hes had his operations 
here before 
bentsen is running parallel campaigns for the vice presidency 
and for reelection to his senate seat the dual candidacies are 
allowed under an unusual texas law

the founding chapter of the nations 
largest college fraternity is fighting for its life because of the 
arrests of four members on cocaine charges 
university of alabama officials have ordered the fraternity 
sigma alpha epsilon shut down for two years because of the drug 
arrests 
fraternity leaders are hoping for a favorable ruling in an 
appeal which is expected to be decided this month otherwise the 
fraternitys stately whitecolumned mother chapter will be 
closed until 1991 
despite the suspension the fraternity will recruit members 
during rush week which begins tuesday on this campus where it was 
formed in 1856 it has 210000 members nationally and many 
prominent alumni in this state 
with this going on who knows how many pledges we will have 
said bill smithart a tuscaloosa attorney and sae member who heads 
an alumni board set up to direct the chapter about 1 years ago 
also on tuesday authorities have scheduled an arraignment for 
three of the four arrested chandler eskridge 21 of prattville 
william dodd roberds jr 21 of memphis tenn and john barnette 
jr a junior from atlanta 
the three were indicted on charges of selling cocaine said 
district attorney charles freeman the case against a fourth 
student was closed after a grand jury refused to return an 
indictment 
two of the four were removed from the fraternity and two were 
suspended pending the outcome of the case which includes 
allegations that at one point drugs were sold inside the fraternity 
house 
ken tracey national executive director of sae said each of the 
organizations 200 chapters is watching what happens to the 
60member alabama house sae has initiated more people than any of 
the 60 other national fraternities and it ranks eighth in terms of 
the number of chapters 
we are not holding our chapter accountable these were 
individual arrests in individual cases tracey said in a recent 
telephone interview from sae headquarters in evanston ill 
jonathan brant head of the national interfraternity conference 
said the entire world of greekletter organizations also would be 
interested in the outcome at a time when universities are 
struggling to define their role in regulating student organizations 
brant said the conference is trying to get universities more 
involved in the governing of greek organizations because of an 
apparent increase in the number of problems with alcohol abuse 
drugs hazing and racism 
but many of these things are going on across campus not just 
in fraternities and sororities which have experienced a 
resurgence in popularity this decade said brant total 
undergraduate membership in fraternities nearly doubled from 
230000 in 1980 to 400000 in 1985 after reaching a low of 157000 
in 1970 
officials at the university of alabama made it clear that sae 
despite former prominence has what they consider to be a checkered 
past 
edward whipple director of student life announced the 
suspension in june saying the move was based partly on what he 
called a history of repeated infractions 
i hope that during this twoyear suspension period all sae 
alumni will work together toward the day when we will have a 
drugfree hazingfree chapter of sae at the university of 
alabama whipple said at the time 
associate law dean tom jones will hear the appeal of the 
suspension soon university spokeswoman dale allison said last 
week and university president joab thomas wants to make a final 
decision on the appeal before he vacates the presidency sept 1 to 
return to teaching 
whipples statement mentioned a 1979 probation for hazing of 
pledges and a 1980 probation violation a 1982 case in which the 
fraternity was convicted on six counts of violating the student 
conduct code and 1987 investigations by the university and sae 
national that found a drug problem and extensive hazing in the 
chapter 
smithart and tracey do not deny past problems but both maintain 
the group was caught in the trap of a vengeful college 
administration 
weve got a whole new group of boys and they are being blamed 
for things that happened while they were still in elementary 
school said tracey 
smithart said the fraternity has been doing better in many 
areas including academics its gradepoint average has moved from 
the middle of alabamas 28fraternity pack to second partly as a 
result of hiring a fulltime academic counselor he said 
the chapter has proposed a drugtesting program for members 
smithart said although he said he never believed there was 
widespread drug use in the chapter

war hero family man national leader 
if those phrases dont bring to mind george bush wait until 
republican convention officials wind up four days of primetime 
image building 
im confident that when all is said and done with this 
convention the american people are going to feel very good about 
george bush says convention producer mark goode 
goode derides last months democratic convention as long on 
platitudes and short on substance and maintains his own 
production is not some sort of madison avenue job 
nevertheless planners are leaving little to chance in their 
efforts to highlight what they say is the true nature of their 
standardbearer 
what people will see in their living rooms will be an 
individual who has very selflessly given of himself over many many 
years in a variety of public service positions said goode a 
very committed husband and father an experienced public servant a 
decorated war hero and a loyal vice president who worked very hard 
behind the scenes to help create a lot of the reagan legacy 
goode said there will be an entire host of speeches about 
bushs life and career including one wednesday night in spanish by 
his mexican daughterinlaw 
the speeches were honed to consistency with the convention 
themes an early podium sample from max fisher a detroit real 
estate magnate and chairman of the national jewish republican 
coalition hes not only a war hero hes a peace hero 
roger ailes bushs masterful media adviser produced a film 
about the vice president scheduled for thursday night expect to 
see lots of frolicking with the grandchildren underscoring the 
family man theme 
but dont expect a camera tour of the 11acre family vacation 
compound on the coast of southern maine advisers reportedly were 
concerned about showing evidence of bushs wealth 
something else viewers wont see bush with ronald reagan the 
nearmythical man from whose shadow he must emerge reagans 
farewell with all of its attendant drama and emotion will be long 
over as the spotlight shifts to bush and his family 
the first bush to mount the podium will be george prescott bush 
the prospective nominees 12yearold grandson hell lead the 
pledge of allegiance on tuesday 
young georges parents jeb and columba garnica bush a native 
of leon guanajuato mexico will be speaking wednesday and later 
that night during the roll call son george jr will announce from 
his spot among fellow texas delegates the 111 votes clinching the 
nomination for his father 
to have his son of the same name put him over the top speaks 
about family and the commitment of our family to work hard for the 
person we love george jr said in an interview bushs five 
children are all convention delegates 
the bush presence a healthy 60 counting cousins siblings and 
other relatives culminates thursday night with a speech by barbara 
bush the candidates wife of 43 years the ailes film about bush 
and bushs acceptance speech 
what will he say what we are trying to do in the speech is 
have george bush define where he wants to take the country in the 
next four years goode said he called bushs plans very 
specific 
the bestlaid plans of convention organizers are still subject 
to the whims of the network television executives who determine 
whether anyone outside of cable viewers actually will see their 
careful orchestrations 
the bush film slightly over 7 minutes long is a key thematic 
element an nbc spokeswoman said the network plans to show it all 
the other two networks hadnt yet decided 
but even if the networks wreak havoc with the gops master plan 
that sturdy triad of family man hero and leader we wont be 
thwarted goode said the campaign begins in earnest after the 
convention anyway and those are obviously things that well be 
stressing beyond the convention

roman catholics loyal to the vatican and followers 
of rebel archbishop marcel lefebvre organized competing processions 
monday each attracting about 5000 faithful to renew frances 
350yearold vow of consecration to the virgin mary 
carrying statues and banners of the virgin and chanting hail 
marys the loyalist group in french the traditionalists in 
latin the two sets of marchers added color to downtown streets on 
the assumption day holiday one of the quietest days of the year in 
france 
parisians and tourists at sidewalk cafes turned to watch the 
processions and puffs of incense 
this was the third year of dueling processions on aug 15 but 
the competition was sharpened this year by the recent schism and 
excommunication of lefebvre for consecrating bishops without 
permission from pope john paul ii 
it also drew added attention because monday was the 350th 
anniversary of king louis xiiis vow of frances loyalty to the 
virgin it is celebrated on assumption day which marks the day 
mary was received into heaven 
cardinal jeanmarie lustiger the archbishop of paris led the 
official ceremony at notre dame cathedral 
across the seine river in the latin quarter the traditionalist 
procession was led by monsignor bernard tissier de mallerais one 
of the four bishops lefebvre consecrated in a ceremony june 30 at 
econe switzerland 
lefrebvre was excommunicated for going through with the 
consecrations without papal permission creating the churchs first 
schism in more than a century 
those who remain faithful to monsignor lefebvre will stay in 
the path of grace tissier de mallerais said before the 
procession left the church of st nicolas du chardonnet those 
who do nor remain faithful will lose this grace 
the 17th century church in the ancient latin quarter a few 
short blocks from notre dame has been occupied since 1977 by 
traditionalist worshipers and priests who follow lefebvre in 
rejecting such church reforms as mass said in modern languages 
instead of latin 
lustiger has taken steps recently to try to appeal to the 
traditionalists including establishing the assumption day 
procession three years ago following their example he also said 
mass in latin at notre dame and said the traditional latin mass 
would be used in three paris churches each sunday 
its an effort to coopt people said jeanbaptiste 
chaumeil one of the marchers in the traditionalist procession 
it shows a hypocrisy the french bishops have always been against 
monsignor lefebvre and tried to make sure the negotiations with 
rome would fail 
at the halfway point of their procession at the ruins of the 
roman arena of lutece there was a caged lion which organizers 
said was intended to evoke the martyrdom of early christians and 
symbolize the plight of lefebvres followers 
police estimated the traditionalist procession at about 5000 
people 
roughly the same number were gathered at the same time in 
lateafternoon sunshine in the square in front of notre dame 
cathedral 
huge banners decorated the famous facade including one 
multicolored representation of the virgin holding the christ child 
that was hung between the western towers 
church officials said it reproduced a tapestry said to have hung 
in notre dame in 1638 when king louis xiii dedicated the nation to 
mary 
another banner reproduced the kings words we believed 
ourselves obliged to consecrate our person and our state to the 
grandeur of god 
the processions also were linked to ceremonies worldwide marking 
the end of the roman catholic churchs marian year a period 
designated by the pope for special devotion to the mother of jesus

despite her 
fear of flying pearl bailey is riding helicopters and small 
aircraft this week in a visit to the us navy in the gulf 
its not a new experience for the 70yearold singer who 
recalls doing her first show for servicemen in 1941 and has been 
among the professional entertainers on the united service 
organizations better known as the uso circuit ever since 
the reason i do it is simple she said i tell em that 
nobody promised them the bright lights of broadway out here but 
one thing we did promise them is that we wouldnt forget them and 
thats why im here 
miss bailey and a fivemember band headed by her husband jazz 
drummer louie bellson performed sunday and monday for audiences 
aboard the coronado the flagship of the navys 27ship regional 
task force 
earlier they performed aboard the aircraft carrier carl m 
vinson and the submarine tender emory s land in the arabian sea 
miss bailey who starred in a broadway production of hello 
dolly in the 1960s conceded that most of the sailors whose 
average age is about 23 have only a vague idea of who she is 
but she won a standing ovation for her show which featured 
chicago and the battle hymn of the republic a song that 
she said a voice told me to sing in every show i ever do 
afterward despite the debilitating heat and an inflamed knee 
she signed autographs for more than an hour 
most of them didnt know who she was but now they do said 
marcus hutchins a sailor from east orange nj it was a great 
show its wonderful that shed come out to the gulf and share her 
love for us 
men from the missile cruiser halsey moored alongside the 
coronado the missile frigate vandegrift and several us mine 
sweepers also were present 
for mondays second performance her last before returning home 
the navy invited officers and crew from two british ships the 
frigate southampton and the mine sweeper middleton 
in addition to performing miss bailey is a member of the us 
delegation to the un general assembly her uso tour originally 
scheduled for june was postponed after a us warship hit a mine 
miss bailey said the uso funded by contributions from 
foundations corporations and other private sources involves many 
visits to military hospitals as well as performing 
although the pace is grueling she said more professional 
entertainers should visit what she called the far corners the 
woods and places 
she said she fears flying so much that at home she either 
drives crosscountry or takes amtrak trains 
a lot of people are gonna ask how did the amtrak girl get 
out there well im good but i dont walk on water

us industrial production shot up 08 percent 
in july the biggest increase in nine months the government said 
monday in a report which intensified economists worries about 
rising inflationary pressures 
the federal reserve said the large july advance was widespread 
throughout us manufacturing industries and also reflected heavy 
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave 
the 08 percent july advance was double the 04 percent june 
increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial 
production has risen it was the largest increase since a 11 
percent rise last october 
the economy has a tremendous head of steam said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co it increasingly looks 
like an oldfashioned boom in the industrial sector with strong 
demand and production pressures bringing on inflation 
many economists had been expecting a strong july increase given 
the fact the labor department already had reported that 
manufacturing employment rose by 68000 jobs in july the largest 
increase this year 
we are seeing an industrial sector that is surging under the 
impact of increased exports and higher capital spending said 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers 
but jasinowski said some of the strength in july was overstated 
reflecting the increased electrical demand and some unwanted 
buildup in inventories 
people ought not be frightened by these hefty industrial 
production numbers because the inventory buildup we have been 
seeing shows that there is still slack in the economy he said 
other analysts said the federal reserve would likely read the 
new figures as further evidence of an overheated economy that needs 
to be cooled down by additional increases in interest rates 
last week the central bank boosted its discount rate onehalf 
percentage point to 65 percent raising the discount rate the fee 
the federal reserve charges for lending to commercial banks is the 
most dramatic signal the fed can send of its intent to fight 
inflation by dampening demand through higher interest rates 
many economists said they expect further fed tightening in 
upcoming weeks especially in light of the strong industrial 
production figures 
the fed is facing increasing evidence of more strength than 
desired in the economy said david jones an economist with 
aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer this 
growth is too rapid at a time when we are nearly fully employed in 
the labor force and are running up against capacity restraints in 
many industries 
the manufacturing sector has been the star of the economy this 
year as american producers have enjoyed strong foreign sales 
brought on by a weaker dollar 
the export boom has prompted a related surge in business 
investment to expand production facilities to meet the rising 
demand reflecting this increase the industrial production report 
showed that output of business equipment increased 1 percent in 
july continuing a trend that has pushed output in this sector up 
97 percent above where it was a year ago the fastest increase of 
any sector 
the overall july increase came despite the fact that auto output 
actually fell autos were assembled at an annual rate of 71 
million units down from a pace of 75 million units in june 
production of light trucks also decreased during the month 
production of consumer goods was up 03 percent in july with 
gains in both appliance production and nondurable goods sectors 
output of construction supplies fell for the second consecutive 
month dropping 03 percent following a 01 percent decline in 
june the report blamed a strike in the lumber industry for the 
weakness 
overall output by us manufacturers climbed 08 percent and 
now stands 56 percent higher than a year ago in july production 
of durable goods items expected to last at least three years and 
nondurable goods both rose 08 percent 
utility production climbed 06 percent following a huge 25 
percent june increase with both months showing heavy demand for air 
conditioning 
output at the nations mines including oil and gasdrilling 
activities rose 06 percent in july this sector is now producing 
at a rate 49 percent higher than a year ago 
total output stood at 1377 percent of its 1977 base of 100

a federal judge stepped down from the bench 
monday to return to private legal practice leaving fewer than a 
dozen black women among the nations federal trial judges 
us district judge gabrielle mcdonald said she considered that 
statistic when deciding to leave the bench after nine years 
one of the most pressing concerns i have is my race and my 
sex because i know i have brought to the bench a different 
perspective she said the federal judiciary is an institution 
and an institution should reflect society 
however she said i think ive done all i can do here for 
me its time to move on 
a desire to return to private practice rather than 
philosophical considerations prompted her to leave the bench 
im not so much leaving but resuming what i did the years 
before i came here mrs mcdonald said i want to practice 
quality law 
but she also cited overloaded dockets and lack of support 
services as reasons for returning to private practice she said 
budget cutbacks had left each federal judge in houston struggling 
to handle more than 1000 cases without enough employeees or 
adequate computer systems to handle the work 
sen lloyd bentsen now the democrats vice presidential 
nominee recommended mrs mcdonald for a federal judgeship when she 
was a lawyer handling employment discrimination cases 
i feel very very loyal to senator bentsen she said for 
him to appoint me when i had a reputation for suing on behalf of 
minorities that took courage 
mrs mcdonald was sworn in may 31 1979 whens she was 37 and 
became the first black and the third woman to assume a federal 
judgeship in texas 
her race came into play in several of her cases 
the grand dragon of the ku klux klan in 1981 asked her to step 
aside in a lawsuit brought by vietnamese shrimpers who claimed they 
were being harassed by klan members 
mrs mcdonald refused the request pointing out that the grand 
dragon had never heard her express a personal opinion about the 
klan 
her race became an issue again when she presided over a dispute 
about attorneys fees in a package of voting rights lawsuits 
brought against the city of houston the suits eventually led to 
changes in the way the city council is elected 
the city asked her to step down from the case in 1984 saying 
that as a black she was a plaintiff in the classaction suits filed 
on behalf of hispanic and black voters 
mrs mcdonald refused to bow out and her decision was upheld by 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
if the 5th circuit had not affirmed i expect i would have 
left the bench then thats how important it was she said a 
decision not to affirm would have rendered me a secondclass 
citizen

wyoming officials today refused to 
acknowledge the state violated federal election laws in its 
handling of absentee ballots setting up a showdown in court 
against the us government 
at issue is when the states county clerks mailed out absentee 
ballots for tuesdays primary elections 
some counties sent the ballots just 26 days before the election 
the us justice department prefers that ballots be sent at least 
30 days in advance 
wyoming officials today said they refused to sign a justice 
department stipulation saying they violated the law and agreeing to 
count any ballots received through aug 22 six days after the us 
senate and house primaries 
we are not going to enter into a consent order said wyoming 
secretary of state kathy karpan 
she said she expected the justice department to go into federal 
court later today to obtain a court order imposing the sixday 
extension 
state officials believe fewer than 1000 absentee ballots are at 
stake 
karpan and state attorney general joseph meyer said they do not 
believe the state violated any election laws 
there is no set date in the statute that says absentee 
ballots must be mailed so many days before a primary said ms 
karpan there are no rules and regs so were not so sure that 
were not in compliance

state health officials have canceled a 17 
million contract with an ad agency to produce youthoriented 
nosmoking commercials because the agency merged with another which 
has a tobacco company account 
the incident shows how long the tentacles of the tobacco 
industry are said kathy harty manager of the state health 
departments section on nonsmoking and health 
the campbellmithun agency based in minneapolis recently 
merged with new yorkbased william esty which has a 35 million 
account with brown amp williamson tobacco co 
campbellmithun which had a twoyear contract with the state 
developed and produced television and radio spots that have been 
broadcast regularly around the state since january one shows 
students falling over dominofashion from the bad breath of a 
teenage girl smoker another highlights the smelly odor left in 
smokers clothes 
the campaign rather than focusing on longterm health risks of 
smoking emphasized the lowered personal attractiveness and social 
isolation of the smoker 
the us department of health and human services recently began 
airing animated public service ads with a similar tone 
characterizing smokers as buttheads and pariahs 
harty said friday that campbellmithun would be replaced by the 
martinwilliams agency of minneapolis for at least two years 
the contract with campbellmithun had just been renewed when its 
merger with esty was announced last month she added 
the campbellmithun advertisements have been very effective 
harty said based on measurements of audience reach and recall 
campbellmithun made deft use of the states limited 
mediabuying budget obtaining a significant number of free spots 
along with those it bought she said 
paula baldwin a spokeswoman for what now is campbellmithun 
esty said the move was an extremely difficult decision to reach 
but it was an amicable one we remain very very proud of the work 
we did 
esty and the former campbellmithun agencies are owned by the 
new yorkbased saatchi amp saatchi dfs inc 
mary gustafson a martinwilliams spokeswoman said the agencys 
projections indicate very little likelihood of landing a 
tobaccolinked account 
even if it should happen weve made a commitment to the 
health departments section on nonsmoking she said wed ask 
the prospective client to understand but it they didnt wed 
probably not pitch for their business

no one can say that well never see the likes 
of him again but ronald reagan will be a hard act for any 
president to follow 
the man actually enjoys the job 
other presidents pursued the office with equal ardor but none 
has savored it the way reagan does 
harry truman used to refer to the white house as that great 
white prison yet he had the luxury in those safer times of 
taking a walk around the block by contrast reagan is swaddled in 
a germfree cocoon and hasnt seemed to mind if he were to write a 
book you can bet it wont be about the splendid misery of it all 
that aura of comfort in the job invited a comment from delegate 
james proctor from rocky mount nc that you hear often around 
the republican national convention i dont think theres anybody 
here who wouldnt like to have ronald reagan on the ticket again 
george bush and for that matter michael dukakis eat your 
heart out 
everything about reagan shows his pleasure with the best role of 
his actors life its in his body language he bounds onstage for 
speeches he looks interested in the other guys speech he laughs 
at every punch line his wave to crowds is never forced amiability 
is his strong suit 
he has turned his age to advantage with endless variations of 
the same oneliner i always feel at home here in louisiana 
because you know im the fellow that talked tom jefferson into 
buying it he said at a rally welcoming him to new orleans on 
sunday it got a laugh it always does 
where other presidents were renowned for their inability to make 
small talk richard nixon comes to mind reagan is the kind of 
man youd like at your dinner party he is a natural quipster and 
never more so than on the day he was shot 
as he was wheeled into the operating room he told nancy 
honey i forgot to duck to his doctors please tell me 
youre all republicans and en route to the recovery room all 
in all id rather be in philadelphia 
politics aside americans like a man like that he is the movie 
cowboy blowing the smoke away from his gun barrel john wayne 
striding across the shotup deck of his destroyer will rogers 
finding humor in the serious business of politics 
george bush was a real war hero but hes derided as the wimp 
reagans the tough guy who spent his war years making movies for 
the army 
franklin d roosevelt developed a rapport with the american 
people by extolling optimism in a dark time reagan has taken pages 
out of fdrs book ridiculing the malaise that jimmy carter talked 
about a new beginning was his campaign slogan in 1980 its 
morning in america was the refrain in 1984 
who else could get away with the things reagan does he and his 
wife speak freely of family values when their own family is torn 
his reputation is that of a religious man yet he seldom goes to 
church he is caught redhanded with faulty facts misstatements 
admission of ignorance of his administrations doings and he walks 
away with head held high 
it is as rep pat schroeder said a teflon presidency where 
nothing sticks 
far from being a drawback reagans actor background has helped 
him mold public opinion no matter what he says it sounds good 
when he says it television is his medium he handles it better 
than anyone since john f kennedy 
used to taking orders from directors in his earlier career 
reagan has surrounded himself with aides to whom he delegates much 
authority that enables him to be what he said he would be a 
9to5 executive who does not take work home 
he came in to the white house with solidly rooted ideas and it 
has been both an attribute and a flaw that he sticks with them no 
matter what his offthecuff public statements often draw on the 
3by5 cards he used during his political infancy in the 1960s and 
even before when he honed his conservative views as a company 
spokesman for general electric 
reagan is the 40th american president the first actor the 
first divorced man and the oldest ever his administration was 
tainted by scandal by the irancontra affair by budget deficits 
by curtailment of programs 
none of that necessarily will be stressed by history what will 
be remembered is ronald reagan

a fire broke out monday on the 51st floor of the 
empire state building forcing dozens of office workers to evacuate 
the 102story tower and officials said the second blaze there in 
three days was suspicious 
the blaze which began in a batch of carpets discarded in a 
stairwell produced heavy smoke but caused only minor damage to the 
landmark skyscraper firefighters doused the fire about a half hour 
after it began 
authorities declined to say why the fire was declared 
suspicious but fire commissioner joseph bruno said the 
investigation would include why 10 rolledup carpets were stashed 
in the stairwell 
chief robert manson the deputy borough commander who commanded 
fire forces at the scene in last fridays fire as well as the one 
monday said he had found nothing to link the two blazes 
department spokesman john mulligan said 
one woman in the building fell but declined medical treatment 
and a second was removed to bellevue hospital with possible cardiac 
arrest one firefighter was sent to bellevue for treatment of smoke 
inhalation and heat exhaustion 
the temperature was about 94 and rising at the time of the fire 
which was reported at 1134 am and extinguished at 1212 pm 
an offduty firefighter visiting his brother discovered the fire 
and helped to put it out mulligan said 
between 50 to 100 tenants on the five floors of the towers 
midsection floors 51 through 56 were evacuated because of the 
smoke said frank corbin a management spokesman for the building 
the fire department initially reported that the fire started in 
an electrical conduit in a 50th floor stairwell later the 
department attributed the cause to the burning carpets 
on friday a fire broke out in an 86th floor shaftway after it 
was brought under control firefighters discovered that it had 
climbed up to the 102nd floor 
the popular observation decks at both those levels had to be 
closed and some 1500 tourists evacuated 
in addition to forcing other evacuations because of smoke the 
fire friday interrupted broadcasting for several hours by eight fm 
radio stations whose antennae are atop the building

a feud between the security police and 
the governing social democratic party is proving to be an 
embarrassment to prime minister ingvar carlsson as he campaigns for 
next months general election 
in the last week the governments election worries have been 
compounded by an exchange of accusations with the secret police of 
mischiefmaking and political spying 
the feud between the government and its counterintelligence arm 
known as sapo goes back decades 
but the tension resurfaced after book publisher and former 
journalist ebbe carlsson launched his own investigation into the 
1986 assassination of prime minister olof palme 
it became clear the amateur detective an insider in the 
governing party was investigating sapo as much as looking for the 
elusive killer 
but critics said social democrats exceeded their authority and 
sidestepped official channels by ordering the secret investigation 
which has overshadowed campaign issues such as taxes or the 
environment 
justice minister annagreta leijon resigned last month after it 
was disclosed that she aided ebbe carlssons efforts to contact 
british intelligence officials for the investigation 
sapo is a department within the regular police structure and is 
responsible for ferreting out spies and protecting cabinet 
ministers 
palme who disliked the formalities of office dismissed his 
sapo bodyguards when he and his wife went to see a movie on the 
night he was killed 
prime minister carlsson not related to ebbe carlsson told a 
parliamentary inquiry aug 4 that he backed the investigation 
because of important allegations and serious criticism against a 
swedish authority 
he was referring to charges that sapo was negligent in 
protecting palme and tried to cover up its shortcomings in the hunt 
for the assassin 
ebbe carlsson told the inquiry earlier that sapo had failed to 
act on a tip that palmes life was in danger if it is not a 
conspiracy it is stupidity he told the televised hearing 
in another slap at sapo foreign minister sten andersson told 
reporters that he trusted ebbe carlsson more than he did sapos 
commanders 
palmes murder was for many leading social democrats the final 
confirmation of sapos incompetance said a report in the 
business weekly affars varlden 
holger romander a former police chief was quoted as saying the 
carlsson affair is part of a campaign against sapo by people 
who distrust an organization they cannot control and know little 
about 
social democrats say sapo is a bastion of conservative politics 
some party leaders are reported to back removal of sapo from the 
police force so that it would report directly to the government 
the svenska dagbladet newspaper said sapo urged the government 
to reject the credentials last year of a soviet diplomat whom the 
security police said was the new kgb station chief the government 
ignored their advice 
in a book published last week former sapo chief per gunnar 
vinge wrote that the social democrats created a political 
intelligence agency during the late 1950s 
the agency called the information bureau enlisted personnel in 
military or research organizations to register political opinions 
of citizens to identify communist sympathizers the book said the 
activity went on until the early 1970s 
the information bureau story was first published in 1973 and 
prime minister carlsson questioned the timing of the books 
publication six weeks before the sept 18 election 
the dispute has helped the three opposition parties cooperate in 
their attempt to unseat the social democrats who have governed 
sweden for 50 of the last 56 years

barry bingham sr the patriarch of a 
media empire that he sold in 1986 to end a family squabble over 
control of the holdings died monday at age 82 
the former owner and publisher of the courierjournal and the 
louisville times had undergone treatment in boston and louisville 
hospitals since learning he had a brain tumor late last year his 
doctor said bingham had been in a coma for the past nine days 
bingham whose newspapers won eight pulitzer prizes sold the 
two papers in 1986 to gannett co which folded the times into the 
courierjournal 
many public figures praised binghams journalistic and financial 
contributions to kentucky 
he was one of our commonwealths treasures said former gov 
ab happy chandler who had his share of feuds with the 
courierjournal during his halfcentury in public life 
he was respected for his character integrity fairmindedness 
and benevolence of spirit by those on every side of the 
controverisal issues of the day said sen wendell ford dky 
the tradition he established serves as a continuing memorial 
to his high sense of journalistic responsibility said george n 
gill president and publisher of the courierjournal 
dr william a blodgett binghams personal physician said he 
was with bingham when he died at home at 515 am he had a 
seizure last weekend and we believed the tumor was growing 
again the doctor said 
bingham served as president and publisher of the courierjournal 
and the louisville times from december 1937 until june 1971 when 
his son barry jr took over the reins and he became board chairman 
since the sale of the media properties including the two 
papers a tv station and a printing company reportedly for 4358 
million bingham had exercised his influence through the mary and 
barry bingham sr fund 
bingham and his wife established the philanthropic organization 
to support education arts and health endeavors in kentucky and 
southern indiana it had distributed more than 8 million by late 
last year 
one of the funds largest gifts was 26 million for the 
construction of the 40story louisville falls fountain the worlds 
largest floating fountain which will be dedicated friday 
bingham placed the media properties on the market in january 
1986 after nearly two years of family infighting he said he 
couldnt find a solution that was fair to everyone 
his illness came as he unsuccessfully fought the release of a 
controversial book about his father judge robert worth bingham 
who had acquired the newspapers in 1918 with a 5 million 
inheritance from his second wife 
the book alleged that the elder bingham contributed to his 
second wifes death by failing to secure proper medical attention 
for her and by drugging her to try to persuade her to change her 
will 
macmillan publishing co dropped the book project after bingham 
supplied a 5inch thick memorandum of what he contended were 160 
misstatements of fact by author david chandler crown publishing 
co issued the book in 1987 after making what it called 
insignificant changes 
the louisvilleborn bingham graduated from harvard with honors 
in 1928 eventually abandoning his dream of becoming a novelist and 
joining the newspaper as a police reporter he took control of the 
media empire in 1933 when president franklin delano roosevelt 
appointed his father ambassador to great britain 
judge bingham had launched whasam radio in 1922 and later 
started standard gravure which prints sunday magazine and 
advertising supplements barry bingham sr set up whastv in 1950 
barry bingham jr was involved in opening wamzfm 
dissension within the family surfaced in 1984 when sallie 
bingham challenged the ability of her brother to serve as editor 
and publisher 
sallie bingham her sister eleanor bingham miller and their 
mother were replaced on the board of directors by professional 
managers sallie bingham then announced she was disposing of her 15 
percent interest that eventually led to binghams surprise 
announcement that he was dismantling the empire 
in addition to his wife and three children bingham is survived 
by nine grandchildren two other sons died in accidents in 1964 
and 1966 
a funeral service is scheduled for wednesday at calvary 
episcopal church in louisville

two men have conquered the last unclimbed 
area of mount everest the treacherous northeast ridge but they 
failed to make it the last 1000 feet to the 29028foot summit 
it is the longest and hardest route on everest said russell 
brice of twizen new zealand 
brice and harry taylor of oxford england completed their climb 
the weekend of aug 57 
it has been 35 years since everest was first climbed yet this 
was the first to succeed in reaching the rocky pinnacle atop the 
knifeshaped northeast ridge brice said in an interview with the 
associated press in katmandu after returning from tibet 
we were both disappointed we did not reach the summit 
taylor said but we feel proud we have climbed the unclimbed 
ridge and we are happy it is a notable climb in the 
history of everest 
this was the fifth british everest expedition to tackle the 
ridge taylor had previously reached the 26000foot level on a 
1986 expedition 
the route was pioneered by british alpinist chris bonnington six 
years ago two of bonningtons british colleagues peter boardman 
and joe tasker never returned 
brice 36 said their expedition established its advanced base 
camp where the ridge begins at 21000 feet in the east rongbuk 
glacier several members went on to camp 3 at 26000 feet where 
the pinnacle starts 
taylor 29 said they left camp 3 early in the morning of aug 6 
and climbed 14 hours to the pinnacle along the knifeedged ridge 
which was strewn with many cornices 
for the whole way we had to knock off a foot and a half of 
snow before we could climb there was no place to stop and sit 
so we could not drink or eat anything on that day 
the two stopped climbing after dark and made a ledge to sit on 
for the night in high winds and a heavy snowstorm 
we could sleep only 10 to 15 minutes at a time because of the 
cold and lack of oxygen brice said but we were not worried 
not scared we were confident of what we were doing 
the next morning the two climbed for a couple of hours and 
reached the top of the pinnacle at 28000 feet 
we stayed there for two hours hoping to go to the summit of 
mount everest brice said but the weather deteriorated from 
bad to the worse the visibility was poor 
asked whether they could have reached the summit if they had 
pushed on brice replied you cant beat the weather if we had 
gone to the summit we could not have come back

fortyfive years after jim wright flew a 
daring world war ii bombing mission from a remote australian 
airfield the speaker of the house is going back this time as the 
leader of a congressional delegation celebrating the countrys 
bicentennial 
for me it will be a sentimental journey wright said 
remembering the 17 hours spent flying over the south pacific in a 
strippeddown b24 and the midnight bombing of refineries at 
balikpapan borneo where much of japans aviation fuel was being 
produced 
the texas democrat was a 19yearold second lieutenant in the 
army air corps when he and capt gus connery flew the lead plane in 
the 2700mile mission and suprised the japanese who had left the 
lights on in the harbor at balikpapan because they thought the 
refineries were beyond the range of american bombers 
on this trip down under he hopes to demonstrate to australia 
our appreciation for their steadfast friendship 
a meeting with prime minister bob hawke is on wrights 
itinerary as the speaker his wife betty and about a dozen 
members of congress and their spouses attend ceremonies to 
inaugurate the new parliament house in the capital of canberra 
the delegation leaves friday and returns to the united states on 
aug 31 said wright who is organizing the bipartisan group at the 
request of the state department and william lane us ambassador 
to australia 
while in canberra wright and the delegation will attend the 
first session of parliament in the new building and meet with 
leaders of the ruling labor party and of the opposition party the 
us lawmakers will visit the australian war memorial and the 
australianamerican war memorial and wright will lay a wreath on 
each 
the australian air force will fly wright to fenton air strip in 
the rugged northern territory where he spent much of his combat 
tour 
ill go back for this sentimental journey he said 
reminiscing about the time as a young soldier he bought a wild 
horse from a nearby rancher for 48 and fed the animal with oats 
intended for his comrades breakfast 
he was awarded the distinguished flying cross for his valor in 
the bombing of the balikpapan oil refineries at the time the 
longest bombing mission on record his plane was the first to 
arrive over the refineries and the lights immediately went out when 
he dropped his bombs

gov madeleine kunin has asked for a 
review of a state corrections program that has allowed john zaccaro 
jr to spend his fourmonth prison term for selling cocaine in a 
1500amonth apartment 
louis berney a spokesman for the governor said monday kunin 
believes the overall program is outstanding but that she is 
concerned about inequities in living accommodations among 
participants 
zaccaro the son of former democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro was convicted in april of selling a 
quartergram of cocaine to an undercover officer while a student at 
middlebury college in 1986 he was sentenced to one to five years 
in prison with all but four months suspended 
zaccaro was deemed eligible for the state corrections 
departments house arrest program under which nonviolent 
convicts can find their own housing while they remain under close 
supervision by corrections officials the program is designed to 
ease prison overcrowding 
zaccaro is staying in a luxury apartment with room service and 
cable tv in a building designed for expenseaccount business people 
on short assignments 
this guy is a drug felon and hes living in conditions that 
999 percent of the people of vermont couldnt afford said 
addison county states attorney john quinn who prosecuted the 
24yearold zaccaro 
state corrections officials say they have no control over the 
quality of the living quarters the department doesnt provide 
the apartment said john perry director of planning for 
corrections the prisoner does that we are only concerned that 
it meets minimum standards no drugs no guns no college kids 
hanging around 
obviously some people mr zaccaro among them have more 
money than others and they can afford a better place the aga khan 
probably wouldnt think much of his apartment he said 
the governor believes poeple should be treated equally 
regardless of personal circumstances so has asked for the 
review said berney he said kunin had no suggestions for solving 
the inequities 
there are a host of problems in trying to regulate the standard 
of living quarters for example some of the participants live at 
home raising the question of whether the state would force people 
from their homes if they seem too luxurious 
berney said it was important to remember zaccaro does not have 
freedom in any sense of the word he works most of the time and is 
restricted to his apartment for the rest of the time with the 
exception of one hour a week in which he has to go grocery 
shopping 
zaccaro works at a community youth center in burlington 
he gets a personal visit a day and two phone calls a day from 
an officer he is very closely monitored said berney

president alfredo stroessner took the 
oath of office for an eighth time monday in a subdued ceremony that 
followed weeks of tension between the government and the roman 
catholic church 
stroessner 75 was sworn in before the congress by the 
president of the supreme court luis maria argana he then quietly 
walked off the podium without speaking to assembled representatives 
and foreign dignitaries 
the 25minute ceremony was broadcast by staterun radio across 
this landlocked and mostly rural country of 38 million 
although there were no protests the catholic church canceled 
the annual te deum mass of thanksgiving traditionally celebrated on 
aug 15 to mark the anniversary of the founding of the capital 
asuncion 
the cancellation ordered by monsignor ismael rolon archbishop 
of asuncion was a response to the expulsion july 25 of a spanish 
jesuit priest for allegedly publicly encouraging overthrow of the 
government 
the church denied the charge and said the priest juan antonio 
de la vega a 65yearold professor was explaining liberation 
theology a movement that advocates political change as a tool of 
social reform 
the church the most influential institution in the country 
after the government and the military claimed in a message 
delivered from pulpits two weeks ago that it was the victim of 
persecution 
pope john paul ii urged stroessner during a visit here last may 
to relax restrictions on human rights and political freedom 
stroessner also commander of paraguays military took power in a 
1954 coup and has ruled with a heavy hand ever since 
his tenure has brought order and modest economic growth to a 
country that had seen turmoil and 11 different presidents in the 19 
years following the end of the chaco war with bolivia in 1935 but 
most civil liberties are curtailed and dissent is crushed 
stroessner won an eighth term in february in an election marked 
by the absence of the major opposition groups and by charges of 
fraud he was credited with obtaining 886 percent of all votes 
cast 
mondays inauguration was witnessed by brazilian foreign 
minister roberto de abreu sondre taiwans prime minister yu kuo 
and delegations from south korea south africa and neighboring 
argentina 
afterward stroessner swore in his 11member cabinet rodney 
elpidio acevedo replaced carlos saldivar as foreign minister

the kremlin said monday it will not tolerate more 
pakistani aid to moslem guerrillas in afghanistan who increased 
pressure on the sovietsponsored government by capturing a district 
near kabul the capital 
insurgent leader gulbaddin hekmatyar said in pakistan that 
guerrilla successes in the field may cause the soviets to complete 
their troop withdrawal ahead of the feb 15 deadline he said his 
forces had captured shigal a strategic post in kunar province near 
the pakistani border 
a soviet government statement issued through the official news 
agency tass contained some of the sharpest language the kremlin has 
aimed at pakistan 
the soviet government most resolutely declares that the 
continuation by pakistan of its obstructionist policy visavis the 
geneva accords on afghanistan cannot be further tolerated it 
said 
the soviet union reserves for itself in that case the right 
to take such measures that are necessitated by the situation it 
was not specific about the response 
on may 15 the soviet union began withdrawing its estimated 
115000 soldiers from afghanistan under an agreement signed april 
14 in geneva by afghanistan and pakistan with the soviet union and 
united states as guarantors 
half the soldiers were to be out by aug 15 which the soviets 
said sunday had been achieved and all are to be gone by feb 15 
president najib of afghanistan marked the occasion with an 
article in the communist party newspaper pravda thanking the soviet 
union for its help 
with the article pravda printed a map showing the remaining 
soviet soldiers in afghanistan along two evacuation routes from 
kabul and from shindand via herat in the west 
soviet military officials said earlier the pullout had cleared 
the red army from 25 of afghanistans 30 provinces the map showed 
soldiers in only a narrow ribbon through the remaining five 
provinces 
tass said 31 civilians were killed and 113 wounded in 142 
attacks on populated areas in the first 10 days of august najib 
said at a news conference in kabul there are more than 180 
guerrilla training centers in pakistan and 50 bases for rearming 
rebels and storing weapons 
the geneva agreement calls for other countries not to interfere 
in afghanistans internal affairs guerrilla groups were not 
parties to the accord 
red army soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 replaced 
one prosoviet government with another and remained to fight the 
insurgents more than 13000 soviet soldiers have been killed 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and use pakistani border camps and cities where more than 3 
million afghan refugees live as supply points and bases the 
united states and other countries have armed them through pakistan 
tass said monday fighters from insurgent groups had captured the 
shakardar district about 20 miles north of kabul it quoted reports 
in kabul as saying they were armed with 1500 rockets they intended 
to aim at the capital 
other guerrilla organizations planned to send large forces armed 
with longrange weapons rockets and stinger missiles from 
pakistan to the karabag pagman and sorubi districts of kabul 
province the agency said 
lt gen boris t gromov soviet commander in afghanistan said 
sunday that insurgents had captured kunduz a northern provincial 
capital 40 miles from the soviet border 
afghanistan foreign minister abdul wakil who arrived in moscow 
on sunday told a news conference that reports of the fall of 
kunduz were fabrication and misinformation 
when told gromov announced it wakil said the generals 
statement was not authentic 
what is authentic and reliable is the statements made by the 
government of afghanistan he said 
several days ago kunduz faced a barbarous and ferocious 
attack but insurgents could not be considered in control unless 
they established institutions such as schools and hospitals 
the fact is that they do not have any kind of administration 
over there he said 
najib said monday soldiers had recaptured the city hekmatyar 
leader of the hezbiislami guerrillas said his information 
indicated fighting continued near kunduz 
wakil did not respond directly when asked whether there were 
circumstances under which the soviets might stop withdrawing 
he cited a joint statement issued aug 7 when foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze was in kabul saying the two sides would 
draw the necessary conclusions and determine their actions if 
pakistan continued to aid the insurgents 
shevardnadze said in an interview the same day however that 
the withdrawal would finish on schedule 
hekmatyar claimed moscow had wanted to remove partial units from 
eastern southern and southwestern afghanistan to make things 
easier for afghan government forces but that proved too dangerous 
so entire units have been withdrawn 
the soviets are not leaving because of a geneva agreement but 
because they see no gain he said they are forced to leave

it wasnt too long ago that they were a pack 
of bickering rivals six wouldbe presidents sniping and squabbling 
in public over who could best lead the republicans to victory in 
november 
george bush was most often the target of the other five who 
never hesitated to list his shortcomings 
but all that is forgotten now as bob dole jack kemp alexander 
haig jr pete du pont and pat robertson join the republican 
convention this week in singing bushs praises 
while bush is the undisputed star of the gop unity fest the 
other five are by no means shrinking violets during the weeks 
activities 
two are busily keeping themselves at the front of the vice 
presidential sweepstakes three will be prominently featured in 
primetime slots at the convention and all five are making the 
rounds with delegate speeches media interviews and receptions in 
their honor 
each of the former candidates was given a spot to address the 
convention hall du pont and haig shortly after the opening gavel 
on monday morning and robertson kemp and dole in the prized 
primetime slots at evening sessions 
du pont in an eloquent version of the message he has been 
delivering since his dismal showing in the primaries said the 
democrats are looking to the policies of yesterday while bush and 
the republicans are the party willing to explore examine and put 
new ideas to work 
you have to feel a little wistful the former delaware 
governor said in an interview when asked about seeing bush receive 
the partys nomination i love the process i enjoyed what i was 
doing id love to still be doing it but george was a little 
stronger this year 
haig the former secretary of state who has served under seven 
presidents said he will join bushs surrogate speaking team and 
do everything i can to get george bush elected president 
haig who often directed the most pointed barbs at bush during 
gop primary debates said in an interview monday that bush is as 
well qualified a candidate as our party has ever put forward 
were in new orleans to unify our party to endorse our worthy 
nominee george bush he told the delegates monday 
dole the senator from kansas and kemp the new york 
congressman meanwhile have been dashing around new orleans 
campaignstyle from breakfasts to receptions to luncheon speeches 
to interviews and tv shows 
both are said to be on bushs short list as he deliberates who 
will be his running mate and both have said they would accept the 
job 
at a breakfast sponsored by bell south on monday dole thanked 
his primary supporters but he added thats behind us and now 
were on to the big event where george bush will become the 41st 
president of the united states 
wife elizabeth sounded as if she were promoting her husband for 
the second spot on the ticket saying i was very proud of the 
fact that literally a week after bob withdrew from the presidential 
race he was out working hard and i mean hard for george bush he 
doesnt look back 
kemp being pushed for the second spot by conservatives has a 
full schedule hes encouraging republican enthusiasm for the 
partys conservative platform and attacking the democratic ticket 
of michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
but mostly kemp is stirring up support for his own vice 
presidential ambitions saying monday that he could be a good 
second string quarterback for george bush 
robertson the television evangelist who raised 25 million but 
failed to attract significant voter support has set up a large 
campaign office near the french quarter but so far there seems to 
have been little activity in the office 
arriving in new orleans on monday robertson spoke party unity 
but insisted that the conservative views he espoused will be 
vindicated in the election this fall 
we are getting ready to show why republicans should be elected 
next fall and why george bush should be the next president of the 
united states he said 
robertson is to address the convention tuesday night and will 
be honored at a rally afterward 
robertson announced last week that he would not enter his name 
into nomination removing the last potential wave on the otherwise 
smooth convention waters

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis on monday dismissed president reagans criticism of him as 
a liberal liberal liberal saying republicans have turned 
their backs on basic american values and that the l word in 
this campaign is leadership 
the massachusetts governor on his annual visit to the central 
part of his home state said he was not fazed by criticism of him 
at the republican national convention and predicted reagans 
personal popularity would not help certain republican nominee 
george bush 
in the last analysis people are going to be looking at me and 
mr bush and they are going to be looking at which one of us has 
the leadership dukakis told reporters he noted that reagan 
campaigned actively for gop senate candidates in 1986 but could not 
keep democrats from regaining control of the senate 
dukakis talked with reporters after attending an event to mark 
the first phase in implementing the states universal health care 
law which guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by 
1990 
on arriving in new orleans on sunday reagan said its time 
to talk issues to use the dreaded l word to say the policies of 
our opposition and the congressional leadership of his party are 
liberal liberal liberal he also accused the democrats of 
stealing the theme of family values that reagan said had helped 
fuel the republican resurgence 
dukakis said he does not think such criticism of him will cause 
lasting political damage 
the l word in this campaign is leadership dukakis said 
this isnt about the past its not about the 70s or the 30s 
its about the 90s the l word is leadership thats why im 
running for president 
dukakis used the healthcare event to tout his record as 
massachusetts governor on issues that affect the family citing his 
work to expand opportunities for day care and affordable housing as 
well 
he called basic health care a birthright of every american 
and added thats something the republican party has never 
understood 
dukakis said he could not provide a figure of how much such a 
program would cost on a national level but said he hoped most of it 
could be financed through minor increases in insurance premiums 
with the possibility of using government money to get the program 
rolling that is the case in massachusetts where 65 million has 
been allocated for the first two years 
at mondays event with dukakis were several disabled people who 
will get health insurance through the new program allowing 
several of them to work for the first time 
the central massachusetts trip is an annual event for dukakis 
who will return to the region tuesday he recited his 
administrations efforts to bring the region back from an economic 
depression and said he wasnt sure if he would be back next year 
fate will tell us in a little less than three months he 
said 
after the luncheon and healthcare event dukakis toured a 
metals factory in westboro before returning home for the night 
the governor issued a statement calling for a cabinetlevel 
council to oversee the nations space program and said he would 
support deployment of a permanently manned space station 
at the news conference dukakis said the startup money for the 
station which aides said would be about 900 million in the first 
year would be taken from cuts in some weapons programs and from 
more efficient pentagon management 
dukakis endorsed the space station for the first time as his 
running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas toured the johnson space 
flight center in houston 
dukakis also continued to blame reagan for the increase in the 
prime interest rate to 10 percent saying the higher lending rate 
resulted from reagans continued borrowing and spending 
borrowing and spending borrowing and spending 
dukakis is scheduled to be in his home state through wednesday 
when he will begin a campaign trip to minnesota alabama florida 
illinois missouri arkansas and texas

lone wolf maverick member of an extremely 
small group of conservative us senators gordon humphrey 
identifies with all those characterizations and says he doesnt 
care as long as george bush is listening closely 
i run with a pretty small pack the selfproclaimed and sole 
congressional spokesman for the coalition for a winning ticket said 
late sunday night i didnt come here to blend in with the 
wallpaper im going to compete within the bounds of civility up to 
the end to put forth my agenda 
thus far humphreys effort to pressure bush into naming a 
conservative running mate has attracted tremendous media coverage 
humphrey planned it that way if there werent a news vacuum 
at this convention we wouldnt really get the attention but i saw 
the chance and quite frankly decided to exploit it he said 
humphrey acknowledges that all the noise wont win victory on 
the convention floor if he had to take it to a roll call vote 
wed be beaten he said 
so why fight bush campaign attempts to create harmony 
were trying to sensitize him and particularly his advisers 
humphrey said bush people are tone deaf they are so isolated 
from the majority of the party 
humphrey 47 a former airline pilot narrowly defeated 16year 
incumbent sen thomas mcintyre a democrat in what was viewed as a 
major upset in 1978 it was humphreys first try for public office 
he promised to be the toughest skinflint in the us senate 
humphrey has since carved a niche in the senate as the leading 
spokesman against abortion he is a fiscal conservative strongly 
anticommunist and an advocate for the freedom fighters in 
afghanistan 
i do not try to be all things to all people he says of his 
essentially unyielding positions people either like the kind of 
representation i give them or they dont 
when bush named new jersey gov thomas kean as keynote speaker 
humphrey threatened to stage a boycott unless bush allowed an 
abortion opponent to speak humphrey later announced he was 
satisfied with the bush campaigns promise to let congressman henry 
hyde of illinois to speak on the issue 
ive made that abortion a real point of leadership he 
said that riles some people 
humphrey also believes that many agree that the vice 
presidential nominee should be antiabortion fiscally conservative 
and strong on defense but are afraid to speak out 
if i wasnt raising hell who would be he asked 
humphrey says he doesnt really want to force the convention to 
consider an alternative nominee but he will try if bush picks a 
moderate even in losing an alternative nominee would be able to 
reassure conservatives the movement is still there and lives 
as long as i dont overplay my hand or become uncivil i dont 
see any downside for conservatives he said right now were 
shut out

they talk about plant closings we want to continue plant 
openings they see america in terms of its limits we see america 
in terms of its possibilities 
if we do our job right i predict that by 1992 the start of 
george bushs second term onequarter of our party will consist 
of black hispanic and asianamericans who will see in our party 
the best hope of a better life for themselves and their families 
whats the real purpose of the reagan revolution it wasnt to 
defeat democrats it was to bring new ideas and superior 
leadership to restore confidence in america like the american 
revolution itself the greatness of our revolution is measured not 
by who were against but by what were for 
last month in atlanta the leaders of the democratic party 
failed to say what theyre for all they said was who theyre 
against they all said we cant stand another eight years of 
republican policies of course they cant its clear that ted 
kennedy jim wright and michael dukakis cant stand another eight 
years of republican policies because that means another 5 million 
new employers and another 17 million new jobs at that rate all 
their constituents will become republicans 
this is no time to stop this is no time to go back we have a 
lot of work to do we dnt just want low inflation we want no 
inflation we dont just want low unemployment we want no 
unemployment we need a safety net to keep people from falling 
but we also need a ladder of opportunity upon which all can climb 
we dont just want to oppose communism we want to support men 
and women who are fighting for freedom and democracy whether in 
afghanistan angola or central america we want to free people not 
only from too much dependence on government we want to free them 
from dependence on drugs and the disrespect for human life 
mr president youve brought us to the threshold of a new era 
in fact youve taken us over the threshold youve shown us that 
we can do more than contain our adversaries we can transcend 
them youve shown us how we can make even the threat of nuclear 
war obsolete through the nowproven technology of strategic 
defense youve reminded us that the first and best department of 
health education and welfare is a strong family and youve shown 
us that the power of a right idea is the greatest force on earth 
mr president this is a powerful legacy that you are handing us 
here in new orleans i just want you and nancy to know that under 
the able leadership of george bush this party is going to take it 
and run with it 
were going to win in november were going to finish what we 
began in 1980 to help all americans to help people everywhere 
to share in the success of freedom democracy and peace 
thank you and god bless you

elvis presleys high school buddy said monday he 
has the kings first recording a highly sought twosong disc 
presley made for his mother in 1953 
edwin s leek jr a retired airline pilot said in a telephone 
interview that elvis left the record at leeks grandmothers house 
in memphis 25 years ago 
i saw him a few years later in chicago when he was first 
starting to make it and i said i still have that first record of 
yours its going to be worth a lot of money some day 
presleys reply according to leek just hold onto it 
ive been telling my wife what are we gonna do with it all 
weve ever done it lock it away leek said now id like to 
find out what its worth 
todd morgan of graceland the presley home and museum in 
memphis said the museum had long kept an eye open for the 
record which he described as probably the single most valuable 
record in record collecting its the first record of the man who 
pioneered rock n roll 
presleys first recording led directly to his discovery and one 
elvis expert describes it as extremely valuable 
the discs existence was reported in this weeks edition of 
goldmine magazine a journal for record collectors 
it sounds like early presley slow romantic its not rock 
n roll according to kit kiefer goldmine managing editor who 
said he had listened to tapes provided by leek the sound isnt 
cd quality but its surprisingly good 
asked if the magazine suspected a hoax he said ive heard a 
lot of elvis imitators and none of them go for the immature elvis 
sound also everything leek said checks out 
in 1953 presley an 18yearold truck driver wanted to make a 
record as a present for his mother he went to the memphis 
recording service paid 4 and accompanying himself on acoustic 
guitar sang two ballads my happiness and thats when your 
heartaches begin 
the studio was owned by sam phillips head of sun records which 
shared the premises one of the employees liked presleys disc and 
called him to phillips attention 
the first disc was long known to have been made but no one has 
been able to determine what happened to it morgan said 
leek said that for years he kept the presley disc with his 
wifes records and later placed it in a bank safety deposit box 
after they moved to key largo fla 
leek said he will auction off the record if he can get a 
reasonable price he also hopes to sell what he said was an 
autographed copy of presleys first sun release thats all right 
mama 
leek said he met elvis in 1945 when they shared a class in high 
school he said presley frequently visited leeks grandmother who 
had a piano young presley liked to play leeks grandmother 
expressed an interest in the record hed made and presley brought 
it over and played it for her leek said 
presley forgot to take it with him when he left leek said

a 12 billion mathematical error by the 
reagan administration in calculating the size of next years 
federal deficit could spark a fight with congress when lawmakers 
return to the capital next month 
the mistaken estimate which under the grammrudman balanced 
budget law cannot be rectified is preventing the spending of 12 
billion at a time when legislators are struggling to decide which 
among several competing spending bills they will pass 
among them are programs to combat drugs and to help the homeless 
and the hungry 
the white house office of management and budget is estimating 
that spending bills for fiscal 1989 passed by congress so far leave 
the government with a deficit of about 1442 billion 
under the grammrudman law if next years deficit surpasses 
146 billion there will be automatic spending cuts of at least 10 
billion 
but omb officials confirmed last week that they have pointed out 
to lawmakers that their estimate of the deficit was in error and 
should have been 143 billion 
we dont know omb spokeswoman barbara clay said when asked 
how the error occurred 
some democrats questioned last week said that with increasing 
pressures to spend money on various programs lawmakers may have to 
consider passing legislation that would free up the 12 billion 
if its an error and does not reflect in fact where we stand 
its an option that should be considered said rep leon panetta 
dcalif who is expected to become chairman of the house budget 
committee next year 
but in a prepared statement administration budget director 
james c miller iii said he would oppose any tinkering with the 
law for purposes that would increase the deficit 
as the 11 trillion federal budget goes 12 billion normally 
would barely register a tick but with omb calculating that the 
1989 deficit is coming so close to the grammrudman target of 146 
billion every dollar counts 
the bills lawmakers would like to pass or that president 
reagan has not yet signed into law would exceed 18 billion in 
spending 
under the grammrudman deficit reduction law omb analyzes the 
economy and federal spending and revenues several times annually 
projecting how much red ink is likely in the coming fiscal year 
if the final numbers show that the deficit will exceed a target 
set by the law it is 146 billion for next year spending is 
automatically cut by at least 10 billion that is a scenario 
congress and president reagan have desperately sought to avoid 
omb first made the error when calculating the rate of spending 
in a foreign military sales program in an august 1987 deficit 
report 
omb noticed the mistake soon afterward and made a slight 
correction but provisions in the grammrudman law prohibit omb 
from making dramatic changes in its projections on how quickly 
money provided by congress is actually spent by agencies 
congress wrote that provision to prevent the executive branch 
agency from using bogus estimates to clamp down on allowable 
spending 
yet another part of the grammrudman law forbids omb from making 
any changes in its deficit projection this close to the new fiscal 
year except for new programs enacted into law fiscal 1989 begins 
on oct 1 
were locked in by grammrudman clay said 
for legislation not yet enacted this year the cost of a 
wideranging drug bill has not been officially estimated but it is 
believed that its cost will exceed 1 billion 
in addition omb estimates that the trade bill would cost 400 
million hunger relief would cost 300 million and welfare reform 
would cost 200 million to 500 million in addition a measure 
primarily devoted to emergency spending for 1988 also contains 100 
million for 1989

a conservative group pushing for a roll call 
vote for the republican vice presidential nomination lost one round 
monday when a convention committee voted to scrap the 
timeconsuming ritual to conserve television time 
however sen gordon humphrey rnh chairman of the group 
calling itself the coalition for a winning ticket said that he 
was prepared to carry the fight to the convention floor possibly 
putting up a rival candidate for vice president to keep the process 
open 
every dictator in history has wanted to make the trains run on 
time humphrey said at a news conference after his proposal died 
before the republican national conventions rules committee 
there is no more foolish thing in politics than seeking to stifle 
dissent 
humphrey has been outspoken in recent weeks in urging george 
bush to choose a conservative as his vice presidential running 
mate bush has not said who he will ask to join him on the ticket 
now humphrey and his group object to a rules change that would 
dispense with a statebystate roll call vote on the gop vice 
presidential nomination if only one candidates name is placed in 
nomination in effect the rules change if adopted by the entire 
convention would allow delegates to vote only on whether the 
nomination should be made unanimous 
haley barbour of mississippi who proposed the change in the 
rules said it is to let the party use primetime television more 
productively 
are we going to take 45 minutes of george bush and the 
republican partys valuable time and waste it on an uncontested 
nomination barbour asked during the rules committee meeting 
humphrey who is not a member of the committee was allowed to 
speak to the panel but when delegate duane mutch of north dakota 
tried to bring humphreys proposal up for a vote he was ruled out 
of order 
when the entire set of gop rules came up for a vote only one 
dissenting voice was heard 
humphrey said later that he would try to line up the five state 
delegations necessary under the rules to put another vice 
presidential candidates name in nomination he said he had nobody 
in particular in mind and refused to name which states he was 
targeting

defense minister yitzhak 
rabin said monday his order confining 650000 palestinians to their 
homes under a military curfew was a clear message that israel was 
cracking down on protesters 
in the occupied west bank israeli troops shot and killed a 
palestinian bringing the arab death toll in more than eight months 
of antiisraeli violence to 245 according to united nations 
figures 
the aroundtheclock curfew was imposed indefinitely on this 
seaside strip sunday evening following a violent weekend in the 
occupied lands in which three arabs died troops shot and wounded 
25 people in gaza on sunday according to arab reports 
it was only the third time the army had sealed off the gaza 
strip since the uprising began dec 8 rabin said the curfew which 
kept about 50000 gazans away from jobs in israel would be in 
effect as long as it is needed 
some israeli sources speculated the move was related not to 
resurgent violence but to an effort to put economic pressure on the 
650000 residents of gaza 
in arab east jerusalem palestinian protesters threw rocks at 
police and at an israeli bus near the walled old city slightly 
injuring three american tourists police said 
an official at hadassa hospital identified the americans as 
brother and sisters abraham dina and shoshana kai the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said the three teenagers were 
released after treatment he did not have their hometown 
scattered protests broke out monday despite the curfew and 
palestinian reports said two residents of the jabaliya refugee camp 
on the outskirts of gaza city were wounded in the legs by army 
gunfire 
reporters were allowed into the strip only with israeli army 
escorts to tour with rabin 
we have delivered a clearcut message that violence will 
be met by force rabin said standing in the road near the site 
where a firebomb hurled at a van sunday burned six israelis one of 
them an 8monthold infant 
the population must realize that if they take the law into 
their own hands throwing firebombs stones and putting up 
roadblocks this will lead nowhere and they will be the ones to 
suffer 
rabin said earlier that soldiers had been ordered to shoot to 
hit anyone caught throwing a firebomb and that the homes of 
suspects would be torn down without right of appeal 
yigal kaminetzky the chief rabbi of jewish settlers in gaza 
called for tough measures to prevent further firebomb attacks 
including clearing both sides of the road for 50 yards in both 
rural and builtup residential areas 
during rabins tour monday arab youths darted out from behind 
garbage dumpsters and brick walls to hurl rocks at a 12car 
military convoy carrying reporters and military offixcials 
the convoy stopped several times to chase away protesters but 
no shots were fired 
in gaza city palestinians violating the curfew dropped a large 
rock on top of a van carrying an israeli television crew but no 
one was hurt 
protesters also set tires on fire in the middle of roads and 
scrawled slogans on walls 
most streets were deserted but an arab witness who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said soldiers forced some residents to 
whitewash graffiti or clear away debris 
rabin said the army would concentrate on breaking the power of 
autonomous palestinian popular committees which have been 
orchestrating protests at the neighborhood and village level 
he attributed the unrest to a show of force by moslem 
fundamentalists who called for demonstrations to mark the start of 
the islamic new year 1409 
palestinians traced the weekend protests to the arson deaths of 
two gaza workers who were trapped in a shed that was set on fire 
near tel aviv police said jewish extremists may have been involved 
in the occupied west bank hospital officials said 21yearold 
jamal odeh of tulkarm refugee camp was dead on arrival after being 
shot in the heart during overnight clashes 
troops shot an 18yearold palestinian in the right leg after 
youths threw rocks on soldiers in the old city marketplace and a 
second 18yearold was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet nablus 
hospital officials said 
israeli officials expressed mixed reactions to suggestions from 
senior plo official salah khalaf that a completely new plo 
charter might include recognition of israel 
foreign minister shimon peres the dovish labor party leader 
called for clarifications 
whoever wants negotiations should say so clearly what has 
been said until now is a jigsaw puzzle peres told reporters 
but a spokesman for rightwing prime minister yitzhak shamir 
described khalafs statements as verbal trickery 
we have to watch what they do not what they say said 
spokesman yossi ahimeir

george bush conceded monday he has a hard act 
to follow but hopes to leave his personal stamp on the republican 
national convention and not try to be a ronald reagan there is 
only one 
the vice president spent his last day here putting finishing 
touches on his acceptance speech and maintaining his silence on his 
choice of a running mate he planned to watch reagans evening 
speech to the convention on television before flying to new orleans 
on tuesday morning 
as of late monday bush still had not made up his mind on a 
running mate although was likely to do so tuesday before his 
arrival in new orleans said spokeswoman sheila tate 
hes going to call the schedule the way he sees fit she 
said he knows that if he tells one person it will leak 
ms tate said bush still plans to announce his choice thursday 
morning although she would not rule out the possiblity that the 
announcement might be moved up to wednesday night 
bush spent two sessions on monday working on a final draft of 
his acceptance speech with speechwriter peggy noonan and was 
pretty well finished with it ms tate said 
making the rounds of morning television interview shows bush 
said that while he had narrowed his choice of a running mate he 
still had not made the final decision even in his own mind 
asked whether he expected to be compared with reagan bush told 
nbcs today show he felt such comparisons were inevitable 
because hes been a great president he deserves tribute not 
only of the republican party but of a grateful nation and so there 
will be some comparison of that nature 
im not going to try to be a ronald reagan he continued 
there is only one i want to be george bush 
bush also told nbc the pressure is mounting as he nears the 
time of nomination 
but he also said that as an athlete hed been in pressure 
situations before maybe none this intense but look all ill do 
is just stand up there and say what i believe about peace and what 
i believe in about prosperity 
in an interview on abcs good morning america bush said 
i want to stand up there on thursday pay tribute to what we have 
done and give the president plenty of credit for bringing this 
country to new heights and then say what i george bush will do 
on peace and on keeping this recovery going until everybody 
benefits 
so its a big moment for me the culmination of a lot of years 
in politics but i dont feel concerned about it ive got to be 
what i am and im not going to be like someone else 
on the subject of a vice presidential choice bush told abc i 
have not decided and i probably will say when i have decided but 
im going to continue with this appropriate plan making a decision 
in private and then presenting it at the appropriate time 
bush also said he hoped to make maximum use of his family at the 
convention including his five children their spouses and his 10 
grandchildren 
ive always protected the privacy and the wonder of our 
family he told cbs morning news but he added ive had 
to lighten up and say to the world i guess through this 
convention this is what makes me tick 
i thought governor dukakis did a good job on that showing off 
his family at the democratic convention but weve got him 
outnumbered weve got a stronger bench and weve got a great 
family

georgia republicans gambling that rep pat 
swindall will be vindicated by a house ethics committee 
investigation voted monday to elect him chairman of the state 
delegation to the republican national convention 
swindalls election in a unanimous vote came at a rowdy caucus 
at which delegates were poised to elect brant frost iv of macon 
ga a leader of a faction dominated by supporters of former 
presidential candidate pat robertson the television evangelist 
then oscar persons an atlanta lawyer nominated swindall a 
bornagain christian with wide support among the robertson faction 
frost withdrew and endorsed swindall 
the robertson faction which won control of the delegation in 
the credentials fight demonstrated its clout by beating back the 
faction led by party regulars in a series of procedural roll call 
votes 
the selection of swindall by party leaders came less than two 
months after the same gop officials met privately to decide whether 
to launch their own investigation of swindall 
those meetings were prompted by revelations about an ongoing 
federal undercover investigation of swindall tape recordings from 
the investigation obtained by atlanta newspapers showed that 
swindall had continued to pursue an 850000 home construction loan 
after he was told it likely would be financed with drug money he 
would be helping to launder 
the georgia gop decided not to conduct its own investigation 
but the house ethics committee formally known as the committee on 
standards of official conduct launched a probe of swindall in june 
to determine if he had violated the law or house rules 
swindall who requested the ethics committee probe apologized 
for his role in the loan negotiations at a news conference in june 
he said he was wrong and ashamed but would continue to seek 
reelection

the republican platform committee gave its 
final assent monday to a conservative but compassionate 
platform and sent it to the full gop national convention with only 
two dissenting votes 
most of the 106 members of the platform committee shouted an 
enthusiastic approval to the 40000word document which will be 
presented to the full convention tuesday thhe only no votes 
were cast by connecticuts two platform committee members sen 
lowell p weicker jr and mary boatwright 
after the voice vote weicker demanded a show of hands but it 
was curtailed without a formal count after sen bob kasten of 
wisconsin the cochairman looked at all the arms raised in 
support of the platform 
there were no minority reports which means there will be no 
debate on the convention floor tuesday over any of the planks 
the platform an american vision for our children and our 
future includes a firm pledge against tax increases calls for 
rapid and certain deployment of the strategic defense 
initiative and seeks a constitutional amendment against abortion 
it skewers the democrats on ethics and promotes george bushs 
positions in favor of a childcare tax credit and increased 
education spending 
new jersey assembly speaker chuck hardwick a cochair of the 
panel said i think we have a platform here thats not only 
concervative but its compassionate its compassionate because 
its dealing with so many of the problems that are current in 1988 
problems of the environment of children of health care of 
building for a better america 
nebraksa gov kay orr chairwoman of the platform committee 
missed her final committee session to attend a luncheon honoring 
nancy reagan 
the gop platform is roughly eight times longer than the 
5200word streamlined document that the democrats approved in 
atlanta last month 
rep jerry lewis of california a cochairman said the gop 
document was a substantive piece of work unlike the democrats 
flight of fancy 
kasten said afterwards the democrats gave us a little bit of 
an opening its kind of unusual that they decided to be so vague 
and almost kind of bragged about it we have seen this as an 
opportunity to become the party in which ideas have consequences 
this platform will be looked upon as a tool for george bush 
and republican candidates to run upon kasten said 
weicker said he was against the platform both for whats in it 
and whats not in it 
he said the document fell short on civil rights aids social 
justice and other issues and we certainly dont do any favors 
for women 
weicker the most liberal gop senator added im against the 
democratic platform because it didnt say anything and im against 
the republican platform because it says too much 
boatwright a gop national committeewoman from stonington 
conn stayed for the meeting despite an injury to her left leg 
caused by an escalator mishap she said she was riding up an 
escalator at the hilton hotel and somebody dropped a whole bunch 
of boxes they got stuck at the top of the escalator and i 
couldnt get off so i fell over them 
she said the platform was a little bit more conservative than 
our constituency in connecticut feels she delayed a trip to a 
hospital for stitches because i certainly didnt want my senator 
to vote alone 
weicker who lost attempts last wednesday to liberalize the 
platforms planks on abortion aids and disability issues said 
it was a fair hearing i took my licks and gave a few thats the 
whole process in this country so im not complaining but neither 
am i voting for it

aids claimed about 13000 american lives last 
year a toll that would have ranked it 15th among all causes of 
death according to the first annual government statistical summary 
to include the disease 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome was added to the annual 
summary of disease starting in 1987 the national center for health 
statistics reported monday 
the agency estimated that between 12450 and 13820 americans 
died of aids last year while aids was not officially added to the 
overall rankings of causes of death that total would have put in 
15th place ahead of birth defects which claimed 12130 lives 
for statistical purposes aids has been listed in the category 
of other infectious and parasitic diseases which accounted for 
19160 deaths in 1987 compared with 9030 the year before 
the report said 65 percent of aids victims were white males and 
25 percent black males white and black females each made up 
between 4 percent and 5 percent of the total 
the age groups most heaving affected were 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 
the study added 
aids is a contagious fatal disease that attacks the bodys 
immune system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases 
and infections 
the disease is spread most often through sexual contact needles 
or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood 
products and from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
the chief victims of aids have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug abusers health officials estimate that 
heterosexual contact is responsible for 4 percent of cases and that 
between 1 million and 15 million americans have been exposed to 
the virus 
a person who tests positive for antibodies to the aids virus an 
indication of exposure has a 20 percent to 30 percent chance of 
developing aids over a fiveyear period according to the federal 
centers for disease control 
as of aug 8 aids had been diagnosed in 70208 americans of 
whom more than half or 39620 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the federal centers for disease control no one is 
known to have recovered from aids

republican convention organizers say time 
pressures brought on by the mystery over george bushs running mate 
are forcing them to begin writing generic speeches for 
lastminute use by the person picked for the ticket 
they conceded however that theyd leave some room for 
modification to fit whoever delivers the speech 
by wednesday morningwe will have one or two writers working 
on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee would then 
have to take and modify and put into his or her own style of 
words said fred malek george bushs convention manager 
by keeping the vice presidential selection the bestkept secret 
in the convention city bush adds pressure to organizers of the 
convention who are working hard to orchestrate even the tiniest 
detail for a good television showing 
that includes editing and painstaking revision of every word in 
every speech delivered from the podium malek said those 
speechwriters want an early start on the vice presidential 
nominees speech because it will be a major focus of the 
conventions final night 
its a generic kind of a speech its a draft malek said 
the nominee will not learn of his or her selection until thursday 
morning 
even with the headstart on the nominating speech malek said 
convention organizers will face a lastminute scramble to line up 
nominating speakers and write their speeches 
weve got two other three other addresses really to go 
along with it malek said they will be also in the same 
sequence well have one or two writers working on an acceptance 
speech and another working on a nominating speech 
we wont start this until wednesday he said they will 
have no clues nor will i on who its going to be 
a good writer with some general directions and general clues 
can get a running start malek said 
we havent selected yet who is going to give the nominating 
speeches for the same reason he said we are developing some 
ideas of who are good speakers and could do it 
part of the problem malek said is whoever nominates the vice 
presidential candidate must have some logical ties to the person 
selected and fit within the campaign theme selected by bush 
theres got to be some kind of a linkage he said 
this weeks republican national convention is a carefully 
scripted affair and malek clearly wasnt comfortable with leaving 
major gaps in a schedule thats been developed over months of 
planning 
we dont have any choice malek said 
i think its going to be all right i think we have the 
caliber of people to do the nomination i dont have any great 
trepidations about that obviously they could do a better job with 
more time

prime minister rajiv gandhi warned 
pakistan on monday against aiding sikh insurgents in punjab state 
saying he did not want to take further action pakistan might 
later regret 
he spoke at celebrations of the 41st anniversary of indias 
independence from britain clashes in kashmir state related to the 
celebrations injured at least 75 people including 25 police 
officers the press trust of india said 
in gujarat state popatlal sarothia a legislator of gandhis 
governing congress party was shot and killed monday by a 
disgruntled party worker attending independence festivites the 
news agency said 
gandhi said at a ceremony in new delhi we have taken firm 
action against sikh terrorism he did not elaborate 
he has often accused pakistan of arming and training sikh rebels 
who are fighting for a separate homeland in northern punjab state 
which borders pakistan india has offered no proof and pakistan has 
denied the charge 
we do not wish to take action pakistan might later regret 
the prime minister said he did not refer to pakistan by name but 
said sikh insurgents were getting help from across the border 
on sunday indian border guards shot and killed 11 pakistanis as 
they tried to slip across the border into kashmir authorities said 
sikh radicals have waged a bloody sixyear struggle in punjab 
which has claimed about 1700 lives this year 
in srinagar capital of kashmir state adjoining pakistan police 
fired in the air to disperse propakistani demonstrators objecting 
to independence celebrations pti reported it said demonstrators 
burned a police jeep threw stones at police and forced shops to 
close with at least 75 people hurt 
pakistan was part of india until 1947 since their joint 
independence from britain the two nations have fought each other 
in three wars 
pakistan controls 30 percent of kashmir but claims the entire 
state as its own india rejects the claim 
at least 2500 security officers were on duty as gandhi 
delivered his independence day address at the 16thcentury red fort 
in new delhi according to a police official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
guests including cabinet ministers and foreign diplomats were 
frisked before the 40minute ceremony and sharpshooters were posted 
on tall buildings around the sandstone fort 
gandhi wearing white trousers and a tunic unfurled the indian 
flag on the ramparts of the fort to begin the festivities 
he referred in his speech to the nearby island nation of sri 
lanka where about 47000 indian soldiers are deployed to enforce a 
july 29 1987 peace accord aimed at ending a fiveyear rebellion 
by tamil insurgents 
tamil rebels returned to combat after a brief truce and are 
fighting indian troops 
we hope that the accord will be speedily implemented gandhi 
said 
a major reason for indias brokering the accord was that india 
has 60 million tamils of its own who are sympathetic to the sri 
lankan rebel cause tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people and claim discrimination by the majority sinhalese 
population 
indias diplomatic mission in colombo sri lanka is under heavy 
security after intelligence reports that a tamil assassination

an american researcher said monday 
she is investigating whether hypnosis can help people with aids 
strengthen their immune systems which the virus that produces the 
deadly disease destroys 
karen olness professor of pediatrics at the case western 
reserve university in cleveland said she is very optimistic 
that hypnosis eventually may play a role in battling acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
aids undermines the bodys diseasefighting immune system 
rendering it vulnerable to various infections and forms of cancer 
ms olness said she is trying to find out whether some infections 
can be prevented or slowed 
hypnosis has been found effective in the treatment of less 
serious immunerelated illnesses such as warts ms olness told 
the associated press in an interview 
she was attending the 11th international congress on hypnosis 
and psychosomatic medicine a gathering of more than 600 medical 
and psychiatric experts 
we are trying to find out which immune changes a human being 
can voluntarily affect under the influence of hypnosis she said 
ms olness added that she had recently began an experiment 
involving about 50 hemophiliac children infected with the humane 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids hemophiliacs are 
a major risk group for aids which they contract through infected 
blood transfusions 
part of the group is being taught selfhypnosis techniques to 
see if they develop more antibodies against disease than the other 
children ms olness said 
the patients all aged 5 to 12 are shown a puppet show that 
explains the basics of the immune system 
they then are hypnotized and given the suggestion that they can 
voluntarily increase production of certain antibodies shesaid and 
in later stages of the experiment they should be able to invoke the 
hypnotic state themselves 
her experiments purpose is to boost boosting the function of 
tcell lymphocytes immune system cells that can help fight off 
aids infection 
mrs olness said her work was in line with a recent experiment 
in which a group of children showed significant increases of 
immunoglobulins immune system proteins in their saliva after 
undergoing hypnotic treatment 
they were effectively increasing their antibodies just by 
being told to do so under hypnosis she said the experiment 
involved was conducted two years ago at the university of minnesota 
in minneapolis minn according to ms olness 
a hypnotized person is made to concentrate on a particular image 
and enters an altered state of consciousness similiar to sleep 
while that condition lasts the patient is highly susceptible to 
suggestions that would otherwise seem strange or unacceptable 
conversely the immune system can be severely weakened by 
adverse factors such as stress ms olness said adding that little 
is known about the exact relationship between a persons emotional 
state and the bodys resistance to disease 
she acknowledged that the experiment scheduled to last for two 
years may be too short for lasting conclusions not all hiv 
carriers ultimately develop aids and it may take several years for 
symptoms to appear in those who do 
use of hypnosis in fighting immunerelated disease is among the 
most recent applications of the practice which became popular in 
the late 18th century through the work of the austrian physician 
franz mesmer 
aids is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

a highranking soviet diplomat arrived 
at the secret nevada test site on monday as the countdown continued 
to wednesdays historic joint ussoviet nuclear weapons test 
igor m palenykh who headed the soviet delegation during the 
arms control talks in geneva was taken to the remote desert site 
65 miles from las vegas where final preparations are under way for 
a test that will mark a milestone in the atomic age 
palenykhs arrival was not announced in advance 
the nuclear test known officially as the joint verification 
experiment comes nearly four years after president reagan first 
proposed such a project in a speech to the united nations it is 
designed to measure each countrys ability to monitor the size of 
the others test verification could lead to ratification of 
treaties limiting the size of nuclear tests which were signed in 
1974 and 1976 but never ratified 
scientists from the united states and the soviet union will be 
measuring the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device encased in 
a steel canister buried 2050 feet beneath a picturesque mesa 
the canister painted red white and blue is 8 feet tall 88 
inches in diameter and weighs 7 tons soviet scientists were 
allowed to look at the canister but only after the nuclear device 
had been sealed inside 
while the test will measure the size of a blast it is not 
directly related to a possible test ban however scientists and 
diplomats say wednesdays experiment is a crucial first step 
energy department spokesman chris west said palenykhs 
counterpart at the geneva talks us ambassador c paul robinson 
is scheduled to arrive at the test site this week 
the weather looks good and from a technical standpoint 
everythings in place west said monday afternoon were just 
making last minute checks and doublechecks both sides want to 
make sure it goes like clockwork 
robinson who helped forge the historic agreement called the 
test unprecedented and said it was the result of a breakthrough 
in negotiations between the united states and the soviet union 
the test will mark the first time nuclear scientists from either 
country have been allowed on the others highly sensitive test 
sites as many as 45 soviets will be on the secret nevada test site 
to monitor wednesdays blast scheduled for 1 pm edt 
a like number of us scientists who conduct nuclear testing 
programs for the us and great britain will be on hand for a 
soviet test at semipalatinsk sometime next month 
on wednesday the two superpowers will be testing their own 
monitoring systems the united states will be using a system known 
as corrtex continuous reflectometry for radius versus time 
experiment which determines the yield of a nuclear explosion by 
measuring the shock waves from the blast 
the soviets will be testing similar systems to see if they 
obtain the same data the data for both sides will be recorded in 
trailers hundreds of yards from the blast site no one will be 
allowed with 15 miles except for helicopters monitoring the site 
with television cameras 
soviet and american scientists along with selected reporters 
will monitor the blast from a control point 30 miles away 
systems to measure the size of an explosion are considered a key 
in ratifying the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 
peaceful nuclear explosions treaty both limit nuclear tests to 150 
kilotons and both sides have accused the other of exceeding those 
limits 
the soviet scientists are based at mercury a tiny community on 
the remote desert test site they are allowed to move around at 
will in mercury but are taken under escort to all other areas of 
the secret site

prime minister margaret thatcher said monday her 
government will enact laws prohibiting banks from handling funds of 
the irish republican army and other terrorist groups 
it will be illegal for banks and other financial institutions 
accountants and financial advisers to handle such funds and the 
government will be empowered to seize the assets of convicted 
terrorists she said 
mrs thatcher also said her government plans to put a special 
force in northern ireland to combat extortion and fundraising 
rackets run by the ira a predominantly roman catholic group trying 
to drive britain from the province and rival protestant 
organizations 
she outlined her plans in a letter to the rev martin smyth a 
lawmaker from northern irelands largest protestant party the 
official unionists who had accused the government of inadequate 
efforts against the ira and other outlawed organizations 
the irish republic passed legislation in 1985 enabling the 
government to seize money suspected of belonging to the ira which 
also is outlawed in the republic 
convention obliges mrs thatcher to withhold details of planned 
legislation until queen elizabeth ii presents the governments 
program at the opening of parliament in november 
a spokesman for sinn fein the iras legal political wing said 
eliminating the distinctive car license plates issued to british 
soldiers serving in west germany will not protect them from 
guerrilla attacks 
sean macmanus sinn feins national chairman said in a 
statement the proposal was only a cosmetic exercise 
calls for a change in the distinctive license plates were 
renewed after the ira killed a british soldier driving in belgium 
on friday 
changing british soldiers car license plates wont protect 
them from irish republican army attacks while their army continues 
to occupy part of irelands national territory macmanus said 
warrant officer 1st class richard michael heakin based in 
moenchen bladbach west germany was shot by two men who approached 
his car while it was stopped at a traffic light in ostend belgium

iraq accused iran on monday of bombarding 
its troops with artillery and mortar fire the second time in a 
week it said tehran had broken a promise not to attack in the days 
leading to a formal ceasefire 
iraq made its accusations in a letter from the iraqi mission to 
the united nations it did not mention casualties or damage 
iran denied a similar accusation last week iraqi ambassador 
ismat t kittani did not lodge a protest but filed a brief 
factual report with the united nations

saturday through monday in army sectors that include the iraqi 
southern port city of basra and the southern faw peninsula 
on aug 8 secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced 
that iran and iraq had agreed to a truce in their nearly 8yearold 
war beginning saturday and to start peace talks five days later in 
geneva 
iran gave perez de cuellar a letter pledging not to engage in 
military action except in selfdefense iraq did not offer such a 
letter but the secretarygeneral said both countries told him they 
would restrain their armed forces 
last week tehran lodged a protest with the un chief claiming 
iraqi warplanes violated irans air space and created sonic booms 
over five cities

health officials are premature in embracing 
programs to trace sexual and needlesharing partners of people 
infected with the aids virus researchers said monday 
such programs are required by the federal government as a 
condition of grants to states for aids programs 
but there is little evidence such programs curb the spread of 
the virus the researchers said at the annual meeting of the 
american psychological association 
in response a government public health expert defended the 
programs as a way to get education to people a high risk of 
infection 
we have to try and make education work said russ havlak of 
the federal centers for disease control 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome can be 
spread by sex or sharing of needles used to inject drugs one goal 
of notification is to limit the spread of infection by uncovering 
people who do not realize they carry the virus and persuading them 
to act accordingly 
but evidence is lacking that notification affects virus spread 
said edmund dejowski of rutgers university so it is premature to 
adopt widespread notification he said 
cdcs havlak said that while the brief counseling that surrounds 
a notification will not be enough to make a person change his 
behavior that counseling is only the beginning 
longterm counseling and support are needed to bring about 
behavior change he said many parts of the country have yet to 
develop such programs he added 
dejowski also said the workings of some notification programs 
raise questions about the rights of notified people 
one citys notifiers ask to draw blood for a test from the 
person at the time he is notified he said the contacted person 
having just heard overwhelming information from a stranger may 
not be able to properly consider that request dejowski said 
havlak called the point arguable but said the notifiers offer 
onthespot testing only as an option distraught people are 
offered crisis intervention help rather than being forced to decide 
on the blood test he said 
dejowski also criticized pending federal legislation that would 
make states and local governments allow notification of spouses to 
be done by medical personnel such notification lacks the control 
and accountability of programs by public agencies he said 
and there is no guarantee that a doctor nurse or other medical 
professional would have the training and sensitivity to deliver the 
news properly he said 
havlak said he knows of no state that now prevents doctors from 
doing such notifications doctors can get help from state health 
departments if they wish he said

cardinal miguel obando y bravo said 
monday the sandinista government and ussupported rebels are 
preparing for more war after several failed attempts at talking 
peace 
during the news program el pensamiento on privately owned radio 
noticias the roman catholic prelate referred to a broadcast in 
which a leader of the rebels known as contras said they never 
will abandon their fight against the leftist sandinistas 
i heard a few moments ago something resembling the roman 
saying that if you want peace prepare for war and it seems both 
sides are preparing for war obando y bravo archbishop of 
managua said that would be deplorable because those who pay the 
price for it are the youths who are dying 
i have always said dialogue should be the solution but it 
seems clear a propitious climate for dialogue doesnt exist at this 
moment 
god willing the government and the contra resistance will 
adopt flexible positions these inflexible positions only produce 
death destruction and the countrys ruin he said 
contras and their civilian supporters have been fleeing to 
neighboring honduras as supplies dwindle for lack of us funds 
but rebel leader enrique bermudez said on clandestine liberation 
radio the fight will continue 
if we want peace we should prepare ourselves for war 
bermudez said at a ceremony inducting 600 new guerrillas into 
contra ranks at a camp in southern honduras liberation radio 
carried parts of the ceremony 
we will not abandon the struggle until we achieve democracy in 
nicaragua bermudez said we will lay down our weapons only in 
exchange for democracy otherwise the nicaraguan people will 
declare us guilty of writing one of the blackest chapters in our 
countrys history 
we will not return to the negotiating table until the 
sandinistas are ready to talk seriously he said referring to 
president daniel ortegas call last week for resumption of the 
stalled peace talks 
bermudez a hard liner was elected last month to the 
sevenmember directorate of the contra umbrella organization 
nicaraguan resistance 
contra and sandinista representatives signed a ceasefire 
agreement march 23 that has been extended but often violated 
ortega last extended it unilaterally for 30 days until aug 31 
efforts to negotiate a permanent truce have been deadlocked the 
contras insist the sandinistas introduce democratic reforms before 
they lay down their arms but the sandinistas demand the rebels 
stop fighting and join the legal opposition 
contra negotiators broke off the last meeting in managua saying 
the government confined them to their hotel and did not allow them 
to meet with opposition leaders 
ortega proposed another meeting aug 2729 in managua or 
washington 
the contras demanded a site elsewhere in central america 
preferably san jose costa rica and that ortega lead the 
government delegation the sandinistas have not responded 
last week honduras revived the issue of an international 
verification commission provided for in a central american peace 
plan of aug 7 1987 and said it should operate on the 
nicaraguahonduras border to keep contras and sandinista troops 
apart 
ortega agreed but on monday the rebels objected 
contra leader adolfo calero said in miami the nicaraguan 
resistance is present throughout nicaragua so if you are going 
to get an international force to guarantee a security zone it will 
be necessary to have an international force that will guarantee all 
of nicaragua as a security zone

the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is 
likely to concur with the minor disciplinary recommendations 
contained in an investigative report on the shootdown of an iranian 
airliner by the uss vincennes defense officials said monday 
the report in its current form recommends the light penalty of 
a nonpunitive letter of censure for the guidedmissile 
cruisers operations officer said the officials who insisted on 
anonymity 
that officer so far not identified would be reprimanded for 
his role in misinterpreting radar data and leading the vincennes 
skipper capt will c rogers to believe that the ship was about 
to be attacked by an iranian fighter 
rogers and other crew members would not face any disciplinary 
action even though investigators concluded the iranian airliner 
was shot down primarily through human error aboard the ship the 
sources said all 290 people aboard the iran air a300 airbus died 
in the july 3 incident 
adm william j crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs 
received the investigative report a week ago and will forward the 
document to defense secretary frank c carlucci soon the sources 
said 
crowe has the prerogative of changing the reports 
recommendations before they are presented to carlucci but that 
doesnt look like its going to happen said one official 
its hard because 290 people died but the vincennes was on a 
wartime footing and just coming out of combat when this happened 
no system is perfect in war the official said 
carlucci as the final reviewing authority may accept or reject 
crowes findings 
the recommendation that only one officer be disciplined in the 
incident was first reported sunday by the washington post which 
said the operations officer faced a letter of reprimand 
however defense officials said monday that the recommendation 
involved a nonpunitive letter of censure which is a lighter 
penalty than a letter of reprimand because it wont become an 
official part of the officers service record 
the sources also said the special board of inquiry that 
investigated the incident had not originally recommended any 
disciplinary action at all 
the recommendation for a letter of censure was inserted by gen 
george b crist the head of the us central command before he 
forwarded the report to crowe the sources said 
two weeks ago defense officials disclosed the board of inquiry 
headed by rear adm william n fogarty had concluded the 
vincennes attacked and destroyed the airbus because of human 
mistakes made under the stress of combat 
because of the mistakes capt rogers believed his ship had 
survived its first combat action with iranian gunboats only to 
confront an approaching hostile iranian f14 jet fighter the 
sources said 
there was no evidence the aegis radar system aboard the cruiser 
malfunctioned or that it presented technical data to justify the 
hostile classification the sources added

a soviet historian says the goals of the 
czechoslovak reforms soviet tanks crushed 20 years ago were similar 
to those now pursued by mikhail s gorbachev 
ls yagodovskys article in the latest issue of the weekly 
journal arguments and facts contrasted dramatically with previous 
characterizations of the the prague spring led by alexander 
dubcek which ended with a sovietled invasion aug 21 1968 
as recently as january the soviet news agency tass said 
comparisons with current soviet reforms were the work of western 
propaganda 
yagodovsky assistant director of the soviet academy of 
sciences institute of the economy of the world socialist system 
used such gorbachev words as restructuring glasnost 
selfmanagement and selffinancing to describe the 
czechoslovak reforms 
reforms adopted by the czechoslovak communist party in 1965 
coincide with the basic principles of todays transformation in 
this area in czechoslovakia as with the conception of economic 
reform existing at this time in the soviet union and other 
socialist countries he said in the aug 1319 edition of the 
journal 
he said leonid i brezhnev then the soviet leader was more 
sympathethic to conservative opponents and in the end reformers 
let the situation get out of control 
yagodovsky quoted party documents that said no way existed to 
restore order in the country except to invite the invasion 
he said conservatives backed by party chief antonin novotny 
blocked the reforms and they could not succeed without 
perestroika of the form and methods of party work without 
democratization of society affirmation of glasnost openness 
without giving socialism genuine human lines 
dubcek replaced novotny as party leader in january 1968 and in 
march ludvik svoboda replaced novotny as president 
further reforms put in place in january and april 1968 opened 
the way for normalization of the situation uniting the leading 
forces in a platform of renewal yagodovsky said but dubcek and 
other party leaders did not take advantage of it 
one of the main reasons in my view is that despite the 
rearrangement in the government unity in the presidium of the 
czechoslovak communist party and in the party as a whole was not 
guaranteed he said 
all top officials wanted reforms but did not agree on what the 
reforms meant he said 
antisocialist forces inside and outside czechoslovakia 
became more active and the situation in the country deteriorated 
sharply he said yagodovsky quoted czechoslovak party documents as 
saying the party was paralyzed the government on the brink of 
decay and there was no choice but to bring in the warsaw pact force 
to restore order 
dubcek was replaced as czechoslovak party leader in april 1969 
by gustav husak who retired last year after running one of the 
soviet blocs more conservative organizations for nearly a 
generation

harold stassen wound down his eighth 
fruitless presidential campaign monday with the claim that ive 
always had something to say during his 40year quest for the 
white house 
the fascinating thing about this year the 81yearold 
stassen said in an interview as the republican national convention 
began here is i came in very late saying that none of the 
other 14 candidates were saying anything about children 
i said we needed a new american childrens program we needed 
it urgently so im quite fascinated that theyre all talking 
about a new childrens program now the candidates of both 
parties 
stassen the onetime boy wonder of minnesota politics was 
elected governor at age 31 and reelected in 1940 and 42 he 
resigned in 1943 to serve in the navy during world war ii and 
never won another election 
stassen was a major contender for the gop presidential 
nomination in 1948 when the partys nod went to thomas dewey 
he also unsuccessfully opposed barry goldwater for the partys 
nomination in 1964 richard nixon in 1968 gerald ford in 1976 and 
ronald reagan in 1980 and 1984 
stassen entered primaries this year in new hampshire west 
virginia and a few other states 
he insisted that campaigning even when there is no chance of 
victory is the best way to get a hearing for his views 
you dont get attention to your views by writing letters or 
talking to politicians said stassen who practices law and lives 
with his wife esther in the st paul suburb of sunfish lake 
stassen said hes attended about a dozen republican national 
conventions the first in 1936 as president of a young republicans 
organization 
asked whether he will run for president again stassen said i 
dont know how long im going to live

an experimental roman catholic parish 
that offered extensive lay participation such as planning the 
liturgy went out of official existence monday but its members 
vowed to carry on 
daniel corley a lay trustee of the genesis community said the 
13yearold group would continue in some form despite bishop louis 
e gelineaus decision to disband it as a formal churchsanctioned 
group 
after today the bishop has told us that we cannot have a 
priest and a eucharist celebrated on sunday morning corley said 
we will be following the bishops directive over the next 40 
days we will not get together as a community for eucharist 
celebration on sunday morning 
the group will meet on sunday nights for prayer reflection 
and discussion and will decide at the end of the 40 days where to 
proceed corley said 
last month gelineau who created the genesis community 13 years 
ago announced it would be dissolved after a task force he 
commissioned found it beset with erroneous attitudes concerning 
church teaching 
corley said the group was consulting canon lawyers to see 
whether gelineaus decision could be appealed william g halpin 
spokesman for the roman catholic diocese of providence said he did 
not think an appeal was possible 
theyre an experimental open worship community that was a 
creation of the diocese so its strictly a diocesan internal 
matter halpin said 
my understanding is that their only appeal would be to the 
bishop he said i dont think theres any provision where they 
could go over his head to rome for example 
the genesis community unlike most catholic parishes was open 
to rhode islanders regardless of where in the state they lived 
corley said it was distinguished by the role lay people played in 
sitting down with the priest planning liturgy social justice 
concerns 
conflicts between the group and its most recent priest the rev 
peter scagnelli led gelineau to commission the task force that 
recommended ending the experiment 
corley said the conflicts included whether leavened or 
unleavened bread would be used during the eucharist ceremony and 
whether lay people as well as priests could read from the gospel or 
deliver homilies 
he said the community gave in to scagnelli on each of those 
issues but with each concession some members became more and more 
disturbed 
some members said the degree of lay participation was what drew 
them to genesis and warned that the churchs resistance to the idea 
would be selfdefeating 
the catholic church is not the cathedral its not the clergy 
its us its the people said member jack cotter i cant see 
myself going back to the parish i left 13 years ago

vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen used a 
visit to the johnson space flight center monday to announce the 
democratic ticket will support building a permanent manned space 
station 
the texas senator long a supporter of the space program said 
presidential nominee michael dukakis now endorses the permanent 
station and that nails it down 
dukakis the massachusetts governor issued his endorsement in 
shrewsbury mass and said he would pay for the station by cutting 
some weapons programs and requiring tighter defense department 
management 
a dukakisbentsen administration will support an allout 
effort to restore american leadership in exploring the universe 
bentsen said in a speech to the houston chamber of commerce 
although president reagan is a longtime supporter of the space 
station bentsen said the administration has mismanaged the space 
effort if dukakis is elected president bentsen said he as vice 
president would be put in charge of a reconstituted cabinetlevel 
space council 
lyndon johnson headed the space council when he was vice 
president but the board was later abolished by president nixon 
and reagan has killed recent efforts in congress to put it back in 
operation bentsen said 
dukakiss previous silence on the question of the space station 
has created worries in states with large national aeronautics and 
space administration installations including texas although 
congress has authorized 902 million for starting the project next 
year the next president will have the option of withholding 515 
million of that nasa officials said 
dukakiss statement makes you breathe a little easier said 
john trebes manager of the space station mockup at the johnson 
center now were on our tippytoes worrying if well be around 
next year 
bentsen following his speech to the chamber of commerce 
luncheon denied dukakiss announcement represents a conversion 
i think he was wise to have insisted on counsel before 
making any decision bentsen told reporters adding that he was 
one of those consulted by the presidential nominee 
rep mike andrews dtexas who accompanied bentsen in houston 
called dukakiss decision an extremeley important announcement 
for the campaign in some hotly contested states that have space 
facilities itll help him in florida california alabama texas 
and ohio andrews said 
although reagan has been supportive he said the president 
didnt mention it in his last state of the union address i think 
its a huge issue 
before making his speech bentsen climbed into a space shuttle 
mockup at the space center and chatted with navy cmdr robert 
hoot gibson a shuttle pilot bentsen sat in the command seat and 
compared the controls with those he used as a b24 pilot during 
world war ii 
i can look at a lot of things and have a great deal of 
familiarity he said some of the instruments arent that far 
apart from those in older aircraft he said 
bentsen visited the space center during a nineday campaign 
swing that will be spent almost entirely in his home state where 
he is running both for the vice presidency and for reelection to 
his senate seat dukakis is scheduled to join bentsen at the end of 
the week for campaign stops and a visit to the lbj ranch 
bentsen made a quick trip to little rock ark monday afternoon 
for a rally with his senate colleagues from that neighboring state 
dale bumpers and david pryor 
about 400 supporters cheered them on in a blazinghot office 
building courtyard as they praised the dukakisbentsen ticket and 
blasted the republicans convening in new orleans 
i have never seen a crowd so out of touch with reality 
bentsen his shirt soaked with sweat told the crowd 
bentsen said little rock had lost 3700 manufacturing jobs 
during the reagan administration and theyre trying to tell you 
its never been better he said 
i think we may be playing for all the marbles this time he 
said 
bentsen then headed back to texas for appearances tuesday in 
beaumont and fort worth

a second request for clemency for convicted 
rapist gary dotson was made monday to gov james thompson citing 
new hightech tests dotsons attorney says support cathy webbs 
recantation and prove his clients innocence beyond a doubt 
this is a case where a person was arrested convicted and 
sentenced for a crime that never occurred said dotsons 
attorney tom breen 
dotson had served six years of a 25 to 50year sentence 
following his 1979 rape conviction when mrs webb stepped forward 
to say she had lied when she said he raped her in order to cover 
up a teenage sexual liaison 
thompson who received results of the test last week is in new 
orleans for the republican national convention 
terry barnich the governors legal counsel said before 
thompson makes a decision on the clemency he wants to talk to 
some scientific types to feel comfortable in his own mind whether 
this test is scientifically reliable beyond a reasonable doubt 
dotson meanwhile remained behind bars monday at the joliet 
correctional center serving the last day of a sixmonth prison 
term for failing to call his parole officer immediately after 
thompson granted him a last chance release from prison dec 24 
testimony before the illinois prisoner review board showed 
dotson waited until dec 26 to call his parole officer later that 
day he was arrested in a bar for allegedly starting a fight over a 
sandwich 
that was only one of a number of scrapes with the law dotson has 
had since may 1985 when thompson commuted his sentence on the 
original rape conviction to the six years dotson had already served 
in commuting his sentence thompson bypassed dotsons request 
for clemency saying he did not believe mrs webbs recantation nor 
dotsons denials 
since that 1985 release dotson 30 has been in jail several 
times convicted of drunkendriving charges and arrested for 
allegedly punching his wife and threatening the couples infant 
daughter 
under the goodbehavior terms of thompsons lastchance 
order dotson will remain under parole supervision for three years 
and will undergo treatment for an admitted drinking problem 
dotson will be released tuesday into an intensive residential 
treatment program for an unspecified period of time and will 
continue to receive outpatient counseling for his alcohol problem 
said nic howell spokesman for the illinois department of 
corrections 
breen suggested monday that dotsons runins with the law may 
have stemmed from his original imprisonment and that recent tests 
performed by a california forensic serologist prove conclusively 
absolutely and definitively that gary dotson did not have sex with 
cathy webb 
results of the test which involve dna analysis of blood and 
semen samples from dotson webb and her former boyfriend were 
turned over to breen by thompsons staff 
dr edward blake who performed the tests said in a telephone 
interview monday from the san francisco area that the test 
demonstrates that the semen in webbs panties did not come from 
dotson but was compatible with that of her boyfriend 
he said results of the test called polymerase chain reaction 
were submitted in one criminal case in which he testified in 
california state courts and were not legally challenged by either 
prosecutors or the defense 
he said he was uncertain whether illinois courts would allow 
test results to be submitted as evidence 
the actual clemency request breen made monday is submitted to 
the prison review board which makes a recommendation and passes 
the request on to the governor

the soviet journalists didnt expect to be 
treated like honored guests at the republican national convention 
but they at least thought they would get housing somewhere in the 
city of new orleans 
instead they are staying at a holiday inn some 60 miles from 
the superdome where the convention is being held in the outlying 
town of hammond 
three washingtonbased soviets from the news service tass and 
newspaper pravda said their drive to the convention site is even 
longer because they must travel by a route approved by the state 
department 
they also had to book their rooms through the department which 
is routine said vitaly gan of pravda 
he said they asked for their rooms in april and were told 
everything in new orleans was booked up 
state department officials told them there are no rooms no 
chance sorry guys no deliberate attempt to impede your work 
they said youre lucky not to be in baton rouge added oleg 
polyakovsky of tass 
at the state department in washington spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley gave a different version of what happened 
she said one soviet request was received in may and another in 
july and that the new orleans hotels were in fact booked up 
some other new yorkbased soviets applied in april and were 
housed in downtown new orleans she said 
however one american journalist reported booking a room only 
last week downtown and another said a french quarter hotel that is

demonstrators sought to disrupt a rally for 
evangelist pat robertson and focus attention on the homeless and 
aids as the republican national convention got under way monday 
police said six demonstrators were arrested outside the hotel 
where the robertson rally was underway 
while most rallies were peaceful a shoving match broke out near 
a fence outside the superdome the convention site when some of 
about 50 people protesting federal policy on acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or aids tried to push their way past no one 
was arrested 
before they arrived at the superdome protesters gave brief 
speeches calling for more government support for social and medical 
programs for aids victims then they lay down on the steps of city 
hall for what they called a diein 
at lafayette park about six blocks from city hall and the 
superdome officials had set up a small stage and sound system for 
demonstrators to reserve 90minute slots the stage was empty much 
of the day 
one of the speakers naim daiy head of the new orleans 
coalition for the homeless said more attention should be paid to 
the issues which prompted the demonstrations 
protest organizers have lamented about light turnouts at several 
events dana beal 41 a demonstrator from new york said many 
groups are complacent about the fall elections 
theres no turnout because everybody thinks george bush is a 
goner hes behind in the polls beal said 
the climate is another factor with both parties conventions 
held in the south this summer 
its difficult to persuade people to go from one hot place to 
another hot place beal said 
daytime temperature in new orleans have been in the 90s similar 
conditions prevailed at the democratic national convention in

republican senate candidates paraded their 
wares at the gop national convention monday as the coordinator of 
their drive to regain control of the senate said none of them will 
ever be outhustled by their democratic opponents 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn chairman of the republican 
senatorial campaign committee predicted the gop will regain 
control of the senate in november because of good organization 
good candidates good financing and a series of surprises 
although he acknowleged that at the moment 12 to 15 seats can 
still go either way 
thirtytwo senate seats are at risk this fall the republicans 
hold 17 of those seats the democrats have 15 
boschwitz was optimistic 
we think the gop can regain control of the united states 
senate in 1988 he said we think its in the realm of reason 
no matter how you look at it these are good candidates none of 
them is going to be outhustled 
he predicted that the republicans will take five of the six 
states left open by retirements 
he acknowleged that republican candidates are behind in some 
states but he added we think a number of these guys are going 
to pull through 
democrats won conntrol of the senate in 1986 and now hold it 
with a majority of 5446 
boschwitz introduced the candidates at a news conference and 
allotted 60 seconds of exposure to each of 16 candidates many took 
longer than that 
susan engeleiter minority leader of the wisconsin state senate 
reported that her name identification is up from 15 percent to 65 
percent

americas ambassador to china said monday that 
during a visit to tibet he expressed concern about human rights 
violations and asked the regions government to lift restrictions 
on foreign journalists and other travelers 
ambassador winston lord lord said he told doje cering chairman 
of the tibet autonomous region that if they want to have 
informed reporting they ought to let in journalists as well as 
anyone else 
lord visited the tibetan capital of lhasa and the city of xigaze 
aug 410 he was the first us ambassador to visit the remote 
western region 
tibet ruled by china has been closed to all but a few selected 
foreign reporters since proindependence riots in lhasa last fall 
and again in march tibet had been trying to build a tourist 
industry but it also banned individual travelers permitting only 
organized group tours after the violence 
fourteen foreign reporters who went to lhasa to cover the 
october riots were expelled from tibet 
lord said doje cering seemed responsive he did not 
elaborate 
the ambassador said that in his twohour meeting with doje 
cering he also brought up the issues of human rights and the status 
of prisoners detained after the disturbances 
china accused the us congress of interfering in its internal 
affairs after the passage of several congressional resolutions last 
year calling for an end to human rights violations in tibet 
lord said doje cering told him that the human rights situation 
has improved in tibet since the chinese communists ended the 
theocracy headed by the dalai lama the spiritual head of tibetan 
buddhism 
tibet came under chinese military and political control in 
195051 the dalai lama fled to india after a failed nationalist 
revolt in 1959 and tibet was made an autonomous region of china in 
1965 lord noted the united states recognizes chinas sovereignty 
over the region 
the antichinese demonstrations in october 1987 and last march 
were led by tibetan monks loyal to the dalai lama they accuse the 
chinese government of undermining tibetan social and religious 
customs 
lord said doje cering told him that only 25 or 26 of the more 
than 200 people detained after the march rioting remained in 
prison and eight of those still jailed were buddhist monks or 
nuns it is beleved several dozen people were killed during the 
violence in march 
lord said he asked permission for a us official to visit a 
jail but there was no immediate response

us attorney general dick thornburgh said 
monday he has no reason to believe he will be selected as 
republican george bushs running mate and that it would be 
presumptuous to say whether he would accept such an offer 
ill be back on the job tomorrow in washington thornburgh 
the former twoterm pennsylvania governor told reporters at a 
rally sponsored by his states gop convention delegation 
thornburgh said he was in town only to hear president reagans 
address to the convention monday night 
asked how he would respond to an offer from the allbutcertain 
nominee for the vice presidency thornburgh hesitated before 
replying thats a presumptuous kind of a statement to make i 
have no reason to think thats going to happen 
thornburgh was sworn in as the successor to former attorney 
general edwin meese iii on friday 
sen arlen specter rpa a member of the judiciary committee 
that heaped praise on thornburgh during his confirmation hearing 
said senators would understand if thornburgh left after less than a 
week on the job 
obviously the justice department is very important we pushed 
hard to move things quickly with confirmation specter said 
but my sense is people would feel this is important if the 
vice presidency gives him a higher calling thats that he said 
specter who favors kansas sen bob dole for the no 2 spot on 
the ticket said he did not know what thornburghs chances were of 
getting the nod

the police chief monday yielded to pressure 
from civil rights leaders and rescinded a policy requiring officers 
to randomly stop black youths in a racially mixed neighborhood 
chief martin felker issued an order july 8 that police stop and 
question groups of black teenagers in what he called an effort to 
end racial violence in old west end neighborhood 
the procedure was implemented to address a series of crimes 
that had been committed felker said in a statement monday 
afternoon unfortunately the focus of the directive has been 
perceived as racially motivated instead of the intent of focusing 
on the suspects involved 
the statement apparently was issued to clarify reports earlier 
monday that felker had just dropped the word black from his 
directive the statement said he had rescinded the order and 
directed his officers to return to normal procedures of stopping 
people only if police believe reasonable cause exists 
felkers decision followed meetings with the president of the 
toledo chapter of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people city officials and neighborhood residents 
a group of black lawyers hailed felkers decision but said a 1 
million federal lawsuit against the city would not be withdrawn 
the suit will continue and we expect more plaintiffs to join 
us the policy was patently racist said lafayette tolliver vice 
president of the thurgood marshall law association 
the group filed the lawsuit friday on behalf of walter wade jr 
a black teenager who was followed and stopped by police in front 
of his house but never charged with a crime 
the lawsuit said the policy violates the constitutional 
protections against illegal search and seizure 
us district judge john potter rejected the groups request for 
a temporary restraining order after learning felker had rescinded 
his directive 
blacks make up about 17 percent of the citys population of 
340000

democrats

it was reagans last full day in the spotlight at bushs 
convention complete with an affectionate birthday party tribute to 
his wife in front of all our friends here today let me say 
thank you for all you do thank you for your love and thank you for 
just being you he said 
said the first lady we have had a wonderful run but today it 
is time for the bushes to step into the political leading roles and 
for the reagans to step into the wings 
republicans hoped that bushs turn at center stage would 
dramatically improve his standing against dukakis most polls 
indicate the vice president trailing and a new abc news poll gave 
the massachusetts governor a doubledigit advantage 
the vice president told interviewers that he hadnt settled on a 
partner for the fall campaign and hinted that some surprise names 
were still on his private list nice try was his 
noninformative reply when one interviewer tried to penetrate the 
secrecy 
if there was no news about his pick there was no shortage of 
interest 
were trying to get barbara bush to put a recorder under the 
vice presidents pillow said barbara campbell gop chairwoman in 
montana 
many of the contenders were in town for the convention and 
related caucuses and receptions some of them practically 
auditioning for the job and others professing bewilderment that 
they even figured in the speculation 
if i were to be asked i would be a terrific campaigner and a 
terrific candidate and a terrific vice president said kemp 
were not running sen bob dole insisted as his wife and 
cocontender elizabeth sat at his side but when the phone rings 
she says well let me get it he teased 
but former senate majority leader and white house chief of staff 
howard baker said ive no desire to be vice president quipped 
sen william armstrong they cant possibly call me now i have 
an unlisted number 
convention organizers passed the word that they would soon 
assign aides to draft generic speeches for use by the person 
bush ultimately selects 
bush said he felt the pressure mounting as his big moment 
approached but i dont feel concerned about it i have to be

tens of thousands of people turned 
the funeral for threetime president arnulfo arias madrid into a 
huge but peaceful antigovernment demonstration monday 
it was one of the largest demonstrations in 14 months of 
protests against the rule of gen manuel antonio noriega who 
commands panamas defense forces and controls the civilian 
government 
arias was elected three times and overthrown each time by the 
military he died wednesday in miami 
arias who would would have been 87 monday spent more time in 
jail and exile than in office but was credited with founding 
panamas social security system and introducing womens suffrage 
a vast crowd gathered in the plaza in front of the metropolitan 
cathedral for the funeral that was conducted from the church steps 
as the service ended and the coffin was placed aboard a 
firetruck a roar went up from the crowd with the people repeatedly 
shouting justice 
thousands of people followed the cortege out of the plaza 
through the narrow streets of the old section of panama city and 
onto central avenue for the threemile journey to a cemetery with 
each block te procession became longer until people filled the 
fourlane avenue for nearly a mile 
arnulfo president noriega criminal people in the crowd 
shouted noriega must go 
many people waved white banners a sign of protest in panama or 
the flags of political parties opposed to noriega who was indicted 
by two federal grand juries in florida last february on charges of 
narcotics trafficking 
the government offered to provide military honors at the funeral 
but the authentic panamanian party which arias founded in 1935 
refused instead the party decided on the requiem mass conducted 
on the cathedral steps by marcos mcgrath the roman catholic 
archbishop 
we cant accept that those who always overthrew the doctor 
arias share in our grief said francisco artola party vice 
president the ceremony is going to be for the people 
noriegas soldiers and police who have crushed dozens of 
protests in the past 14 months did not interfere with the funeral 
despite the antigovernment tone 
firefighters helped control the cathedral crowd and one of their 
bright orange ladder trucks carried the flagdraped coffin to the 
garden of peace cemetery 
all sides in this politically divided country claimed arias as 
their own 
governmentcontrolled newspapers referred vaguely to his 
errors during 57 years in politics but praised his nationalism 
and defiance of the united states 
us ambassador arthur davis and his daughter susan were among 
the mourners monday 
arias was first turned out of office by a military coup july 14 
1941 after serving 9 months of a fouryear term in january of 
that year he had rejected a us war department request for land 
for military bases along the panama canal 
soon after arias was deposed at washingtons urging panama 
provided 37000 acres for the bases 
he was elected again in 1949 but tossed out by the army in 1951 
he began his third elected term oct 1 1968 but was overthrown 11 
days later in a coup led by gen omar torrijos whom noriega 
replaced as head of the 15000member defense forces 
four years ago arias ran for president again and lost to nicolas 
ardito barletta noriegas candidate in an election widely viewed 
as fraudulent the government said ardito barletta won by 1713 
votes 
arias died of a heart attack he had gone to florida for medical 
treatment last april and remained there until his death

part of the media portray him

die welt a conservative bonnbased daily 
it is the most critical nominating convention for the 
republicans in the last 12 years they have not had to operate so 
much on the defense since jimmy carter challenged incumbent gerald

the republicans now realize that for them reagan is an 
indispensable factor in their presidential election campaign

le figaro a conservative newspaper in a report from its 
correspondent in new orleans 
the republicans asked themselves for a long time should 
reagan and bush appear together in new orleans the gop delegates 
do not hide their preference for the incumbent president and a 
certain lukewarm feeling about the candidate bush it was therefore 
judged more reasonable that the two men simply shake hands tuesday 
morning as they pass at the military airport at new orleans 
so tomorrow george bush takes charge of the party 
le monde an afternoon daily published a frontpage cartoon 
showing reagan gesturing toward bush and saying believe me 
dukakis is worse 
le monde correspondent jan krauze wrote 
mr george bush remains after 7 years as vice president and 
more than a year of campaigning a man about whom there are 
questions a man who despite eminent strengths and a long 
experience in public life has never succeeded in showing a quality 
that is elementary but essential at this stage that he really has 
the stuff of a candidate let alone that of a president

something appears to be stagnant too stagnant around the 
politician george bush 
dagens nyheter independent 
the republican party convention in new orleans will hardly be 
exciting 
an undeniable fact is that the republicans slogan peace and 
prosperity is their best weapon against the democrats if bush 
simply manages to articulate this message of republican triumph at

opposition groups at the club pilipino where mrs aquino took her 
oath as president on feb 25 1986

meetings would be held to unite the opposition and seek mrs 
aquinos ouster 
we are just starting the evolution to unify the political 
parties said enrile the only opposition member in the 23seat 
senate

opposition strong enough to make a challenge

strong leadership in the face of the countrys communist rebellion 
and in other economic and social crises 
he urged her to step down and call new elections and promised 
to resign himself if she did if she refused he would stay in 
office and join the opposition laurel said

mrs aquino and could not say when he would formally announce an 
alliance with the opposition 
i do not want to pressure mrs aquino he added the 
moment it becomes obvious that she will not be stepping down i 
will be a free agent 
mrs aquino has not commented directly on laurels call but she 
accused the vice president saturday of withholding public support 
during coup attempts in 1986 and in august 1987 
asked the presidents reaction to laurels meeting monday with 
the opposition spokesman teodoro benigno quoted mrs aquino as 
saying i was under the impression they were together all along 
sen sotero laurel the vice presidents brother told the upper 
house he would remain with the administration saying there is no 
reason for me to dissociate myself from the coalition

led to marcos ouster after 20 years in power

two israeli f15 jet fighters on a training 
flight collided over the dead sea area monday and both pilots were 
killed the military command reported 
it said maj gen avihu binnun the air force commander 
appointed a commission to investigate 
the announcement was held up about 12 hours and gave no further 
details strict censorship delays release of information on events 
considered to involve national security 
the army identified the pilots as maj ehud falk of the northern 
israeli kibbutz or communal settlement of merhavya and lt col 
ram kuller of the northern kibbutz of kfar giladi 
informed sources in washington said it was the first known 
accident israels air force has had with the highflying 
americanbuilt eagle 
israel has about 50 of the planes manufactured by the mcdonnell 
douglas corp and ordered five more earlier in the summer 
they were used with deadly force in an air war with syria a 
decade ago more than 80 syrian jets were shot down none of the 
israeli f15s were lost 
the lopsided israeli victory and triumphs in other wars with 
arab enemies has created an aura of pride and proficiency envied 
by other air forces around the world 
two other f15s owned by japan crashed last june the planes 
cost about 30 million apiece 
normally israeli training exercises with the highflying jets 
are conducted over the negev desert in the southern area of the 
country but speculation about mondays accident centered on the 
israeliheld west bank 
the f15 nicknamed the eagle by the us air force is the most 
advanced landbased jet fighter in the american inventory the 
twinengine jet is designed to fly and fight in all weather 
conditions and can soar at more than 2 times the speed of sound 
israel is one of few foreign countries that has been allowed to 
acquire the plane even so the eagles in its possession are not 
the most advanced version of the f15 produced by mcdonnell douglas 
in recent years the f15s safety record has helped the us 
air force reduce its overall accident rate to some of the lowest 
marks ever 
the us air force has had three midair mishaps involving f15s 
this year but in each case the plane was only damaged managed to 
land without further incident and there were no fatalities 
overall the air force said there have been 15 midair 
accidents 
the f15 was first flown in the united states in 1972 and was 
delivered to us air force combat squadrons beginning in 1976 
since then the eagle has chalked up an overall accident rate of 
30 mishaps per 100000 flight hours which for a jet fighter is 
very low

wyomings primary election tuesday 
features a hotly contested democratic us senate primary that 
could take a week to untangle because of justice department 
concerns over the handling of absentee ballots 
state and federal officials tried monday to avoid a lawsuit that 
could leave the democratic race undecided until next week but 
secretary of state kathy karpan and attorney general joseph meyer 
refused to acknowledge that the state had violated federal election 
laws 
unable to reach an agreement the justice department asked us 
district judge clarence brimmer on monday to order state elections 
officials to count any absentee ballots received through aug 22 
brimmer scheduled a hearing on the matter for tuesday 
several weeks ago the justice department told karpan it would 
file a lawsuit over the mailing of absentee ballots since some 
county clerks sent the ballots out just 26 days before the primary 
instead of at least 30 days 
karpan however maintains that there are no specific guidelines 
governing the mailing of absentee ballots 
a wide margin of victory in the senate primary among state sen 
john vinich state schools superintendent lynn simons and 
university of wyoming law professor pete maxfield would make the 
justice departments concerns moot 
state officials believe that less than 1000 absentee ballots 
are involved in the controversy and with gop registration in 
wyoming approaching 60 percent its possible that just 400 of those 
ballots were sent to democrats and so only an extremely tight race 
would be affected by those ballots 
meyer and karpan pointed that out monday to justice department 
officials who refused to wait until after the primary to decide 
whether to take the state to court said karpan 
the secretary of state as a precaution against a court order 
did advise all 23 county clerks to hold any absentee ballots 
received after the polls close tuesday for at least one week 
the justice department flap capped a primary election campaign 
dominated by the democratic senate race which easily overshadowed 
uncompetitive us house contests and state legislative races 
vinich the first to seek the democratic senate nomination 
became labors favorite and later attracted support from 
environmentalists simons counted on the success of her three 
previous campaigns for superintendent of public instruction 
maxfield is a political neophyte 
incumbent us sen malcolm wallop faced little opposition in 
the republican primary and spent much of the months leading up to 
the election reconstructing a campaign machine that twice before 
had led him to victory in november 
when he did campaign wallop stressed the record he has built 
over the past 12 years pointing to his support of western water 
rights a strong defense and efforts to reduce the tax burdens on 
the oil and gas industries 
in the races for wyomings only house seat bryan sharratt was 
unopposed for the democratic nomination while fiveterm incumbent 
republican dick cheney faced bob morris who two years ago lost by 
63520 votes 
if cheny wins his campaign would get off to a slow start hes 
scheduled to undergo heart bypass surgery friday

an estimated 5000 people claiming the july 
elections were fraudulent clogged the steps of the congress 
building monday as legislators began the process of certifying 
election results 
the crowd parted as cuauhtemoc cardenas presidential candidate 
of the leftist national democratic front arrived to address 
congress people showered cardenas with confetti and shouted 
insults at the governing institutional revolutionary party known 
as the pri 
cardenas told the legislators what we are asking the members 
of the electoral college is one thing responsibility 
we are asking that the elections be cleaned up of the 
innumerable irregularities committed in the electoral process 
principally by representatives of the official party by municipal 
state and federal authorities 
the 64member senate and 500 members of the chamber of deputies 
serve as the electoral college and the session is scheduled to run 
through aug 31 senators will certify election results for senate 
seats and the deputies will certify the results for seats in the 
lower house the chamber of deputies then will certify the count in 
the presidential balloting 
according to the federal election commission pri candidate 
carlos salinas de gortari won the presidential contest with 5036 
percent of the vote it said cardenas a former pri governor and 
senator who broke with the party last year over democratic reform 
received 3112 percent and manuel j clouthier candidate of the 
conservative national action party obtained 1707 percent 
the pri has governed mexico since 1929 dominating both national 
and state politics and it is virtually certain that the 
legislators will name salinas presidentelect in the final stage of 
this years election process 
the new president will be inaugurated dec 1 replacing 
president miguel de la madrid who is completing his sixyear term 
and could not run for reelection under mexican law 
for the first two weeks of the electoral college session the 
legislators will review the results of the congressional races the 
results for 26 seats in the chamber of deputies and at least one 
senate seat are being challenged 
both rightwing and leftwing parties have accused the pri of 
fraud in the july 6 elections and have held protest rallies almost 
daily 
opposition leaders claim the pri cheated at the polling places 
and doctored the voter registration rolls and totals released by 
the federal election commission 
despite the allegations the election may have been the most 
open since the pri was founded in 1929 
for the first time the opposition won seats in the senate 
gaining four although one is being challenged and the pri will 
have have to contend with at least 227 opposition deputies in the 
lower house which has been expanded from 400 to 500 seats the pri 
had 289 seats in the old 400seat chamber 
the final count depends on the certification of the electoral 
college 
in all previous presidential races the pri presidential 
candidate received at least 70 percent of the vote 
the opposition is awaiting with particular interest the separate 
returns on the presidential race from about 25000 of the nations 
nearly 55000 polling places which the election commission did not 
make public 
the commission after a weeklong delay announced overall 
totals saying salinas a 40yearold former budget director had 
won but it made public the tallies from only about 30000 polling 
places

puerto rican speakers showed their deep 
divisions at the united nations monday over whether statehood 
independence or keeping the islands status as a us commonwealth 
was the answer to its economic woes 
the united nations decolonization committee is holding hearings 
this week on puerto ricos status athough the united states 
already has rejected the committee as antiamerican 
a diplomat on the committee speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the committee probably will issue a resolution wednesday 
calling for selfdetermination for puerto rico 
william felice from an organization called the international 
league for the rights and liberation of peoples said puerto rico 
has become poorer than any us state and should be granted 
independence 
but manuel medina a member of a group called puerto ricans for 
statehood inc told the committee puerto rico would benefit more 
by achieving statehood medina said the island still could preserve 
its spanish culture 
other speakers said the united states was actively trying to 
block the proindependence movement 
cuban ambassador oscar oramasoliva introduced a resolution 
which noted allegations that the federal bureau of investigation 
was using surveillance to keep track of puerto rican independence 
activists 
the united states seized puerto rico in 1898 during the 
spanishamerican war puerto ricans are us citizens 
in 1952 puerto rican voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum 
favoring commonwealth status and the following year the general 
assembly removed puerto rico from its list of colonies 
since 1973 the un decolonization committee has adopted 
numerous resolutions calling puerto rico an illegal colony and 
demanding selfdetermination for its people 
the united states rejected those resolutions as interference in 
us internal affairs and in 1971 walked off the committee saying 
it had an antiamerican bias 
prostatehood speakers told the committee monday that 95 percent 
of the islands voters rejected independence in a 1984 election and 
that the solution to poverty is to make puerto rico the 51st us 
state 
jan susler of the national lawyers guild described the us 
attitude toward the commonwealth as colonial saying 
proindependence advocates are added to blacklists compiled by the 
fbi and shared with the puerto rican police 
she said washington used the grand jury system to compel friends 
and family members of proindependence advocates to testify about 
their activities or face jail a method to politically intern 
puerto rican independence activists 
a prostatehood advocate elsie valdes ramos of the movimiento 
unidos ante la incertidumbre the united movement against 
uncertainty said spanish would not atrophy in puerto rico 
rather she said mainland america will become bilingual in english 
and spanish with puerto rico leading the way 
carlos vizcarrondo irizarry spoke for keeping the commonwealth 
he said the present uspuerto rico relationship should be 
maintained and developed but he questioned whether the united 
states desired to really improve the economy of the island

an accountant testified monday that the 
sister of the late liberace has been paid nearly 132000 since his 
death 18 months ago and has 511000 remaining in her trust account 
the testimony conflicted with that given last week by angie 
liberace 74 who described herself as penniless 
certified public accountant gary mohler revealed the figures in 
state district court in the ongoing legal battle involving efforts 
to remove the executor of liberaces estate 
both sides rested monday after weeks of testimony and closing 
arguments were scheduled for tuesday afternoon then it will be up 
to judge michael wendell to decide whether to remove beverly hills 
attorney joel strote as executor of the liberace estate and head of 
the liberace foundation 
a sister and four former associates have filed suit seeking to 
have strote removed saying he drew up the will and had liberace 
sign it when the famed pianist was too ill to comprehend what he 
was doing 
those testifying on the attorneys behalf say liberace was well 
enough to know what he was doing when he signed the will jan 22 
1987 and that strote had done a good job of increasing the value 
of the estate 
strote testified he did not know what was taking the life of his 
famous client until after the will was signed 13 days before 
liberace died feb 4 1987 from aids complications 
angie liberace testified last week she was penniless and had 
to live off charity but mohler testified monday that the sister 
had been paid an average of 7755 a month the first 17 months 
following her brothers death 
mohler discounted the contention that strote had kept money from 
the sister 
mr strote was concerned that angie be able to get the money 
as needed mohler testified up until four or five months ago 
we had been told to give her almost anything she wanted 
mohler who oversees the angie liberace irrevocable trust and 
disburses its funds said in recent months he has been asked to 
obtain authority for any expenditures from the trust which 
liberace set up for his sister 
strote testified earlier that he put restrictions on the account 
because he was concerned over the rate which the money was being 
spent 
mohler said he had been a member of the liberace foundation for 
the performing arts since the entertainer formed the foundation in 
1979 to provide scholarships at 30 colleges and universities 
mohler said strote had conducted foundation meetings since the 
organization was formed

here are excerpts from the prepared text of 
the speech by president reagan to the republican national 
convention on monday night 
nancy and i are so honored to be your guest tonight to share a 
little of your special time and we thank you 
eight years ago we gathered in detroit in a troubled time 
for our beloved country 
that year it was our dream that together we would rescue 
america and make a new beginning to create anew that shining city 
on a hill 
it was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to 
preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national 
destiny 
and on the night of july l7 1980 we left with a mutual pledge 
to conduct a national crusade to make america great again 
and my fellow citizens while our triumph is not yet complete 
the road has been glorious indeed 
before we came to washington americans had just suffered the 
two worst backtoback years of inflation in 60 years those are 
the facts 
and as john adams said facts are stubborn things 
when they sat around the kitchen table it was not to plan 
summer vacations it was to plan economic survival 
when we met in detroit in that summer of 1980 it was a summer 
of discontent for america around the world our national defense 
had been so weakened the soviet union had begun to engage in 
reckless aggression 
our embassy in pakistan was burned to the ground and the 
one in iran was stormed and occupied with all americans taken as 
hostages 
we rolled up our sleeves and went to work in january of 1981 we 
focused on hope not despair 
we said something shocking taxes ought to be reduced not 
raised 
we rebuilt our armed forces we liberated grenada from the 
communists and helped return that island to democracy we struck a 
firm blow against libyan terrorism weve seen the growth of 
democracy in 90 percent of latin america the soviets have begun to 
pull out of afghanistan the bloody iraniraq war is coming to an 
end for the first time in eight years we have the prospects of 
peace in southwest africa and the removal of cuban and other 
foreign forces from the region and in the 2765 days of our 
administration not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists 
today we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an 
entire class of us and soviet nuclear missiles we are working on 
the strategic defense initiative to defend ourselves and our allies 
against nuclear terror and americansoviet relations are the best 
theyve been since world war ii 
and virtually all this change occurred and continues to occur 
in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly 
proclaim that its time for a change

a lightningcaused forest fire in montana was threatening homes 
monday and firefighters at yellowstone national park were forced 
to close an entrance when smoke from an 80squaremile blaze 
hampered visibility 
smaller fires were being fought in idaho oregon and utah and 
officials said hot dry weather played a role in most 
we have engines at every homesite or building that is in 
danger lame deer mont fire information officer jerry chapman 
said of the 6000acre blaze on the northern cheyenne indian 
reservation in the southeastern part of the state 
six to eight structures were in the fires path he said 
bulldozers and road graders were used to clear debris and crews 
burned fire lines around the homes to save them 
with temperatures in the 90s and winds of 10 mph to 20 mph 
flames shot right up to the yards around two homes on the main road 
up the south fork of lame deer creek 
chapman said some residents left their homes temporarily no 
injuries were reported 
at yellowstone spokeswoman amy vanderbilt said a road at the 
parks west entrance was closed monday afternoon although 
officials expected it to reopen later in the day it was the second 
road closed monday 
earlier the road to the old faithful geyser also was closed 
because of low visibility caused by smoke from the 52960acre 
high winds pushed the fire toward the parks main roadway monday 
afternoon vanderbilt said 
the hot dry weather feeding the yellowstone fires also fueled 
a number of new lightning fires in northwestern and southeastern 
wyoming 
and in idaho high winds and no precipitation prompted nez perce 
national forest officials to postpone trying to control the 
2175acre ruby rapids fire on the main salmon river 
both the nez perce and the payette forests in westcentral idaho 
expected another round of dry lightning storms to ignite even more 
blazes 
in the nez perce national forest about 300 firefighters were 
battling nearly 50 blazes most of them 10 acres or less lightning 
in the last three days continued to spark fires as officials 
contended with dwindling manpower and equipment 
oregon fire officials contained a 50acre fire sunday as a wave 
of thunderstorms brought the threat of more fires to parched 
central and eastern oregon 
and in utah crews completed fire lines around a 900acre blaze 
on the ute indian reservation

the supreme court on monday rejected an 
appeal for a retrial by convicted spy arne treholt ending the 
former foreign ministry officials hopes for a reversal of his 
20year prison sentence 
treholt 45 was sentenced by a district court in june 1985 to 
norways maximum prison term prosecutors charged he had been 
handing over norways secrets to soviet and iraqi agents since 1974 
treholt was arrested jan 20 1984 when he was about to leave 
oslos airport with classified documents which the court said were 
intended for his soviet contacts 
police claimed last year they had uncovered a plan by treholt to 
escape to africa with a girlfriend 
treholts appeal was based on arguments that evidence was 
misinterpreted a police witness withheld important information and 
there were technical mistakes during his trial 
an appeal last year to the district court that sentenced him was 
turned down and the one to the supreme court was his last legal 
option

arizona sen john mccain recalling his 
captivity in north vietnam depicted michael dukakis as weak on 
defense issues monday and compared the democratic nominee to former 
president jimmy carter 
in this presidential race george bush alone has the 
experience and knowledge to continue the policy of a strong 
defense coupled with a willingness to negotiate mccain told the 
republican national convention 
michael dukakis like jimmy carter before him clearly doesnt 
understand that mccain said 
michael dukakis seems to believe that the trident 
submarinebased nuclear missile is a chewing gum that the b1 
bomber is a vitamin pill and that the midgetman landbased 
nuclear missile is anyone shorter than he is mccain said 
mccain spoke to the convention on its opening night as delegates 
eagerly awaited the address of president reagan who was delivering 
something of a farewell to his party as well as a strong 
endorsement of bushs candidacy 
reagan watched mccains speech from his seat in the superdome 
convention hall and with the delegates watched a brief film about 
mccains ordeal during the vietnam war 
the delegates gave mccain a standing ovation the first of the 
convention after his account of five and a half years as prisoner 
of war in north vietnam 
mccain recalled those days of captivity as he denounced dukakis 
for his veto as governor of massachusetts of legislation requiring 
the pledge of allegiance to be spoken in the states public 
schools dukakis contended the legislation was unconstitutional 
it is outrageous mccain said of that action 
mccain described the beating administered to a fellow prisoner 
at the hands of north vietnamese captors after they discovered a 
handsewn american flag they had used to secretly pledge their 
allegiance to 
we must never forget those thousands of americans who with 
their courage with their sacrifice and with their lives made 
those words live for all of us mccain said ronald reagan and 
george bush remember they have made america strong free 
prosperous and have brought peace to our time 
mccain also blasted dukakis for opposing the bombing strike on 
libya for his reluctance to support the rescue invasion of 
grenada and for opposing us military action in the persian gulf

leading advocate of the income tax cut reagan pushed through 
congress in his first term

the threshold of a new era in fact youve brought us over the 
threshold 
youve shown us that we can do more than contain our 
adversaries we can transcend them kemp said

the star wars nuclear defense system has shown us how we can 
make even the threat of nuclear war obsolete and he credited 
reagan with leading an entrepreneurial renaissance that has 
electrified the world and raised our standard of living while 
creating 17 million jobs in five years

state house and senate negotiators 
reported reaching a compromise monday on a county government 
reorganization bill inspired in part by an fbi corruption 
investigation in which 56 county supervisors were charged 
after doubts earlier in the day on whether differences could be 
settled between versions the two chambers approved in a special 
legislative session chief senate negotiator ollie mohamed said an 
agreement was reached he said it would be brought before the full 
house and senate for approval tuesday 
i did not want to be held responsible as i was held 
responsible last may that the senate killed the bill he said 
the plan to restructure county government stemmed from an fbi 
investigation of corrupt county purchasing practices that led to 
federal charges ranging from mail fraud to extortion against 56 
supervisors in 25 counties 
gov ray mabus called the special session to consider 
instituting countywide administration in place of mississippis 
unique system in which most counties are split into districts in 
which locally elected supervisors govern decisions such as 
purchasing and road maintenance 
mohamed said his conferees had backed off a senate provision 
that would have required counties to purchase at least 10 percent 
of equipment supplies and services from businesses owned by 
minorities and women 
he said house conferees had accepted a provision granting home 
rule to counties but senators had allowed to be stricken 
language prohibiting them from entering collective bargaining 
agreements 
under home rule counties would be allowed to take actions not 
specifically prohibited by law under current statutes they may 
take only those actions expressly permitted cities were granted 
home rule in 1985 
mohamed said negotiators had accepted the house language on the 
wording of a referendum for voters to decide if their counties 
would maintain roads on a countywide or district basis he said 
they had split on senate language that would have exempted from 
the referendum requirement those counties that were in 
substantial compliance with provisions of the bill on oct 1 
the house and senate agreed that a county supervisor could not 
serve as county administrator road manager purchasing clerk 
receiving clerk or inventory clerk 
of the 56 supervisors charged 42 have pleaded guilty six have 
been convicted one has been acquitted one died before going to 
trial one died after sentencing and another was declared mentally 
incompetent to stand trial the remaining ones still have charges 
pending

republican presidential nomineetobe george 
bush will have made his decision on a running mate by the time he 
arrives in the republican convention city tuesday a top campaign 
aide hinted monday night 
rich bond bush deputy campaign manager told a reporter on the 
convention floor that he expected bush would acknowledge he had 
made his choice but would not disclose the identity 
if you asked the question i think thats not an unlikely 
thing for him to say said bond 
campaign manager lee atwater talked with bush from a telephone 
in the texas delegation and said he was told the announcement of 
the running mate was set for thursday but its flexible 
while the bush campaign has scheduled a news conference for 
thursday morning there have been persistent rumors that making the 
announcement on wednesday perhaps through a joint appearance at 
the convention hall was under discussion 
the last word directly from bush came on monday morning and he 
said that he had not made up his mind 
meanwhile potential republican vice presidents made a whirlwind 
round of appearances in this convention city some openly touting 
their qualifications others playing coy 
one prospect senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
complained that the selection process was dragging on too long i 
dont care for it frankly said dole when asked if felt the 
process was demeaning 
dole who had urged bush to make his selection right after the 
democratic convention in july said he felt the republicans were 
giving the democratic ticket a fiveweek head start 
not far from the superdome where the convention opened with a 
prenoon session rep jack kemp told a news conference i would 
be a terrific campaigner and a terrific candidate and a terrific 
vice president 
the rumor mill worked nonstop trickling out new names the 
latest to surface were two missouri senators john danforth and 
christopher bond 
convention manager fred malek told a news conference that speech 
writers would soon begin work on a generic kind of acceptance 
speech to serve as a base for whomever is chosen for the vice 
presidential nomination 
in addition malek said the writers also would draft nominating 
speeches that would require filling in the blanks with the right 
name and background 
roger ailes bushs media adviser was taping oneonone 
interviews with prospective choices in the interviews potential 
choices were asked such questions as why they thought bush would 
make a good president 
it was believed that the interviews would be used for television 
commercials 
while most prospects were less bullish than kemp on their 
qualifications they made it clear they would love to be tapped for 
the no 2 spot on the ticket 
sen pete domenici of new mexico described himself as an 
extreme longshot in the veep sweepstakes but he also suggested 
that as bushs running mate i could help on the economy i could 
help on the immigrant vote the senators parents were italian 
immigrants 
the dole family the kansas senator and his wife former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole appeared at a series of 
receptions 
we finally had to leave washington to come down here 
quipped the senator so we got a recording on the machine at home 
just in case they got the wrong number it just says i accept 
if george bush thinks i can offer the most to the ticket 
dan quayle will sign up immediately said the indiana senator 
you really cant campaign for the office of vice president 
said quayle as he arrived for an appearance before the ohio 
delegation im here because george bush knows who i am he 
decided to put me on a list 
former white house staff chief howard baker of tennessee 
professed to be mystified by the mention of his name 
my names not on that list he said ive made it 
perfectly clear ive no desire to be vice president 
in washington the man with the list and the power of decision 
said i have not decided 
i probably will say when i have decided bush said on the 
abc program good morning america 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate said hes going to call the 
schedule the way he sees fit he knows that pretty well building a 
lot of suspense he knows when hes going to make up his mind hes 
just not telling us 
the vice president was flying to the convention city tuesday 
and most speculation was that he would make his decision before 
arriving in new orleans 
campaign manager lee atwater said he thought that going into the 
weekend bush had received the input he wanted on the field of 
potential running mates 
the list of prospects appeared to include the doles kemp 
quayle domenici baker sen alan simpson of wyoming and attorney 
general richard thornburgh a former governor of pennsylvania 
thornburgh said he was at the convention only to hear president 
reagans monday night speech and would return to the justice 
department on tuesday 
thornburgh ducked a question about how he would respond to an 
offer of the vice presidential nomination 
i have no reason to think thats going to happen he said 
but there also were hints that the list could be larger 
when bush was asked on the nbc show today whether he had 
dropped from his list those prospects including simpson who said 
they werent interested the vice president replied i wouldnt 
say that at all 
that statement could reopen speculation about govs george 
deukmejian of california and jim thompson of illinois both of whom 
have said they dont want to be considered 
gov thomas kean of new jersey a close friend of bush said he 
had talked to the vice president on saturday and i know there are 
some people who have not been on those lists who are still in his 
mind so it could be a surprise 
vice presidential activity wasnt limited to the appearances of 
potential running mates 
sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire was leading a conservative 
effort to persuade bush to choose someone acceptable to the partys 
right wing 
i think my choice will be widely accepted when i decide on 
who that choice is bush said on the today show 
kemp said my conservative friends are going to be happy with 
the ticket and the platform 
but the opposite end of the gop spectrum also was finding hope 
in the prospects 
its going to be a tall ticket predicted rep jim leach of 
iowa a reference to the 6foot7 simpson the wyoming senator 
while generally regarded as a conservative supports a womans 
right to abortion and is open to a tax increase to deal with the 
federal budget deficit positions that put him more in tune with 
moderates such as leach

a woman who allegedly bought a car jewelry and 
clothes with nearly 500000 donated for her late sons three liver 
transplants failed to turn the items over monday and faces contempt 
charges 
maria desillers also failed to post a 100000 bond as an 
alternative said karen gievers the courtappointed curator of 
ronnie desillers estate who was supposed to receive the property 
the order clearly has been violated ms gievers said ms 
disillers attorney has indicated no bond has been posted and i 
have personal knowledge that the property has not been turned over 
to me 
ms gievers said she would file a contempt order tuesday with 
dade circuit judge francis christie who will then schedule a 
hearing 
ronnie 7 died at pittsburgh childrens hospital in april 1987 
while awaiting his fourth transplant contributions including 
1000 from president reagan had poured in after a small fund 
collected by ronnies school was reported stolen 
ms desillers refuses to pay the hospital about 262000 in 
medical bills because she says her son received improper care a 
charge hospital administrators deny 
she also has refused to cooperate with authorities and account 
for the rest of the money 
ms gievers believes about 242000 remains of the nearly 
690000 donated for the boys liver transplants 
at a lastminute hearing before christie earlier monday ms 
desillers sought to put off complying with an order issued last 
week that she turn the disputed items over to the court 
her attorney told the judge that items in ms desillers home 
were valued at 4500 and that bonding companies refused to issue 
a 100000 bond for them 
but christie brushed aside the objection and ordered ms 
desillers to turn the items including a bmw luxury car over to 
ms gievers by 4 pm or post the bond 
ms gievers said ms desillers never showed up

oman were headed home monday after hopscotch visits to four 
american warships

omani authorities at goat island in the strait of hormuz and then 
delivered to iranian diplomatic officials the sources spoke on

of cigarette lighters and heard voices shouting in the predawn 
darkness

doctors said monday farm labor leader 
cesar chavez was weak and dizzy and should consider ending his 
monthlong fast in protest of pesticide use on california table 
grapes 
we are extremely concerned about the possibility of 
irreversible damage to his health the physicians said in a 
prepared statement the longer he continues his wateronly fast 
the closer he comes to reaching the point where his life will be in 
danger 
chavez said he would consider it said dr marion moses 
chavez whose fast was in its 30th day monday had not suffered 
irreversible damage even though he had lost 30 pounds 17 percent 
of his original 174pound weight moses said 
but the joint statement signed by moses dr fidel huerta and 
dr augusto ortiz said chavez was weak and dizzy has a high uric 
acid level which is dangerous to his internal organs and is 
having increased difficulty maintaining proper fluids 
chavez began a wateronly fast on july 17 to call attention to 
the united farm workers boycott of california table grapes and 
claims that workers and consumers are endangered by five pesticides 
chavez raised the pesticide issue in 1986 and demanded that 
california growers stop using captan dinoseb methyl bromide 
parathion and phosdrin the union contends tolerance levels of 
those chemicals were set without toxicity data or any information 
concerning their longterm effects on peoples health and the 
environment 
jim wells a pesticide expert with the state department of food 
and agriculture countered that all five chemicals are tightly 
controlled 
chavez conducted a 25day fast during the 1968 grape boycott he 
conducted a 24day fast in 1972 to protest adoption of a 
righttowork law in arizona

the toronto humane society claims the famed 
moscow circus is mistreating its performing bears by confining them 
in small cages and on monday it threatened court action 
david bain a humane society investigator said the 12 brown 
bears are being psychologically mistreated by being held in cages 
measuring about 3 feet by 4 feet 
he said the society will file a complaint accusing the circus of 
cruelty to animals if it doesnt provide larger cages or better 
treatment by wednesday 
arthur fogel a promoter of the soviet companys tour that 
includes shows in new york city next month said the bears are 
treated great and the humane society was misleading the public 
fogel of concert productions international said the bears are 
excercised daily and bains contention that they are confined up to 
16 hours a day is totally inaccurate 
he said the bears are raised by their soviet trainers from birth 
and are in excellent health im glad the trainers cant 
understand english he added if they heard what is being said 
about their bears theyd be very upset 
bain said the bears daily training routines in which they walk 
on their front legs and ride bicycles are not adequate exercise 
for the animals which weigh from about 195 to 300 pounds 
he said the bears are suffering from severe behaviorial 
problems because of the psychological strain of confinement 
the circus begins a threeweek run wednesday at the canadian 
national exhibition in toronto with the bears performing once or 
twice a day 
bain also criticized the circus for its treatment of a pregnant 
siberian tiger shipped to canada he said the animal gave birth 
during a 15day sea voyage from the soviet union to montreal 
circus manager ted thrasher said the tiger was transported by 
sea because it would have been traumatized had it been moved by 
airplane 
bain insisted the tiger should not have been moved at all 
he said the other animals in the circus appeared to be healthy

there was the good news and bad news from 
atlanta the good news was that dukakis laid all those cards on the 
table the bad news is they were all face down 
laughter applause 
the democrats asked the wrong question the question was not 
wheres george the question is whos mike 
laughter applause 
this was the introduction to the introduction or to be more 
exact sen alan simpson of wyoming introducing former sen paul 
laxalt of nevada whose job it was to introduce ronald reagan 
and reagan of course was the only person at the republican 
national convention who needed introduction to no one 
but political conventions being what they are laxalt spent five 
minutes welcoming reagan who was about to enter the hall 
i dont have to give a ringing political speech said 
laxalt who was described by simpson as the presidents first 
friend 
nor do i have to speak of his many political accomplishments 
and the legacy he leaves said laxalt instead he spoke of 
reagan the person 
to ronald reagan the golden rule is very much alive he 
has faithfully stuck to his conservative guns his eternal 
optimism is infectious if theres a pony in the pile give him 
time and hell find it every time 
then reagan entered with his wife and the applause and cheering 
from the delegates and visitors lasted exactly the five minutes it 
had been scheduled 
 
many in the huge superdome couldnt see the first couple in 
person so they watched the entrance via huge screens on three sides 
of the hall it presented a peculiar picture of heads turned in all 
directions 
this was the night for lauding the president whos about to 
leave the praise for the man republicans hope will be the 
presidenttobe comes later 
jack kemp the congressman from new york and former football 
star likened reagan to the gipper a character that actor reagan 
played in the movie knute rockne 
we all remember the famous line about winning one for the 
gipper kemp said but he said he preferred another scene the 
one in which rockne tells the gipper he would be given the ball and 
he should just run with it 
ronald reagan the gipper just looks at him with that smile 
of his kemp recalled and says how far coach 
kemp turned toward reagan sitting across the hall in a box 
decorated with the presidential scene 
well mr president kemp said when america gave you the 
ball eight years ago no one could have imagined how far you would 
carry it 
later reagan also evoked the old movie with a request for 
george bush 
george said the president go out there and make it one 
more for the gipper

a calculating error by reagan administration 
budget experts cannot be rectified by law and is preventing 
congress from enacting 12 billion in additional spending programs 
for 1989 
the overcalculation of the size of next years deficit was 
pointed out to congressional aides in the last few days by the 
agency that committed it the white houses office of management 
and budget 
omb officials confirmed this past week that the mistake had been 
made and said they had told congressional staff members about it 
as the 11 trillion federal budget goes 12 billion normally 
would barely register a tick 
but the amount is significant because it means that congress 
will have to squeeze spending for antidrug programs the homeless 
the hungry and other popular causes under a 18 billion ceiling 
rather than what should be a 3 billion limit

size of nuclear tests which were signed in the 1974 and 1976 but 
never ratified

citing the potential of terrorist attack 
members of congress are putting the reagan administration on notice 
that they will strongly oppose any move to permit sea shipment of 
plutonium from europe to japan 
here you have an administration that is supposedly waging a 
war on terrorism but promoting a policy that could make terrorism 
easy said rep howard wolpe dmich a member of the house 
foreign affairs committee 
the issue stems from a recently signed usjapan nuclear 
cooperation treaty that authorizes shipments by air of plutonium 
from reprocessing plants in europe back to japan where it will be 
used to fuel nuclear power plants 
the plutonium which also could be utilized for nuclear weapons 
is controlled by the us government because the nuclear fuel 
originated in the united states 
proceeding with the air shipments was made contingent upon 
development of crashproof shipping casks which so far has proven 
unachievable

their assumptions about alcohols benefits were challenged than if 
they were warned about its dangers psychologists say 
were looking at this as an approach to prevention of 
problem drinking said researcher renelle massey of the university 
of south florida at tampa 
study results support a theory that one reason people drink is 
because they think it will make them funny brave more sociable 
sexier more assertive or better in some other way she said 
levels of such expectancies have been linked to alcohol

president to follow 
the man actually enjoys the job 
everything about reagan shows his pleasure with the best role of

speeches he looks interested in the other guys speech he laughs 
at every punch line his wave to crowds is never forced amiability 
is his strong suit 
used to taking orders from directors in his earlier career

national convention are content to leave the choice to george bush 
be it man woman or 800pound gorilla 
do you think george bush is out there looking for an 
abortionist liberal who wants to raise taxes asked former 
nebraska state sen john decamp he called the thought of limiting 
bushs choices the profoundly dumbest hed heard 
it was sen gordon humphrey rnh who ignited the issue by 
suggesting an ideological test for the vice presidential nominee 
without it he warned political conservatives could withhold their 
support from the gop ticket 
but dozens of delegates interviewed by the associated press on 
sunday and monday broadly rejected that suggestion while many 
expressed their personal favorites nearly all said they would 
support bushs choice regardless

americans had more babies in 1987 than in any 
year in nearly a quartercentury but at the same time the nation 
recorded more deaths than any year in history 
last year also saw the lowest marriage and divorce rates in over 
a decade according to figures compiled by the governments 
national center for health statistics 
a slight increase in fertility coupled with the huge number of 
women in their prime childbearing years resulted in an estimated 
3829000 new arrivals last year the most since 1964 the center 
reported monday in its preliminary statistical summery for 1987 
millions of people born in the postworld war ii baby boom are 
now in their 20s and 30s and after completing school and launching 
careers have begun families 
that has led to a sharp increase in the total number of births 
in recent years although the nations rate of 661 births per

us industrial production shot up 08 percent 
in july the biggest increase in nine months the government said 
monday in a report which intensified economists worries about 
rising inflationary pressures 
the federal reserve said the large july advance was widespread 
throughout us manufacturing industries and also reflected heavy 
demand for electricity during the summer heat wave 
the 08 percent july advance was double the 04 percent june 
increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial 
production has risen it was the largest increase since a 11 
percent rise last october 
many economists had been expecting a strong july increase given 
the fact the labor department already had reported that 
manufacturing employment rose by 68000 jobs in july the largest 
increase this year

the federal reserve one week after its

bumping up against tight labor markets and capacity restraints in 
the manufacturing sector 
we are facing the danger of a new wageprice inflationary 
spiral and i am looking for further tightening steps based on a

the soviet red army is beating an orderly 
retreat from afghanistan but has left millions of deployed and 
dangerous mines behind the state department said monday 
many of the devices are disguised as toys others are socalled 
butterfly explosives that cause limited damage but the overall 
total which spokesman charles e redman placed at 10 million to 30 
million amounts to one to three for every afghan 
these mines are strewn throughout the countryside and so its 
difficult to come up with a precise figure redman said at the 
departments daily news briefing 
he said they were placed there by the soviet army and by the 
afghan forces engaged in an 8year war with usbacked guerrillas

with each start of a car hum of a computer or clatter of an

garbage polluting the airways and obscuring the heavens from radio 
telescopes noted marcus price of the university of new mexico 
the radio spectrum is a natural resource and as with any 
natural resource it can get polluted price said in an

see it but its there 
for that reason he said astronomers are anxious that 
unneccessary uses of radio signals be eliminated in many cases 
gross radio interference sources could be controlled with the use

the heir to jordans throne is a prince who 
fosters economic reform and political openness for his nation in 
the midst of middle east turmoil 
there has been a continous cry on my part for a need to 
think seriously of jordanian perestroika said prince hassan 
referring to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs plans to 
revitalize soviet society 
the 41yearold younger brother of king hussein is regarded as 
one of the arab worlds most visible intellectuals 
for two decades the oxfordeducated prince has guided 
development planning in this country of 28 million people he has 
overseen remarkable economic growth in a land blessed by education 
but nearly barren of natural resources 
with an economic slump squeezing the region hassan has urged 
bureaucratic reforms and calls for economic policies aimed at 
making the hashemite desert kingdom a center for services and 
technology 
hassan sees economic success as a major element of identity for 
his 40yearold country along with his familys 1000year history 
as rulers of mecca 
he said in an interview with the associated press the task of 
rebuilding jordan following the disastrous 1967 war with israel 
which flooded the country with refugees was one of restating 
jordans credibility on the basis of merit that jordan is a 
country that works 
he also describes the war as his greatest trauma most of his 
published works have been devoted to the palestine problem urging 
a moderate road to arabisraeli peace about half or more of 
jordans population are palestinians most of the remainder are 
bedouin arabs like king hussein and prince hassan 
jordans failure in its efforts for arabisraeli peace led king 
hussein in early august to renounce responsibility for the 
palestinians on the israelioccupied west bank 
husseins decision is expected to force jordan to forge a new 
identity for itself one in which hassan likely would play a role 
because of his leadership of the kingdoms economic and research 
institutions 
the prince himself is key to the survival of the last hashemite 
monarchy his family descended from islams prophet mohammed once 
ruled arabia syria and iraq as well as jordan it led the arabs to 
independence from ottoman turkey in a world war i alliance with 
britain 
his patronage of jordans intellectual and business communities 
as well as his periodic tours of army installations are partly 
designed to help broaden his base in a country so closely 
identified with its ruler that a common cliche says king hussein 
is jordan and jordan is king hussein 
hassan was an oxford undergraduate in oriental studies when 
hussein named him crown prince in 1965 he said his oxford years 
were definitely the happiest years of my life and an academic 
aura still clings to him 
he described himself as a magpie reader sampling a wide 
range of subjects 
but he said gorbachevs book perestroika was the most 
fascinating thing he had read lately along with british 
philosopher bertrand russells in praise of idleness 
short stocky and athletic the prince seldom seems idle 
he spends his spare time practicing chinese martial arts 
playing squash or polo and with his family 
the prince has four children by his pakistaniborn wife 
princess tharwat but none have a direct line to the throne king 
hussein has decreed that his own third son prince aly is in line 
after hassan 
jordanian television often shows hassan addressing two or three 
seminars or conferences a day in jordan or attending international 
conferences on development or humanitarian affairs 
he helped found most of the countrys chief think tanks and 
said he enjoys seminars where he can step out of his palace role 
nobodys going to stand up to a person of authority and 
express their views as clearly as they should he said 
hassan has repeatedly urged freer debate on domestic policy 
issues occasionally bumping heads with government officials 
concerned about criticism 
the prince said jordan should emphasize our basic renewable 
resource which is creative thought and political will based on an 
openness which i think has characterized king husseins style 
he has also prodded arabs to develop their own centers of 
excellence and said he was somewhat resentful of the western 
dominance of middle eastern studies 
i think that regional selfreliance in the intellectual field 
is the only way of tempering that western naivite which is 
welcome in terms of its innocence but tiresome in terms of its 
clumsiness he said

the sandinista government is 
attempting to push ahead with ambitious health care programs that 
suffered severe setbacks because of seven years of civil war 
we are just beginning to move ahead a bit but we have a long 
way to go dr milton valdez deputy health minister said in an 
interview 
the sandinistas promised improved health care as part of a 
package of social pledges made after they ousted the rightist 
somoza dynasty in july 1979 
shortly after coming to power the sandinistas set out to build 
clinics and install a socialistic medical system 
our policies were based on health being a right for the people 
and an obligation of the state valdez said 
but the promises of the leftist government gave way to the 
realities of the war started by contra rebels 1 years after the 
sandinistas took control the battles destroyed more than 100 rural 
clinics by the end of last year helped bring back such diseases as 
malaria and created combatrelated mental problems 
the situation was further complicated in 1985 when a us trade 
embargo cut off many supplies and spare parts for medical equipment 
health officials acknowlege that not all of the problems can be 
blamed on the war a lack of hygiene education and basic unsanitary 
conditions in the capital as well as the isolated rural farmlands 
are blamed for a current epidemic of dengue an infectious disease 
carried by mosquitos 
during six days in july the health ministry reported almost 
3000 children were treated for diarrhea the no 1 killer of 
children in nicaragua 
the government recently called on residents in managua to 
cleanup the trash and cut the grass in their neighborhoods 
valdez said health programs suffered serious deterioration by 
1983 with the loss of clinics and personnel and doctors who fled 
the country 
we had constructed a health system for peace it clashed with 
the war valdez added 
we had malaria under control along the pacific coast but then 
we began large troop mobilizations to the mountains where malaria 
still existed and they brought it back to the cities 
doctors and medical volunteers couldnt get into remote combat 
regions or those controlled by the contras barricada 
international a sandinista publication said in a recent edition 
that 600 students health workers and teachers had been killed 
wounded or kidnapped while working in war zones 
mental problems stemming from combat surfaced 
its difficult to confront the ones who spend two years 
fighting have the most problems valdez said 
we have seen an increase in violent deaths homicides and 
suicides and more aggressiveness in general 
one woman told a reporter her son returned from almost two years 
in combat with serious emotional problems 
he would scream in his sleep that the contras were coming 
she said he would become nervous when he was awake 
valdez said mental problems also are found among the numerous 
exsoldiers who suffered losses of limbs in the war 
its not the actual loss of limb that causes the problems but 
the psychological part he said 
the combatants are no 2 on our priority list no 1 are the 
children 
the health ministry this year outlined a threeyear plan and 
designated 1988 the year for defense and protection of childrens 
lives 
infant mortality halved since july 1979 stands at 645 per 
1000 births it is the highest in central america 
health workers have been taking advantage of a fragile truce 
since march to vaccinate rural children against polio measles 
diptheria and tuberculosis 
valdez said it was too soon to rebuild the lost clinics because 
fighting continues and the economy still is suffering 
medical care is free but medicine is not valdez said only 
about 10 percent of nicaraguas doctors work with the state system 
the others are private practitioners 
medicines are among a long list of basics that are in need 
black marketeers make large profits selling medications at outdoor 
markets 
the largest single cause of death to adults up to age 49 last 
year was related to the war health ministry statistics indicated 
the ministry said it has detected only 26 cases of aids in 
nicaragua and that only five of those were nicaraguans

after years of exile and scorn 
for the ballot box el salvadors leftist political parties allied 
with marxistled guerrillas are preparing to compete in next years 
presidential election 
elections here between 1982 and now have been part of a plan 
designed principally to counter action of the guerrilla army part 
of a counterinsurgency project said hector oqueli organization 
secretary of the national revolutionary movement 
it could therefore be argued that we are now lending our 
support for that same project and that were contradicting 
ourselves he said 
however oqueli added more political space has opened up 
since the presidents of el salvador and four other central american 
countries signed a peace plan aug 7 1987 
we want to take maximum advantage of that political opening 
even though we are certain that doing political work in those 
spaces is like swimming in a river full of crocodiles he said in 
an interview in his partys san salvador headquarters 
the regional plan has not ended guerrilla conflicts in el 
salvador nicaragua and guatemala but it has contributed to 
broadening the range of political expression in el salvador and 
nicaragua 
the national revolutionary movement as part of the democratic 
revolutionary front has been allied since 1981 with the farabundo 
marti national liberation front the guerrilla organization known 
as the fmln that has been fighting the usbacked salvadoran 
government for eight years 
leaders of the political front who had left in the early 1980s 
because of rampant rightist death squads began returning to el 
salvador in november and are still coming 
among them are guillermo ungo oqueli and ruben zamora general 
secretary of the popular social christian movement 
zamoras party is a leftleaning offshoot of the centrist 
christian democratic party of president jose napoleon duarte who 
sat on militarycivilian juntas in 198082 and has governed since 
1984 duarte has cancer and his doctors say it is terminal 
the oquelis revolutionay movement the social christians and 
the social democratic party have formed the democratic convergence 
oquelis group announced in july its participation via the 
convergence in the presidential election set for march although 
the electoral front has yet to announce its participation 
officially it is already hard at work launching a campaign 
zamora in an interview with the associated press said the 
convergences activity is generating a political alternative 
capable of attracting ample sectors of the population that have 
been left without alternative 
were also contributing little by little to overcoming 
peoples fear because of past repression of participating in 
politics he said 
the leftists do not harbor illusions of an electoral victory 
we are not taking part strictly for the votes rather were 
mounting a historical project that transcends election day said 
oqueli 
the main plank in the leftist platform is a negotiated end to 
the war the government has rejected two such proposals by the 
insurgents so far this year 
the countrys principal problem is the war oqueli said 
if the armed conflict is not resolved we will not be able to 
resolve the economic social and political problems health 
housing nutrition employment so were telling the salvadoran 
people that a solution to the war is necessary and for us that 
solution is a negotiated political one 
duartes position is that the guerrillas lay down their arms 
before talks can begin but the rebels say that would be tantamount 
to surrender 
the guerrillas imposed a nationwide transport ban during 
legislative and municipal elections in march to underscore their 
characterization of them as a farce the prospect of watching 
their political allies take part in similar elections next year is 
thought to be a difficult pill for them to swallow 
the fmln doesnt have to either approve or disapprove of our 
participation said oqueli they simply must respect it as we 
respect their principal means of struggle 
he said political and military revolutionary leaders met in 
managua nicaragua in midjuly to discuss electoral participation 
our position and our objectives were fully understood by the 
guerrillas he said 
the convergence will go up against an incumbent party shattered 
by infighting and deteriorated by the exercise of power during 
years of crisis duartes promises of peace and increased 
wellbeing have gone unfulfilled 
the republican nationalist alliance the main rightist 
opposition is running on the full head of steam produced by its 
victories in march the party known as arena gained control of 
the legislature and two thirds of municipalities nationwide 
the leftist political front could face its most difficult 
dilemma if no candidate in march receives more than 50 percent of 
the vote that would require a second round with the top two 
finishers in the running 
most observers doubt either the christian democrats or arena 
will receive a majority in the first round 
if the convergence obtains around 10 percent of the vote which 
is considered feasible it could decide the outcome by casting its 
lot with one of the two major parties 
oqueli said he believes abstention would be advisable in a 
second round 
if we tie ourselves to the christian democrats and they 
continue as they have been we dirty our future he said and 
arena represents the oligarchic past that brought the country to 
where it is now

the charred skeletons of a once 
magnificent city center still dominate dresdens patchwork skyline 
of hasty postwar renewal and piecemeal restoration 
city planners acknowledge and many dresden residents complain 
that the pace of restoration has been slowed because east germanys 
capital east berlin has been given priority in rebuilding efforts 
dresden known as the german florence before its almost 
total destruction in two days of allied firebombing raids in 1945 
is today a city of stark often brutal contrasts 
viewed from the far end of the old augustus bridge over the elbe 
river the meticulously rebuilt semper opera house roman catholic 
cathedral and zwinger gallery stand next to the bombedout and 
scorched ruins of the once majestic royal palace 
despite initial restoration efforts the palaces crumbling and 
roofless facades remain in large part home for birds and overgrown 
vegetation 
featureless sovietstyle housing and commercial blocks erected 
after world war ii now dominate the citys main thoroughfares and 
plazas interspersed with vast and idle spaces long since cleared 
of rubble 
most of the citys once fabled baroque turrets and spires are 
gone 
nevertheless city officials are fiercely proud of the 
restoration projects undertaken in recent years 
but they say much work has been slowed because of lack of 
resources 
many grumbling dresdeners blame the restoration delays and the 
widespread deterioration of many buildings that survived on poor 
planning and breakneck efforts to spruce up east berlin 
more than 20000 construction workers were ordered to east 
berlin last year to work on massive building projects as communist 
party officials strove to compete with west berlins glitter during 
the citys 750th anniversary celebrations 
east german officials in an effort to make east berlin a 
showcase have diverted building materials and workers to the 
capital for years leaving many provincial cities to struggle to 
find the means to restore thousands of crumbling buildings 
karlheinz seltmann an official in dresdens city 
administration responsible for culture defended the allocation of 
resources 
the capital city is the capital city he said 
others say the city and the nation faced an awesome 
reconstruction task after world war ii 
you have to remember that this city was raised from 15 million 
cubic meters of total ruin said manfred bachmann director 
general of dresdens 11 state musuems referring to the firestorm 
that devastated the city feb 1314 1945 
the destruction of dresden in the final days of the war has 
prompted debate among military historians about the necessity of 
the raids at a time when the soviet army was already rapidly 
advancing into nazi germany 
the city a communications and rail link was swollen with 
refugees and estimates of the death toll have ranged from 35000 to 
more than 135000 
the city and its destruction figured prominently in author kurt 
vonnegut jrs internationally acclaimed 1969 novel 
slaughterhouse five 
bachmann said the devastation did not break the citys will to 
survive 
dresden residents turned out to help rebuild the zwinger 
gallery when many of them still had no homes to return to 
he added that the city had accomplished much despite the 
subsequent shortages 
he said city pride and a deeprooted sense of cultural tradition 
has helped dresden recover much of its reputation as a city once 
legendary for its art architecture and music 
most of dresdens art treasures escaped wartime destruction 
bachmann said because they were hidden by the nazis in more than 
50 locations around the state of saxony many were discovered in 
poor condition in a damp mine shaft by soviet troops bachmann said 
the russians preserved them and returned them to us 
he said more than 1240 paintings were returned but about 500 
works are still missing including two rembrandts 
the treasures of the saxon royalty known as the gruene 
gewoelbe also survived the the war intact and are on display at 
the state art gallery 
the collection contains more than 3000 stunningly crafted works 
in gold silver ivory ebony amber brass and bronze many are 
lavishly decorated with precious stones 
bachmann said he hoped shortages that have slowed restoration of 
the royal palace can be overcome and that work can be completed by 
the turn of the century 
the palace will be the repository of many of the citys art 
treasures now in storage because of a lack of gallery space 
but some of the citys most dramatic restoration achievements 
are already in peril because of air pollution 
heavilyladen diesel trucks and cars using oillaced gasoline 
roar past theater square belching clouds of exhaust fumes around 
the opera and zwinger gallery coating the buildings with a film of 
grimy black soot 
emissions from a coalfired power plant not far away also 
threaten the sandstone and granite facades

with each month evidence grows that mass 
psychology is playing as important a role in the economys 
performance as more traditional factors such as interest rates and 
inventories 
perhaps the clearest manifestation shows up in the widespread 
belief that the expansion cannot be sustained much longer simply 
because it is almost 69 months old and is due to expire 
the factor shows up in the latest quarterly economic survey by 
the national federation of independent business which found that 
smallbusiness optimism lost ground mainly because fewer companies 
expect continued growth 
the longer the recovery goes the larger the proportion of 
economic agents becomes which believes that the expansion cannot be 
sustained said professor william c dunkelberg who regularly 
interprets the findings 
apparently many believe that the law of gravity applies to 
economic statistics as well as apples said dunkelberg dean of 
the graduate business school at temple university 
he noted that companies have become decidedly less optimistic 
about future expansion each july with 60 percent expecting growth 
in 1983 compared to 16 percent in 1988 
nevertheless he declares in a report released today there is 
no sign that the economy is poised to enter a recession 
reviewing detailed responses from 1834 companies dunkelberg 
noted that the decline in the surveys smallbusiness optimism 
index resulted as much from disbelief about the likelihood of 
further growth as from strong negative views 
in some parts of the country he said businesses just figure 
it cant get any better so no improvement is expected 
the surveys smallbusiness optimism index fell to 1005 
seasonally adjusted its lowest reading since the fourth quarter of 
1986 when it registered 995 the base of 100 applies to economic 
conditions in 1978 
over the past 14 years the index compiled from responses in 
10 business categories including expected business conditions 
changes in earnings and plans to hire has anticipated conditions 
six months away 
reviewing these categories dunkelberg said imbalances that 
precede recession such as rapid inflation unusually strong 
inventory buildup overly rapid capacity expansion labor shortages 
and rising wages werent present 
some of the wage stability he attributed to an 
internationalization of labor markets explaining that rising 
costs and wages in the united states simply provide windows of 
opportunity for imports 
moreover he continued bottlenecks that historically produced 
rising prices are now alleviated by imports which dramatically 
moderate price pressures worldwide there are few if any 
identifiable capacity problems 
in another reference to expectations affecting the economys 
direction dunkelberg commented on the widespread feeling that a 
recent rise in the federal reserve discount rate will slow the 
economy and prevent inflation 
if this occurs it will be due to the psychological effects of 
the change and not the real impact of rising rates he said 
he explained that higher rates primarily will affect housing 
but wont impact manufacturing only if higher interest rates 
produce a stronger dollar will demand in this sector be dampened 
he said 
thus he said there is more hope than substance to the latest 
fed move but if everyone believes it is the correct policy it is 
more likely that this will turn out to be the case

for millions of youngsters one of lifes great 
experiences and great traumas is about to occur the first day 
of school 
this milestone adventure into foreign territory sets the stage 
for many years of schooling to come and calm preparation by mom 
and dad can help ease the strain federal educators report 
the government has put together a little booklet entitled 
plain talk about when your child starts school which is 
available at no charge write the consumer information center 
pueblo colo 81009 and ask for booklet 505t 
youll also get a catalog including a list of several other 
booklets with information on helping kids cope with school these 
are available free or at low cost 
in the meantime though educators stress the importance of 
preparing a firsttime student for school in advance 
but they add dont make a federal case out of it 
children should be informed ahead of time that they will be 
starting school but dont make it a topic of daily conversation 
during the summer treat starting school as part of the normal 
course of life something everyone does including your youngster 
children will likely have questions about school and educators 
urge answering them honestly 
especially important are letting the child know how many days 
school will last how many hours per day how they will get back 
and forth to school what they will do after school and so forth 
explain patiently 
older children seem to enjoy frightening younger ones so be 
aware that this can happen take the older child aside and explain 
their responsibility to help the younger one attend school without 
fear 
educators stress that it is important not to give the impression 
that there is any choice about going to school 
it is normal for children to say things like im not going 
or they cant make me go 
remain calm and be reassuring but explain that all children 
must go to school dont argue or waiver just be matteroffact 
and calm about school 
it does help to give the child some control about things such 
as asking if they want to wear sneakers or shoes and what fruit or 
other desert they would like packed in their lunch that can help 
communicate to the child that you appreciate the effort they are 
making to do what is being asked say educators 
also the departure of a child to school creates extra free time 
for many parents time they may enjoy having dont tell the child 
how much fun youll be having when they are away 
while the first few days of school are unique try to develop a 
routine at home to make the event seem relatively normal starting 
school may be special but it isnt on a par with lindberghs first 
solo across the atlantic 
all the best planning and preparation notwithstanding when the 
final moment comes the child may balk 
if this happens educators say fight back the annoyance and 
send the child to school 
if tears flow it is usually at the moment of separation after 
that things usually settle down many a parent has spent a 
miserable day worrying about a child who quickly recovered and 
spent a fine first day at school 
fearful behavior will usually disappear within a few days when 
the child begins to feel comfortable away from home has learned to 
trust the teacher and makes some new friends 
and mastery of the new situation can be an important success for 
the child who is helped to feel better about himself or herself 
and more secure in the world

when the new us immigration 
law went into effect last year this town in durango cattle country 
500 miles south of el paso texas feared for its future 
for nearly half a century it had supplied mexicans who worked 
legally or illegally in the united states and sent home the dollars 
that helped keep the town going 
but the catastrophe santa maria del oro braced for 14 months ago 
hasnt happened 
thousands of dollars still pour in every day in money orders 
sent by residents relatives working most of them illegally in 
the united states 
mayor epifanio carreon had feared the flow of dollars would dry 
up and worse hundreds of young men would come home looking for 
jobs that dont exist 
we would have seen at least some economic affects of the law 
by now but everything is totally normal carreon says now 
the dollar continues being the most important source of income 
in this region said roberto acosta assistant manager of banco 
internacional the only bank in the area people that cashes dollar 
checks 
some people returned because of fear before they knew what was 
going to happen with the law but now things are back to normal 
one young man in town said however hes waiting to see what 
happens with the law the us immigration control and reform act 
before he attempts his first crossing 
if it werent for the law id already be in los angeles 
said rocky rocha 18 who just graduated from a technical school 
here 
he said two of his brothers already there had applied for 
amnesty under the us law and fear theyll lose out if they harbor 
him as an illegal alien 
if my brothers will let me ill go in spite of the law 
said rocha here you work so hard and you dont make much 
santa maria del oro has supplied the us labor market with a 
steady stream of workers since world war ii 
many residents went to the united states as farm workers under 
the us bracero program of 1942 said mayor carreon by now some 
have gained us citizenship or legal residency 
by the time the program was dropped in 1964 many local 
residents had grown accustomed to having a steady job and earning 
dollars 
besides said carreon the local gold and mining operations were 
winding down and there wasnt much left to do here but work in the 
fields or raise cattle the only major employer around these days 
is a lumber company which has about 300 workers 
miguel angel salinas the municipal clerk estimates that more 
than 30 percent of the towns 14000 people still go back and forth 
to jobs in the united states 
authorities estimate the percentage of people on surrounding 
farms and ranches with relatives working in the united states is as 
high or even higher 
carreon said the steady flow of dollars as much as 60000 a 
week has helped santa maria del oro weather mexicos 6yearold 
economic crisis 
indeed by mexican standards santa maria del oro is well off 
the main streets are filled with latemodel us and mexican 
pickup trucks many bearing us license plates there are no 
beggars on the streets many of the homes and businesses were 
financed with dollars 
residents and public officials here say the law has helped those 
who hve been in the united states for a long time and wanted to 
stay there 
manuel sanchez returned several years ago and bought a butcher 
shop with the money he earned as an undocumented worker in chicago 
his brother a chicago butcher stayed and has applied for 
amnesty the provision of the law allowing foreigners who meet 
certain requirements to seek legal residency 
he feels a lot safer knowing that when he leaves the house in 
chicago hell return sanchez said 
illegal aliens caught in the united states most often are 
deported immediately 
for others who didnt qualify for amnesty under the law or just 
didnt bother to apply its business as usual a sundown trek 
across the border 
well stay as long as theres work when theres not well 
come back crying said jesus chavez 29 who has worked in the 
united states as an undocumented worker for a decade 
right now the work is there waiting for us said chavez one 
of three brothers working without documents at a california 
construction company 
chavez home on vacation said the 21 an hour he earns makes 
the risk of crossing as an illegal alien worthwhile 
similar work in mexico probably would pay him about 12 a day 
right now it the law hasnt affected us at all said luis 
chavez jesus 18yearold brother who began working illegally in 
the united states when he was 14 
the toughest provision of the us law went into effect this 
past june 1 making it illegal for most employers to knowingly hire 
undocumented workers the law calls for stiff fines and even jail 
sentences for violators 
agricultural workers now in the united states have been given an 
extension to dec 1 to get their papers in order or leave 
although crossing the border without legal documents is the 
risky part those whove worked in the same job in the united 
states since before 1982 dont have to show employers their 
documents

jackie chan the successor to the legendary 
chop and drop king bruce lee as asias top action film star has 
yet to crack the american market but insists he has more to offer 
than sylvester rambo stallone 
i think i am far better than him i dare say it straight to 
his face because i can do things he can but he cant do things i 
can the babyfaced chan boasted in a recent interview 
chan 34 is famous throughout asia for the deathdefying stunts 
liberally sprinkled throughout his movies and he poohpoohs the 
rambo series because stallone doesnt attempt such exploits 
we see the cave explode and then there he is appearing on top 
of another hill really rambo he said 
i only do what i really can something an ordinary man cannot 
do but a trained man can this is me chan said proudly tapping 
his chest 
in the 1987 film project a ii chan jumped from a 50foot 
clock tower to the concrete ground through two flimsy canvases it 
was a typical example of his work 
such stunts however dont come without bruises in july he 
knocked himself out during a scene in which he somersaulted on top 
of a moving bus before smashing through a billboard 
the combination of stunts and humor in chans movies have made 
him a smash boxoffice success in asia with his last 10 movies 
earning more than 150 million in japan hong kong taiwan 
singapore and malaysia 
at the same time jackiemania is ever present when he appeared 
for a promotion in tokyo in march 800 fans turned up and he 
topped a list of idols in a survey of taiwan teenagers released in 
february 
in 1987 a japanese woman moved to hong kong to serve him tea in 
his studio every day chan made her his floor manager a move that 
drove dozens more japanese women to fly to the british colony 
another woman 24yearold reiko mimura moved here from tokyo 
in 1984 to be closer to her idol i just looked at him and felt 
very nervous he was nice and gave me his records with his 
autograph she recalled of a meeting two years ago 
chan a muscular 5foot10 said he does not dare have a lover 
or a wife for fear of driving his fans to despair two girls 
reportedly tried to kill themselves over the actor 
but despite his wild popularity in asia his efforts to impress 
us moviegoers have been disappointing he has appeared in five 
american movies including battle creek brawl and the 
cannonball run 
chan was not happy with the movies and said he would like to do 
a film with steven spielberg free of charge if necessary 
i need an opportunity a great director who wants to make a 
movie about chinese people to hire me chan said the audience 
will want to see any film by that director and when they happen to 
see me in the movie theyll say hey this jackie is cool 
with no offers from spielberg however chan plans to star in a 
selfdirected movie in the united states next year if the 
americans like it ok if not forget it he said 
chan was born in hong kong in 1954 to parents who emigrated to 
australia six years later they enrolled chan in the chinese opera 
research institute to study acting acrobatics and martial arts he 
appeared in a few films before leaving the institute to work as a 
stuntman 
after kung fu star bruce lees death in 1974 director lo wei 
picked chan as a new talent chans career was launched in the 1976 
film new fist of fury in which he imitated lee more than 10 
similar films quickly followed but not until the 1978 drunken 
monkey in a tigers eye did chan find his own style of 
actioncomedy 
in 1985 chan cracked his skull in yugoslavia while shooting a 
scene in which he was to leap from a castle onto a tree instead 
he fell 50 feet to the ground fracturing his skull and driving a 
splinter into his brain chan underwent brain surgery and hearing 
in his right ear remains impaired 
i never thought it would happen to me he said while i 
was lying in the hospital i thought a lot and found there are many 
things i have not done the accident was a turning point in his 
life when he returned to hong kong he set up a charity 
foundation participated in antidrug campaigns and ran marathons 
for charity 
now i think more positively he said if i want to do 
something ill do it quickly its not that im afraid i may not 
live through tomorrow but i dont want to have any regrets

the promise of bright technological frontiers

uneasiness is jeremy rifkin biotechnologys leading gadfly he is

in the industrial age our parents didnt ask questions it 
was the age of progress and efficiency and there were no limits 
rifkin says scientists said trust us industrialists were 
hellbent on change ie profits policy leaders were wildly 
enthused there was a utopian mentality 
a child believes there are no consequences for his acts weve 
had a childlike consciousness now with the new scientific 
technology the changes are so impactful we cant afford that 
childlike mentality its time to raise fundamental questions 
he speaks quickly a rush of words barely audible over the drone 
of a copier the lone concession to electronics in the otherwise 
resolutely lowtech office of the foundation on economic trends

rifkin the foundations president is 43 a small man trim from 
years of swimming a mile every night at the y his brown eyes 
radiate warmth and good humor the vision of a civilization bent on 
engineering its own demise is a burden that rests on him lightly 
at least outwardly 
he has no shortage of critics among scientists who dismiss his 
arguments as unscientific and his writing as antiintellectual 
opponents stress rifkins lack of credentials hes had no formal 
science training and describe him as a nuisance but a few 
concede that along with their blood pressure he also raises some 
important points 
his talent lies in bringing prominent people together in 
alliances such as the national coalition against surrogacy 
composed of feminists lawyers and 17 former surrogates including 
mary beth whiteheadgould to hold news conferences testify before 
congress and generally stir up the public 
other foundation staffers specialize in lawsuits such as the 
1984 action that has delayed construction of a department of 
defense germ warfare laboratory at the dugway proving ground in 
utah the armys considering scaling down the proposed facility or 
putting it elsewhere among other choices 
they also circulate petitions such as the june 13 request to 
postmaster general anthony frank to halt the armys longstanding 
practice of shipping deadly experimental viruses through the mail 
frank concurred 
a 1983 lawsuit by rifkins organization stalled tests of a 
frostinhibiting microbe on the west coast for four years before a 
state court of appeals judge finally gave the goahead 
another suit prompted the federal environmental protection 
agency to deny a permit to monsanto for a test of a genealtered 
microbial corn pesticide monsanto eventually abandoned the project 
last may the defense department agreed to curtail testing at 
electromagnetic pulse simulator facilities in virginia alabama and 
new mexico until environmental health and safety matters can be 
documented emps are electromagnetic pulses that travel at speeds 
of light to simulate those generated by highaltitude nuclear 
explosions the agreement came in response to another rifkin suit 
charging potential environmental and human health risks 
rifkins foundation was also instrumental in exposing two 
biotech cases involving violations one concerned a california 
company that conducted outdoor tests of a genetically engineered 
chemical before receiving a permit the epa accused the company 
advanced genetic sciences of falsifying the data to indicate the 
tests had taken place indoors 
in the other the department of agricultures animal and plant 
health inspection service without first consulting other 
regulatory agencies allowed biologics corp of omaha neb to 
test and market a genetically altered vaccine for pigs the new 
york times in an editorial called the foundation an unrelenting 
watchdog of genetic engineering that deserves credit for 
bringing to light these two cases and what they show about the 
ragged federal system for regulating the new technology 
not all rifkin campaigns succeed two recent suits challenging 
government regulation of genetic engineering were dismissed by a 
us district judge who ruled it had no legal standing to sue 
a genetically engineered mouse can still be patented the same as 
a mousetrap although legislation has been introduced in congress 
calling for moratoriums on animal patenting 
deliberate environmental releases of various genetically 
engineered viruses and bacteria are planned over the next several 
years

the federal food and drug administration rejected a petition 
demanding an environmental impact statement on bovine growth 
hormone charging it will damage the environment cause 
unnecessary suffering to cows and wreak havoc on the dairy 
economy 
and a proposal for the first authorized human gene transplant is 
on the agenda for the fall meeting of the national institutes of 
healths recombinant dna advisory committee 
nonetheless rifkins influence has been felt in the boardroom 
as well as the courtroom 
companies dont want to take jeremy on headtohead its a 
losing proposition companies dont want to get into emotional 
situations they dont want to be perceived as being in the middle 
of a dogfight with jeremy while theyre out there trying to raise 
money says bruce mackler general counsel for the 180member 
association of biotechnology companies 
the financial costs must be measured in terms of eroding of 
investor confidence people dont like to invest in industriesin 
which there are controversies 
mackler an immunologist as well as a lawyer calls rifkin 
very articulate very persuasive and very dangerous he has done 
more to delay science to erode public confidence in science than 
many people 
if he were at the end of the runway at kitty hawk hed be 
yelling dont do it until we develop a parachute dont do it 
until we know it can fly 
among scientists rifkin is regarded as a nuisance says dr 
gerard mcgarrity cell biologist at coriell institute for medical 
research in camden nj and chairman of the recombinant dna 
advisory committee rac it is the racs job to draft safety 
guidelines for conducting genetic engineering research and to 
decide whether potentially hazardous research should be carried 
out racs guidelines are mandatory for governmentsponsored 
research private industry has agreed to follow them voluntarily 
when someone opposes every new development when he takes an 
extreme view on every issue you have to wonder sometimes the 
person standing on the periphery is a pioneer but every issue 
moreover mcgarrity adds he operates on a very limited 
scientific basis 
he recalls that rifkin once opposed a vaccine being developed 
against an organism that causes diarrhea he feared it could be 
used in biological warfare mcgarrity says in fact we wanted 
to use it as a vaccine in developing countries where diarrhea is a 
problem for thousands of children 
susan gottesman a former rac member says that rifkin doesnt 
address science at all gottesman is chief of the biochemical 
genetics section of the national cancer institutes lab of 
molecular biology and a consultant to the federal environmental 
protection agency on biotech matters 
he makes absolute statements which sound scary and he uses 
discussion points which are sure to appeal as you hear them says 
gottesman who has debated rifkin on television its hard for 
the public to understand the science and the real difference 
between something thats scary and something thats not 
those views are echoed by others who invariably single out 
algeny one of the nine books rifkin has written each in 
longhand on yellow legal pads for their harshest criticism 
the author an economics major who has had no formal science 
training describes algeny as a thoughtful and studied 
critique of the philosophy of modern science and technology 
a harvard university biologist stephen jay gould called it a 
cleverly constructed tract of antiintellectual propaganda 
masquerading as scholarship 
among books promoted as intellectual statements by important 
thinkers i dont think i have ever read a shoddier work gould 
wrote in 1985 damn shame too because the deep issue is 
troubling and i do not disagree with rifkins basic plea for 
respecting the integrity of evolutionary lineages 
rifkin does have a measure of support even among scientists 
however 
stuart newman a developmental biologist at new york medical 
college and a member of the bostonbased committee for responsible 
genetics acknowledges inaccuracies in rifkins writings but says 
i see him more as an old testament prophet who raises important 
issues that go beyond expertise 
i believe technology should be developed and fostered but 
there are other important issues society has a stake in making 
sure the technologies are used safely and ethically from that 
perspective i do think jeremy rifkin has performed a service by 
keeping the issues of appropriate use of biotechnology in the 
public eye 
liebe f cavalieri of sloankettering institute in rye ny is 
a molecular biologist whose work with dna dates to the discovery by 
watson and crick of the double helix 35 years ago cavalieri 
acknowledges soft spots in algeny but says scientists who 
dismiss his arguments as strictly emotional are throwing dust 
around 
most scientists are trained not to think in broad global ways 
and cannot see the possible outcome of this or that technology in 
terms of societal impact its very difficult to get out of the 
mold of scientist were trained in reductionist thinking he 
says 
but we have at our disposal methodology which can disrupt 
living systemsand im afraid were not being selective 
were not going to get a plague next week because somebody 
released some nitrogenfixing bacteria cavalieri adds the 
issue is much more subtle and in a way more dangerous the 
effects will take place over time 
those subtle longterm effects are at the heart of rifkins 
crusade hes not worried about killer tomatoes he is worried 
about applying engineering principles to living things at the 
expense of traditional human values 
its called genetic engineering because its about engineering 
genes taking engineering principles and applying them to the 
blueprint of every aspect of life he says

control predictability of outcome reductionism 
utilitarianism and efficiency those are the values we have come to 
covet as important 
the philosophy of using genetic engineering is to improve a 
species so what criteria do we use to determine what are 
functional genes who should have that authority would you trust 
the president the congress the national academy of science would 
you trust ge or the marketplace 
two value systems are in confrontation the ancient value of 
our sacred relationship to the rest of creation and our desire to 
reduce everything to utilitarian standards 
these would be tough times for scientists even without jeremy 
rifkin 
long accustomed to working in good faith researchers 
increasingly find themselves assailed by creationists animal 
rights activists and others 
close scrutiny by ones colleagues is one thing surveillance by 
a suspicious scientifically unschooled public is something else 
a biotechnology symposium at the university of california last 
fall gave a glimpse of scientists mounting frustrations at finding 
their experiments hamstrung by what they called biological 
mccarthyism or the tomatothatatehollywood syndrome 
the symposium came in the wake of field tests of iceminus 
bacteria by researchers from the university of california at 
berkeley and advanced genetic sciences the test involved the 
release of genetically altered microbes placed on crops the 
microbes help prevent frost from forming 
scientists generally agreed that testing the microbes on 
strawberry and potato plants presented no danger rifkin and others 
feared the microbes could mutate to cause human disease lawsuits 
and protests followed ultimately vandals tore up plants at both 
test sites 
everybody involved with iceminus has had such a horrendous 
time with the controversy that theyre all burned out one 
scientist said 
some scientists who have reservations about aspects of 
biotechnology feel that to say so would be counterproductive 
there arent many societies that give science the free rein 
its had here biologist newman says its a precious thing 
and it relies on good will scientists are very reluctant to sour 
that 
genetic engineering technology involves manipulating the dna 
the basic substance of heredity of living organisms by moving dna 
between different organisms researchers hope to develop more 
productive plants and treat genetic diseases they also hope to 
create new drugs one application of genetics that rifkin does not 
oppose 
newman is among a handful of experts who are beginning to 
express scientific as well as ethical doubts about genetic 
engineering he believes the strong drive to commercialize new 
techniques of manipulating genetic material has given rise to 
distorted views about biotechnologys potential 
the standard view holds that biologists have cracked the code 
of life and are now poised to genetically reprogram damaged or 
unsuitable life forms he wrote in a recent issue of perspectives 
in biology and medicine 
but the most that can be claimed for dna on the basis of 
present knowledge is that it specifies some of the ingredients that 
make up an organisms cells dna does not function as a command 
center or blueprint for the functioning of those cells as has 
sometimes been stated 
the concept nonetheless continues to flourish in textbooks in 
the popular media and in corporate handouts as a confidently worn 
mask that obscures the primitive state of our understanding of the 
biological world 
the notion of genetic programming intended as metaphor is 
now taken literally newman says resulting in serious 
misconceptions of the status and potential of biotechnology on the 
part of scientists and nonscientists alike 
since each gene contributes to thousands of traits and each 
trait is the result of the interaction of thousands of genes all 
we can do is make minor modifications and hope for the best 
separating good genes from bad is far more complicated than most 
people realize he adds the same recessive gene linked to 
development of one disease sickle cell anemia for example also 
protects against another malaria 
clearly the nature of this material is very different from 
what were used to working with in building and engineering says 
newman he characterizes current knowledge of the relationship 
between an organisms dna and its overt characteristics as 
meager 
to rifkin biotechnology is unfolding in a manner all too 
reminiscent of other technical and scientific developments that 
have suddenly come to exact an unexpected price he points to a 
magazine cover story about the greenhouse effect the gradual 
heating of the planet scientists say will result from the 
destruction of the ozone layer in the atmosphere that protects 
against the suns ultraviolet rays 
this is the bill for the industrial age he says 
brandishing the magazine it lasted 200 years and well pay for 
it for 2000 
now were about to run out of fossil fuels and enter the age 
of renewable resources this is the time to raise the issues like 
patenting animals its as if 100 years ago we divided up the oil 
and coal the resources for the industrial age now were dividing 
up the resources for the age of biotechnology 
science and technology initiatives dramatically affect the 
future we cant be passive the 21st century is being defined now 
were determined to help shape it before it becomes a fait 
accompli

for jeremy rifkin the combat against 
biotechnology is the latest in a series of battles that have helped 
shape a varied life and career hes fought tougher 
he was born weighing 2 pounds 
his birth midway through the sixth month of vivette rifkins 
pregnancy wasnt the only surprise mrs rifkin was about to be 
wheeled out of the delivery room when a doctor detected a second 
baby 
our chances of survival were something like zero says 
rifkin other than being smaller than most high school freshmen 
and the occasional schoolyard thrashings that went with it he 
suffered no permanent ill effects 
jerelyn rifkin was less fortunate an error in regulating the 
flow of oxygen to her incubator robbed her of most of her sight 
now married and a mother of three she remains legally blind 
although she does everything everyone else does says her 
brother shes probably the bestadjusted person in my family 
her daughters handicap inspired vivette rifkin to found 
educational tape recording for the blind a volunteer organization 
now in its 20th year of recording textbooks for blind students at 
77 she still works a sevenday week as its president milton 
rifkin is retired from his job as a plastic bag manufacturer 
theyve lived in the same house for 43 years in a workingclass 
neighborhood on the south side of chicago 
growing up with a handicapped twin prompted rifkin to give a 
great deal of thought at an early age to weighty social issues he 
still does 
in this society the highest compliment is to turn out 
generations of productive human beings you have to have 
productivity of course but a lot of us grow up believing the 
highest value is to be productive like a machine is productive 
he says 
that does a disservice what matters most is to turn out 
caring human beings people who have the higher value of empathy 
by the time he graduated from high school about the time he 
finally caught up to his classmates rifkin had come to believe 
that an ordinary person can accomplish extraordinary things a 
notion reinforced by his acceptance despite flunking high school 
english to an ivy league college twentyfive years and nine books 
later he says i still cant tell you which is the adverb 
as a beerdrinking fraternity man at the university of 
pennsylvania he was very rahrah a cheerleader says neal 
borenstein his college roommate 
rifkin was never enthralled with hightech adds his 
roommate when most college kids were preoccupied with rock music 
rifkin was busy organizing a nostalgia show of 50s kiddie 
programs even then his organizational skills were impressive 
he filled the auditorium and the show was a huge success 
his politics took a sharp turn to the left in 1966 when a 
vietnamese history course didnt square with what they were 
saying on tv 
the following year he made waves nationwide as the first senior 
class president of an ivy league college to publicly denounce the 
war after graduation he attended the fletcher school of law and 
diplomacy at tufts then became a vista volunteer in new york 
working with welfare recipients in bedfordstuyvesant and east 
harlem 
during the 70s he organized the peoples bicentennial 
commission an alternative to nixons tory celebrations he 
says the commission held rallies for economic democracy and 
churned out classroom materials celebrating the nations 
revolutionary past 
by 1977 rifkin had found his next cause in the controversy over 
recombinant dna technology the subject of his new book who 
should play god the same year he led protesters in disrupting a 
national academy of sciences meeting on dna research chanting we 
will not be cloned 
in the years since both rifkins techniques and his targets 
have grown more complex these days in addition to campaigns 
against animal patenting biological warfare and surrogacy another 
form of tinkering with life hes preparing a global boycott of 
milk treated with bovine growth hormone a greenhouse effect 
coalition and wed like to move big on electronic pollution 
for all his public pronouncements on technologys ills im 
not a purist rifkin concedes he owns a condo drives a honda 
and is a faithful viewer of thirtysomething and cheers 
hes clearly proud of the favorable reviews hes receiving for 
his college speaking engagements yale university called him a 
rare bird a firstrate speaker and a firstrate writer at the 
same time no amount of criticism directed at him or his politics 
seems to faze him 
ive known him a long time says ralph nader who has lent 
support to rifkins campaign against animal patenting hes very 
determined very sincere and hes on the issue for the long run 
im an average person with an average background says 
rifkin who believes average people are quite capable of changing 
history

editors note back in 1964 a man running for the white house 
could still bring his campaign to the people without a vast 
apparatus of hired imageshapers consultants security forces 
anxious glances at the latest quickie polls to tell him what to 
say perhaps one of the last candidates to present himself largely 
unencumbered was barry goldwater of arizona an ap reporter who 
covered this and many another run for the white house recalls how 
it felt in simpler times 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
barry goldwaters was the last of the freestyle presidential 
campaigns innocent of consultants short on security men played 
in person instead of on television and seldom inhibited by any 
real prospect of winning the white house 
that made it a perfect fit for the senator from arizona the 
secret service would have cramped his style and he undoubtedly 
would have fired the kind of campaign consultants who manage 
campaigns these days in 1964 goldwater worked with people he knew 
and trusted not hired hands he said what he thought which 
sometimes changed over the course of a campaign day he was accused 
of shooting from the hip but he wasnt always that careful 
for all that goldwaters 1964 campaign was candid generally 
honest short on rancor despite the bitterness of some of his most 
ardent supporters and remarkably prophetic 
latterday legend notwithstanding goldwater dug many of his own 
political traps before he became a presidential candidate his 
notions about selling tva and turning social security into a 
voluntary system are samples both proposals were made in pieces he 
wrote as mr conservative not mr candidate actually he tempered 
them during the campaign although he liked to reminisce about the 
blunt way hed talked in st petersburg about social security and 
in nashville about tva he repeated the proposals but he also said 
that he didnt believe in changing contracts like social security 
and that besides congress wouldnt let any president make that 
system voluntary or sell off tva 
it was a simpler time and too briefly a safer time john 
kennedy had been assassinated an event that deformed the politics 
of 1964 but that was an aberration secret service agents were not 
deployed around candidates until more than four years later after 
martin luther king and robert f kennedy had fallen to assassins 
goldwater traveled with charlie justice an automobile dealer 
hed met in a new hampshire motorcade as his sole security man 
during the presidential primaries since 1968 the secret service 
cocoon has enveloped candidates limiting access controlling 
crowds and often keeping voters away in the name of security 
not that goldwater was a gladhander he sometimes seemed 
annoyed when crowds kept him overtime one night an unexpected 
crowd of supporters turned up to cheer him as his chartered plane 
arrived in atlanta goldwater snapped a demand to know who on his 
staff was responsible for that 
im no babykissing backslapping blintzeleating 
politician he said one day in hanover nh that was intended as 
a slap at his arch rival new york gov nelson a rockefeller the 
eastern republican incarnate rocky of course delighted in being 
all of the above and like any new york politician he knew how to 
say blintz 
in concord an overzealous new hampshire supporter marched 
goldwater into the puritain restaurant to shake hands at lunch 
time the senator didnt stay long if somebody walked up to me 
while i was eating and stuck out his hand id put a hamburger in 
it goldwater said 
he was a westerner who liked guns security people do not like 
guns around their candidates one can only speculate at the 
reaction had the secret service been on hand when goldwater decided 
to fire a few shots across his driveway toward scottsdale into a 
bullet trap he sometimes missed he did just that one day after 
entertaining a group of reporters at lunch at his home one of them 
liked pistols as much as the senator did and goldwater invited him 
to join in target practice 
this proved exciting for the rest of the party still chatting 
with mrs goldwater when the gunfire began out of the front door 
one room away 
its just barry with his pistol said peggy goldwater 
thinking to calm her guests she made him stop shooting goldwater 
acknowledged it probably was just as well because some of his shots 
had strayed into the valley below and it seemed to bother the 
people at the church down there 
goldwater also liked airplanes as pilot and as passenger his 
campaign jet was named yia bi kin navajo for house in the sky 
it was one of the first of the boeing 727 jets that now are a 
staple of world aviation 
the senator flew it although nobody ever admitted that he also 
landed it when he arrived at dulles airport near washington after 
the election he brought it down hard and smiled knowingly when a 
reporter told him the third bounce landing was a nice one although 
the first had been rather exciting

<TEXT>
it was at least that exciting when the goldwater charter 
performed the bristol flyby early in the campaign the 727 took off 
from tri cities airport near bristol tenn and leveled off en 
route to cleveland suddenly the plane turned sharply and dove at 
high speed grown pilots and there were a lot in the goldwater 
entourage paled goldwater up front went into the cockpit and 
came back smiling the plane kept diving toward the ground then 
suddenly leveled off and blazed down the runway at control tower 
level a pilots prank 
that was to separate the men from the boys goldwater said 
consistency was not a hobgoblin of the goldwater campaign one 
morning in laconia nh during the primary campaign goldwater 
said he would be inclined to withdraw from the united nations if 
communist china were seated one stop later he said the united 
states must stay in the united nations another stop and he said 
that if the mainland chinese supplanted the nationalists it would 
blow us participation to pieces 
then that evening ive never said lets get out of the un 
i dont know how that rumor ever got started 
at an american legion convention in dallas goldwater likened 
the new york times to izvestia outside he chatted with a group of 
reporters and took pains to tell charles mohr the times reporter 
who covered his campaign that it wasnt personal i didnt mean 
you charlie i meant them he said 
goldwaters partisans despised reporters particularly eastern 
reporters a reporter for the san diego union arranged for two sets 
of press badges one read eastern liberal press the other read 
western tory press the safe course was to grab one of each 
the vietnam war was taking shape during 1964 the purported 
attack on us vessels in the gulf of tonkin came in august after 
goldwater had been nominated 
long before that happened goldwater warned that vietnam had the 
makings of the long agonizing conflict it became 
in an unlikely setting amid acres of blossoming pear orchards 
in northern california that spring goldwater said that vietnam 
could become a far more serious conflict than korea he said 
president lyndon b johnson should tell the nation of the peril 
and of his plans for the future 
at that time us involvement was limited to aid and advisers 
combat forces came later 
still grappling with the vietnam issue that fall goldwater 
announced that if elected he would ask former president dwight d 
eisenhower to go to south vietnam and recommend future policy 
it was an ironic echo of eisenhowers own promise in 1952 that 
if elected he would go to korea 
the problem was that nobody bothered to tell eisenhower what 
goldwater was about to propose 
goldwater never liked johnson and it only heightened his 
frustration at the democratic presidents landslide lead in polls 
borne out by the election besides the democratic president kept 
mousetrapping the republican nominee 
goldwater had voted against the civil rights act of 1964 that 
landmark law and the threat of a white backlash were backdrop 
realities during the campaign the senator said he didnt want them 
to become divisive issues a reporter asked whether he had talked 
with johnson about that concern goldwater hadnt but he would 
johnson grabbed that opening the instant he learned of it he 
said hed meet with goldwater any time they met at the white 
house on johnsons turf and johnsons terms johnsons people then 
crafted a joint statement which said in effect that the president 
would continue to take the high road on civil rights and the 
republcan nominee had finally agreed not to make an issue of it 
on election eve goldwater went north to his good luck town 
fredonia ariz on the utah border in indian country hed wound 
up his senate campaigns there and it would be the last stop on his 
presidential campaign too one reporter made it his mission to 
record for posterity the last words spoke in the campaign they 
were not memorable they were and if there are any paiutes out 
there i want to thank you too 
in 1964 the united states had seen three presidents 
eisenhower kennedy and johnson hold office within four years the 
voters werent about to install a fourth even had there been a 
republican nominee with wider support than goldwater found 
goldwater knew the odds when he hobbled into the campaign his foot 
in a cast after one bone spur surgery on election night 1964 at 
the camel back inn goldwaters staff set up a giant blackboard to 
record the popular and electoral vote state by state 
from the time the first votes were counted the johnson 
landslide was evident nobody bothered to write a number on the big 
blackboard chalk never touched it all night long

editors note a south texas rancher they call the desert fox 
is a mystery man of texas politics clinton manges says hes not a 
power broker or a kingmaker but just likes to help his friends 
some of those friends are now in high places in state government 
while manges stuggles to shore up a shaky financial empire 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
freer texas eight miles west of freer an arched gateway 
marks the entrance to the remote duval county ranch that clinton 
manges calls home 
the ranch is called the magic kingdom he is called the desert 
fox 
the house itself is big and luxurious and open with the kitchen 
set apart by a circular bar and the living area anchored by a 
magnificent fireplace it is a warm and friendly desert hideaway 
for a person once described as brilliant backward brash bashful 
and ruthless 
clinton manges also has been portrayed as persecuted powerful 
generous ignorant lucky shy and misunderstood 
today manges is highly agitated and just a little combative 
a seattle bank wants to foreclose on his 100000acre ranch to 
settle a 53 million debt and the local school district is 
demanding 15 million in back taxes 
there are other lawsuits other creditors other unpaid bills 
and other miseries stemming from his ownership of the san antonio 
gunslingers of the illfated united states football league 
but what irks manges as much as anything is that he wants a new 
car and cant get it despite assets of perhaps several hundred 
million dollars 
his credit and current cash flow are zilch 
theres not a bank in texas that will loan me 15 cents he 
grumbles as he guides a visitor around his ranch and past herds of 
deer buffalo and cattle ive been on a cash basis for five 
years 
when they cut off all your blood somewhere down the line 
youre supposed to die but i didnt 
in the manges mind they are a conspiratorial mix of big 
banks big law firms big oil and big insurance companies they 
are the establishment the power structure 
they control 95 percent of the wealth in texas he snorted 
and they make the politics 
some of the things theyve done to me shouldnt happen to a 
dog 
who is clinton manges the answer depends on who you ask 
a liar and a fraud says san antonio attorney pat maloney a 
former friend and legal counsel who once sued manges for 20 
million in a flap over the gunslingers it was also maloney who 
said he has a degree of raw courage hes quick hes tough 
hes the best trader ive ever seen 
san antonio lawyer james ingram hes very tough and very 
shrewd i doubt that you could ever apply enough heat to force him 
to his knees hell fight you till his last breath 
ag mcneese retired chief executive officer of houstons bank 
of the southwest now mbank a classic subject for publicity a 
poor boy with little formal education scaling heights so few 
people ever reach 
state comptroller bob bullock a longtime manges friend and 
political ally i love the man he is one of the most generous 
people ive known and not only with money but time 
land commissioner garry mauro a remorseful recipient of manges 
campaign largesse he lives in a fantasy world in his magic 
kingdom and i dont have the key to the kingdomif i never see 
clinton manges again ill be better off 
freer car dealer frank thomas hes in his realm when hes in 
a courtroom fighting a case 
attorney general jim mattox to be a capitalist youve got to 
have a little larceny in your heart and i think hes probably got 
a little larceny in his heart hes been an underdog and he likes 
to help underdogs i like him 
ruth manges clintons wife of 42 years and mother of the 
couples four adopted children everybody in town knows who he 
is but they dont know him 
in 1974 texas newspapers speculated that a rags to riches 
rancher named clinton manges might seize the south texas power base 
of troubled political boss george parr the legendary duke of duval 
county 
parr later killed himself 
in 1984 texas monthly concluded that the newspaper prophecy had 
come to pass 
the magazine described manges as corrupt and manipulative a 
convicted felon who was reluctant to py his bills yet the article 
conceded 
his mystique and money have combined to make him the most 
powerful and most controversial behindthescenes figure in 
current texas politics 
no one else has so much influence 
manges angrily dismissed the article as a hatchet job 
regarding the crime itself a false statement on a 1959 small 
business loan application manges friend lloyd bentsen father of 
the states senior us senator contended that the indictment 
should never have been brought and was only sustained on a 
technicality 
at 64 clinton manges is hefty and balding with muscular arms 
and a round face creased by sun wind sand and stress he often 
speaks in rapid spurts like bursts from a machine gun

despite what they call me said manges pouring gravy over 
freshly fried quail im not a kingmaker or a power broker but i 
have helped a lot of people 
he said it was no secret that he funneled nearly 1 million into 
the 1982 state democratic primary through a political action 
cmmittee headed by pat maloney and called texans for good 
government 
but he smiled he actually spent about 3 million in that 
election much of it earmarked for a wide range of liberal 
democrats 
the pac money they know about he said what else i did 
nobody knows 
whatever he did it was money well spent his candidates 
captured several of the states top offices judgeships and 
legislative seats 
jim mattox is now attorney general garry mauro is land 
commissioner bob bullock is state comptroller and jim hightower is 
agriculture commissioner 
all could move up in 1990 when mattox most likely will run for 
governor and hightower will oppose us sen phil gramm a 
conservative republican 
you know why theyre ready to move up manges asked his 
visitor because theyre good people theyre clean and theyre 
fair you dont catch them running around taking payoffs like that 
bunch controlled by the establishment 
theyre not doing too badly by manges either as 
representatives of the state mattox and mauro played pivotal roles 
in the 1984 settlement of a 17 billion lawsuit filed by manges 
against mobil oil corp 
with the state of texas aligned with manges mobil surrendered 
its oil and gas lease covering 64000 acres of the duval county 
ranch the settlement was hailed as a 100 million windfall for the 
state treasury and a 400 million victory for manges 
those figures are now suspect based as they were on what was 
later described as a property production and paper deal but 
there is no doubt that manges emerged the big winner in his battle 
with mobil 
i wasnt trying to get a fix manges insists when questioned 
about the political funding activities that preceded the states 
intervention in his case all i wanted was a fair shake 
mobil didnt want any part of that lawsuit after the election 
they knew they were facing people with no love for big oil 
companies and they knew they couldnt buy them 
there is no evidence to suggest that mattox or mauro peddled 
their influence on manges behalf or in fact did anything improper 
on the contrary both maintain the state will reap millions from 
the mobil deal for years to come 
in an interview at his office in san antonio 110 miles north of 
freer manges denied claims that he is a deadbeat 
i always pay when i can and in the end i pay em all he 
said but sometimes you cant pay because you dont have the 
money and sometimes you file lawsuits to stall em until you get 
the money to pay em 
i never deny my debts to anybody 
at the moment his most pressing concern is seafirst bank of 
seattle which wants to foreclose on his ranch to settle a debt now 
exceeding 53 million 
that debt stems from loans in the early 1980s that manges used 
to finance his highstakes battle with mobil and the related 
multimilliondollar political contributions 
in a curiously worded ruling against manges this spring us 
district court judge hf garcia of san antonio wrote 
it seems almost unconscionable that the defendants manges 
incurred a debt of 50 million did not pay and had to be sued 
defendants have no one but themselves to blame for their financial 
predicament 
they incurred the debt and its time for the fat lady to 
sing 
seafirst officials seemed only cautiously optimistic about 
collecting anytime soon bank attorney pat deely says the ranch has 
up to a dozen claims against it and the foreclosure cannot proceed 
until those are cleared up and a final court judgment secured 
manges could torpedo the issue with a bankruptcy filing but 
seems reluctant to do so not that he has any warm feelings toward 
seafirst 
they took all my production he complained all my money 
goes to seafirst theyre supposed to return 25 percent to me for 
my expenses but ive never received a cent from them in nearly 
five years 
his time might come though he says 
things will brighten up when we get a democrat in there as 
governor he beamed and he fully expects his good buddy bob 
bullock to be the next lieutenant governor 
theyre all there and theyre all in place he said but 
i dont want to say anything that might hurt them i want to help 
them like i said i dont want anything from them i dont need 
anything from them 
nothing that is but a fair shake

editors note they are a link between the past and the future 
bridging a communications gap for americas immigrants teaching 
them how to cope in the new world with some notable exceptions 
foreignlanguage newspapers are thriving in the united states 
partly as the result of a resurgence of ethnic pride

when li quanwu arrived here two years ago he 
learned what was facing him from a series of articles on successful 
chineseamericans in the chineselanguage centre daily news 
it taught me that ive got to be in the studio all day to 
succeed says the 32yearold artist now represented by a major 
new york gallery 
when enmore narcisse immigrated from haiti 10 years ago he had 
little but a drivers license and spoke little english the haiti 
observateur a creole newspaper based in brooklyn helped change 
that 
reading the paper i found this cab company and got me a 
job narcisse says slapping the seat of his taxi it also 
helped bring me into the haitian world here 
after decades of decline foreignlanguage newspapers are making 
a comeback in the united states 
in a 1962 survey of the american foreignlanguage press 
yeshiva university professor joshua fishman found 704 publications 
in 40 languages twentytwo years later he documented 1031 
publications in 58 languages including about 100 daily newspapers 
the papers are teaching new groups of newcomers how to cope with 
the new world and in a break with the past second and 
thirdgeneration immigrants are also turning to the papers as a 
means of holding onto their cultural heritage 
for firstgeneration immigrants the papers play a critical 
role in the acclimation process fishman says they provide 
important social legal and economic information to new americans 
but for second and thirdgeneration americans the papers offer 
something less tangible 
for them the papers play more of a cultural and social 
role fishman says the papers help the readers define 
themselves as americans after all we are a nation of immigrants 
the foreignlanguage papers are sensitive to this cultural role 
and its helped them stay alive fishman says many papers now run 
sections in english or write stories using very simple words in the 
mother tongue 
the heyday of foreignlanguage newspapers was at the turn of the 
century at the height of the european immigration when nearly 
every town with a substantial immigrant population had a 
foreignlanguage press 
boston had dozens of italian and gaelic papers new yorks 
steinway street was home to a slew of germanlanguage dailies the 
jewish daily forward built a towering building on manhattans lower 
east side papers in scandinavian languages could be found in 
minnesota 
but as the older generation died off leaving a new generation 
committed to a future in america not a past in europe 
foreignlanguage papers folded 
a drop in immigration due to the depression and legislation 
restricting entry to the united states further hurt the industry 
it was not until the 1960s that immigration and the 
foreignlanguage press began to rise again helped in part by a 
more liberal quota system for immigrants and economic troubles in 
other parts of the world but the accents and the colors of the 
immigrants had changed 
at the turn of the century 80 percent of the immigrants came 
from europe starting in the 1960s the majority came from asia and 
developing countries in africa and south america 
between 1955 and 1965 for example the number of chinese in new 
yorks chinatown increased eight times to 165000 replacing the 
european jews italians and irish by the early 1970s at least 
eight chineselanguage newspapers were being published 
at the same time a haitian community was taking root in 
brooklyn long home to italians and jews vietnamese refugees were 
moving to california newspapers followed both 
a growth in ethnic pride and awareness fueled by the 1960s 
civil rights movement also helped spur an increase in the number 
of papers 
americans who had lived here for decades began to look for their 
roots seeking a sense of community unavailable from american 
societyatlarge 
new yorks two healthy greek papers are examples of newspapers 
that are succeeding despite dwindling immigration from greece 
but the 110yearold il progresso the nations only 
italianlanguage newspaper announced in early july it was shutting 
down because of a labor dispute 
in addition to the roles they play in america many ethnic 
newspapers in america also try to affect life in the old country 
raising money for political movements and pushing for social change 
during the 1986 presidential campaign in the philippines the 
weekly philippine news published in south san francisco with a 
circulation of 77000 raised 35 million for candidate corazon 
aquino according to publisher alejandro esclamado 
the haiti observateur circulation 65000 fought the duvalier 
regime for years and continues to agitate for democracy in that 
caribbean nation 
i look at my paper as a vehicle for political 
transformation says the editor raymond joseph a former wall 
street journal reporter when i was younger i believed in 
guerrilla warfare now its the power of the press 
in contrast novoye russkoye slovo circulation 50000 a 
russianlanguage paper published in manhattan doesnt push 
politics its concerned with teaching russian immigrants about 
america 
we want our readers to be involved in american life says 
lawrence wajnberg executive vice president of the paper anyone 
who thinks theyre going back is nuts 
helping readers adapt to their new home has always been a 
priority for the foreignlanguage press in years past the jewish 
daily forward ran an advice column called bintel brev yiddish for 
a packet of letters readers asked about the intricacies of 
baseball intermarriages and social mores 
in todays newspapers articles on immigration law drugs aids 
and real estate abound 
in a chinatown dumpling house cindi mei and three friends pore 
over the world journal catching up on the latest gossip about 
taiwans movie stars while the world journal supports the taiwan 
government the opposition centre daily news supports mainland 
china the communists 
its good to know so that when i go back to taiwan in the 
summer ill know what my friends are talking about says the 
17yearold thirdgeneration american it also helps me keep up 
my chinese 
many immigrants complain that their papers just reprint stories 
from the american press 
what you get in the daily news we get in the korean papers two 
days even three days later says william kim a 
secondgeneration proprietor of a laundry in lower manhattan but 
reading english is a headache so ive got no choice

editors note with hotel prices going through the roof in many 
places more and more travelers are looking for bedandbreakfast 
accommodations in private homes its the fastestgrowing segment 
of the hospitality industry and its no longer confined to the 
country bed and breakfast hosts are springing up all over the big 
apple one reason is that it helps new yorkers pay their own 
exorbitant housing costs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
if valerie dimitris bedandbreakfast guests 
dont look out the window they can they can fantasize that they 
are staying in a cozy country cottage complete with a fat cat 
sitting in front of a white brick fireplace 
actually its a manhattan penthouse facing east 86th street 
with a noisy rumble of fumespewing buses taxis trucks and people 
down below 
well if you want us to replicate the inn in vermont you 
better go there says mary mcauley proprietor of urban ventures 
one of seven registries that send visitors to bedandbreakfast 
hosts in the big apple 
ms mcauley and others in the bampb industry say the market for 
their brand of bigcity hostelries is booming in the 1980s 
they appeal to business people tired of staying in 100anight 
hotel rooms where brass statues are riveted to tabletops to prevent 
theft to tourists tired of paying 13 for a bowl of cereal 
bampbs are an affordable way to explore urban life prices range 
from 45 to 90 a night for two depending on the location and 
other amenities the arrangement is also helping a lot of new 
yorkers pay their soaring housing costs 
overseas visitors have long known the charms of bampbs which 
originated in europe the idea spread to america early in the 
century but the cottage industry was nearly wiped out after world 
war ii when rural roadways dotted with bampbs were replaced by 
highways and motel chains 
country and seashore bampbs and unusual urban inns like san 
franciscos bishop mansion survived but city bampbs disappeared 
things began to change around 1979 thanks to rising housing and 
hotel costs big city bampbs are now the fastest growing segment of 
the hospitality industry says susan morris of bed and breakfast 
association worldwide inc a new orleansbased trade group 
urban ventures had 15 hosts in 1979 in 1988 it has 700 
the number of people using bigcity bampbs has increased 200 
percent to 300 percent each year ms morris says one reason is 
their variety 
they come in condos and apartments and mansions and even in 
yachts in some locations she says there are ranches and log 
cabins in the west antebellum mansions in the south and french 
quarter homes in new orleans 
in new york guests can find rooms in nearly every manhattan 
neighborhood from an artsy loft in soho to a tony central park 
penthouse there also are a few bampbs in the outer boroughs of 
queens and brooklyn 
there are even countrystyle places like valerie dimitris 
penthouse 
cheery country red walls welcome visitors into an apartment 
filled with antiques and lace a black kettle doorstop and scatter 
rugs strewn over polished hardwood floors add a country cottage 
atmosphere 
in the living room a small round table near the window is 
covered with delicate spidery lace and adorned with yellowed 
family photographs guests can cozy into an overstuffed clawfooted 
chair with a cup of valeries own blackberry tea 
some hosts enter the business because they like to meet people 
from other parts of the country and other parts of the world 
says ms morris others do it out of necessity in the cities 
its a help in paying exorbitant rents people are being charged 
now 
at urban ventures ms mcauley estimates her hosts average 
10000 a year 
some more some less depending on how often they book guests 
ms dimitri is one of urban ventures most popular hostesses 
i like to get a little fancyschmancy says the diminutive 
ms dimitri a speechwriter i put mints under pillows give 
honeymooning couples a split of champagne and always use the good 
crystal 
she delighted one couple in town to start a bicycling 
honeymoon by decorating their bikes with crepepaper ribbons and 
just married signs 
notes and fresh flowers welcome each guest bus and subway maps 
and magazines tell them whats going on around town and ms 
dimitri offers tips on the best restaurants and broadway shows she 
caters to the whims of her guests such as the prince who eats 
vanilla yogurt for breakfast 
guests pay ms dimitri 65 a night for one or 80 for two but 
they often find other ways to repay her kindnesses like the 
80yearold french perfumer who sends her a bottle of his special 
scent each year on her birthday 
new york bampbs may not offer all the amenities of their country 
cousins by and large ms mcauley says breakfasts are not going 
to be the great stuff like mamas homemade biscuits 
besides a few retired hosts most are not going to be hanging 
around the house our hosts are nurses theyre internsthey have 
a place to be at 89 in the morning and theyre not going to sit 
around and chat 
allan arrow an aspiring writer bought a fiveroom penthouse in 
the theater district and finds that he often has enough guests to 
pay his monthly mortgage and maintenance expenses 
david turner of collingswood nj was in new york for several 
job interviews and stayed at arrows digs for five days 
if you can afford a suite at the plaza or the palace thats 
wonderful but small inexpensive hotels in new york are a drag 
turner says someone told me about this and it seemed like a real 
nice alternative and it is 
not coincidentally a new play arrow is working on is set inside 
a bedandbreakfast place in a big city in a penthouse to be 
exact 
its got a lot of amusing possibilities he says

editors note when the skiing is done with and aspen colo 
settles down to a more placid way its an enviable setting for 
thinkers of cosmic thoughts thats what a large group of notables 
who have much to do with americas designs for living does for one 
very cerebral week each year 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for nearly 40 years when other peoples 
thoughts turn to vacations and light summer reading a select 
contingent of conventioneers has descended on this pastoral alpine 
playground to contemplate the state of civilization 
this year again some 1500 creative people who influence the 
way much of the world buys products wears clothes reads books 
drives cars eats sleeps and works came to ponder and discuss 
their theme was the cutting edge 
or put another way where are we as a global society as the 
human race that was the question cochairmen jay chiat a los 
angelesbased advertising man and henry wolf a new yorkbased 
photographer and graphic designer bit off and left for the 38th 
international design conference to chew 
it seems that many of us have serious doubts that 
significant progress has taken place in literature advertising 
architecture and product and graphic design since the 60s 
chiat said in the conference program is this true if so why 
if not why dont we believe it is there a cutting edge or is it 
as dull out there as some of us think 
the idca was started in 1951 by the late walter paepke chairman 
of the container corporation of america paepke was a millionaire 
businessman who along with his wife elizabeth who still lives in 
aspen set out to make this mostly dilapidated victorianera 
colorado mining town a mecca for intellectuals and artists the 
entertainers and jet set followed 
the first conference design as a function of management 
explored the relationship of design to business 
in 1951 tv was a fledgling medium that would change the world 
the first commercial color telecast was aired and dacron suits 
sugarless chewing gum orlon and a commercial electronic computer 
made their debut 
in the intervening years the folks whove designed everything 
from cars to computers to commercials the graphic artists 
painters writers social scientists museum directors filmmakers 
the men and women who decorate and stimulate our physical and 
mental lives have made the pilgrimage to aspen to learn how 
design is integrated into politics art business science 
education and philosophy 
ted goudvis a retired mining engineer and aspen resident whos 
been attending the conference for eight years found that the 
speakers last june had a more idealistic slant 
some ominous notes intruded dr howard h hiatt former dean of 
the harvard school of public health and currently senior physician 
at the brigham and womens hospital in boston told the audience 
that the aids toll in the united states is already catastrophic 
but we have only seen the beginning 
he urged more government funding to combat acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome and a national system of health care i hope 
the cutting edge the state of things to be will be a more humane 
society he said 
a group of museum directors including kinshasha conwill 
executive director of the studio museum in harlem and richard 
koshalek director of the museum of contemporary art in los 
angeles noted that 80 percent of americans live in cities and said 
art has to go to the people 
we defined space in los angeles that is outlined by four 
freeways and we consider that our turf said koshalek whos held 
art exhibits in parking lots and now has a revolving collection in 
a hardware store named the temporary contemporary 
ms conwill said she believed the current american art scene 
is lacking in originality and vigor and black artists are absent 
from that arena but added that her museum was spotlighting negro 
artists in probably the most important black community in the 
world harlem

the conference was held among the manicured meadows of the aspen 
institute for humanistic studies also founded by the paepkes 
right away the snack bar menu revealed it wasnt an ordinary 
convention forget greasy burgers and fries this was aspen home 
of the toothin the toorich here you have toubouleh sandwiches 
yogurt and cucumber soup and brie with grapes 
the participants were overwhelmingly big city dwellers from the 
coasts because most were designers wardrobes ran the gamut from 
silks to sleaze black to brazen polished to punk the crowds 
differentness became a sameness 
set amid wildflowers and fresh air spectacular sunsets and 
snowcapped mountains the gathering had its share of famous names 
former television talk show host dick cavett acted as a floating 
moderator 
david puttnam producer of 29 films including chariots of 
fire and the killing fields talked about his disagreements 
with the chiefs at coca cola inc parent company of columbia 
studios which puttnam recently headed and the state of movies 
today 
a movie should start out attempting to be everything good 
exciting commercial in the best sense and leave an aftertaste 
puttnam said where we are at now is a lack of ambition in what 
films can do the dream in cinema is gone i think money corrupts 
the creative process the sheer cost of making a film today takes 
away creative risk 
puttnam a briton who lives in london and now produces films for 
warner brothers studios said unwillingness to take creative 
chances pervades american corporate life today 
there is this extraordinary pressure to perform to 
outperform last year to outperform this year said puttnam a 
fan of smallerbudget movies with unknown actors and directors 
the reason we are chasing the japanese is that the japanese have 
this extraordinary ability to make a decision and then take a long 
view 
paul goldberger architecture critic of the new york times since 
1973 said that in the past few years there has been a tendency 
to believe that the most profound effect of architecture has been 
deciding what kind of molding to put on the 3 million beach house 
of an investment banker 
architects have become so obsessed with size corporate power 
and the lushness of detail that the idea that architecture serves a 
social purpose has been forgotten goldberger said 
feminist betty friedan founder of the national organization for 
women and author of the feminine mystique and the second 
stage and now at work on the fountain of age said a new 
feminine mystique is telling american women to give up the social 
economic and legal gains of the past two decades and put on the 
girdle again put on the miniskirt and go home again 
the answer is repent of your ways of your feminist dreams 
of your ideas and your aspirations friedan said facetiously 
nearly drowned out by laughter and applause this economy would 
really collapse if the women went home again to say nothing of the 
familys economy 
friedan thought the nation was coming to the end of an era of 
devotion to greed and gave it a verbal shove 
the nations resources are great enough to accept public 
responsibility if we let go unchallenged this culture of greed 
of privatism not only are the poor the homeless the underclass 
going to create a possible depression the middle class the 
professional class and our children earning more than we did when 
we were their age are going to have a mean life 
so what is the cutting edge and where is it 
the cutting edge is not always where we assume it to be 
said idca cochairman wolf it crops up in unpredictable places 
and the prognosticators have a very hard time finding it

the judds the motherdaughter team that bounded 
out of nowhere to country music stardom less than five years ago 
will get their ragstoriches story told in a fall special on cbs 
people will have a chance to see us on the road and see what 
its like to go through what were going through the pressures of 
being so close professionally and personally says wynonna judd 
24 we filmed all day long yesterday in colesburg ky where 
mamas brother whos a baptist preacher has a small church 
as the judds toured on the country music circuit this summer tv 
cameras also followed them to new york iowa california and 
tennessee 
naomi judd who is 18 years older than her daughter but looks 
more like her sister says the image we have right now is that 
were almost joined at the lips we share a common bond in music 
were alike in a lot of ways but were very different the 
director thinks thats interesting enough to investigate indepth 
the judds popped into country music prominence in 1984 while 
wynonna was in high school they had shunned honkytonks and 
practiced at home working on wynonnas singing and acoustic guitar 
playing and naomis harmonizing and the family image they wanted 
to project 
we got signed at a live audition naomi says we didnt 
have biographies or photographs had never had a band or played in 
public 
a deal was made with curb records and rca brent maher has 
produced all their albums using arranger don potter top country 
songwriters and sticking to the presentation the judds already had 
worked out 
when our first single had a dream was on the radio i 
was working full time as a nurse and wynonna was a temporary 
secretary naomi says 
after the second single mama hes crazy reached no 1 on 
the country charts the judds still had fleamarket furniture and 
unmatched dishes 
when the country music association presented awards in october 
1984 the judds won the horizon award essentially meaning best 
new act the cma named them vocal group of the year and they also 
won grammy awards for best country performance by a duo or group 
the following three years 
mom and i havent always had it this wonderful wynonna says 
naomi still turns off lights when she leaves a room and clips 
grocery coupons all my life i felt i was a face in the crowd 
not having any money she says 
naomi has another daughter ashley who has finished her 
sophomore year at the university of kentucky studying french 
history and art history she is not a singer but naomi says in 
the summer we like to take her out and slam her around on the road 
a little bit i dont want her to think that its easy last year i 
paid her 10 a day to be bus engineer it meant cleaning the bus 
ashley declined the position this year 
naomi took back her maiden name judd after she was divorced in 
california and returned with her daughters to her native kentucky 
wed been in hollywood seven years naomi says they were 
thinking hollywood was home and normal we went to morrill ky it 
had maybe 200 people 
we lived on a hilltop didnt have a telephone or tv i wanted 
them to develop their imaginations and play together they worked 
in the garden learned about animals 
naomi entered nursing school wynonna began singing 
mom had a guitar someone had given her she says i had a 
friend who would teach me someone gave me a book i guess im 
lucky to have an ear for learning i would listen to the radio and 
try to get all i could teaching myself 
we would buy discount records we didnt have the money for 
fullprice albums it caused us to discover all these weird but 
wonderful types of music my first influence was bluegrass 
only ashley lives with her mother now wynonna bought a small 
farm in franklin tenn close enough to call mom to say im 
coming over 
a lot of times mom and i couldnt get along but we could still 
sing together wynonna says you have someone to share the 
joys awards excitement and incredible opportunities with other 
times being so close we know how to bug each other 
naomi says of her daughter she makes me the maddest of 
anybody and makes me laugh the loudest

at age 85 al hirschfeld is still drawing in the 
dark capturing in his unique caricatures the essence and spirit of 
broadway 
for six decades the genial whitebearded artist has sat in the 
theater and sketched making graceful line drawings that seem to 
come alive on the page 
ive learned to annoy as few people as possible he was 
saying the other day reflecting on all the hard work he has done 
during performances with a small sketch pad and a venus hb pencil 
hirschfeld was sitting in a barber chair in his studio on the 
top floor of an east side brownstone where he has lived for more 
than 40 years with his wife dolly its where he finishes all his 
drawings 
today hirschfeld draws more than theater folk movie stars 
television personalities politicians even ordinary citizens are 
his subjects but its the theater drawings particularly his 
sketches that appear regularly in the new york times that most 
people remember 
on a slanted and wellworn drawing table perched in front of the 
barber chair hirschfeld opens a large sketch book its filled 
with what look like random doodles a cigar wicker furniture the 
detail of window a bow tie theyre bits and pieces of 
remembrances from the recent broadway production of long days 
journey into night 
these are very helpful in putting together a sketch he 
says you cant trust a faulty memory 
these sketches were interspersed with roughly drawn portraits of 
the plays two stars jason robards and colleen dewhurst 
she has a way of putting her hand to her face all the time 
he says 
hirschfeld says he does no research before beginning to sketch a 
new show 
the characters are what interests me but as for the play 
itself sometimes i come out and i dont know what it was all 
about he says when im working i concentrate on the actual 
design or the image rather than the thought later i go to the 
opening and can see the play 
hirschfeld has always been partial to drawing the 
largerthanlife actors particularly comedians 
most of them have invented themselves he says they know 
what they look like people like carol channing zero mostel and 
in the earlier days the marx brothers buster keaton charlie 
chaplin or mae west they were all real inventions the modern 
actor is a little more the fellow next door the people in the 
street are more theatrical than most actors today 
the artist used to go out of town to philadelphia boston or 
new haven to see new shows and do his sketches today with the 
broadway tryout a rare occurrence he goes to rehearsals or 
runthroughs to do his sketching or even draws from photographs or 
videocassettes supplied by producers 
its the little things that help develop the character in a 
drawing hirschfeld explains some simple little thing like 
the way a fellow holds his hand or his cigarette george burns for 
instance the way he holds a cigar is very unique he holds it 
differently than groucho does 
hirschfeld born in st louis started out as a sculptor and 
later turned to painting 
then suddenly i developed this insane passion for line and 
what you can do with it and how it can communicate he recalls 
its always mysterious to me how it happens 
his first drawing in the new york times appeared in 1925 a 
sketch of sir harry lauder a famous comedian of the day making 
one of many farewell tours in new york 
from then on hirschfeld was hooked on the theater and the 
actors on stage 
im more interested in people than in nature he says it 
would never occur to me to sit on the lip of the grand canyon and 
paint it im interested in people the way they dress and eat and 
walk and dance and talk whatever they do 
hirschfelds drawings have also intrigued people because he puts 
nina the name of his daughter in all his sketches he got the 
idea the day she was born in 1945 
i just wanted to record it historically that she was here 
he says i kept it up for two or three weeks and then tried to 
stop it i would leave nina out but the mail was unbelievable 
today nina is always the last thing to go into one of his 
drawings and he puts a little number next to his name if there are 
two or more ninas in a picture 
nina will even make an appearance on a postage stamp hirschfeld 
has designed three 25cent stamps portraits of laurel and hardy 
mary pickford and rosa ponselle that the postal service will 
release over the next year it took a special decision by 
postmaster general anthony frank to allow the stamps to have nina 
imprinted on them 
hirschfeld calls his job a lemming profession one which 
apparently has no future and says there are very few outlets for 
his kind of work 
im always surprised that i get paid for all of this 
hirschfeld says i would do it anyway maybe not in the theater 
but i certainly would be sitting around a cafe and be doodling away 
my demands on life are very small i like what im doing i 
dont have any hobbies im here all day long seven days a week and 
in the evening we go to the theater or have people in and sit 
around and talk i find that very engaging i could never retire i 
wouldnt know what to do with my time

on an april day in 1908 the steamship 
kasato maru set sail from kobe japan with 781 japanese peasants 
contracted to work on the coffee plantations of brazil their plan 
was to come home in two to five years and start new lives with 
their earnings 
but most stayed in brazil to become the founders of what today 
is the worlds largest japanese community outside japan 1168000 
strong 
they are brazilians first they tell you but as japan has risen 
in economic power and influence across the world they are feeling 
the pull of the land of their ancestors 
andre hori 20 wearing faded blue jeans and a white sweat 
shirt kneels silently on a straw mat his eyes riveted on the 
kimonoclad instructor who patiently goes through the precise 
movements of the chado centuriesold japanese tea ceremony 
a few blocks away in downtown sao paulo hifumi konno 55 in a 
blue and white cotton kimono rehearses the delicate and intricate 
steps of the kyo fujima ryo one of japans traditional 
classical dance forms 
the renewed interest in homeland traditions is a relatively 
recent phenomenon among brazils japanese according to luis 
masahiro hanada executive secretary of the braziljapan cultural 
alliance 
for many years especially after japans defeat in world war 
ii the main concern in the community was to integrate to be as 
brazilian as possible this led to an almost total rejection of 
anything identified with japan he said in an interview 
but in the 1970s as japan prospered many in the community 
started feeling a strong sense of curiosity and a need to 
understand and recover a cultural past which for years had been 
ignored 
he added that over the past 10 years the number of people 
learning japanese at the cultural alliance has been increasing by 
15 percent annually the alliance houses brazils largest 
japaneselanguage school with more than 2000 students 
similar increases have been registered in courses of traditional 
japanese art forms such as flower arrangements origami paper 
folding and caligraphy he said 
andre hori explained why he decided to learn the tea ceremony 
and take japanese language classes 
i always felt that japans recovery after the war and its 
current economic strength could best be understood by studying its 
culture something i knew nothing about he said 
kaesundri wakisaka one the directors of the japanesebrazilian 
research center said another important reason for the communitys 
renewed interest in its cultural background is a kind of 
instinctive concern that one day these traditions may disappear 
during a break in her dance rehearsals mrs konno said if we 
dont learn and transmit our cultural heritage to the younger 
generations it will all fade away 
she said that despite her efforts her two daughters have shown 
little interest in following my example they have become too 
brazilian 
wakisaka said the japanese communitys assimilation into 
brazilian culture and society was progressing so smoothly and 
steadily that in 50 years it will be almost impossible to 
distinguish it as an ethnically different group 
he said the main reason was growing number of interracial 
marriages wakisaka estimated there were about 11500 marriages in 
brazil between the descendants of japanese and nonjapanese 
most japanesebrazilians interviewed insisted that their life 
styles and way of thinking are brazilian but they make clear their 
heritage is not far behind 
kenichi yamai a 58yearold attorney said i am so brazilian 
that i only remember my japanese background when i look at myself 
in the mirror 
but sitting on a beige sofa in his three bedroom apartment he 
said he never misses a chapter of takeda shigen the great 
samurai a soap opera produced in japan and aired every sunday in 
japanese by a local tv station 
he also starts his day reading sao paulo shimbun one of three 
japaneselanguage newspapers published in sao paulo 
with his wife emi sitting at his side yamai also said he 
insisted that his daughter regina a 28yearold dentist marry a 
japanese because mixed marriages never work out and when my two 
sons are ready to marry i will make the same demand 
carlos nakayashi a 43yearold economist said no matter how 
brazilian we feel or act or are seen by others there is no denying 
our heritage its in our blood and will never go away 
for harumi kawasaki a 50yearold teacher in a japanese 
language school being japanese in brazil is like having a split 
personality for we are constantly straddling two entirely 
different cultures

silicone plaster and glue can go a long 
way toward helping to heal wounded selfimages 
i think its amazing says denis lee head of the university 
of michigan medical centers medical sculpture unit a lot of 
people when they first come are hesitant about wearing anything 
artificial or rubber they think it will fall off or people will 
laugh 
after they see the results its incredible 
hundreds of people each year who have lost an eye ear nose 
finger toe breast or other feature to birth defects cancer 
accidents and fire and who cant be helped by plastic surgery 
seek assistance from prosthetic artists 
i really dont know what to say for making me feel like a 
whole person again a 69yearold ohio woman whose face was 
disfigured and right eye lost to cancer wrote to lee people 
just cant believe how anyone can do such a wonderful job i can go 
anyplace and people dont stare 
its a wonderful feeling to have in my life again 
stan stasilowicz 63 of union lake lost his right ear to 
cancer two decades ago i said to some of my cronies that i got a 
new ear and they said which one it was very exhilarating 
prosthetics can be especially important for children says lee 
who is seeking a corporate sponsor for a center for disfigured 
children here if not treated properly and quickly they can have 
psychological problems children can be pretty cruel and 
disfigured children get teased 
popular shows and movies have helped alleviate that problem in 
the six million dollar man and bionic woman series people 
with mechanical parts have superhuman strength and the recent 
movie robo cop dealt with replacing lost features and organs 
with mechanical ones 
if theyre the bionic kid lee says theyre the hit of 
the class 
of about 200 patients treated here annually lee estimates the 
breakdown is 50 ears 30 breasts 20 noses 20 eyes and 50 
miscellaneous most health insurance covers the cost which 
runs about 1400 for an ear or nose and 2000 for an eye 
there are about 200 prosthetic sculptors working in the united 
states most of them affiliated with michigan a veterans 
administration clinic in new york city and a medical center 
associated with baylor university according to lee who also 
directs a 22yearold graduate program to train the artists 
the university of illinois ohio state university johns hopkins 
university the medical college of georgia and the university of 
texas also offer such courses its harder to get into than 
medical school its a very strange combination to have people 
interested in science and art thats why the program is so 
small lee says 
the course of study includes anatomy pathology anatomical 
sketching medical and scientific drawing and medical graphics 
graduates generally can set up their own business freelance or 
work for a hospital or medical center 
one works for star wars creator george lucas industrial 
light and magic making creatures for science fiction films 
sculptors take a plaster mold of the patients undamaged 
feature then make a silicone rubber copy and carefully match skin 
tone the replacement is applied daily with a medical adhesive 
though the appearance of prostheses are strikingly realistic 
many of lees patients are apprehensive about how well they will 
work people ask if it will fall off in their soup 
one of the centers success stories is a 3yearold lakeworth 
fla girl who lost half her right foot in a lawnmower accident 
within six months of getting her prosthesis she was taking ballet 
lessons 
her mother says she wont take her silicone rubber toes off

questions surrounding withholding and 
cost of treatment and even confidentiality have hospitals turning 
more frequently to special consultants and committees to help 
search for the answers 
the american hospital association estimates that at least 60 
percent of us hospitals with 200 or more beds have such 
committees made up of doctors philosophers theologians and 
social workers a report in last weeks journal of the american 
medical association said 30 percent of 280 patients in a virginia 
study presented ethical problems 
some hospitals like lutheran general hospital have doctors 
like john la puma as consultants la puma does at least two 
consultations a week 
an ethics consultant helps clarify issues and provides a lot 
of comfort for myself as a primary care physician said dr 
stuart goldman director of research and family practice at 
lutheran general 
in addition to medicines capacity to prolong life in a 
society where lawsuits are common lawsuits are less likely when an 
ethics committee has been consulted said dr david larson 
director of loma linda universitys center for christian bioethics 
in california its harder to demonstrate that a doctor has acted 
unprofessionally 
the fact that not all ethics consultants are doctors raises 
other issues 
among them said arthur l caplan director of the center for 
biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota are who should 
be entitled to do this and what qualifications and training should 
they have what are the proper duties to give to someone who is an 
ethics consultant teaching troubleshooting or policymaking 
what is the job 
another unresolved issue is consultants legal responsibility 
said caplan i think down the road the courts are going to have 
to clarify their role 
medical guidelines will ease debate over withholding treatment 
said la puma the big ethical issue of the 1990s is going to be 
medical indigents and what kind of care we provide for patients 
who cannot provide for themselves

a new combination of solar cells cracked a 
us department of energys efficiency goal and could find use in 
the space program or eventual earthbound solar power plants 
officials say 
researchers at sandia national laboratories stacked a gallium 
arsenide solar cell made by varian associates inc of palo alto 
calif on a silicon cell from stanford university to achieve a 31 
percent efficiency rating it can generate 31 watts of electricity 
for every 100 watts of sunlight it collects 
doe had set a 30 percent efficiency goal and previous attempts 
at stacking yielded 20 percent said sandias dan arvizu 
the gallium arsenide cell is best at converting light on the 
blue segment of the spectrum while the silicon chip is better on 
red each cell is about 27 percent efficient researchers may 
almost have reached the limit of efficiency for single solar cells 
so stacking is the most promising way to achieve high efficiency 
said jan werthen varians manager of solar research 
the bottom line is how much is the electricity on a 
centsperkilowatthour basis said robert annan head of does 
photovoltaic energy technology division some coal and oilfired 
power systems cost 30 cents per kwh and sandias new chip might 
generate at 12 cents within a decade annan said 
similar costs might also be possible with a cell developed by 
the solar energy research institute and arco solar annan said 
seri and arco reduced the cost of production while sandia 
increased efficiency he said

teeth are getting smaller but dont go 
measuring your children or even your greatgrandchildren 
the change is about 1 percent per 1000 years according to 
university of michigan anthropologist c loring brace who 
attributes the shrinkage to better food preparation techniques 
putting softer food in our mouths 
teeth have shrunk about 50 percent in 100000 years and twice 
as fast in the last 10000 years says brace who has studied teeth 
for 25 years 
the advent of earth ovens pottery and other utensils has 
played a direct role he says ancient cemeteries contain many 
bodies with no teeth where earthen ovens were common in areas with 
ovens there are more teeth 
as softer cooked foods became available our ancestors had 
less need of big strong teeth to survive he says

cheaper more powerful telescopes 
the last molding material was flushed off the glass blank with a 
highpressure water hose on aug 11 and university of arizona 
spokeswoman jan mccoy said its a perfect piece of glass 
astronomers unveiled the blank in june when they removed the lid 
of a its furnace after letting it cool for weeks after it was 
spuncast centrifugally in a new process that creates a lighter 
more deeply curved mirror 
this first one has been a great success mccoy said 
grinding and polishing will take about a year then the mirror 
will go into the apache point observatory planned for the 
sacramento mountains near sunspot nm it will be operated by the 
astrophysical research consortium of princeton chicago new mexico 
state washington and washington state universities 
work already has begun at the mirror laboratory here on a second

the national hurricane center is 
counting lightning strokes to see if they could lead to better 
thunderstorm warnings but one meteorologist says such warnings 
could be too late to do any good 
a correlation between the the severity of a storm and the 
number frequency and intensity of lightning before it would let 
forecasters issue more timely and accurate warnings said bob 
pifer a meteorologist at the center 
the equipment for comparison has been available for years but 
florida has been slow to use the information for weather 
prediction he said specialized users like electric companies 
forestry services or power generation plants are more concerned 
with lightning than the general public 
in florida we have fairly shortlived storms they usually 
start to dissipate in 30 to 45 minutes said national weather 
service meteorologist gordon mccann in west palm beach by the time 
enough lightning strokes to make the prediction are recorded it 
could be too late for warnings he said 
the hurricane center gets its data from receivers in

a 2yearold girl lies in a hospital 
room suffering from a rare incurable blood disorder that involves 
painful treatment 
in another room relatives of a 56yearold comatose woman 
recall her wish not to be kept alive with no hope of recovery 
two patients two medical histories but each poses ethics 
questions which have us hospitals turning more frequently to 
special consultants and committees to help search for the answers 
the american hospital association estimates that at least 60 
percent of the nations hospitals with 200 or more beds have such 
committees 
a few such as lutheran general hospital in this north chicago 
suburb have doctors like john la puma who serve as ethics 
consultants 
la puma the first graduate of the university of chicagos 
pritzker school of medicine with a fellowship in ethics is both a 
doctor and a teacher trying to balance the complexity of medical 
technology with patient care 
clinical medicine has within it a great deal of humanity that 
has been deemphasized with the development of technology its 
simply time for us to look back at our values of caring and balance 
them with those of curing he said 
in last weeks journal of the american medical association an 
issue that focused on medical ethics dr julia e connelly of the 
university of virginia reported on a study of 212 women and 68 men 
who visited a doctors office run by the school in charlottesville 
from november 1983 to july 1984 
eightyfour patients or 30 percent presented ethical problems 
ranging from refusing treatment to confidentiality and the cost of 
care 
la puma a hospital staff member does at least two 
consultations a week mostly triggered by doctors nurses lawyers 
or hospital administrators 
one involved evelyn jendrzejyk a 2yearold suffering from a 
rare fatal blood disorder who had been hospitalized 18 times since 
birth doctors wanted to use painful kidney dialysis and a machine 
to help evelyn breathe but her parents questioned the benefits 
i felt that each treatment should be evaluated for how much 
burden it caused the baby and the parents these parents take their 
job as parents very seriously said la puma who recommended 
against the machines he suggested a longterm care plan that would 
include simpler treatment involving the use of fluids with the 
goal of relieving evelyns pain 
so far evelyn hasnt needed the dialysis or mechanical 
ventilator she has gone home and is doing fine la puma said 
he definitely opened our eyes to all the options said her 
mother lisa jendrzejyk he was very thorough with us real 
understanding and supportive 
in another case a comatose 56yearold womans cirrhosis of the 
liver was complicated by stomach bleeding that required her to 
receive three pints of blood a day la puma declined to identify 
the woman 
relatives and doctors discussed discontinuing treatment she 
once said she didnt want to live without hope of recovery and 
because it was thought she might die her her daily transfusions in 
effect were a waste of blood 
although there was little medical research available on her 
prognosis la puma said i thought we should give her the benefit 
of the doubt 
treatment continued and the woman revived enough to leave her 
bed when the bleeding resumed she was able to tell doctors in 
writing that she wanted to continue treatment to spend time with 
her family she died a few days later 
you have to let patients tell you what the issues are la 
puma said out of the details of their own medical situation and 
their own values come the ethical issues that are important to 
them putting that all together medically and ethically makes a 
whole 
an ethics consultant helps clarify issues and also provides a 
lot of comfort for myself as a primary care physician said dr 
stuart goldman director of research and family practice at 
lutheran general 
in addition to medicines capacity to prolong life in a 
society where lawsuits are common lawsuits are less likely when an 
ethics committee has been consulted said dr david larson 
director of loma linda universitys center for christian bioethics 
in california its harder to demonstrate that a doctor has acted 
unprofessionally its the basic idea that two heads are better 
than one in a terminal situation 
consultants recommendations arent binding said dr henry 
perkins an assistant professor of medicine and ethics consultant 
at two teaching hospitals associated with the university of texas 
however in almost all the cases he consulted on during 1 years in 
1984 and 1985 doctors said it increased their confidence in 
caring for the patient 
la puma evaluated a formal ethics consultation service 
established in 1986 at the university of chicago hospitals and 
clinics he reported in jamas issue on ethics that 45 doctors 
requested consultations for 51 patients and that in 36 cases they 
found the consultation very important in patient care 
in 96 percent of the cases doctors indicated they planned to 
request an ethics consultation in the future 
years ago perkins said the family doctor often discussed 
ethical issues in patient care but technology has changed all 
that and he believes the need for ethics consultants especially 
those trained in medicine will grow 
not all ethics consultants are doctors many ethics committee 
members are philosophers theologians and social workers that 
raises other issues 
among them according to arthur l caplan director of the 
center for biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota who 
should be entitled to do this and what qualifications and training 
should they have what are the proper duties to give to someone who 
is an ethics consultant teaching troubleshooting or 
policymaking what is the job 
most of la pumas training is clinical but he studied social 
science health policy and medical arts history and took informal 
courses in law and ethics he also asks lawyers philosophers and 
others for advice 
the field is so new we actually should be talking about what 
makes up a good ethics consultation the battle over who should do 
it is a turf battle 
another unresolved issue is consultants legal responsibility 
said caplan i think down the road the courts are going to have 
to clarify their role 
many ethical debates now center around ending or withholding 
treatment but la puma believes as doctors develop guidelines that 
may be easier to resolve 
i think the big ethical issue of the 1990s is going to be 
medical indigents he said and what kind of care we provide 
for patients who cannot provide for themselves

10acre pond so visitors can watch feeder birds and waterfowl and 
listen to sounds piped in by microphones installed outside 
during allens lifetime he died in 1964 the laboratory 
gained international recognition but his continued connections 
with amateurs and volunteer conservationists were frowned upon by 
the new breed of professional ornithologists in response the 
university made the lab a separate department but without 
professors or course offerings and with no students of its own 
it was expected to support itself financially and generates 
money through dues and project fees sale of publications and bird 
recordings and homestudy courses in ornithology and bird 
photography 
membership dropped so low by 1980 that cornell seriously 
considered shutting down the lab walcott who earned a reputation 
as an educational promoter developing public television science 
shows like nova and 321 contact has boosted its 
membership from 2000 to 13000 in eight years and rejuventated its 
homestudy enrollment to about 9000 
now that we have become stable again we are turning our 
attention to our research efforts and producing a tremendous 
scientific archive he said of course all we do here has 
really one focus conservation the information we collect is 
highly useful as an environmental monitoring tool and we hope will 
serve as a biological early warning system 
its foremost study is in bioacoustics or bird communication 
with the help of computers we are making progress in finding out 
what birds say to each other and they do communicate said chris 
clark head of the program 
the research has led to similar efforts involving whales and 
elephants 
the labs 1yearold project feederwatch last year paid 4000 
backyard birdwatchers to fill out a computerized form twice weekly 
recording the species that appear at their feeders the goal this 
year is 10000 and walcott notes there are more than 82 million 
americans who put out food for wild birds 
we can only begin to guess at what we might have been able to 
accomplish if we had had this kind of information years ago he 
said how many extinct species we could have saved

the agriculture department has long advised 
prospective exporters to do their homework mind their manners and 
refrain from breaking cultural taboos if they want to sell american 
products overseas 
a private trade expert has given usda a hand in advising 
wouldbe exporters on how to behave such as not putting your 
drink on the desk of a london executive while chatting about 
business 
john w bing president of international training associates of 
princeton princeton nj said the british manager probably 
will refrain from calling the bobbies if you put a coffee or tea 
mug on his desk but after all it just isnt done 
bing talks about doing business overseas in a forthcoming issue 
of foreign agriculture magazine which is published by the 
departments foreign agricultural service 
leading off he recalls an old story about the cultural 
differences among americans germans french and russians 
in america everything is permitted that is not forbidden 
bing said in germany everything is forbidden that is not 
permitted in france everything is permitted even if it is 
forbidden and in russia everything is forbidden even if it is 
permitted 
bing noted however that in these days of glasnost or 
openness the soviet description probably should be updated to 
almost everything is forbidden even if it is permitted 
the serious side is that when people do business internationally 
they should learn not only about the legal financial and technical 
dimensions of dealing in the marketplace but also about the people 
with whom they are dealing 
you dont have to go native or lose your character to be a 
successful entrepreneur overseas bing said in fact you 
shouldnt but you do need to have the capacity to understand your 
customers needs your international partners concerns and your 
competitors strengths 
an important first step is to be accepted by foreign buyers 
he said in most countries doing business involves a higher 
level of trust than in the united states bing added 
that is probably because americans put their trust in the legal 
contract and in the courts 
perhaps thats why there are more lawyers in new jersey than 
there are in all of japan he said thats also why developing 
personal relationships with potential customers is so important 
some us food and agricultural products sell well in different 
foreign cultures without being changed however there are some 
that require modification 
cocacola has been successful in almost every country of the 
world and so have kelloggs corn flakes bing said but 
general mills had a hard time introducing cake mixes to england 
and campbells also was unable to launch their canned soups in 
european markets until they were reformulated to meet european 
tastes 
some advertising agencies may say a products message can be 
taken worldwide without changing it 
well almost bing said you might have to change the 
language and perhaps the medium from tv to billboards or to 
newspapers 
in many cases a nations culture determines what are perceived 
as desirable qualities of a product 
for example a study was made of what people in the united 
states great britain brazil and india saw as desirable attributes 
of toothpaste he said the results showed that us consumers 
preferred a refreshing taste the french wanted one that would kill 
germs the indians wanted it to appeal to children and the 
brazilians cared about its color and whether or not the tube 
squeezed easily 
in another instance the successful introduction of a 
pennsylvania dutchtype of cookie into japan followed market 
research showing that japanese consumers preferred a more glazed 
finish a smaller cookie with different spices and more elegant 
packaging 
the business person who launched this product in japan did his 
homework and his cookie is selling bing said 
different economic climates also can have an impact on a 
products pricing strategy 
for example if you are selling a product in brazil or another 
country with a rapid rate of inflation be prepared to change your 
prices monthly sometimes weekly bing said

video cassette recorders compact disc 
players camcorders and other consumer electronics products are 
becoming standard fare in the american home according to a gallup 
survey 
these products are no longer just symbols of an affluent singles 
lifestyle but are finding their way into the homes of families with 
children says the electronic industries associations consumer 
electronics group which commissioned the study 
people always think of these as yuppie products and theyre 
not said cynthia saraniti a spokeswoman for the electronics 
group 
the vcr is the fastest growing product in the 41billionayear 
consumer electronics industry she said the number of households 
with a vcr has been climbing at 10 percent to 12 percent a year and 
sales are expected to top 13 million this year she said 
the survey of 1008 adults found that 65 percent of the 
households polled had a vcr by household composition vcr 
ownership was 40 percent among single adults 63 percent among 
households of two or more adults and 78 percent among couples with 
children 
the survey was conducted by telephone last spring by the gallup 
organization the results have a sampling error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points 
the next most popular product was a pair of speakers for audio 
playback an item claimed by 40 percent of the households overall 
some 26 percent said they had an electronic typewriter 24 percent 
said they had a telephone answering machine 18 percent had a 
personal computer 14 percent had a compact disc player and 8 
percent had a camcorder according to the survey 
in all of the product categories the ownership percentages for 
couples with children were higher than for single adults 47 
percent compared with 25 percent for audio speakers 32 percent 
compared with 14 percent for electronic typewriters 24 percent 
compared with 18 percent for telephone answering machines 24 
percent compared with 8 percent for personal computers 15 percent 
compared with 10 percent for compact disc players and 13 percent 
compared with 3 percent for camcorders 
though the prices of most consumer electronics products have 
dropped since they were first introduced income is still a 
determining factor in purchases the higher a households income 
the more likely it is to have one of these products 
in households with income over 60000 a year 88 percent said 
they had a vcr compared with 49 percent of households earning 
under 20000 the survey found the disparity was more apparent 
with personal computers which were in 46 percent of the 
higherincome households compared with 10 percent of the 
lowerincome homes and camcorders 25 percent compared with 3 
percent 
portable stereo units known as boom boxes were the most 
popular audio equipment owned by 48 percent of those surveyed 
smaller radiotape players with headphones were owned by 40 percent 
nearly every household 99 percent had a television set 
according to the survey and predictably the more people in the 
household the more tv sets there are likely to be 
about half of the single adults said they had one set about a 
third had two sets and 14 percent reported three or more in 
households with children 43 percent had three or more tv sets 31 
percent had two and 26 percent had just one

the washington area has a labor shortage but 
it can be reduced by creation of support systems giving people more 
incentive and opportunity to work according to a study released 
monday 
the report from the greater washington research center cites 
strong growth in the areas private sector in part fueled by 
federal contracting as the reason for the regions booming economy 
and consequently low unemployment 
recent figures have put area unemployment at 27 percent 
described by economists as a frictional rate because most 
unemployed workers are in the processs of switching jobs rather 
than looking for them 
in addition to private sector growth the areas growing 
importance in hightech international and regional development is 
a strong impetus to local economic development according to author 
george grier 
washington is becoming the hub of an emerging megametropolis 
that has become identified as the chesapeake crescent which 
combines the economic power of the baltimore washington richmond 
and norfolknewport news areas grier said 
but it also faces problems recruiting workers grier says as 
housing costs increase and commuting distances lengthen grier says 
many people who might otherwise consider locating in the 
greater washington area find themselves priced out of the market 
he says 
making better use of resident resources could add up to 300000 
people to the current labor force grier says 
support systems to compensate for special needs such as 
flexible and parttime schedules could attract retired people who 
otherwise might not want to work according to the report 
in addition providing child care facilities would allow mothers 
on welfare and other nonworking mothers more freedom to work the 
study says

enzo ferrari italys greatest sports car 
builder and racing pioneer died at his home in modena his auto 
company announced today he was 90 
in a statement the company said enzo ferrari serenely ended 
his earthly life sunday aug 14 no cause of death was given 
but ferrari was known to suffer from a kidney disease 
at ferraris side when he died were his son piero and pieros 
wife floriana the statement said pieros mother lina who was 
not ferraris wife was also at the deathbed his wife had died in 
1978 
at ferraris request the announcement of his death was made 
after the private funeral rites and burial today in san cataldo 
near this northern city according to the ansa news agency 
the founder and chairman of the company that bears his name and 
makes luxury sports cars and formula one racers once dreamed of 
becoming an opera star or a sportswriter 
but his first love was automobiles and his drivers whipped the 
prancing black horse that decorates his bright red racing cars to 
victory on every major track in the world 
its true that i have never met any man whom i thought 
altogether resembled me but only because my faults are so 
enormous he wrote in his autobiography 
i have yet to meet anyone quite so stubborn as myself and 
animated by this overpowering passion that leaves me no time for 
thought or anything else i have in fact no interest in life 
outside racing cars he wrote i have never gone on a real 
trip never taken a holiday the best holiday for me is spent in my 
workshops when nearly everybody else is on vacation 
his factory in the town of maranello near modena turns out 
about 1300 cars a year hundreds of customers book the ferrari 
models years in advance and pay as much as 150000 and more for 
the cars 
born in february 1898 ferrari entered motor racing in 1919 and 
drove with the alfa romeo team for 11 years but he never became a 
great driver because of a fatal flaw he could not bear to ruin an 
engine to win a race 
ferrari founded his maranello auto works in 1946 letting other 
men win races in cars he produced 
at the time about 400 workers toiled painstakingly on the 
silvery engines some crankshafts were sculpted by hand out of 
steel each requiring more than 80 hours of work 
his drivers drove the racers to more than 4000 victories and 
the ferrari team picked up 13 world titles including nine in the 
formula one category since 1952 
ferrari was forced to reduce his business activities in february 
when he developed influenza 
last month a company spokesman confirmed that ferrari was being 
treated at home for kidney troubles and for ailments typical of 
his age 
ferrari was an avowed agnostic who made no secret of his 
aversion for the vatican which had criticized him for his stoic 
attitude toward the deaths of his drivers in fiery accidents on the 
track 
however in june pope john paul ii toured the companys plant 
took a spin in one of the sports cars and spoke by phone for five 
minutes with the bedridden ferrari

the government monday abolished the state 
tourism directorate and said major hotels restaurants and other 
facilities will be sold off or leased to the private sector 
a decree by the ruling revolution command council said the 
staterun assets to be privatized included seven major hotels in 
baghdad the warbattered southern port city of basra and the 
northern city of mosul including two sheratons 
the basra sheraton was damaged by shell and rocket fire during a 
major iranian offensive against basra in early 1987 in which some 
of the heaviest fighting in the nearly 8yearold gulf war took 
place 
mondays announcement came as iranian and iraqi leaders prepared 
to meet in geneva aug 25 for peace talks under united nations 
auspices 
the iraqi move to sell off its tourist facilities is part of 
president saddam husseins drive to develop his socialistrun 
countrys private sector by selling off stateowned assets to 
stimulate the economy badly battered by the war with neighboring 
iran 
no statistics were immediately available but tourism to iraq 
rich in archaeological sites dating back at least 6000 years has 
been badly affected by the conflict 
the hotels will still be run by their parent chains in 
accordance with an agreement signed with the iraqi government 
officials said 
but managers at the hotels said they did not yet know if the 
facilities will be sold to iraqs private sector or be handed over 
to their parent companies 
according to the rcc decision taken aug 2 but only announced 
monday those hotels which will not be sold will be leased for 25 
years to private companies 
the decree said a special commission will supervise the sale or 
lease of the stateowned utilities which also include a tourist 
complex in habaniya west of baghdad and several modern resort 
complexes in the northern mountains scene of heavy fighting in the 
war

months after white collar workers at harvard 
university voted to unionize a tense labor battle continues with 
the ivy league school being accused of unionbusting as its seeks 
to throw out the vote 
a national labor relations board administrative law judge was 
scheduled to open hearings today on harvards challenge of the may 
17 vote that created a 3300member union the hearings are 
expected to take two weeks 
harvard alleges that organizers used illegal tactics including 
intimidation of opponents and electioneering at the polls to win 
the election by 44 votes 1530 to 1486 
the university wants the agency to invalidate the election 
officials at the harvard union of clerical and technical workers 
deny the charges whats really going on here is we beat them 
and they know it and everybody knows it said kristine a 
rondeau an organizer 
our union is now a permanent part of harvard university and 
the only remaining question is whats the future relationship 
going to be peace or war harvards got to decide she said 
harvard administrator anne taylor who coordinated the 
universitys response to the union conceded that the school is 
in a difficult position because its a liberal institution 
and the administration of the university is not reflexively 
antiunion and would not like to be thought of as reflexively 
antiunion 
joel harmetz an administrative law judge from washington dc 
who is conducting the hearings is not likely to reach a decision 
until midautumn said joseph l kane supervisory examiner in the 
nlrbs boston office 
the union drive which began in 1975 was closely watched by 
national labor leaders as a bellwether for organizing whitecollar 
workers 
taylor said administrators believe there is strong evidence 
that union organizers acted improperly during the election 
she said the violations include the unions maintenance of 
lists on which they checked off voters their interrogation of 
voters as to how they voted the escorting of voters to the polls 
electioneering on the way to the polls and at the polls and the 
providing of things of value such as medical care and plane fares 
to get union supporters to vote 
rondeau said the union conducted a legitimate getoutthevote 
operation and nothing more 
theyre saying we were at the polls keeping lists and we were 
not she said theyre saying we were intimidating people 
thats incredible no matter how much you stretch it

peasants in southern china have cut down and 
stolen more than 10000 trees from a staterun forest since the 
beginning of the year an official newspaper said 
the legal daily said monday that illegal logging has been 
increasing at the wugong mountain forest in jiangxi province 
because forestry officials refuse to punish the peasants 
the report said in the past peasants used to sneak up the 
mountain and cut one or two trees down now it said they steal 
dozens of trees and even hundreds of trees at a time 
the peasants use the wood to build houses and for fuel 
on april 19 the paper said 2000 peasants from a nearby 
village looted more than 200 cubic yards of trees five days later 
peasants again entered the forest and cut down trees this time 
forestry guards were injured the paper said 
the report said the wugong mountain forest has 49444 acres of 
trees and is one of the countrys main producers of wood products 
the chinese press has said that illegal logging poses serious 
problems for the environment and the development of agriculture 
illegal logging quickens soil erosion and creates conditions where 
small amounts of rain can cause major floods 
last year 247100 acres of forests in china were destroyed by 
illegal logging and 91 million yuan or about 245 million in 
trees were stolen the china daily reported in march 
mondays report said the problem could not be solved in jiangxi 
province because officials there are too lenient

the government has announced it is extending 
an emergency inflationbusting program until nov 30 president 
miguel de la madrids last day in office 
a statement released by the presidents office sunday night said 
the government would maintain its 6monthold freeze on the peso 
currency exchange rate and prices for governmentregulated goods 
and services through the end of the administration 
the government said it would not increase the federal minimum 
wage also frozen since feb 29 but it said the national sales tax 
for processed foods and medicines as well as taxes on rents would 
be lowered in some cases to bolster workers real income 
implemented in december the first phase of the socalled 
economic solidarity pact between the government labor and business 
sectors expires aug 31 the new measures announced sunday go into 
effect sept 1 
what we have achieved with the economic solidarity pact is not 
artificial nor is it casual nor has it responded to immediate 
political objectives de la madrid said at a ceremony attended by 
members of his cabinet and the heads of leading business and labor 
organizations at the presidential residence 
the program was unveiled as mexicos inflation rate was soaring 
to a record 1592 percent in 1987 on aug 10 the central bank of 
mexico announced the pact had succeeded in bringing consumer prices 
down to a 17 percent increase in july the lowest monthly rise in 
seven years 
inflation for the first seven months of the year reached 433 
percent while the annual rate between july 1987 and july was 1223 
percent the central bank said 
the measures announced on sunday include 
prices for gasoline telephone service natural gas 
electricity and other goods and services sold by the government 
will remain stable 
the peso exchange rate with the us dollar will remain frozen 
the government will reduce its value added tax from six to zero 
percent on processed foods and medicines with retailers required 
to pass the savings on to consumers 
the daily minimum wage currently about 350 in the federal 
district of mexico city will remain frozen 
taxes on rents will be reduced for those workers earning less 
than four times the daily minimum wage 
by sept 1 retailers will be obliged to lower prices for their 
goods an average of 3 percent compared to prices in effect between 
july 7 and august 7 
de la madrid said the government would continue its attempts to 
alleviate shortages in certain goods such as meats that have 
appeared since the officially voluntary pact went into effect 
but he warned the government will not abandon the use of 
instruments and responsibilities of authority in necessary cases 
to enforce compliance with price guidelines the statement said 
the final objective of the fight against inflation is to reach 
rates of price increases similar to those of our principal trade 
partners de la madrid said 
the timing of the announcement was important for the president 
economists here agreed the government wanted to stop costly 
speculation that it planned to devalue the peso against the dollar 
on the controlled market last week the peso traded at 2241 to buy 
and 2273 to sell 
the announcement also provides two weeks lead time for reaction 
to subside before de la madrid gives his final state of the nation 
speech on sept 1 
the president is virtually certain to be replaced by carlos 
salinas de gortari his former planning and budget minister on 
dec 1 
the 3month extension of the minimum wage freeze and lowering of 
retail prices represented a compromise by both government and labor 
only saturday jorge sanchez president of the umbrella labor 
congress said his organization would not abide by a renewal of the 
pact unless the government either raised salaries to compensate for 
inflation since february or forced the private sector to reduce its 
retail prices 
sundays presidential statement quoted sanchez as saying the 
pacts second phase provided a greater protection for the real 
salary of the workers

the peabody coal co has laid off 
128 more employees from one of its operations in this st clair 
county community reducing the companys work force to only 32 
of the 128 workers laid off friday 50 were laid off 
indefinitely while the 78 others were offered new jobs or 
transfers to other peabody operations 
the layoffs bring to 540 the number of local workers eliminated 
in the past three years 
peabody coal a wholly owned subsidiary of peabody holding co 
operates 40 surface and underground mines in nine states 
another 85 administrative and clerical workers throughout the 
company were also laid off 
the latest layoffs occurred because of a reduced demand for 
highsulfur illinois coal said company spokesman ron greenfield 
large users of coal have continued to switch to other forms of 
energy such as nuclear energy or use lowersulfur coal from western 
or eastern states he said 
we have reduced the number of employees at the mine level over 
the past several years in response to the highly competitive market 
for coal company president howard w williams said friday in a 
statement 
the layoffs bring our support staff more in line with the 
current active mining employee levels within these operations he 
said 
further layoffs will depend on government regulation greenfield 
said 
highsulfur coal contributes pollutants to the air that need to 
be reduced in order to comply with federal clean air legislation 
he said 
further tightening of cleanair legislation will not help 
greenfield said 
in october 1985 peabody holding co laid off 100 management 
employees at what was then its st louis headquarters and 70 people 
in its illinois division which includes the fairview heights 
office 
the companys headquarters was moved in april 1986 to henderson 
ky 
a total of 151 miners were laid off at two bellevillearea mines 
in 1987 
the companys illinois division office is responsible for seven 
mines six in illinois with four in the belleville area and one 
in oklahoma 
at the end of 1987 those mines employed 2844 and produced 108 
million tons of coal greenfield said that was down from 4890 
employees and coal production of 16 million tons of coal from 15 
mines three years ago

critics of a new 500 million chicago garbage 
incineration and electrical generation plan are pointing out that 
other cities have canceled similar plans worth an estimated 4 
billion in the last 18 months 
the technology itself is a dog complained one critic brian 
lipsett of the citizens clearinghouse for hazardous waste 
despite uneven success with such garbage power plants including 
two already built in the city proponents say as many as 10 
incinerators would be built under the plan which also calls for 
the city to sell the steam and electricity produced to defray costs 
lipsett and other critics contend that garbage plants emit 
cancercausing chemicals and produce tons of ash laden with poisons 
such as lead and arsenic and that taxpayers routinely get burned 
because such incinerators run over budget break down repeatedly 
and fail to meet optimistic projections on how much revenue they 
will generate 
industry officials however counter by pointing to the success 
of a 288 million stateoftheart incinerator now operating in 
bridgeport conn that has helped that city avert a garbage crisis 
youll find success stories where projects have come in under 
budget and ahead of schedule and have operated as designed said 
jack lyman spokesman for the solid waste management association 
the us environmental protection agency says 140 municipal 
garbage incinerators are operating and that another 200 are planned 
chicago now buries about 85 percent of its garbage about three 
million tons annually in landfills about 13 percent is 
incinerated at chicagos one working plant on the northwest side 
and the remainder is recycled 
but with the illinois epa estimating landfills will be full by 
1991 the city has turned its attention to wastetoenergy plants 
the city plan calls for as much as 55 percent of chicagos waste 
to be burned by the year 2000 at between two and 10 plants 
depending on the size of each an 18month study already is 
underway to determine how to pay for those plants and where they 
should be located 
the city meanwhile has had mixed results with incinerators 
the northwest side facility has burned garbage 24 hours a day 
for 17 years consuming about 1000 tons a day and producing 
industrial steam thats sold to a candy company nearby for 1 
million a year 
but a second plant on the southwest side built at a cost of 27 
million was mothballed in 1979 after only 1 years of irregular 
service 
mayoral aide leroy bannister jr says the city has learned 
something from both and will put that knowledge to use when it 
moves forward with the new plan 
were not going to be reckless and support unproven 
technology he said

the copublishers of the martin county mercury 
have been ordered to pay the court costs incurred by their rival 
legal newspaper in a dispute over circulation 
attorneys john w kirk of lexington and leonard stayton of 
inez have been ordered to pay legal expenses exceeding 11000 for 
homer marcum publisher of the martin countian 
circuit judge nick frazier of paintsville also ruled that they 
must pay marcums costs if they appeal the order 
frazier said they must pay the legal bills because they 
continued to press the circulation case after it was settled in 
march 1987 kirk and stayton are the mercurys copublishers 
the continued litigation as set forth can only lead this court 
to believe that counsel for the mercury caused the martin countian 
to incur additional legal expenses for no valid reason other than 
to harass the plaintiff frazier said friday in his 39page 
decision the decision was the result of a hearing held last 
december 
the case began in february 1987 when martin fiscal court voted 
to designate the mercury as the countys legal newspaper based on 
figures presented by that newspaper the move took the countys 
legal business away from marcums feisty martin countian 
marcum called kirks circulation figures bogus and sued the 
next day in his ruling frazier said that the mercurys press run 
of 2800 included hundreds of papers given away free in kirks law 
offices in prestonsburg and hindman 
the martin countians circulation is about 4350 marcum said 
on march 13 1987 fiscal court voted 50 to reinstate the 
martin countian as the legal newspaper 
frazier ruled that even though the circulation dispute was 
settled when the magistrates reversed their decision kirk and 
stayton continued to press the case forcing marcum to incur 
additional legal costs for depositions and responding to motions 
frazier invoked a civil judicial procedure rule requiring 
attorneys who file socalled frivolous lawsuits or motions to pay 
for defendants legal expenses

a washingtonbased investor group today launched 
a tender offer for interco inc even though the apparel and 
furniture maker rejected the 269 billion bid a week ago 
the group which is led by the rales brothers is offering 70 a 
share in cash which values the company at 269 billion rales and 
their associates however already own about 87 percent of 
intercos 384 million common shares outstanding 
last week interco rejected the offer and took measures to 
strengthen its defenses against unwanted suitors including 
amending the companys antitakeover poison pill so that it 
takes effect if a suitor acquires 15 percent or more of the 
companys stock and makes a bid prohibitively expensive 
in addition interco said it was continuing to persue a 
restructuring plan that would include selling the companys 
faltering apparel operations and paying shareholders a special 
dividend

just a few months ago britains economic 
disease of rampant inflation skyhigh interest rates and 
persistent unemployment was pronounced cured y just about everyone 
except the conservative governments staunchest critics 
today the economy is suffering something of a relapse 
exhibiting that old familiar symptom higher inflation and the 
government admits it is troubling 
in addition a hike in interest rates and a sharp widening of 
the trade deficit are worrying economists 
ironically the symptoms cause is the economys vigorous 
growth which is stretching resources and driving up prices like 
its trading ally the united states britain faces the threat that 
its economy could overheat into recession 
the peak came in march when the treasurys top official 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced the first 
surplus budget in nearly 20 years and slashed the top income tax 
rate to 40 percent from 60 percent 
since then the attention has turned instead to britains annual 
inflation rate which fed by strong consumer spending has jumped 
from 35 percent to 46 percent in june in his budget speech 
lawson had forecast an inflation rate of 4 percent by the end of 
the year 
to combat higher inflation prime minister margaret thatchers 
no 1 economic priority the government has pushed interest rates 
up more than 3 percentage points since early june 
whatever action is necessary to keep inflation under control 
this government will take lawson told members of parliament in 
late july characterizing the pickup as modest but unacceptable 
strength in the dollar gave the government room to raise 
interest rates without pushing the british pound dangerously high 
but the pound which has been trading at about 320 west german 
marks remains well above a rate of 3 marks which the government 
long had protected 
the pound broke through that ceiling in march raising concerns 
that britains export competitiveness might be hurt indeed the 
trade deficit is much worse than lawson had forecast 
for the first six months of 1988 britain had a current account 
deficit of 56 billion pounds 96 billion compared with a 16 
billion pound 26 billion deficit in all of 1987 the current 
account includes invisible trade such as services and overseas 
investment earnings 
in his budget speech lawson had forecast a trade deficit of 4 
billion pounds 7 billion for all of 1988 
things have deteriorated said ian harwood an economist at 
the london investment firm warburg securities the major part of 
the reason for the deterioration has been the way the economy has 
been growing so much faster than expected 
david owen an economist with the london investment firm 
kleinwort grieveson ltd said domestic demand is just growing 
too quickly for its own good 
the latest survey conducted by the polling organization market 
and opinion research international showed that in july for the 
first time since february 1987 more people thought the state of 
the economy would get worse rather than better over the next year 
economists expect britains gross domestic product its total 
output of goods and services to grow between 35 percent and 4 
percent this year faster than the 3 percent forecast by lawson in 
march and following growth of 44 percent in 1987 
on top of the troubling symptoms there have been recurrent 
reports of a rift between mrs thatcher and lawson over currency 
exchange policy 
these have been fueled by the pounds rise and the governments 
negotiations with mrs thatchers former economic adviser sir alan 
walters for him to return to her downing street office next year 
mrs thatcher advocates freemarket policies while lawson favors 
managing exchange rates through direct intervention in the markets 
and the adjustment of interest rates 
however lawson survived a cabinet reshuffle by mrs thatcher in 
late july and now appears likely to remain until at least after 
next springs budget 
but the economic outlook remains worrying harwood said 
inflation will peak at 6 percent early next year interest rates 
might move higher into the double digits and the trade deficit 
probably will balloon to 10 billion pounds 172 billion in 1988 
harwood predicted 
the government remains upbeat 
the difficulties that beset us are difficulties we have 
successfully dealt with in the past and will do so again without 
drama and without interrupting the steady progress we have already 
achieved lawson said

thanks to a strong economy britains persistently 
high unemployment rate has fallen sharply but critics claim the 
government is massaging the figures to make them ook even better 
than they are 
opponents of prime minister margaret thatchers government agree 
that unemployment is down but say exaggeration in the degree of 
improvement is encouraging apathy toward the unemployed 
the jobless rate has been falling for two years reaching 84 
percent in june its lowest point in nearly seven years the 
department of employment says 
unemployment has fallen to 238 million people from a peak of 
115 percent or about 331 million in june 1986 
the decline is the fastest among major western industrialized 
nations the government says 
but the unemployment unit a private research and lobby 
organization says the rate would be 106 percent representing 
303 million people if the calculation method were the same as 
when the conservatives first came into power in 1979 
the british figures compare with a west german rate of 89 
percent in june which is unchanged from two years earlier and a 
french rate of 109 percent in may which is up from 107 percent 
two years before 
an employment department spokesman who requested anonymity 
said were still reasonably confident that it ours is an 
accurate measure of unemployment 
lawmaker michael meacher the opposition labor partys spokesman 
on unemployment said unemployment has indeed been going down 
over the last two years but only about half as fast as the 
government has been claiming 
peter kellner a columnist for the independent newspaper wrote 
if the calculations were done differently it is doubtful 
whether the government could claim or would receive anything like 
the credit that the media and the public now bestow upon it 
paul convery a director of the unemployment unit said britons 
have become a little bit anesthetized partly because they 
generally are feeling better off economically and partly because 
the government has scored several sizable propaganda victories 
national unemployment registers have been the source for 
unemployment statistics in all common market countries except 
spain portugal and greece the unemployment unit said 
in 1982 britain alone began basing its unemployment rate on the 
number claiming unemployment benefits rather than the number 
registered as unemployed it said 
since 1979 the government has made 22 changes in the way it 
measures joblessness all except one of which have reduced the 
official unemployment rate the unemployment unit said 
the government denies that it has made that many changes or that 
its alterations are designed to make the numbers look better 
in a recent monthly unemployment report the government said it 
began counting as employed those people who are in government 
training programs that reduced the unemployment rate by 01 
percent 
the unit said the government has removed from the unemployment 
benefit lists jobless men over age 60 who receive other kinds of 
benefits 
parttime workers whose numbers are increasing have always 
been counted as employed and many jobless married women arent 
eligible for unemployment benefits it said 
another way of measuring unemployment is to conduct surveys 
which ask adults questions about their employment status this 
method is used monthly in the united states 
in britain the government uses the method once a year and 
reveals the results a year later by the survey method britain had 
an unemployment rate of 107 percent in the spring of 1987 by the 
governments regular method the rate was 108 percent 
they are so close that it shows that our own measure is 
accurate the department spokesman said

the british government reported monday that retail sales rose 2 
percent in july and that industrial production fell 09 percent in 
june 
the figures sparked concern that a continuing boom in consumer 
demand coupled with capacity constraints in industry could further 
fuel inflationary pressures in the british economy dealers said 
that raised fears that british commercial banks base lending 
rate which has been increased seven times to 11 percent from 75 
percent in early june would be pushed up even higher

a west german scandal involving 
the use of illegal hormones to spur the growth of calves may spread 
to the netherlands and italy officials and news reports said 
monday 
discovery of the illegal hormone use has led to charges of an 
international hormone mafia and the arrest of a major veal 
producer in northwestern germany 
there is an illegal market for animal drugs that is causing 
mischief both within the european economic community and outside of 
it said klaus matthiesen agriculture minister for north 
rhinewestphalia 
the main substance at issue is testosterone the male hormone 
that is suspected of being a cancercausing agent in large doses 
authorities last week arrested veal producer felix hying of 
borken in the northwestern part of the country after discovering 
illegal hormone use hying was arrested on criminal charges of 
violating the countrys food and health laws that ban the use of 
hormones prosecutors say bernhard wigger another veal producer 
from the same area is suspected of using similar banned substances 
albert rentmeister a spokesman for the city of borken said 
wigger kept a thousand or more calves in the nearby netherlands 
siegfried martsch a spokesman for the environmentalist greens 
party in the affected state of north rhinewestphalia said 
there is a possibility wigger had business dealings with italy 
he did not reveal further details during a press conference in 
duesseldorf 
the hamburgbased der spiegel magazine and the westdeutsche 
rundfunk radio station of cologne said the hormones themselves came 
from the netherlands 
officials say they fear the scandal will grow 
matthiesen told reporters on sunday he is convinced there is an 
international hormone mafia behind the illegal use 
we have had many many indications not only in the last few 
days but also for several months that confirm this view the 
state minister said there are ties going beyond national 
boundaries 
west german offficials say its the largest hormone scandal in 
the countrys nearly 40year history 
the issue is particularly sensitive for west germans who are 
wary of food additives and similar substances 
health food firms also have been experiencing sharp growth in 
recent years while news accounts still chronicle the lingering 
effects of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident on the nations food 
supply 
matthiesen on friday ordered the confiscation of about 14000 
calves belonging to wigger because of the suspected use of 
testosterone 
testosterone is the principal male sex hormone and it is 
responsible for various male sex characteristics its use is banned 
throughout the european economic community 
wigger says that needle marks found on a sampling of his calves 
were only for routine immunizations 
also last week in a separate action north rhinewestphalia 
officials accused calf breeder hying of using testosterone on 
thousands of his calves 
officials ordered the slaughter of 4200 of hyings calves that 
tested postive for the hormone more than 10000 others were also 
being tested hying remained in jail monday afternoon pending 
further investigation 
local prosecutor klaus deupmann told reporters sunday that 500 
of the calves remained unaccounted for after several days of 
investigations 
we cant exclude the possibility that these calves have 
already been slaughtered prepared and have reached the markets 
deupmann added 
both wigger and hying have their businesses in towns located 
less than 10 kilometers six miles from the dutch border 
while experts say that testosterone is a suspected 
cancercausing agent west german scientists say that quantities of 
the substance found in the calves pose no danger to humans

fear of rising interest rates bedeviled the 
stock market again today and depressed the dow jones industrial 
average to the lowest closing level in nearly three months 
trading was extremely light which brokers called a reflection 
of slack summer business the extrordinarily hot weather and 
skepticism about the markets prospects in the aftermath of the 
sharp losses last week 
the sellers are just getting plain tired theyre just getting 
worn out said robert otoole manager of overthecounter 
trading at shearson lehman hutton inc in new york theres no 
bids 
strongerthanexpected industrial production figures released by 
the commerce department set the mood for the markets weakness by 
raising anxiety that the federal reserve will raise interest rates 
further to slow economic growth 
last week the feds hike in the discount rate from 6 percent to 
65 percent rattled the stock and bond markets and contributed to a 
8161point weekly drop in the dow average the biggest weekly 
decline since early spring

opec general secretary subroto said 
monday the persian gulf ceasefire should lower opec production by 
around 1 million barrels a day enabling the organization to solve 
its overproduction problem without drastic output cuts 
oil traders reacted skeptically to the statement and oil prices 
were little changed the september contract for west texas 
intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil rose 9 cents 
to 1561 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
subroto who is touring latin american oil producers said he 
will go to iran and iraq following the scheduled aug 20 ceasefire 
to try to convince the former enemies to accept equal production 
quotas as they end their eightyear war 
he said said the organization could opt for a new lower 
benchmark price of say 17 in its november regular meeting as 
an alternative to cutting production 
he added that the organizations price committee would meet 
sometime after the last week in august but before the nov 21 opec 
ministerial conference 
the outcome of the ceasefire is anyones guess but my 
opinion is that iran and iraq will be rational and what they will 
rationally want is higher prices to build their economies 
subroto told a press conference 
by bringing iraqs production to equal that of iran this will 
reduce opec production without reducing the temporary quota of 
anyone else with that policy we will be able to strengthen 
prices without a lower production level he said 
i will try my best to convince iran to accept parity said 
subroto who is the indonesian oil minister irans quota is 
2369000 barrels per day 
he said a parity agreement would at least reduce iraqs 
production by 600000 to 700000 barrels per day while an end to 
oil loans to iraq by its allies saudi arabia and kuwait could 
result in a total cutback of 1 million barrels 
he said he would visit both nations in the last week of august 
and would report the results of his talks to the opec price 
committee which would then meet prior to the organizations 
november regular conference 
he said opec might decide in november for a higher production 
level but at a lower price of say 17 per barrel 
what strategy we take depends on the regular conference 
he said opecs current target price is 18 per barrel although 
actual market prices are 14 to 15 a barrel

a group of 27 employees of drexel burnham 
lambert inc including top dealmaker michael milken owned a stake 
in the arbitrage firm of ivan f boesky beginning in 1984 
according to a published report monday 
the previously unknown financial tie raises questions of 
potential conflicts of interest for milken and drexel according to 
lawyers and wall street executives interviewed by the wall street 
journal 
from 1984 to 1986 when the drexel employee group held a stake 
in boeskys operation boesky was wall streets most powerful 
takeover speculator and traded in many stocks about which drexel 
had valuable inside information 
a spokesman for drexel said the drexel employees were only 
passive investors with no role in the operations boeskys firm 
the journal said the tie was revealed in public documents filed 
in washington dc and california private offering documents 
and people familiar with the relationship 
boesky was sentenced to three years in prison last december on a 
criminal charge stemming from the governments investigation into 
wrongdoing on wall street he previously agreed to pay a 100 
million penalty to settle a civil complaint of insider trading and 
was banished from the securities business 
the securities and exchange commission approved civil charges of 
securitieslaw violations against drexel milken and three other 
drexel employees but so far the charges have not been filed 
the charges are based largely on allegations of illegal dealings 
between boesky and drexel the journal said citing people familiar 
with the investigation 
the journal said people close to drexel say the drexel 
employees through a general partnership known as camro associates 
invested 1 million in the boesky firm seemala corp in 1984 and 
received 3 million for their stake in 1986 
camro was made up largely of employees of drexels junk bond 
operations in beverly hills calif the journal said 
a drexel spokesman steven anreder told the journal the 
investment was made over four years ago with the full knowledge and 
consent of drexel it was fully disclosed and the amount 
involved was only 1 percent of the equity of seemala based on 
book value 
anreder described the investment as strictly passive 
meaning the drexel investors were not involved in the business of 
seemala he said monday that fried frank harris shriver amp jacobson 
a law firm working for seemala proposed the investment for tax 
reasons 
leon silverman a lawyer for boesky declined comment monday 
after the drexel employee group sold its stake in boeskys 
arbitrage firm in 1986 drexel took its own stake in boeskys 
successor firm drexel sold 660 million in notes as part of 
boeskys effort to raise 1 billion in debt and equity for his new 
firm received 24 million in investment banking fees and invested 
5 million in the new firm

fear of rising interest rates bedeviled the 
stock market monday and depressed the dow jones industrial average 
to its lowest closing level in nearly three months 
the barometer of 30 bluechip stocks still wobbly from its 
8161point decline last week dropped 3325 to close at 200427 
the last time the dow average closed lower was may 27 when it 
finished at 195644 
broader market indicators also finished sharply lower 
you still have this global interest rate pressure said 
william king head trader at nikko securities co international in 
new york thats why the market got whacked 
the mood was set for the decline by a government report that 
july industrial production rose 08 percent double the june figure 
and much higher than market expectations 
the report raised fear that the federal reserves 
credittightening last week which jacked up interest rates to the 
highest level of the year wasnt sufficient to quell inflation 
pressures in the economy 
brokers said trading remained extremely sluggish reflecting a 
broad lack of interest in stocks by institutional investors that 
are the biggest influences in the market 
there are real heavy cash positions out there said thomas 
ianiro a partner on the trading desk at william blair amp co in 
chicago people are just waiting for all these news events 
a key event anticipated by many market participants was the june 
merchandise trade deficit figure scheduled for release by the 
commerce department before the market opened tuesday but there was 
a widespread view that whatever the deficit it was more likely to 
hurt stocks than help them 
a number vastly higher than the 109 billion shortfall in may 
could weaken the dollar and encourage a selloff in stocks some 
brokers argued conversely a sharply lower figure could also hurt 
stocks by reinforcing fears that the domestic economy is growing 
too fast 
declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4to1 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with

grain and soybean futures posted their strongest gains in a week 
monday in response to predictions that crops in the droughtweary 
corn belt would bake in tripledigit heat for most of this week 
on other markets most livestock and meat futures rose precious 
metals advanced energy futures were higher and stockindex 
futures retreated 
mondays midday weather forecasts coming on the heels of a hot 
mostly dry weekend in the midwest stoked fears of further damage 
to the crops and helped push most corn oat and soybean contracts 
up their permitted daily limits on the chicago board of trade 
meteorologists said the same weather pattern that had made the 
spring and early summer unseasonally warm and dry was 
reestablishing itself and intensifying promising at least several 
more days of searing heat in the midwest 
were going to have extreme heat right into thursday 100 to 
110 degrees in the corn belt said charles notis a private 
forecaster based in des moines iowa 
after the close the national weather service issued a 
sixto10day outlook predicting abovenormal temperatures but 
normal to abovenormal rainfall for the farm belt during the first 
five days of next week 
analysts said the soybean crop was nearing the end of its 
vulnerable flowering and podsetting stage a fourtosixweek 
period during which weather plays a crucial role in determining 
yields 
the hot weekend weather probably caused some deterioration of 
the soybean crop analysts said and the forecasts for similar 
weather this week likely means yields will fall further making 
contracts for future deliveries of soybeans more precious karlin 
said 
corn and oat futures soared their 10centsabushel daily limit 
soybeans were limited to moves of 30 cents a bushel expect for the 
limitless august contract which finished with a gain of more than 
38 cents

delivery in september at 392 a bushel corn was 7 cents to 10 
cents higher with september at 297 a bushel oats were 7 cents 
to 10 cents higher with september at 287 a bushel soybeans were 
27 cents to 38 cents higher with august at 887 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures finished mostly higher on the chicago 
mercantile exchange ahead of the agriculture departments monthly 
sevenstate cattleonfeed report 
the government reported cattle marketings during july were 4 
percent higher than the same month a year ago which surprised most 
analysts and prompted predictions of a sharply higher opening 
tuesday 
the number of cattle on feed aug 1 in the seven largest 
cattleproducing states was 2 percent larger than a year ago while 
2 percent fewer cattle were placed on feedlots in those states 
during july 
the high marketing number startled analysts most of whom had 
expected a decline the number meant there had been fewer 
droughtrelated sales of cattle to packing houses than analysts had 
believed said chuck levitt an analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc in chicago 
live cattle closed 07 cent to 45 cent higher with august at 
6960 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 115 cents 
higher with august at 8175 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent to 
57 cent higher with august at 4737 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 52 cent lower to 70 cent higher with august at 3365 
cents a pound

exchange in new york in response to the inflationary implications 
of higher prices for most other commodities said bernard savaiko 
an analyst in new york with painewebber inc 
gold settled 170 to 2 higher with august at 433 a troy 
ounce silver was 45 cents to 46 cents higher with september at

higher with september at 1561 a barrel heating oil was 23 cent 
to 41 cent higher with september at 4427 cents a gallon unleaded

the farm credit system on monday reported a 
profit for the second quarter continuing an improvement trend 
based on a reduction in its provision for loan losses 
the system said it had combined net income of 170 million for 
the quarter compared with a net loss of 46 million a year ago 
also contributing to the positive results were increased net 
interest income and a gain on the sales of certain properties 
the systems net interest income totaled 214 million compared 
with 110 million in the yearago period 
alan fass president and chief executive officer of the federal 
farm credit banks funding corp the financing arm of the farm 
credit system said improvements in net interest income resulted 
from increased reinstatements of nonaccrual loans to accrual status 
and from a modest decrease in the systems overall cost of debt 
when loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted 
for only as they come in rather than when they are due 
during the second quarter the system reported negative 
provisions for loan losses of 181 million compared with a 
negative provision of 10 million a year earlier 
in spite of the current drought the recent improvements in 
the agricultural economy continued throughout the second quarter 
resulting in stabilized loan collateral values and other 
improvements in the overall credit quality of the systems loan 
portfolio fass said 
he noted that while it is too early to assess the impact of the 
current drought on system institutions the system has been 
monitoring the drought very closely because of its potential impact 
on borrowers in certain parts of the country 
for the first six months the system reported net income of 336 
million compared with a loss of 201 million a year ago net 
interest income during the period totaled 360 million up from 
258 million a year ago 
during the second half the system reported negative provisions 
for loan losses of 341 million compared with a provision of 105 
million a year earlier 
the farm credit system consists of 37 borrowerowned banks and 
associations serving the rural economy congress put it on a more 
secure footing last year by authorizing the issuance of up to 4 
billion in governmentbacked lowinterest loans the 1987 
legislation by increasing confidence in the farm credit system 
made it possible to narrow the interestrate spreads on farm credit 
debt obligations over us treasury securities

a federal judge on monday dismissed lawsuit 
allegations that top media general corp officials had an 
obligation to consider an unsolicited merger offer from investor 
burt sugarman 
but us district judge richard l williams refused to throw out 
suit allegations that media general made misleading statements in a 
recent proxy fight and that its board of directors may have acted 
improperly in creating a twotiered stock structure that makes 
takeovers impossible without the consent of top management 
the allegations were contained in two lawsuits filed by 
stockholders against the richmondbased media company after 
sugarman made a 18 billion buyout offer for the companys class a 
stock in late february 
media general repeatedly rebuffed the overtures by sugarman who 
staged an unsuccessful proxy fight for three seats on the board of 
directors in may 
media general chairman d tennant bryan and his family own 71 
percent of the companys class b shares which control the election 
of the other six board members bryan has said the familys 
interest is not for sale 
sugarman failed in a lawsuit to get a ruling allowing a combined 
class a and b shareholders majority vote on the takeover offer 
and was critical of the companys twotier stock structure 
on monday williams told the plaintiffs in the shareholder suits 
that they should be prepared to show him at a sept 8 pretrial 
meeting that their cases should go to a jury 
for some time now the court has suspected that both were filed 
with the thought in mind that if sugarman was successful on his 
claims the other shareholders might reap a corresponding 
windfall the judge said 
stockholders harry m jasper of new york and sarah shields of 
florida filed one of the suits contending they paid too much for 
their media general stock because the price was inflated by 
incomplete or misleading statements by some of the companys top 
officers 
ms shields and jasper also claimed the bryans had a fiduciary 
duty to investigate and consider sugarmans merger plan and a later 
restructuring proposal 
but williams noted the bryans also are the principal 
stockholders in addition to being directors 
once the bryans as controlling shareholders had firmly 
rejected sugarmans offer the board of directors had practically 
no role to play with respect to the sugarman offer the judge 
said 
the bryans duty as directors does not obliterate their right 
as shareholders to sell or not to sell their stock as they 
choose said williams 
the second suit was filed by kenneth rosenthal who said the 
bryans as principal shareholders had a duty to other 
shareholders williams dimissed that part of rosenthals suit 
saying virginia law made no such requirement

some 1700 hospital service workers at 
seven hospitals overwhelmingly approved a twoyear contract monday 
while more than 2000 striking nurses from six of the same 
hospitals returned to the bargaining table 
despite ratification the agreement calls for members of local 
250 of the hospital and health care workers union to remain off the 
job until the california nurses association ratifies an accord 
but union leaders this weekend indicated it was not certain they 
would enforce that provision if the nurses dispute continues for 
more than a few days 
the service workers union reported 92 percent of its members 
voted for ratification of a contract which was reached in a 
60hour negotiating session under the auspices of mayor art agnos 
and a federal mediator 
the union said it struck a compromise over sick time and 
vacation days and eliminated plans by the hospitals to require 
workers to pay a share of the basic health insurance plan it also 
said the twoyear agreement restored fringe benefits for both 
fulltime and parttime workers 
on wages the licensed vocational nurses will get a 3 percent 
increase over two years going from 1205 an hour to 1240 an 
hour the technical classes will get 1225 by the end of the 
contract employees at the lower end of a twotier wage system will 
get 3 percent increases in each of the two years 
service and maintenance workers who account for 45 percent of 
union membership will get no raise but lumpsum bonuses of up to 
300 by the end of the pact 
it was the first strike for local 250 in 50 years 
talks between the affiliated hospitals management group and the 
california nurses association were renewed sunday also assisted by 
agnos and the mediator 
the service workers accord raised hopes for a quick end to the 
labor problems that have hobbled eight hospitals for nearly a month 
the major issues in the nurses strike which started aug 2 
include demands for big salary increases overtime pay for weekend 
work and staffing improvements the nurses object to a management 
demand for the right to impose 12hour workdays 
local 250s members include vocational nurses surgical and 
psychiatric technicians dietary workers janitors and housekeeping 
employees pay currently ranges from 790 an hour for lowertier 
housekeeping laundry and and food service workers and hospital 
aides to 1190 hourly for technicians and licensed vocational 
nurses 
within a day of the tentative agreement talks with the 
registered nurses began but eileen maloney a spokesman for agnos 
cautioned against hopes for an immediate settlement 
the average salary for a nurse working for one of the affiliated 
hospitals ranges between 30072 and 37692 for day shifts and 
34583 to 43346 for night shift nurses 
hospitals hit by the strike have employed nurses from around the 
country as replacements the replacements are being recruited with 
promises of hourly wages ranging between 20 and 25 an hour plus 
free air fare and accommodations while in san francisco 
the cna said the high cost of hiring replacements was applying 
great pressure on the hospitals to settle quickly 
the affiliated hospitals group represents childrens marshal 
hale mount zion st francis and st marys in san francisco and 
seton medical center in daly city nurses also are on strike at 
french hospital where talks are being held separately 
the service workers union are on strike at the same hospitals 
plus pacific presbyterian medical center where the registered 
nurses are not unionized

in a unique move aimed at fending off a 
possible hostile takeover by gaf corp which has been indicted on 
charges of stock manipulation cabot corp has adopted a defense 
designed to repel attacks by companies facing government 
investigation 
waynebased gaf asked the federal trade commission on aug 1 for 
antitrust clearance to raise its 49 percent stake in cabot a 
waltham massbased energy and chemicals company to as much as 25 
percent 
cabot responded by amending its antitakeover defense so it 
would be triggered if at least 15 percent of a companys common 
stock was held by a person targeted for government investigation or 
action 
once the poison pill was triggered cabot stockholders could 
buy more shares at half the market price making a hostile takeover 
prohibitively expensive 
a federal grand jury in manhattan indicted gaf and its 
vicechairman james t sherwin in july on charges they manipulated 
the price of union carbide common stock after an unsuccessful 
attempt to take over the larger company in 1986 
gaf and sherwin both pleaded innocent to the charges in the 
indictment which marked the first criminal charges against a us 
industrial enterprise stemming indirectly from revelations of ivan 
boesky the wall street felon at the center of the widespread 
insider trading scandal 
the indictment charged that gaf and sherwin attempted to create 
an artificial demand for carbide stock after gafs takeover attempt 
failed allegedly to allow gaf to sell its 10 percent stake at a 
better profit or a minimal loss 
cabots takeover defense which was designed by the new york law 
firm skadden arps slate meagher amp flom is considered possibly 
the first attempt to capitalize on wall streets insider trading 
scandal 
the idea could signal a trend as several other major takeover 
players are under investigation in the scandal 
it was not clear whether gaf actually intended to mount a 
takeover bid for cabot however telephone calls to the company 
seeking comment on monday night were not answered 
cabot has been considered by some analysts as a candidate for 
takeover or restructuring aimed at boosting its stock price cabot 
shares rose 3 to 37 a share monday on the new york stock 
exchange with some 27 million common shares outstanding cabot had 
a market value of about 999 million based on mondays closing 
price 
a gaf spokesman told the wall street journal over the weekend 
that we have no comment whatsoever with regard to cabots 
meanspirited response to our companys filing 
gaf first disclosed its stake in cabot in 1986 according to a 
company spokesman
