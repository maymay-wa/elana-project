the bush administration is pressing el 
salvadors president alfredo cristiani for progress on 
investigating the murders of six jesuit priests the white house 
said tuesday 
presidential chief of staff john sununu raised the matter with 
cristiani in a meeting monday in san jose costa rica where both 
were attending the presidential inauguration of rafael calderon 
said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
nine salvadoran military men have been accused of murdering the 
priests on nov 16 
sununu emphasized that this is a serious matter for the us 
that must be properly addressed and he said that prosecution of 
this case would have a significant impact in america fitzwater 
told reporters 
the spokesman said cristiani had asked for the meeting 
fitzwater did not say that us aid to el salvador would be cut 
if the salvadoran government fails to pursue the case but he did 
say that sununu underscored with cristiani the growing reluctance 
in congress to approve additional aid while the case is stalled 
secretary of state james a baker iii recently told a 
congressional committee that us assistance will be affected by 
how the case is handled 
the administration and everyone in america is concerned about 
the prosecution of the murders and that obviously would have an 
impact on american attitudes fitzwater said when asked whether 
the administration would back away from its request for 90 million 
in military aid for el salvador next year 
he said sununu and cristiani talked about the overall problems 
of the aid bill the overall attitude in congress and the status of 
the investigation 
a democratic congressional report this month said the 
investigation of the case has come to a virtual standstill due to a 
reluctance by the salvadoran government to implicate its military 
the state department said monday that the us embassy in san 
salvador is looking into reports that a log book and diary of one 
defendant col guillermo benavides is missing 
benavides has been accused of ordering the slayings of the 
jesuits who were accused by rightists of sympathizing with leftist 
salvadoran rebels 
columnists rowland evans and robert novak said in a column 
appearing in wednesday newspapers they had interviewed benavides 
for 2 hours and he denied all knowledge of the massacre saying 
it was a complete surprise to me 
three lieutenants accused in the case are among those who have 
accused benavides of ordering the killings they reportedly have 
said their orders came from benavides but there are now private 
reports from the high command that the lieutenants are withdrawing 
their accusations against him the columnists wrote 
benevides was quoted as saying two of the lieutenants had been 
under his command for only two days and he gave them no orders and 
all his orders to the third had to pass through the staff of the 
military school he commanded 
us officials trying to move the case along had encouraged 
the judge in the case to follow up such leads as the colonels log 
and diary boucher said 
the administration has avoided directly criticizing cristiani 
but the sununu meeting is evidence of increasing us pressure on 
him to make sure the investigation gets back on track and is 
successfully concluded 
we take him at his word that hes trying to prosecute this to 
the best of his ability fitzwater said adding in reference to 
the missing evidence there are these complicating matters

a highfashion show of french dolls wearing postwar 
couture outfits has been brought back from the united states after 
44 years in exile 
called le theatre de la mode the exhibition of 171 dolls in 
spectacular parisian settings will be presented thursday at the 
musee des arts de la mode in a wing of the louvre 
created by top couturiers and artists the exhibition created a 
sensation in 1945 in france then in england and the united states 
the following year 
with clothes by designers such as gres balenciaga and balmain 
and sets by the likes of jean cocteau the exhibit showed the world 
paris remained a fashion leader despite its wartime hardships 
having been lost for decades the dolls were traced to a 
museum in goldendale wash 
they were brought back to be refurbished and displayed thanks to 
a chance discovery and the perseverance of susan train parisbased 
editor of vogue magazine 
it was like a miracle said train who first heard in 1983 
that the doll collection was at the maryhill museum 
id heard about the beautiful dolls before but nobody seemed 
to know where they were said train 
then she was contacted by stanley garfinkel a history professor 
at kent state university in ohio who stumbled across the 
collection during research 
train consulted fashion industry leaders such as pierre berge 
president of yves saint laurent and jacques mouclier head of the 
chambre syndicale fashion guild 
everyone was excited by the discovery and we decided to have 
the show here if maryhill agreed said train traveling to 
goldendale she found many of the 27inchhigh dolls in good 
condition 
she won an agreement to let the dolls return to france 
temporarily 
after closing in paris on sept 9 the show will move in 
december to the costume institute of new yorks metropolitan museum 
before the dolls return to maryhill 
in 1992 they are scheduled to be shown in tokyo 
ive been living and breathing the dolls said train who 
enlisted the few original creators still alive to help reconstitute 
the 1945 show 
she also persuaded writers like former vogue editor edmonde 
charlesroux and historians garfinkel and herbert lottman to write 
chapters of an accompanying book 
of the postwar couturiers only mmes gres and carven are 
living but were lucky to have two of the original setmakers 
andre beaurepaire and jeandenis malcles said train 
before the show opened the museums workrooms and galleries 
bustled with artisans putting final touches on the dolls and 
12foothigh sets 
it was like an archaeological puzzle to put heads arms and 
legs together said train 
she pointed out a gown with a tulle drape and silk cord basque 
waist 
that was just a crumpled rag when we first saw it she said 
but nadine gasc a curator of the fashion museum figured out how 
the original looked 
the costumes ranged from tweed suits to satin ball gowns 
its amazing how the dolls began to get their personalities 
back when the experts started working on them train said 
every detail was perfect from gloves to platformsoled shoes 
every hair of the elaborate period coiffures was in place as styled 
by alexandre todays most famous hairdresser 
imagine going 40 years without a coiffeur said train 
miniature pins were used to curl the dolls locks 
conceived by robert ricci son of couturiere nina ricci working 
with lucien lelong head of the chambre syndicale the show was 
intended to raise money for french war victims 
it proved a brilliant success and stands today as a document of 
postwar fashion and art 
train said the exhibition ended up at maryhill after being kept 
in a san francisco department store following a museum show there 
moving the whole thing back to france was apparently too 
expensive so with french approval in 1952 it was sent to the 
maryhill 
the accompanying book due to appear in english in december 
fills in background about the period and its fashions 
nadine gascs chapter points out the nearmiracle of creating 
such a collection at a time when paris was exhausted by the 
occupation food was scarce not to mention couture materials 
the nazis tried several times to transport french couture 
lock stock and barrel to germany she said but finally an 
accord was reached whereby 60 houses could continue operating in 
france during the war with small allotments of fabric

rep tom mcmillen a former pro basketball 
player thinks congress should get involved in regulating money in 
college sports 
i think our national legislature has the right to be involved 
in looking at the imbalance between academics and athletics the 
maryland democrat told a national press club forum monday 
colleges and even high schools are neglecting their duty to 
provide athletes with a solid education said mcmillen a former 
rhodes scholar who played in the nba 
a bill he introduced last week would encourage high schools to 
require students in extracurricular activities to maintain a c 
average and reward schools with a 10 percent bonus in federal 
money if they stick to the standard 
but mcmillen stressed that problems at high schools reflect 
unbalanced college priorities especially in moneymaking sports

nato is at a critical phase as it struggles to 
adapt to change in europe and tries to make a partner in 
security out of the soviet union the alliances secretary 
general says 
we are looking at this alliance not as an instrument of 
confrontation but as an element of cooperation in a new security 
structure manfred woerner said monday 
speaking on the eve of the opening of a new round of nato 
meetings woerner also dismissed soviet suggestions that a unified 
germany become neutral or hold dual membership in both the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
neutrality is no alternative and to be a member of both pacts 
is just neutrality without a word the former west german defense 
minister said 
woerner was in washington for talks with us officials before 
flying today with defense secretary dick cheney to calgary canada 
to attend the spring session of natos nuclear planning group 
woerner said the alliance is at a decisive phase of its 
history as it attempts to adjust its military and political role 
to the changes in europe and its traditional foe the warsaw pact 
the alliance sees itself as fostering an element of 
cooperation in a new security structure for europe he said and 
nato will be one of the essential pillars if not the essential 
pillar in such a structure 
this structure must involve the soviet union and warsaw pact 
member countries he added 
clearly we are looking towards the soviet union as a partner 
in security and we want them to look at our alliance not as an 
antagonistic institution the secretary general said 
the nato nuclear planning group composed of the defense 
ministers from the alliances 16 member nations with the exceptions 
of iceland and france holds its formal sessions wednesday and 
thursday 
president bushs announcement on thursday that he was scrapping 
plans to modernize shortrange lance nuclear missiles in europe and 
to upgrade nuclear artillery shells was expected to be the prime 
topic at the session 
under intense pressure from the west germans nato agreed last 
year to postpone a decision on modernizing the aging lance 
missiles which are expected to become obsolete in the mid1990s 
the updated weapons designed to fall on east german soil 
were deemed politically impossible to deploy given the 
developments in eastern europe and the prospects for german 
unification 
woerner told reporters he expected the defense ministers to 
issue a statement of support for bushs initiative and to direct 
the supreme allied commander in europe us gen john galvin to 
undertake a comprehensive study of the alliances needs for nuclear 
weaponry 
the calgary meeting is just the opening session of a series 
of spring nato meetings that will pave the way for the expected 
summit of nato leaders to be held in early july woerner said 
he said the summit will most likely be held in london the 
first half of july but the dates are not yet set 
bush is scheduled to meet in washington with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev at the end of may 
at the summit session the allies must decide when and how they 
will address bushs call for eastwest talks on the future of 
shortrange nuclear weapons the presidents initiative left 
unaddressed the future of those shortrange weapons currently based 
in western europe 
galvins nuclear review also will include looking at the pacts 
airlaunched nuclear systems woerner said 
those systems are accepted by the public in west germany as a 
necessary part of belonging to the alliance woerner said adding 
that he didnt see an anguished debate within nato about their 
presence 
asked if he believed that nato would begin to destroy its older 
lance missiles unilaterally before negotiations on shortrange 
weapons woerner said that wasnt likely given the soviets great 
numerical advantage in such weaponry

executives of weight loss businesses say their 
ads claiming that people can shed obesity for slimness simply show 
the most encouraging examples of dieting 
but a congressman who has been investigating diet companies 
doesnt see it that way 
its high time some standards were put in place to do 
something about the rampantly misleading advertising in the 
field rep ron wyden dore said monday 
at a hearing of his house small business subcommittee wyden 
chided the executives for promising extensive weight loss in short 
time frames 
i am concerned with the nearobsession in the industry with 
fast fast fast when people should not go that route wyden 
said noting that rapid weight loss has been linked to health 
problems 
all the executives said no quick fix existed for obesity 
the claim to lose weight quickly can be a very appealing 
claim said peter berger president of weight watchers inc but 
there are recognized speed limits of one to two pounds a week 
berger defended a weight watchers ad that says dieters can lose 
three to five pounds the first week 
week one is an unusual week most people lose a lot of weight 
mostly a liquid loss berger said indicating that advertising is 
supposed to encourage 
we believe in slow and steady but too slow can be 
discouraging he said 
others who spoke included representatives of jenny craig 
international the diet center physicians weight loss centers 
nutrisystem optifast and medifast 
the session was one of a series that wydens subcommittee has 
held on diet programs which each year generate about 33 billion 
in revenue but are governed by few federal regulations 
wyden pulled out a diet center advertisement that said you 
can lose 10 pounds in two weeks be two sizes trimmer in three 
weeks 
that relates to the earlier weight loss people experience in 
the first weeks said jim liljenquist diet center senior vice 
president for corporate communications but this ad has been 
discontinued 
ellen destray vice president of jenny craig international said 
she expected reforms in diet company advertising as a result of 
wydens hearings 
slow weight loss employing nutritional eating habits with 
simple exercise was advocated by most of the group as the 
healthiest approach 
advocates of the faster results of liquid diets said their 
patients are supervised by doctors 
some of the weight loss professionals agreed that federal 
regulations should be developed others said the industry could 
police itself

six army inventory centers lost control of 
more than 328 million in payments to contractors and in some 
cases overpayments and errors in accounting went uncorrected for a 
year or more congressional investigators say 
the general accounting office in a study released monday said 
a review of selected payments showed the army did not take prompt 
action to collect millions of dollars in overpayments made to 
contractors and did not correct thousands of bookkeeping errors 
it said one yearold 28 million overpayment wasnt collected 
until it was brought to the attention of defense department 
personnel by the gao an investigative arm of congress 
in another instance the gao found that more than a year elapsed 
before the army detected a 307000 duplicate payment to a 
contractor the study said 
the report noted that the lack of accuracy tied up army funds 
which could be used to meet other army requirements if not 
collected promptly these overpayments can be considered 
interestfree loans to contractors and may be lost in case of 
contractor bankruptcy 
although army regulations require that immediate corrective 
action be taken to resolve such problems we found that in many 
cases the subordinate commands do not initiate followup actions for 
a year or more to resolve outstanding negative balances the 
study said 
the gao study involved a review of the army materiel commands 
control procedures over what is formally known as negative 
unliquidated obligations or ulos related to the purchases of 
supplies and equipment these result when the recorded expenditure 
exceeds the amount obligated the gao said 
the army materiel command has six subordinate commands 
nationwide through which it purchases stocks and distributes 
billions of dollars worth of supplies it performs this task for 
army units other military services and foreign governments 
as of last sept 30 records showed about 4500 negative ulo 
balances totaling 328 million the study said 
our analysis of the negative ulo balances totaling about 49 
million show that 47 of the balances valued at over 23 million 
were more than six months old the study said coordination 
problems between the commands and other department of defense 
organizations caused these delays in resolving the negative 
balances 
because regulations dont require the disclosure of such 
problems army headquarters personnel did not know the 
magnitude of the negative balances the report said 
most of the negative ulos occurred because a contractor 
was paid too much or information on an obligation payment or 
collection transaction was inaccurately or incompletely 
processed the study said 
of the 49 million in negative ulos we reviewed in detail 
76 million was caused by overpayments 238 million was due to 
processing errors and 27 million was related to other causes 
the study said in addition the causes for 18 million could not 
be determined 
also the study said the government employees responsible for 
making the overpayments to contractors are personally liable for 
any overpayments that are not covered unless the comptroller 
general who heads the gao relieves them of that liability 
the report said 
in its comment on the report defense department officials 
agreed that the reports findings were serious and that they 
reflect a systematic dod problem 
the department agreed to take remedial action along the lines 
recommended in the report

consumer prices rose a record 863 percent in 
third world countries last year spurred by a 350 percent rise in 
latin america the international monetary fund reports 
the united states the worlds largest economy was a little 
above the average of industrial countries at 48 percent 
among 22 industrial countries the rise was only 45 percent up 
from 34 percent in 1988 the imf said monday the increases ranged 
from 11 percent in the netherlands to 208 percent in iceland 
japan had 23 percent and west germany 28 percent 
the imf gets figures from its member countries but calculates 
them on its own basis to make them comparable so rates for 
individual nations sometimes differ from those published by 
governments themselves 
latin american average prices were heavily increased by runaway 
inflation in two of the areas most important countries argentina 
at 3079 percent and brazil at 1287 percent that meant argentine 
consumers were paying roughly 30 times as much for the same basket 
of goods at the end of 1989 as at the beginning of the year 
peru had an even higher rate 3398 percent 
mexico which adopted a strict austerity program dropped to 20 
percent from 114 percent in 1988 
the fund classifies 130 of its members as developing 
countries including those in eastern europe the soviet union 
does not belong and the fund gives no figures for it 
for its seven european members outside the industrial group the 
inflation rate rose in 1989 to an average 232 percent largely 
because of yugoslavias 1239 percent and polands 244 percent an 
imf official said polands inflation has dropped sharply this year 
because of the new nonmarxist governments shock program to shift 
away from communism toward a market system 
annual figures for africa and the middle east were incomplete 
many middle east countries have not been reporting in recent years 
among those that have israels inflation rate rose to 202 percent 
last year from 163 percent in 1988 and egypts climbed to 213 
percent from 177 percent a year earlier 
africas average appeared steady 189 percent in 1988 and 212 
percent in the third quarter of 1989 that average masked a wide 
range from zambias 186 percent inflation in october to small 
price reductions in several countries including chad togo and the 
central african republic 
only asias average showed a decline in the inflation rate for 
21 countries there the annual increase dropped to 102 percent last 
year from 118 percent in 1988 chinas rate declined to 163 
percent from 207 percent and india fell from 94 percent in 1988 
to an annual rate of 62 percent in the third quarter of 1989

students townspeople and some board 
members were wary when 198 japanese freshmen enrolled at tiny 
westmar college under a merger with a tokyo university but the 
cultural barriers are coming down fast 
cashstrapped westmar announced the agreement with teikyo 
university in march in return westmar got about 4 million to 
refurbish dormitories and buildings raise salaries add faculty 
and enroll up to 400 japanese 
it sounded like a lot of propaganda by the board of 
trustees said senior tom joaquin of denver they said the 
japanese would broaden our campus right weve had foreign 
students before and they mostly stay in their rooms 
but after the japanese arrival in april increased enrollment by 
more than a third to 566 students joaquins impressed 
its like a real school now he said 
theyre just like americans young and wild said cuong van 
lo a student from rock valley 
the japanese can read and write english but most do not speak 
well the new students are courteous and cheerful say american 
students and townspeople but conversations are lurching affairs 
that usually break down into gestures 
businesses in this town of 8200 also said there is a language 
barrier but japanese students have learned that money talks 
we didnt anticipate that theyd have much money when they 
arrived said dean carroll manager of the pamida discount 
department store but they had bucks burning holes in their 
wallets 
carroll said there isnt a mountain bike to be found in town 
after japanese students bought every one in stock 
i know we sold between 10 and 15 within four hours thats 
quite a few theyre the more expensive bikes anywhere from 120 
to 160 he said and i know coast to coast hardware is out of 
all 10speed bikes too 
to be honest i didnt think it would have the impact it has 
its like the backtoschool rush like in boom boxes they dont 
want the cheaper ones they want the ones with compact disks that 
run for 169 they dont worry about price carroll said 
he also said the new students created a run on toiletries 
stationery audio cassettes and disks even bottled water 
student hiroshi hayakawa said americans are more friendly than 
japanese and arent in such a rush 
many people say hi he said in japan people dont say 
hi they just pass 
to be friends with americans is a little difficult because 
of language barriers he said so we play sports join them with 
eating we make friends that way 
he also said he didnt miss the food from home i like pizza 
spaghetti hamburger 
westmar is one of four us schools to affiliate recently with 
teikyo whose president plans on spending 70 million to develop 
academic homes for japanse students overseas in 198889 there 
were about 24000 japanese students enrolled in the united states 
westmar jumped at teikyos offer of cash and students but the 
chairman of the board resigned over the quick decision other board 
members also complained and the united methodist church said it 
would review the 90000 it gives the school each year 
westmar has always lived on the financial edge as many 
private colleges do said valda embree vice president of 
institutional advancement what was so interesting about teikyo 
was the offer of students to go along with their gift 
students said they have heard the newcomers will be tough 
competitors one college staffer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said i feel sorry for the americans the japanese 
will eat them alive in the classroom 
marsha melnichak school spokeswoman said classes will be 
taught in english she quoted one professor as saying remember 
these students are studying in another language if they can still 
beat you then you should be worried 
by agreement with teikyo the japanese students will never 
outnumber the americans another 200 japanese will arrive next 
spring

the united states will bar the importation of 
looted peruvian archaeological treasures to shield them from the 
greed of us art dealers and collectors the bush administration 
says 
the import ban is the strongest action possible to assist peru 
in preserving its cultural heritage bruce s gelb director of 
the us information agency said at a news conference monday 
the ban targets artifacts of the moche culture being stolen by 
armed looters in perus sipan region the locale of intact 
precolombian tombs 
gelb said the archaeological sites are believed to be the 
richest tombs found in the western hemisphere 
he said an inquiry showed that the us market for art objects 
looted from the tombs of the moche culture in northern peru is so 
large it is encouraging looting in the region 
cesar atala the peruvian ambassador to the united states said 
the ban will help us avoid the enormous lure of the us market 
intricately crafted gold gilded copper and silver objects have 
been uncovered at the site 
michael h lane deputy commissioner of us customs compared 
the looting to narcotics trafficking 
we see the same techniques and the same motive greed as we 
see every day in the smuggling of narcotics lane said 
under the presidential order requested by peru artifacts from 
the region will be seized by customs agents and returned to peru 
unless the items are accompanied by an export permit issued by the 
peruvian government 
atala said the looting was preventing archaeologists from 
evaluating the material in its original location and from studying 
the moche culture its origins and its relationship to other 
precolombian cultures 
experts say the tombs discovered in 1987 have yielded 
important information about the civilization that inhabited the 
river valleys of northern peru from 100 to 700 ad 
lane said the ban would not be retroactive but moche objects 
already in the united states could be seized under other laws if 
they were shown to have been stolen 
the united states imposed emergency restrictions on monumental 
precolombian artifacts from el salvador in 1987 and on some andean 
textiles from bolivia last year similar requests from canada and 
guatemala are pending

andrew jacksons parrot shook up 
presidential functions with a foul mouth warren hardings pooch 
had his own chair in the cabinet room and the current first dog 
eats out of a china dog dish 
a new exhibit at the gerald r ford museum on presidents and 
their pets provides a rare glimpse into the private lives of first 
families 
this is a way for people to see the more personal human side 
of our presidents museum curator james kratsas said monday 
pets are something almost everyone can relate to 
personal attachments with animals date back to george 
washington said exhibit specialist jane isaacs the first 
president established a deer park at mount vernon and got rid of 
his foxhounds because they chased and frightened the graceful 
animals 
exotic birds seemed to be the popular presidential choice in the 
19th century both dolly madison and thomas jefferson had 
mockingbirds 
jackson gave his wife rachel an amazon parrot who learned to 
speak in english and spanish 
she was quite profane probably in both languages isaacs 
said of the bird named poll she behaved so badly at jacksons 
funeral in 1845 she had to be removed 
theodore roosevelts familys liked exotic animals the 
presidential menagerie included a badger bear cubs guinea pigs 
ponies and dogs the presidents daughter alice attended 
presidential functions with a green snake named emily spinach 
tucked inside her purse 
hardings attachment to his airedale laddie boy gave mans 
best friend a special status in the white house isaacs said 
laddie boy actually had his own chair in the cabinet room 
isaacs said 
also on display are current first dog millies china food bowl 
from air force one and the 25squarefoot doghouse a replica of 
the white house that ronald reagans pooch rex slept in 
one of the best known stories involving presidential pets 
occurred when lyndon johnson picked up his pair of beagles by the 
ears 
i call it the yelp heard round the country said isaacs 
who added that johnson was really very devoted to his pets 
johnson later became inseparable with a mutt that his daughter 
luci found at a texas gas station yuki slept with them and 
attended formal ceremonies isaacs said 
another great animal lover was calvin coolidge who allowed his 
white collie to attend news conferences entertain heads of state 
and sleep in his bedroom 
one of the few presidents to like cats coolidge once took to 
the radio to ask for help in finding his cat tiger who had run 
off as you might imagine everybody and his brother turned up 
with a gift cat isaacs said 
fords close companion golden retriever liberty proved her 
worthiness in helping manage the presidents time isaacs said 
when a guest was in the oval office and had overstayed his 
welcome he would give a signal and liberty would come over and 
start wagging her tail it provided a natural pause in the 
conversation and the president could move onto his next 
appointment isaacs said 
the exhibit runs through nov 4

an agriculture department analysis says 
eastern europes marketoriented drive toward greater livestock 
output could help boost us exports of highprotein meal 
but the departments economic research service also cautioned 
that there are some big question marks 
eastern europe is a proteindeficit region yet has a 
developed livestock sector that serves and established export 
market and supports high per capita meat consumption the agency 
reported monday 
led by poland east germany and romania the region is among the 
top five users of oilseed meal which includes meal from 
cottonseed rapeseed sunflowerseed and other sources 
the largest are the united states the european economic 
community the soviet union and china 
behind exporter optimism are expectations that widespread 
popular demands for improved living standards so evident in 
romania last december will force officials to increase protein 
imports the report said 
thus oilseed imports could rise modestly over the decade by 
about 3 percent annually from the 1 percent rate of the late 1980s 
but the report added that its uncertain whether political and 
economic reforms can stimulate significantly higher growth than 
that 
with or without economic reform the region still must service 
its sizable foreign debt the report said debt service 
requirements will constrain overall import growth as they have 
throughout the 1980s 
looking at poland the biggest user of oilseed meal in eastern 
europe the report said the countrys comparative advantage lies in 
expanded production of pork and other livestock products 
an increase in pork output depends on a significant 
improvement in feed rations the report said currently 
polands hog sector lags in every production indicator sows 
produce smaller litters than in the industrialized west piglets 
take longer to wean sows produce fewer litters per year hogs tend 
to be slaughtered at nine months instead of six months and the fat 
content is higher 
the report by usda economists robert cummings and nancy 
cochrane said polands shortcomings in swine production are 
largely a result of inadequate animal nutrition 
part of the protein need could be satisfied with polands 
large rapeseed crop but only if the poes are able to expand 
crushing capacity and expand cultivation of desirable varieties 
even so there will be a significant need for soybean meal 
but even if the optimistic estimates about eastern european meal 
needs are correct substantially larger sales of us soybean 
producers are not certain 
preference for soybean meal imports south american 
competition the fate of currency convertibility and the 
availability of export credit guarantees will determine the level 
of us sales the report said

former agriculture secretary john r block 
who is now a food industry executive says the recent earth day 
celebration was flawed 
the amount of national attention the whole event received was 
unbelievable he said it is very fashionable to be an 
environmentalist i guess we all want to be one 
but block said there was something wrong with the earth day 
celebration last month 
it was more like a wake with the environmental fringe filling 
the air with their own pollution of gloom block said a statement 
for example he said there were allegations that farmers are 
poisoning the land by using dangerous chemicals to produce food 
and that the worlds population stands on the brink of global 
famine 
block who is president of the nationalamerican wholesale 
grocers association was secretary of agriculture during most of 
the reagan administration 
the 20th anniversary of earth day was april 22 climaxing a week 
of activities to call attention to global environmental problems 
and urge their solution 
a celebration should have included a tribute to the american 
farmer the american food industry and american technology which 
has been able to keep the wolf away from the door all these 
years block said food in this country takes less than 13 
percent of disposable family income no other country in the world 
can claim the same 
one of the things that riled block was the praise of west 
germany over and over again for being the ideal environmental 
nation 
germany may be doing rather well in recycling bottles and 
papers he said but they use five times as much fertilizer per 
acre as we do and twice as much in other chemicals 
further he said the free enterprise marketdriven economy 
of the united states has left the communist centralplanned 
economies in europe choking in their own filthy air

the agriculture department says private 
exporting companies have sold the soviet union an additional 175 
million metric tons of us corn for delivery this year under a 
longterm supply agreement 
officials said monday 115 million tons were new sales while 
600000 tons were previously reported but were shifted from 
unknown destinations to the soviet union 
large sales are reported daily to usda by exporters who 
frequently list foreign destinations as unknown until final 
arrangements are made 
orders since oct 1 the beginning of the agreements new year 
now total more than 156 million tons of corn 33 million tons of 
wheat 342300 tons of soybeans and 12 million tons of soybean 
meal in addition sales of barley total 7300 tons 
in 198889 sales were a record of more than 217 million tons 
including more than 163 million tons of corn and nearly 54 
million tons of wheat 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 175 million tons 
of corn would be about 69 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 266 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usdas fiveday average thus the latest 
sale could have a farm value of about 184 million

a fundamentalist moslem guerrilla 
leader threatened to fight against any superpower deal to end the 
12yearold struggle to oust afghanistans promoscow government 
gulbuddin hekmatyar firebrand leader of hezbiislami or party 
of islam has vowed to launch a jihad or holy war if a dealis 
worked out at this months ussoviet summit in washington 
the afghan war is expected to figure prominently in talks 
beginning may 30 between president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the superpowers have agreed to prevent the formation of an 
islamic government in afghanistan said abdul qadir karyab who 
heads hekmatyars politicial committee 
we will not only continue our jihad on the battlefield but we 
also have other ways should the superpowers interfere in our 
internal affairs karyab told the associated press 
western diplomats and afghan experts in islamabad have hinted 
the superpowers are close to a deal but decline to give any 
specific details 
the likeliest scenario they said was have elections in 
afghanistan run jointly by the united nations and the organization 
of the islamic conference or by a neutral group chosen by the two 
organizations 
but they also warned it will be very difficult to find a 
political solution acceptable to both the rebels and the afghan 
government 
afghan president najibullah has refused to step down prior to 
elections a precondition set by even the most moderate guerrilla 
groups headquartered in pakistans rugged frontier city of peshawar 
the guerrillas have come under increasing pressure particularly 
from the united states to end their internal rivalries and devise 
a political settlement to the war 
but the seven guerrilla groups are deeply divided the president 
of the guerrillas selfproclaimed governmentinexile 
sibghatullah mojaddidi has branded hekmatyar a murderer and 
accused him of killing more innocent afghans than soviet or afghan 
soldiers 
karyab said the hezbiislami would consider imposing its will 
on the other guerrilla groups 
if they cant agree with our reasonable proposals we have our 
unreasonable ways he said refusing to elaborate 
hekmatyar is also feuding with burhanuddin rabbani leader of 
the powerful jamiatiislami or society of islam the two have 
traded threats and accusations of murder kidnapping and theft 
hekmatyar who is strongly antiwestern fought ferociously 
against the soviets and received the lions share of us military 
assistance during the 12yearold war 
karyab said washington now fears hekmatyars strength in 
afghanistan 
as far as i can see the united states has very dangerous 
plans including certain activity even terrorist acts against the 
hezbiislami leader karyab said 
the united states sends 500 million a year in aid to the 
guerrillas while the soviet union gives an estimated 5 billion a 
year to the kabul government

a woman charged with adultery after 
admitting at a divorce hearing that she had an affair has agreed to 
community service and counseling rather than face a trial 
donna e carroll 28 was charged under the states 
seldomenforced adultery law in july 
under an agreement signed monday she must perform 40 hours of 
community service and attend two months of parental counseling 
sessions for the charge to be dismissed 
defense attorney jay s moynihan said she entered into the 
agreement which does not represent an admission of guilt to avoid 
a trial 
mrs carroll a homemaker has been free on a 1000 bond and 
has moved to janesville with her 7yearold son their phone number 
is unlisted 
district attorney robert e eaton has refused to discuss the 
case 
mrs carroll was charged after admitting under oath at a divorce 
proceeding that she had an affair in february 1989 with a truck 
driver her husband befriended 
mrs carolls now former husband robert also admitted he had 
had an affair but prosecutors did not press adultery charges 
against him saying there was insufficient evidence to prove any 
violation occurred in wisconsin 
a courtappointed guardian for the couples son said last fall 
that carroll wanted to disqualify his wife for custody which she 
later won 
eaton has said the custody dispute played no part in his 
decision to prosecute mrs carroll 
the statute seldom enforced this century prohibits a married 
person from having sex with any person other than his or her 
spouse it carries up to two years in prison and 10000 in fines 
about two dozen other states including illinois have criminal 
laws against adultery but enforcement has virtually been 
nonexistent in recent years the penalties are as minor as a 10 
fine in maryland 
in court papers eaton argued the adultery law is still valid 
and is based on the interest of the state in the preservation of 
the marriage 
but moynihan and the american civil liberties union argued the 
law is unconstitutional they said it denies mrs carrolls rights 
to privacy and equal protection of the law and amounts to cruel and 
unusual punishment 
eunice edgar executive director of the wisconsin aclu said the 
organization will push for repeal of the statute 
the case indicates that couples who are in the throes of 
divorce and custody battles will often use whatever they can in the 
state law to inflict more harm and pain to each other ms edgar 
said

a 41yearold lawyer from a 
prominent political family takes over as president today in the 
long shadow of oscar arias who thrust this country into the global 
spotlight with his regional peace efforts 
incoming president rafael angel calderon acknowledges his 
predecessors international renown but says he will concentrate on 
internal affairs without giving short shrift to foreign policy 
arias spearheaded central american peace efforts that promoted 
democracy and sought an end to civil wars he won the 1987 nobel 
peace prize for drafting a regional peace plan 
though originally thrilled with arias fame many costa ricans 
have now come to feel that he gained it at their expense by 
ignoring domestic problems even so he leaves office with an 
approval rating of 90 percent according to national polls 
calderons party of social christian unity is slightly to the 
right of arias socialdemocratic national liberation party 
however the two men seem to basically think alike and calderon is 
expected to steer costa rica on the same course that has made it a 
democratic bulwark in latin america 
years of neutrality and stability have given costa ricans one of 
the higher living standards and literacy rates in the hemisphere 
the united states has long pointed to costa rica as an example of 
what countries can accomplish under democratic governments 
first lady barbara bush headed the us delegation attending 
todays inauguration which was being held in the national soccer 
stadium before 50000 spectators 
calderon says his administration will eliminate what the social 
christians call the ineffeciency and bureaucracy of a swollen 
public sector that eats heavily into the national budget 
but the new president whose father was a president and social 
reformer also advocates a broad profitsharing program for 
privatesector employees 
calderon had twice lost bids for the presidency in 1982 and 
1986 before narrowly defeating national liberation candidate 
carlos manuel castillo in february arias who was elected in 1986 
was barred by the constitution from running for reelection 
the quest for the presidency by calderon affectionately known 
as junior was made tougher by the reputation of his father

cuba now says it will jam radio marti 24 hours 
a day 
the action announced monday marked the latest escalation in the 
electronic war between cuba and the united states 
cuba began jamming the voice of america radio broadcasts during 
the predawn hours last month then started interfering with 
programming between 6 am and noon 
after the announcement that jamming would be carried out around 
the clock the voa issued a statement saying we deplore this 
action which is clearly designed to deny the cuban people access 
to uncensored information 
the jamming of the broadcasts began shortly after the agency 
started testing tv signals to cuba on march 27 cuba has jammed the 
tv tests each day since then 
the cuban government tolerated the radio marti broadcasts for 
five years but reacted sharply to the introduction of tv marti 
calling it a violation of national sovereignty and started jamming 
the longaccepted radio signals in addition to blocking the start 
of tv marti

police officers have begun riding with students 
on designated subway cars to protect the youngsters from being 
robbed or assaulted on the way home from school 
nine officers started riding on selected trains monday in a 
twomonth experiment involving five schools in brooklyn new york 
city has 1000 public schools and the subway free for students is 
often the only way to class 
principal jack m pollock of abraham lincoln high school in 
brooklyn suggested the program to stem the rise in gangrelated 
crime against students youths in groups of three or more carried 
out 159 robberies or assaults from jan 1 to march 13 on the 
subway police said 
there have been kids held up for jewelry sneakers thats 
been on the increase over the last few years especially with the 
rise in crack said bob terte spokesman for city schools 
juan charbonier 17 welcomed riding a car patrolled by a 
policeman he recalled being attacked by a gang two years ago 
i was on the train by myself and a posse of kids came on the 
train and tried to rob me tried to snuff me i pulled out a knife 
and sliced one of them the softspoken teenager said matter of 
factly then i never traveled by myself 
other youngsters also liked riding with an officer on the 
designated secondtolast car as they passed through brooklyn on a 
roughly 10mile section of a subway line at least one officer rode 
the train until nearly all the students had gotten off 
they keep us from getting into fights we associate with some 
of the cops said harold brunsen 16 
the program operates from 130 pm until rush hour begins about 
two hours later by then subway cars are more crowded offering 
safety adults can also board the cars designated for students 
sgt mike courtney in charge of a patrol area covering several 
stations said officers are enthusiastic about the idea mingling 
with officers will help students start to think of a policeman 
being a human being he said 
hey sarge one smiling teenager with schoolbooks said as 
she waved from across the platform at courtney 
at least one student 16yearold jamal james was not 
impressed i think its corny he said 
the program ran smoothly although courtney had to send one 
officer on the student detail to answer a crime call elsewhere in 
the subway system 
police said the subway has become more dangerous when school 
lets out because some youths in loosely knit gangs rob harass or 
pick fights with other students as innercity youths are known 
to do they may pull out a knife or a gun courtney said

nbc plans to offer a 24hour news service along 
the lines of cable news network to its affiliate stations 
the plan which would let affiliates use the service for their 
own broadcasts or when nbc is not broadcasting could put nbc in 
headtohead competition with cnn 51 of nbcs 208 affiliates also 
are affiliated with cnn 
nbc news president michael gartner said in a statement monday 
that many details have yet to be worked out the network hopes to 
unveil the service at the nbc affiliates annual convention june 
36 in washington 
the new service according to one published report could cost 
2 million to start and 8 million a year to run 
james r sefert chairman of the nbc affiliates board 
characterized the idea as an extension of an nbc service called 
anews which sends affiliates reports from nbc news and the 
networks affiliates 
he said he had seen no details of the plan but that based on nbc 
officials description i think its terrific however sefert 
president of cosmos broadcasting corp in greenville sc said he 
didnt know enough about the plan to say whether nbcaffiliated 
stations would approve 
we are still studying it cnn spokesman steve haworth said 
of nbcs plan but weve developed very strong relationships with 
220 broadcast affiliates over the 10 years that weve been in 
business 
were certainly confident that those relationships will 
persist 
michael j corken vice president and general manager of wthr in 
indianapolis and head of the news subcommittee of the nbc affiliate 
board said he doesnt know whether he would drop cnn if nbc came 
up with a similar service 
id have to look and see what the viability of the 
nbcproposed system would be he said 
nbc in 1985 tried to buy 51 percent of cnn but failed because of 
its insistence that nbc news have editorial control of any nbccnn 
operation that would result 
nbcs plan could become the first major network news push 
against cnn in the predawn hours since the early 1980s when there 
was the shortlived nbc news overnight and cbs news 
nightwatch 
nbcs service would be separate from the networks regular 
newscasts

the charred remnants of americas 
two worst space tragedies the 1967 apollo fire and the 1986 
challenger explosion will soon be united in an abandoned missile 
silo miles from any plaque or memorial 
the apollo capsule will be moved from nasas langley research 
center in hampton va where it has been in a shipping container 
for 23 years and buried atop the remains of the shuttle 
no ceremony is scheduled when the capsule its heat shield and 
31 cartons of hardware and investigative material arrive on a 
flatbed truck around may 20 no marker is planned 
its not as if by putting this in the silo we have forgotten 
the contribution these guys have made to the program there are 
memorials elsewhere said nasa spokesman mark hess we didnt 
think it was really appropriate that we do anything special or make 
some kind of a public event out of this 
people will remember regardless of what happens to the 
spacecraft remains hess said they will remember that as long as 
there is a space program he said 
the families of the apollo astronauts had no objections to the 
plan said john lawrence chief of congressional affairs for nasas 
office of space flight 
the agency never seriously considered putting the capsule or 
other material on display he said quite frankly everybody 
found the notion repugnant lawrence said 
derek elliott curator for the national air and space museum 
part of the smithsonian institution said he is interested in 
acquiring the burned capsule even though that seems unlikely at 
this point 
were not thinking in terms of display our job is to collect 
and preserve historic artifacts elliott said 
astronauts virgil gus grissom roger b chaffee and edward 
h white ii died on jan 27 1967 when fire engulfed the capsule 
during a countdown rehearsal for the first manned apollo mission 
the fire in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen was triggered 
by a spark when a broken or bruised wire beneath grissoms couch 
contacted metal 
after the accident the capsule and other remains were placed in 
a locked container at langley and surrounded by a chainlink fence 
until about 10 years ago the corrugated metal container was kept 
in a lowpressure nitrogen atmosphere to minimize corrosion the 
container has since developed small leaks 
nasa said it decided to move the more than 17600 pounds of 
material to the missile silo at cape canaveral air force station 
next to kennedy space center to avoid the necessary maintenance 
and to free up space at langley 
about half the silo which is 90 feet deep and 12 feet in 
diameter is filled with challenger debris challenger remains also 
fill another missile silo a quartermile away as well as an 
underground equipment room at each site 
the 215000 pounds of material salvaged from the jan 28 1986 
explosion which killed seven astronauts was lowered by crane into 
the waterproofed steel cylinders in 1987 each of the approximately 
5000 items was catalogued and their location noted for future 
retrieval 
nasa twice has gone into the silos to remove engine pieces for 
analysis 
a similar procedure will be followed with the apollo remains 
nasa wants the items accessible on the offchance that maybe 
there will be new investigative techniques developed or somebody 
claims it was sabotage lawrence said 
the two silos were used from 1961 through 1970 for minuteman 
missiles the air force which lent the deactivated silos to nasa 
uses the area for combat training 
about eight miles away also on air force property is the 
launch platform on which the apollo craft burned weeds fill the 
cracks in the brick and concrete pad 
a bronze plaque was attached to the platform last fall by a 
former volunteer at the nearby us air force space museum who was 
concerned by nasas failure to recognize the spot said museum 
historian ernest malnassy 
the plaque reads they gave their lives in service to their 
country in the ongoing exploration of humankinds final frontier 
remember them not for how they died but for those ideals for which 
they lived 
every year on jan 27 someone no one knows who places a 
wreath at the site

fifth trading day 
the dollar ended the day at 15805 yen up 025 yen from 
mondays close of 15780 yen after opening at 15815 yen it 
ranged between 15795 yen and 15825 yen 
on the stock market the 225share nikkei stock average at one 
point increased beyond 31000 points but retreated to finish at 
3097058 up just 1431 points or 005 percent from mondays 
close the nikkei gained 78263 points on monday 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a currency dealer with daiwa bank said 
crosstrading with european currencies especially the west german 
mark and swiss franc was the focus of foreign exchange activity 
theres been some speculative buying of the dollar in 
advance of the us treasury note and bond auction due to begin 
later tuesday in washington kinugasa said but theres not much 
happening with the yen and dollar crosstrading is the main 
action 
the treasury was scheduled to sell 105 billion in threeyear 
notes tuesday the first leg of its threepart 305 billion 
quarterly refunding 
the dollar is unlikely to keep rising because sooner or later 
investors will start selling it for profittaking said akiyoshi 
sakai a dealer with chemical bank in tokyo 
the mood on the stock market was basically optimistic for the 
short term according to chris schreiber a broker with new japan 
securities co 
theres a general feeling that the currency is pretty stable 
interest rates also seem stable so shortterm conditions look 
pretty sound 
but he added that a 005 percentage point reduction in brokerage 
commissions that took effect tuesday was encouraging small 
investors to take profits 
the lower commission makes it easier for individual investors 
to meet their profit targets schreiber said 
investors who trade small lots pay higher commissions now a 
maximum of 115 percent under tokyos fixedrate system 
in bond dealings the benchmark no 119 10year japanese 
government bond strengthened as of 3 pm it was listed at 8643 
points up from 8636 points monday the yield dropped to 7280 
points from mondays or 7295 percent 10year japanese government

an arrangement under which more than 
13000 contra rebels are to disarm and be given land to work 
parallels in some ways an earlier episode in 20thcentury 
nicaraguan history 
in 1932 a newly elected civilian government uneasily 
coexisting with a strong military struck a peace pact with 
recalcitrant guerrillas 
in exchange for laying down their weapons the rebels of the 
1920s and 30s were promised a huge cooperative where they could 
farm and live among their own augusto cesar sandino the general 
of free men who fought against the us occupation of nicaragua 
for five years had cut a deal with the elected government of 
president juan bautista sacasa 
sandino and his army of peasants were granted about a fourth of 
the country to farm 
resentful of the pact and suspicious of the rebel generals 
intentions gen anastasio somoza who headed the national guard 
created by the united states had sandino killed on feb 21 1934 
less than two years later somoza seized power starting a 
43year dynasty that ended on july 19 1979 when the guerrillas of 
the sandinista national liberation front named after sandino 
seized control of a popular uprising and ousted somozas son also 
named anastasio 
now the usbacked contra rebels have cut a deal with the new 
government of president violeta barrios de chamorro in exchange for 
giving up their arms in a process that was to begin today 
mrs chamorro elected feb 25 and inaugurated last month is 
struggling to bring peace to a country that has seen nine years of 
war between the contras and the leftist sandinistas who continue 
to control the army 
in exchange for disarming the contras most of whom are 
peasants are to receive land in southern nicaragua where they can 
settle 
the contras had refused to fulfill a previous accord to lay down 
their arms saying they wanted gen humberto ortega brother of 
former president daniel ortega and a leader of the sandinista 
revolution removed as commander in chief of the armed forces 
the latest accord reached last friday makes no mention of that 
demand 
mrs chamorros government in a transition of power agreement 
signed in march allowed the sandinistas to keep control of the 
army in exchange for depoliticizing the body 
she has said gen ortega will keep his post only temporarily 
in a gesture designed to show the civilian governments ultimate 
control of the armed forces mrs chamorro took over the post of 
defense minister herself 
contras and sandinistas both of whom understand military power 
far better than political accommodation remain suspicious of each 
other 
since mrs chamorros april 25 inauguration the contras have 
been gathering in security zones established on a rough northsouth 
line through central nicaragua

prosecutors have dropped the firstever 
charge of racketeering against a federal judge but robert aguilar 
still faces retrial on five charges 
us district judge louis bechtle on monday granted dismissal of 
the racketeering charge and another count against aguilar 
aguilar 59 remains charged with leaking a wiretap trying to 
deceive the grand jury and the fbi and conspiring to influence a 
fellow judge to grant favorable treatment to a felon the charges 
carry up to 25 years in prison 
bechtle also granted a defense request to delay the retrial from 
june 4 to august because of a foot injury incurred by aquilars 
chief attorney patrick halliman halliman needs medication that 
could affect his concentration 
bechtle did not rule on a defense request seeking government 
documents to support aguilars claim he is being prosecuted for his 
liberal rulings 
the jury at aguilars first trial acquitted the us district 
court judge march 19 of trying to influence a colleague in a felony 
case and deadlocked on seven other charges including use of his 
judgeship as a racketeering enterprise 
the justice department then moved to dismiss the racketeering 
charge saying the one charge on which aguilar was acquitted might 
have left a fatal gap in the pattern of racketeering activity 
alleged in the indictment

whose ouster sparked student boycotts and marches has accepted an 
undisclosed amount to leave early and drop his 10 million lawsuit 
against the school board 
norward roussell said monday that the amount of the settlement 
was close to what he would have received if his threeyear 
69500ayear contract had been renewed the contract was to have 
run out june 30 
he said the settlement would be effective when i get the 
money 
in announcing his resignation he cited the stress of the 
turmoil since the whitemajority board voted in december not to 
renew his contract the move sparked nearcontinuous protests by 
blacks including a 5week sitin at city hall 
roussell had sued the city and the board claiming racial 
discrimination the board said it dismissed him because of a 
dictatorial management style 
people are protesting because they want quality education for 
their children roussell said in a telephone interview this 
protest has never been about me it is not something i asked people 
to do 
a leader of the continuing protests dallas county commissioner

guide black students into lowerlevel classes regardless of their 
ability in his lawsuit roussell said his attempt to revise the 
tracking system prompted his removal 
school board member dick bean who is white said roussells 
resignation could allow the boards racial split to begin healing

shiites imprisoned by an israelibacked militia 
in lebanon will not be traded for western hostages unless efforts 
are made to include freedom for militiamen and israeli soldiers in 
the deal the militias commander says 
the remarks by gen antoine lahad of the south lebanon army come 
as washington steps up pressure on israel to free arab detainees to 
help win freedom for six americans and 10 other westerners held by 
shiite moslem extremists in lebanon 
lahads remarks monday appeared to reflect a hard line by israel 
toward any deal that excluded its own captives 
i want to make clear that i cannot release anybody 
just because of the foreigners lahad said in an interview on 
middle east television there is no way i can release my 
prisoners unless there are negotiations to release sla and israeli 
captives 
lahad holds 300 arab detainees most of them shiite moslems at 
a jail two miles southeast of his headquarters in marjayoun 
shiite extremist groups have demanded the release of detainees 
held by lahad and israel an iranian newspaper suggested last week 
that good will gestures by israel would encourage the release of 
additional western hostages two americans were freed last month 
lahad also told the television network that he has temporarily 
stopped freeing prisoners for moslem holidays to quell rumors that 
such moves were part of a package deal to release western hostages 
when the publicity dies down lahad will resume the customary 
prisoner release on moslem holidays the network quoted him as 
saying 
sources close to lahads 2500member south lebanon army which 
gets training and supplies from israel said eight of his fighters 
are held by shiite groups 
israel meanwhile reiterated that it is not opposed to a swap 
in principle but that such an exchange should include three 
israeli servicemen captured in lebanon in 1986 and believed held by 
radical shiites linked to the proiranian hezbollah militia 
it is our stated policy that we are ready to contemplate an 
exchange for the israeli prisoners who are held by those 
organizations said avi pazner a spokesman for israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir 
he denied there was any direct us pressure on israel to make 
prisoner releases exclusively on behalf of western hostages 
israels most prominent prisoner is sheikh abdulkarim obeid a 
shiite moslem cleric obeid and two assistants were abducted by 
israel in july 
israel also holds 9986 palestinians detained during the 
29month uprising against the israeli occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip

this university town has named a 
commissioner to oversee the welfare of some 60000 animals used in 
experiments here each year 
dr stuart wiles was named monday to the position of 
commissioner of laboratory animals established by the city council 
in june as part of the nations first city ordinance to protect 
animals used for research 
wiles a veterinarian will monitor harvard university the 
massachusetts institute of technology and about a dozen other 
academic and private firms that do about some 100 million per year 
in animal research 
this will keep scientists honest said gul agha who 
initiated the legislation four years ago when he was a researcher 
at mit 
its an excellent precedent because we have two of the most 
prestigious institutions in the country accepting accountability to 
the public agha who teaches computer science at the university 
of chicago at urbana said in a telephone interview 
the ordinance which covers all nonhuman vertebrates defines 
an experiment as any procedure a research institution conducts on a 
live animal institutions covered include schools colleges and 
diagnostic laboratories 
federal law covers dogs cats and monkeys but not reptiles 
amphibians mice rats and rabbits 
wiles job will be to ensure that researchers provide proper 
ventilation nourishment and other care to lab animals 
the commissioner has the right to make unannounced visits to 
research sites report infractions to the city manager conduct 
hearings and impose fines of 300 per day per violation 
there are a great many people concerned about the welfare of 
animals wiles said but its important to regulate not 
overregulate or place an unfair burden on the researchers

the news from biologists that record flooding over 
the past two weeks is likely to produce a bumper crop of mosquitoes 
has been particularly unsettling to one group of texans nudists 
claudia adcock manager of the ponderosa ranch nudist colony 
near wills point said her camp is putting up bird houses to lure 
purple martins which eat mosquitos like nobodys business 
officials said pests such as mosquitoes fleas and fire ants 
will be plentiful because of the moisture this spring from the 
worst flooding since 1908 
spring is a particularly tough time for nudists anyway because 
many people are venturing out into the sun for the first time all 
year 
to protect novice nudists ponderosa keeps an ample supply of 
insect repellent sunburn ointment poisonivy lotion and other 
skininjury remedies 
sunburn is our biggest problem with newcomers ms adcock 
said if your butt aint seen daylight before you dont have any 
idea how quickly its going to burn

brian wilson of the beach boys crashed a 
news conference called by cousin stanley love as love was about to 
announce his intention to become legal overseer of the musicians 
estate and life 
wilson 48 took the microphone at the greater los angeles press 
club on monday and declared he was fit to handle his own affairs 
he dismissed allegations that therapist eugene landy controls his 
every move 
i have heard of the charges by stan love and i think theyre 
outrageous said wilson 
wilson had just been served with a petition to appear at a june 
22 conservatorship hearing in superior court said loves 
spokesman warren duffy 
love brother of beach boy mike love said landy abused his role 
as therapist by taking control of wilsons finances and other 
aspects of the singers life landy generated controversy and lost 
his psychology license after beginning a 24hour treatment program 
for wilson 
wilson has credited landy with helping him beat his drug and 
alcohol addiction slim down from more than 300 pounds and return 
to a music career that featured the release of an acclaimed solo 
record last year 
love though said he had taken care of wilson for four years in 
the late 1970s and believes landy has improperly treated wilson he 
said wilson suffers from schizophrenia and an adaptive disorder 
if brian went to the store and gave the checker a 100 bill 
for a 2 item and the checker said may i keep the 98 bucks 
brian would say sure thats brians problem the whole time 
whether its the high level of la or whether its just a clerk at 
the store said love a former los angeles laker 
wilson who is producing his second solo album denied he is 
some sort of puppet 
i see who i want to see when i want to see them and i am 
totally in charge of my whole life he said

two colombians claiming to represent the 
medellin cartel offered 6 million in cocaine proceeds for stinger 
missiles and other weapons for use against aircraft carrying 
colombian officials the fbi says 
the two defendants ordered 120 of the shoulderfired 
groundtoair missiles fbi agent charles a salemme testified at a 
hearing monday 
the men who claimed to work for reputed cartel kingpin pablo 
escobar told undercover agents they were willing to pay 5 million 
from the sale of a halfton or more of cocaine for the missiles 50 
automatic rifles and a plane to carry them salemme said 
an additional 1 million would be paid to those who would steal 
the weapons from the military salemme told us magistrate thomas 
wilson in tampa 
instead of getting the stingers the men were arrested 
alfredo antonio ramostinoco 47 and luis fernando 
arcilagiraldo 28 were ordered held without bail on charges of 
conspiracy to receive stolen property and export arms illegally 
they were also charged with drug trafficking 
no cash or weapons ever changed hands in the deal the latest of 
several attempts by drug traffickers to obtain stingers 
authorities said federal officials say none of the earlier 
negotiations had gone as far as the deal foiled saturday 
the colombians said the weapons were intended to show the 
colombian government it was getting too close to the drug cartel 
officials said they planned to use the missiles to shoot down 
government helicopters in colombia investigators said 
fbi officials said a stinger on the legitimate arms market costs 
about 14000 the 4foot 35pound missile uses an infrared homing 
device to target the heat generated by the engine of a plane or 
helicopter 
allen mccreight head of the fbis tampa office said it was not 
known whether the negotiations for the weapons were directed by 
escobar 
violence linked to colombias drug lords has claimed the lives 
of three presidential candidates in that country in the past year

the massive outpouring of molten rock 
from kilauea volcano has come to a temporary halt as a lava flow 
that has burned its way through much of this coastal community 
finally reached the ocean 
officials are keeping a close watch on acid formed when the lava 
hits the ocean hot lava mixing with salt water produces steam 
clouds known as lazethat contain hydrochloric acid and other 
hazardous chemicals 
trade winds are blowing the gas out to sea said bruce butts 
deputy administrator of hawaii county civil defense 
the flow entered the ocean just west of harry k brown state 
park about a quartermile north of the town butts said 
before it stopped at noon monday the lava had been gushing from 
the kupaianaha opening of the volcano at a rate of 650000 cubic 
yards a day feeding the 8milelong lava flow that has destroyed 
61 homes in this community since april 4 
geologists said they do not know whether the halt in the lava 
flow signals the end of kilaueas eruption that began jan 3 1983 
if it holds true to form itll be only a pause said reggie 
okamura of the us geological surveys hawaiian volcano 
observatory 
instruments monitoring the vent or volcano opening and the 
earlier primary pui oo vent show continued tremor indicating 
molten rock is continuing to move in the vent system okamura said

texaco began skimming more than 37000 
gallons of oil that spilled into the gulf of mexico after it shut a 
pipeline suspected of leaking 
the company sent a skimmer to clean the area and requested two 
more although texaco said it had not determined the cause or who 
was responsible for the leak 
lets just say theres oil in the gulf at this time we dont 
know if its ours or not said texaco spokesman max hebert 
coast guard cmdr dave beach said the leak was discovered sunday 
morning near eugene island about 100 miles off the louisiana 
coast by monday afternoon the coast guard estimated that 37800 
gallons of oil had leaked into the gulf 
initial indications were that the leak may have occurred in a 
pipeline serving 36 drilling platforms in the congested area 
texaco said the pipeline is operated by texaco and is owned by 
marathon exxon mobil texaco chevron and conoco 
divers were investigating the 20inch pipeline to try to 
pinpoint the source of the leak 
seas were moderate in the area monday and the oil was expected 
to disperse in the open gulf texaco said 
the latest report we got late monday evening was that the 
three heaviest brown patches had decreased in size mainly into 
three streaks covering an area roughly eight by 22 miles beach 
said 
basically its spreading out into a lighter sheen and theres 
a lot less heavy oil showing he said 
after testing all pipelines and platforms in the area the 
eugene island pipeline system was shut down at about 1 am monday 
texaco said 
at this stage its still in the minor category said beach 
if everyone has shut down as requested all youre going to get 
from now on is just a minor amount of oil coming from the line 
texaco had notified the companies using the oil line to suspend 
operation by monday officials said

seeking support from western europe for his white governments 
efforts to bring the black majority into the south african 
political system 
de klerk plans to leave today on a tour of nine nations in 
western europe which south african officials call the most 
important foreign trip by a south african leader in decades it 
also is an important test of south africas bid to end its 
international isolation 
the governments hopes of improving its foreign standing after 
years of sanctions were boosted after it reached an agreement last 
week with the african national congress the leading antiapartheid 
group after their first talks the two sides agreed to work 
together to end political violence and clear the way for full 
constitutional talks on ending whiteminority rule 
it is the accord reached last week which the world will 
see as progress towards a new democratic south africa said one 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in a sign of a new willingness to deal with south africa french 
president francois mitterrand who has shunned south african 
leaders in the past will now hold talks with de klerk de klerk 
will also see british prime minister margaret thatcher king juan 
carlos of spain and many presidents and prime ministers 
he begins his trip in france and then goes on to belgium italy 
west germany britain spain switzerland greece and portugal the 
ministry of foreign affairs said it is the most extensive trip by a 
south african head of state since the governing national party came 
to power in 1948 
south african political analysts say the most important aspect 
of the trip is de klerks hope of easing south africas diplomatic 
and political isolation de klerk who has launched major reforms 
to end the apartheid system of racial separation will explain his 
policies to european governments 
de klerk will also be looking for support for his political 
plans west european nations have been an important source of aid 
and support for the african national congress which de klerk hopes 
will help to control more radical black elements that oppose any 
peaceful agreement with the white government 
de klerk is also expected to ask european nations to ease or end 
sanctions imposed against his country to protest apartheid 
sanctions have hurt the south african economy 
while de klerk has little hope of persuading european nations to 
curtail sanctions he may lay the groundwork for an easing of 
sanctions in the future

ferdinand and imelda marcos to launder money stolen from their 
country has been turned over to the philippine government 
the bank estimated by a defense attorney to be worth 20 
million to 30 million was transferred monday in a significant 
victory for the government of president corazon aquino 
the philippines is trying to recover more than 220 million 
allegedly embezzled by the marcoses from the countrys treasury 
during marcos 20 years in power 
a newspaper reported today that the marcoses doled out about 
85 million to politicians reporters and others in the last 100 
days of the philippine dictators regime in a desperate attempt to 
retain power 
an accused political assassin who received about 50000 was 
among dozens of cash recipients during the spending spree 
according to a palace ledger the los angeles times said it obtained 
a copy of 
the transfer of all shares in the california overseas bank to 
the manila government was part of a march 16 plea bargain in 
federal court where mrs marcos is on trial the bank had pleaded 
guilty to wire fraud 
the bank was owned by robert s benedicto a onetime marcos 
crony whom prosecutors charged with conspiring to help marcos shift 
stolen money to secret swiss accounts and other personal uses 
mrs marcos is alleged to have participated with her husband in 
the embezzlement using the money to live in luxury and invest in 
new york real estate codefendant adnan khashoggi the saudi 
financer is accused of helping the marcoses conceal ownership of 
the new york properties 
marcos was indicted with his wife but died in exile in hawaii in 
september 
benedicto also indicted and listed as a fugitive by the court 
was dropped from the case as part of the plea bargain 
two former officials of the bank testified last week that 
benedicto had said he bought the institution for 7 million in 1976 
because marcos needed the bank and that he had personally 
managed several accounts whose owners were known only to himself 
prosecutors said the accounts belonged to the marcoses and were 
used to launder money being funneled to other accounts to buy a 
manhattan office building and mrs marcos jewelry and to provide 
two marcos children with 10000amonth allowances 
the register of cash expenses disclosed by the los angeles times 
made no apparent reference to the expenses related to her trial in 
new york but showed that mrs marcos gave generous gifts to 
members of the national press corps during her husbands 1986 
presidential campaign against mrs aquino 
those gifts included watches and envelopes each stuffed with 
the equivalent of about 250 
three days after the election but before results were announced 
mrs marcos was host of a dinner for employees of an agency that 
investigates election fraud in manila the ledger showed at each 
of the 55 place settings was an envelope stuffed with the 
equivalent of about 500 
the ledger also credits arturo pacificador a marcos associate 
and former member of parliament with receiving about 50000 five 
days after the assassination of evilio javier director of the 1986 
aquino campaign in antique province pacificador was indicted in 
connection with the slaying and is a fugitive 
the ledger was seized along with other palace documents by the 
new philippine government after marcos fled a popular revolt on 
feb 25 1986 and mrs aquino was installed as president

muscovites stopped on the street and some leaned 
out of windows to clap and try to sing along as an american legion 
marching band played god bless america outside a hotel near the 
kremlin 
let me tell you it was one of the most emotional times of my 
life the bands leader dorothy hill said today she said the 
two impromptu concerts sunday and monday proved that peace is 
possible between the superpowers 
the people there watching and listening were shedding tears 
we were shedding tears i never saw such emotion in my life said 
mrs hill a 74yearold world war ii coast guard veteran 
it proved my point right there that reaction of your people 
and our people that peace is possible she told reporters 
mrs hill charmed and plodded her way through the soviet 
bureaucracy for three years to bring the 70member allmale 
american legion band from waltham mass to moscow on what she 
called a peace move 
on wednesday it will march in red square in the soviet unions 
annual victory day parade celebrating the defeat of nazi germany 
mrs hill said soviet officials have told her it will be the first 
american band to join the parade 
but band members have already gotten an emotional charge from 
their two concerts outside the hotel rossiya where they struck up 
god bless america as well as the soviet and us national 
anthems 
muscovites who had watched curiously soon began to sing along as 
best they could some people leaned out of the hotel windows and 
began clapping 
john jake comer of quincy mass past national commander of 
the american legion said the tears just came out of my eyes as 
the band played god bless america and he held the soviet and 
us flags during the impromptu concerts 
ive been to 18 countries to nicaragua had an audience with 
the pope visited the oval office with presidents reagan bush 
he said ive done everything but nothing as moving as that 
mrs hill said she began planning the trip about three years ago 
after having a dream that we should never see another war 
with no contacts in moscow she just stayed up through the early 
morning hours and dialed telephone operators in moscow trying to 
find out who to contact 
after dialing night after night she finally found one helpful 
telephone operator who put her in touch with the soviet peace 
committee and once we got them the show was on the road 
the joseph p hill american legion band named for mrs hills 
late husband arrived moscow on saturday on a 10day trip its 
members range in age from 17 to 82 and include veterans of wars in 
europe japan korea and vietnam 
at a ceremony today at the headquarters of the soviet peace 
committee its chairman genrik borovik praised mrs hill as a 
remarkable wonderful woman 
im happy that she broke american bureaucracy and soviet 
bureaucracy just coming straight to the soviet peace 
committee he said 
borovik called the event unusual because the american legion 
always was considered as a very rightwing organization which 
was always let me say not the best friend of the soviet union 
borovik is a television commentator who in the years before 
mikhail s gorbachev came to power often critized us foreign 
policy in his commentaries

estonia today dropped the words 
soviet socialist from its name and adopted the republics old 
tricolor flag in place of the red banner of socialism as it took 
another step toward independence 
the estonian parliament without formally declaring 
independence reinstituted several paragraphs from the baltic 
republics 1938 constitution including an opening proclamation 
that estonia is an independent republic with the supreme state 
power vested in the people 
nationalist parliamentarians regard the move as another step in 
a phased march toward independence and not in itself a formal break 
with moscow 
the parliament also declared that the step in large part 
symbolic was intended as a show of solidarity with the sister 
baltic republics of lithuania and latvia which have declared full 
independence 
all three republics were forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 
1940 
the vote today was 73 in favor 14 against with two 
abstentions eight members present but not voting and eight 
absent the measure passed with three votes more than the required 
twothirds majority of the legislatures total membership 
minutes after the vote was taken in the estonian supreme soviet 
the red flag with its hammer and sickle was lowered from the roof 
of the ancient parliament building and a new flag with cornflower 
blue black and white stripes was raised in its place 
a small crowd gathered in the cobblestone square to see what 
would follow but there was no immediate attempt to cover the giant 
hammer and sickle crest that has adorned the front of the building 
for five decades 
estonia which in november 1988 became the first of the 15 
soviet republics to proclaim its sovereignty from moscow has taken 
repeated steps in recent months to establish a separate identity 
without provoking a confrontation with president mikhail s 
gorbachev over the issue of independence 
the nearby baltic republic of lithuania which declared 
independence on march 11 is now the target of an economic blockade 
in which the soviets have cut the flow of oil natural gas and 
other critical raw materials 
the third baltic republic latvia declared independence on may 
4 and is now waiting to hear whether gorbachev will impose 
sanctions similar to those he slapped on lithuania 
the estonian parliament today adopted a resolution 
congratulating latvia on declaring independence and declaring 
baltic solidarity 
we congratulate the latvian supreme soviet and the whole 
population of latvia on the occasion of adopting the independence 
declaration of the latvian republic said the statement which 
was broadcast on radio estonia and monitored by the british 
broadcasting corp in britain 
the path to our own statehood is not easy but we are 
convinced that here in the baltics acting together will arrive 
at a restoration of our independent states more fruitfully than if 
each were to struggle on its own the statement said 
tallinn deputy mart laar said estonia already is feeling the 
effects of the soviet oil and natural gas embargo against 
lithuania because a lithuanian refinery processes 50 percent of 
estonias gasoline 
the estonians have been trying for weeks to start talks with the 
kremlin leading toward eventual independence but moscow so far has 
refused 
the estonian independent an englishlanguage weekly in the 
capital of tallinn reported in its most recent edition that 
gorbachev adviser alexander yakovlev told estonian supreme soviet 
chairman arnold ruutel that no negotiations could start unless the 
parliament suspended a march 30 ruling that invalidated the soviet 
constitution on estonian territory 
the action today carried estonia a step further and said that 
dropping of soviet symbols was guided by the decision of march 
30 the law adopted today made the offical name the estonian 
republic 
ethnic estonians make of 64 percent of the overall population of 
15 million the ethnic russian minority makes up 30 percent

a shiite moslem leader said today he 
believes no more western hostages will be freed until the israelis 
and their lebanese militia allies release some 400 lebanese shiite 
and palestinian captives 
hussein musawi leader of the fundamentalist islamic amal 
faction also voiced fears that one of the western hostages in 
lebanon could be killed if four missing iranians are found to have 
been slain by christian militiamen 
musawis remarks were seen as an effort to pressure washington 
to make a conciliatory gesture toward iran and the hostagetakers 
following last months release of two american captives 
iran and its lebanese shiite allies have asked the united states 
to help determine the fate of the four missing iranians who were 
seized eight years ago and pressure israel and its militia allies 
in south lebanon to release their prisoners 
if the kidnappers mind is sound and their religion is sound 
they will not free any more hostages said musawi the reputed 
mentor of some of the hostage takers and i think they wont 
if the americans want to solve the hostage issue they should 
solve the problem of the moslems and the oppressed held by israel 
and its surrogates he added 
but musawi warned that if the four iranians were found to have 
been slain it could prompt a violent reaction by those holding the 
hostages 
if the death of the four iranians is ascertained that will 
definitely affect the hostage issue one of the kidnap groups might 
react by murdering a hostage musawi said 
i dont have any concrete information on that but theyve 
done it before whats there to stop them from doing it again he 
told the associated press in a telephone interview from his 
headquarters in the ancient town of baalbek in east lebanons bekaa 
valley 
musawis prosyrian faction is part of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god which is believed to be linked to the 
shiite extremists holding most of the 16 remaining western 
hostages including six americans 
the longest held is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped in beirut 
march 16 1985 
the four iranians were seized by rightwing lebanese forces 
militiamen north of beirut in july 1982 
iran has repeatedly demanded their release but the four men are 
widely believed to have been killed either in civil war shelling or 
by their captors 
lebanese forces commander samir geagea said in august 1988 that 
after he took over the militia two years earlier he found no trace 
of the missing iranians he blamed his predecessor elie hobeika 
for their disappearance and apparent slaying 
last october iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said that if 
the men are dead the militiamen can at least give us back their 
bodies or show us their graves 
musawi is the reputed mentor of the proiranian islamic jihad 
for the liberation of palestine which holds american professors 
alann steen and jesse turner 
the group freed american educator robert polhill 55 on april 
22 after he spent 39 months in captivity 
the move was followed by the april 30 release of another 
american frank reed 57 who was held hostage for 42 months by a 
group calling itself the organization of islamic dawn 
president bush has publicly thanked iran and syria for helping 
secure their freedom bush has said the united states could try to 
help determine the fate of the four missing iranians 
israeli officials reiterated that they are not opposed to a 
prisoner swap in principle but stressed that an exchange should 
include three israeli servicemen captured in lebanon in 1986 and 
believed held by radical shiites linked to hezbollah 
it is our stated policy that we are ready to contemplate an 
exchange for the israeli prisoners who are held by those 
organizations said avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister 
yitzhak shamir

terry anderson the longest held of the 16 
western hostages helped fellow prisoners make scrabble and 
monopoly games to amuse themselves according to a newly freed 
captive 
his guards are giving him and other hostages plenty of 
diversions according to an account given by former hostage frank 
reed to andersons sister peggy say 
they have a lot of things which was encouraging to me at 
least they did at the time frank was there mrs say said these 
included boxes of books writing materials and dominoes 
although anderson 42 the chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press is in good physical condition from plenty of 
exercise he is tired and needs dental care mrs say said she 
said the hostages are blindfolded and chained in line with their 
preference 
frank preferred a chain on his wrist she said terry 
preferred a chain on his ankle so that his arms are free to write 
and play cards 
the closest she and reed were able to calculate that he last saw 
anderson was somewhere between a year and 18 months ago reed spent 
20 months with anderson and thomas sutherland in lebanon for a 
period of time the three american hostages were together with two 
others john mccarthy and brian keenan 
reed the director of the private lebanon international school 
was freed april 30 after being held for 44 months he is undergoing 
medical checkups at andrews air force base in suburban maryland and 
met with mrs say monday night 
anderson is in his sixth year of captivity sutherland was a 
dean at the american university of beirut mccarthy is a british 
television journalist keenan who is irish taught english at 
american university 
he is still a vindictive hearts player mrs say said of her 
brother reed told her anderson also reads voraciously a book a 
day 
reed said anderson could pick up some things in arabic from the 
radio and have at least some idea of what he thought was going on 
in the world but his guards have made a concerted effort to keep 
from him news of the deaths of his father and brother both from 
cancer within four months of each other in 1986 mrs say said she 
believes that he still does not know 
thats very difficult she said part of you wants him to 
have known and dealt with it and part of you believes it might be 
too much for him if he found out in captivity 
but with his mind still sharp he thinks of new birthdays 
painfully uncelebrated for the two daughters he cares for so deeply 
he is wracked with anguish at missing more than five years with 
them unable to savor the passage of gabrielle from child to woman 
in andersons sixth year of captivity gabrielle turned 14 on april 
26 
he has never held sulome who was born three months after he was 
kidnapped in moslem west beirut on march 16 1985 by islamic 
jihad a group loyal to iran she will be 5 on june 7 
he was very verbal about his love of them and that was what he 
wanted when he got out to see his daughters mrs say said 
unlike reed who said he was brutally beaten by his kidnappers 
for trying to escape twice anderson was left alone mrs say said 
reed told her anderson was not beaten 
reed told mrs say that her brother was aware of her tireless 
campaign to free him and the other hostages 
mrs say 49 shuttles between washington and her home in 
kentucky she has made several trips to the middle east seeking his 
release she has met with president bush pope john paul ii the 
archbishop of canterbury and plo leader yasser arafat she fields 
phone calls all hours of the day and night 
the guards told him anderson everytime i did something of 
major import mrs say said because it has been a criticism 
that ive heard i said to him reed does terry think what im 
doing is making him be held longer and he said absolutely not 
that only gives him hope

a 50 percent increase in money available for 
loans to eastern europe and developing countries was approved today 
by the international monetary funds policymaking committee 
at the insistence of the united states the imfs interim 
committee linked the 60 billion increase to a plan to force 
substantial economic reforms from 11 poor countries which are 4 
billion behind on their loan payments 
us officials said congress had demanded the link before 
approving the increase in the us contribution or quota 
in exchange for the link which many debtor countries opposed 
the united states agreed to begin consideration of an additional 
increase in its contribution in 1993 two years earlier than 
originally planned 
despite reservations that a number of members had on certain 
individual elements of the package we recognize this was a 
consensus everybody had to give in order to achieve a 
compromise said canadian finance minister michael h wilson 
chairman of the 22member interim committee 
the quota change which must be approved before the end of 1991 
by nations representing 85 percent of the funds voting power will 
raise the funds resources to 180 billion from 120 billion 
what you see is a package with features that are designed 
to strengthen the role of the international monetary fund as the 
central pillar of the international financial system wilson said 
delinquent countries that agree to adopt economic reforms would 
be eligible for money from a special imf fund however nations in 
arrears could lose their voting rights also the agency could sell 
3 million ounces of gold roughly equivalent to the members 
original contributions to meet the obligations of defaulting 
debtors 
the 11 nations in arrears are the sudan zambia peru costa 
rica honduras guyana somalia sierra leone cambodia vietnam 
and panama 
the interim committee also agreed to reorder the voting power 
within the fund allowing japan to vault from fifth place to 
second behind the united states in recognition of its growing 
financial power west germany will share the second position 
offiials said great britain which had been no 2 and france 
were close to an agreement to share the fourth spot although that 
was not addressed in the interim committees statement 
the panel reached agreeement on the package monday night after 
debating it most of the day in private sessions it announced the 
pact in a communique released this morning 
the plan had received an important boost sunday with the 
endorsement by the group of seven major industrial nations the 
united states japan west germany great britain france canada 
and italy 
on other subjects the interim committee promised to support 
reforms in eastern european countries emerging from four decades of 
communism but not at the expense of developing countries it 
welcomed applications for fund membership from czechoslovakia and 
bulgaria poland hungary yugoslavia and romania are already 
members 
the panel also pointed to progress under treasury secretary 
nicholas f bradys 14monthold program to reduce the crushing 
13 trillion debt burden on third world countries noting that 
commercial banks have negotiated agreements with six countries 
mexico the philippines costa rica venezuela chile and morocco 
commenting on recent economic developments the committee noted 
an upturn in inflation saying recent price developments point 
to the need for continued vigilance and restraint in monetary 
policy

federal prosecutors intend to seek additional 
drug charges against mayor marion barry according to sources 
familiar with the investigation 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said monday 
that us attorney jay b stephens wants a federal grand jury to 
return up to five additional misdemeanor drug possession charges 
against barry 
the legal action could come as early as today the sources said 
during a neighborhood walking tour today barry reacted to the 
report saying i dont lose any sleep over allegations justice 
is done in the courts the best answer to a lie is the truth 
the mayor already faces five misdemeanor cocainepossession 
charges and three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury 
about his alleged drug use barry arrested in an fbi sting 
operation jan 18 has pleaded innocent to all eight counts 
returned by a grand jury on feb 15 
wrctv also citing anonymous sources reported monday that the 
new charges would relate to alleged drug use by the mayor in the 
weeks before his january arrest 
judy smith a spokeswoman for stephens would not comment on the 
possibility of new charges against the 54yearold barry 
when barry was indicted on feb 15 stephens said he was 
continuing to explore a broad range of allegations against the 
mayor the grand jury that indicted barry has met regularly since 
then and several social companions of barrys have testified 
before the panel 
also court papers filed on monday reported that hair samples 
taken from barry on the night of his drug arrest showed that he had 
used cocaine repeatedly in the preceding weeks 
in the filing stephens opposed a move by barrys lawyer to 
suppress the hair test evidence 
r kenneth mundy barrys attorney argued in an earlier filing 
that because cocaine residue normally takes one to four days to 
reach a suspects hair follicles tests taken in the hours 
following barrys jan 18 arrest would not be relevant to the case 
the tests were administered after the mayor was arrested in a 
downtown washington hotel room by undercover fbi agents who 
officials say videotaped him smoking crack cocaine with a female 
companion who was cooperating with authorities 
stephens argued that the tests should be admitted at barrys 
trial to help the government try to rebut any argument that the 
mayor was coerced into using drugs 
it is hard evidence based upon the concrete results of a 
scientific test and it directly establishes that the defendant used 
cocaine in the weeks immediately preceding his arrest stephens 
wrote 
in recent years courts have increasingly relied on hair sample 
tests for information on past drug use 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson has scheduled a 
pretrial hearing for may 25 on various motions and countermotions 
filed by mundy and stephens the trial is scheduled to begin june 4

an organization representing nonlatvian 
workers today branded the baltic republics declaration of 
independence a state coup and appealed for a protest strike 
in the neighboring republic of estonia parliament took another 
step toward independence by dropping the words soviet socialist 
from the republics name and adopting the republics old tricolor 
flag in place of the red soviet flag 
and in the third baltic republic lithuania sought to cope with 
an economic blockade imposed by moscow after its declaration of 
independence by reducing meat supplies to the soviet union by 10 
percent while it seeks alternative markets a spokesman for 
parliament said 
the spokesman aidas palubinskas said the action was not a 
retaliatory measure he said the idea is to establish direct trade 
with soviet cities and regions bypassing central authorities 
instead of using a worthless ruble well be starting a market 
economy on a small scale he said 
in latvia an appeal printed on the front page of the republics 
communist party newspaper said proindependence leaders did not 
consider it necessary to ask the people do they want a return to 
unemployment lawlessness and oppression do they want hunger cold 
and bankruptcy as in neighboring lithuania 
the appeal increased concern over how nonlatvians who comprise 
up 46 percent of the population and most of the urban working 
class would react to fridays declaration of independence 
many nonlatvians oppose secession especially the ethnic 
russians that make up 33 percent of the republics 26 million 
people 
latvia has pledged to go more slowly than neighboring lithuania 
which declared itself a sovereign state on march 11 
but it is unclear whether latvias gradual approach which 
includes honoring the soviet constitution for an unspecified 
transition period will save it from the sort of economic blockade 
that moscow imposed on lithuania 
in estonia parliament adopted several measures today intended 
as a show of solidarity with lithuania and latvia which have 
declared full independence the soviet union forcibly annexed all 
three baltic republics in 1940 
the parliament without formally declaring independence 
reinstituted several paragraphs from estonias 1938 constitution 
including an opening proclamation that estonia is an independent 
republic with the supreme state power vested in the people 
the deputies also voted to drop the words soviet socialist 
from the republics name and adopt the old estonian blue black and 
white striped flag minutes after the vote was taken in the 
estoniana supreme soviet the red soviet flag with its hammer and 
sickle was lowered from the roof of the parliament building and the 
new flag was raised in its place 
nationalist parliamentarians regard the moves as another step in 
a phased march toward independence and not in itself a formal break 
with moscow 
estonia last month declared its intention to restore 
independence and called the soviet union an occupying power but it 
set no date for secession and left the door open for negotiations 
with the kremlin gorbachev has threatened estonia but taken no 
concrete actions against it 
in latvia the appeal for a protest strike printed in 
sovietskaya latvia was from the republics united council of work 
collectives which members say represents about 140000 workers 
most of them are not ethnic latvians 
it calls the declaration of independence an antisoviet and 
anticonstitutional state coup and said the decision was made 
in spite of the wishes of many work collectives and without a 
general referendum not taking into accont the opinion of a 
significant number of peoples deputies 
the appeal did not say when the strike should begin but leaders 
have previously mentioned may 15 it asked all enterprises in 
latvia to start organizing strike committees 
anatoly alexeyev head of the interfront movement that unites 
thousand of nonlatvians said today that he expected a major 
antiindependence demonstration on wednesday during victory day 
celebrations marking the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii 
residents of riga say they have already observed some panic 
buying by people who fear moscow will impose a partial economic 
blockade as it did against lithuania 
i dont know whats happened to everything now they have 
grabbed up all the salt said a retiree who was walking along the 
streets of rigas old town with an empty shopping bag 
latvian deputies awaited a response from moscow to documents 
they sent the kremlin on monday explaining their declaration of 
independence and the transition period they envision 
deputy prime minister ilmars bisers who helped draft the 
message said there had been no response yet and we may have to 
go there 
in a speech to a group of veterans on monday soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev condemned separatists but the tass news 
agencys report of that meeting did not say whether he mentioned 
latvia directly 
there are forces that would like to use the atmosphere of 
democracy glasnost and freedom to implement their futile ambitious 
plans including separatist plans he said 
such a policy was irresponsible gorbachev said

mixing anger with grief world jewish 
congress leaders today honored the memory of the 6 million jewish 
victims of the holocaust at the mansion where highranking nazis 
plotted their final solution 
i will not pray here because i personally believe that god 
turned his face away from this place as he did from auschwitz 
said congress president edgar m bronfman neverthless something 
must be said 
in hebrew german and english participants read words penned by 
death camp survivor and nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel 
what does a jew today feel in this place marked by evil and 
malediction fear and trembling anger incommensurate anger 
helplessness and grief infinite grief 
the ceremony at the wannsee villa came on the final day of the 
world jewish congress meeting in berlin the first time the 
organization has met on german soil some delegates from around the 
world stayed away from the meeting saying the trip to the heart of 
nazi tyranny would be too traumatic 
after the ceremony the congress leaders went to east berlin for 
a meeting with east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
there has never been a germany without jews de maiziere 
told the jewish leaders there can only be a germany with jews 
or there wont be any germany 
yet the shadow of auschwitz hangs over us he continued 
the democratically elected east german parliament in a dramatic 
gesture last month accepted a share of responsibility for the 
holocaust for more than four decades the nowousted communist 
authorities had denied any responsibility for the deaths of 6 
million jews 
during his east berlin visit bronfman urged that a memorial be 
built at the site of the now crumbling berlin wall to recall the 
dual significance of the date nov 9 
on that day last year the berlin wall was opened on nov 9 
1938 nazi thugs throughout germany started ransacking jewish 
stores and homes and killing dozens of jews in what has been called 
kristallnacht crystal night because of all the broken glass 
the ceremony at the wannsee villa was held on the 45th 
anniversary of the nazis unconditional surrender ending world war 
ii in europe 
under brilliant sunny skies the congress leaders gathered in 
front of the villa where on jan 20 1942 highranking officials 
of adolf hitlers third reich planned the extermination of the jews 
wiesels words called to mind some of the jewish victims of the 
holocaust teachers and their pupils brides and grooms 
intellectuals and workers rabbis and their disciples young 
revolutionaries and old dreamers of zion 
heather harris 23 read the statement in english before about 
300 people including the congress leadership ms harris comes 
from san francisco and now lives in jerusalem where she heads the 
world union of jewish students 
heinz galinski head of west germanys 35000member jewish 
community recalled the horror that the nazis planned at wannsee 
he said the murder of the jews stands alone in the history of 
mankind 
if the nazis had won then all the people of the world would 
have been enslaved said galinski like wiesel a survivor of the 
auschwitz death camp 
before the ceremony bronfman and other leaders of the group 
toured the inside of the villa which is in disrepair west berlin 
plans to turn it into a holocaust memorial 
they stood in what is known as the fireplace room where 
nazi ss boss reinhard heydrich and his fellow nazis planned the 
final solution 
its mindboggling bronfman said im sad and im angry 
too 
introducing the statement by wiesel bronfman called the wannsee 
decision the most despicable decision in the history of 
mankind wiesel himself did not attend the ceremony because of 
what were termed scheduling problems 
in the villa 48 years ago heydrich detailed plans to use jews 
as slave laborers and to build concentration camps gas chambers 
and crematoria he said that a total of 11 million jews would be 
wiped out 
even before the wannsee conference nazi troops had been 
slaughtering jews in occupied polish and soviet territory 
outside the villas high gates a plaque reads in this house 
in january 1942 the infamous wannsee conference took place to the 
memory of the fellow human beings slain by the nazi tyranny 
at a news conference monday at the heavily guarded west berlin 
jewish community headquarters the jewish congress leaders 
discussed their concerns about german reunification 
the jewish people have something to say to the new germany 
that is going to be created in a short time bronfman said 
he said sunday that a unified germany must forever teach 
about the nazi holocaust the lowest point ever reached in mans 
inhumanity to man 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir said it was israels 
duty to demand that in a united germany there would be a 
perpetual educational effort so that the generation growing up 
there would remember in all parts of germany the government must 
wage a war against antisemitism 
the polishborn shamir escaped the holocaust but his parents 
and two sisters were killed 
of the more than 600 participants at the meeting 80 were from 
nations other than germany

deportees from canada are sometimes forcibly 
sedated before being expelled to protect other travelers the 
canadian immigration minister said 
any deportee leaving canada by plane train bus or boat who 
might be disruptive on the trip is liable to be drugged 
immigration minister barbara mcdougall said monday 
in some cases we provide a medical attendant for some people 
who are being deported should there be any sedation that is done 
by the medical attendant she told reporters 
she said under international agreements concerning airlines 
we have to make sure peoples behavior on an aircraft is 
appropriate and theres no danger to other passengers 
the practice is not a violation of anything as far as i can 
tell she said 
but steve foster a lawyer with the jesuit refugee service in 
toronto said the government is abusing the rights of deportees by 
drugging them without consent 
weve got a charter of rights that says you cant do this to 
people foster said in a telephone interview to administer 
drugs for a nonmedical reason is unethical to administer drugs 
without a patients consent is unethical 
in the united states the immigration and naturalization service 
does not as a matter of policy sedate deportable aliens but 
ins officers accompany anyone that might be potentially violent 
or dangerous spokesman duke austin said in washington 
on chartered flights however deportees have been sedated on 
a limited basis by the ins said a source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity the ins has used chartered flights or government 
planes to deport cubans to their homeland 
mcdougalls comments about forced sedations came after 
questioning from canadian member of parliament dan heap who asked 
mcdougall to halt the deportation of mohammed ahmed said a kenyan 
i dont believe theres anything in canadian law which allows 
me to put a needle in you without your permission no matter what 
unless youre mentally incompetent heap said outside the house 
of commons 
said claims immigration officers threatened to sedate him if he 
made any trouble heap said 
said was being held in a detention center in toronto pending 
deportation which mcdougall said she would not halt

several houses stores and vehicles in pereira a city of 300000 
residents about 110 miles west of bogota no one claimed 
responsibility but police said they captured one suspect who they 
believed had driven the car to the site 
an army communique also reported today that 18 leftist guerillas 
and a soldier died in three battles monday in different regions it 
said the rebels belonged to the countrys three main guerrilla 
groups the national liberation army the peoples liberation army 
and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia 
and in the latest terrifying twist in the drug war a top police 
official said monday that traffickers are buying up homes near 
police stations intent on turning them into house bombs 
the traffickers are willing to pay five or six times the value 
of the houses in order to fill them with dynamite and blow them 
up said col oscar pelaez chief of the countrys investigative 
police 
he told a news conference monday that some of the homes involved 
are adjacent his agencys headquarters in southern bogota 
drug traffickers have been carrying out a terrorist campaign of 
car bombings and other attacks in retaliation for a government 
crackdown on drugs authorities blame traffickers for the 
assassinations of three presidential candidates in the last eight 
months 
the medellin cocaine cartel has targeted police in particular 
most of the violence has been in the city of medellin where more 
than 30 police officers and several civilians have been killed the 
last two months on saturday medellin police defused an abandoned 
car packed with dynamite and ballbearings 
the drug lords have said in communiques that they are

informers in the cartel he said indiscriminate violence by the 
cartel had disenchanted some members 
many people are ready to collaborate in a common crime 
pelaez said in an interview after the news conference they are 
willing to kill an individual but when it comes to these 
collective massacres they are sickened and they denounce the 
actions 
he said police also had received cooperation from private 
citizens who live near houses that traffickers tried to buy 
the people realize that their lives are threatened he said

the lead prosecutor at john m poindexters 
irancontra coverup trial says he had ample evidence for telling 
jurors that president reagan lied to the american people about 
trading arms for hostages 
dan k webb said in a court filing that his remark made during 
final arguments was supported by evidence that reagan had indeed 
sold arms to iran to try to secure the release of american hostages 
in lebanon 
webb defended his comment in a brief that he and other trial 
prosecutors filed monday in response to poindexters motion to set 
aside his five felony convictions 
the former national security adviser was convicted april 7 of 
conspiracy obstructing congressional inquiries and making false 
statements to congress about the irancontra affair 
in his summation to the jury webb said he couldnt criticize 
reagans decision to sell arms to iran in an attempt to win the 
hostages freedom 
you make judgments as president and you carry them out and 
maybe youre right and maybe youre wrong webb said but you 
dont lie to the american public 
the defense had previously charged that webbs statement about 
reagan was an improper expression of personal opinion that was 
clearly designed to inflame the members of the jury to make them 
feel as if they themselves were victims of the alleged crime in 
this case 
the prosecution responded monday by saying webbs statements 
were fully supported by the evidence and were relevant to the 
charges in this case 
the evidence clearly established that a november 1985 
shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran was intended as 
part of an exchange of arms for hostages said the brief filed by 
prosecutors in the office of independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
the evidence further establishes that on nov 13 1986 
president reagan addressed the nation and denied to the american 
public the allegation that his administration had been involved in 
an armsforhostages deal the prosecution filing said 
webbs comment was relevant because prosecutors were trying to 
show that poindexters motive for lying to lawmakers about the us 
role in the missile shipment to iran was to protect the president 
from political embarrassment 
poindexter questioned by lawmakers within days of reagans 
speech denied he knew anything about the shipment at the time it 
occurred 
poindexter also was convicted of lying to congress by denying 
that national security council staff officer oliver l north was 
supervising a secret operation to arm the nicaraguan rebels after 
congress banned us military aid 
he is scheduled to be sentenced june 11 and could receive up to 
25 years in prison and fined as much as 125 million

anticommunist protesters stormed out 
of a meeting with interim president ion iliescu today dashing 
government hopes of a quick end to a marathon rally demanding his 
resignation 
the meeting ended just minutes after it began when the 
government said the session could not be videotaped and the 
protesters delegation refused a counteroffer of a stenographer 
recording the minutes 
at downtown university square site of the antiiliescu protest 
about 1000 demonstrators had gathered by midday loudly demanding 
iliescus resignation they called his national salvation front 
which dominates the interim government a party of 
neocommunists 
the demonstrators part of a rally that began 17 days ago vowed 
to continue their protest until romanias first free national 
elections in more than 50 years are held may 20 
iliescu a former communist party functionary was relegated to 
lesser duties when he became an outspoken critic of former dictator 
nicolae ceausescu in the early 1970s 
the front was catapulted to prominence after ceausescu was 
toppled in december iliescu and other former communist officials 
within the front publicly broke with their marxist past and 
embraced democratic freemarket ideals but critics accuse them of 
adhering to communist ideals and seeking to reimpose totalitarian 
rule if they win the elections 
meanwhile the national liberal party said its presidential 
candidate radu campeanu had canceled planned campaign stops in 
the northeastern region of moldavia after being attacked saturday 
by alleged front supporters in braila 180 miles northeast of 
bucharest 
liberal party officials said campeanu who suffered facial cuts 
in the attack was considering whether to cancel two other planned 
rallies out of concern for his safety 
both campeanu and ion ratiu candidate of the national peasants 
party recently have said they would boycott the balloting unless 
political violence by alleged front supporters abated ratiu and 
his wife have claimed they also have been the targets of front 
assaults

hitting a record of more than 27 feet above normal and snakebites 
were on the rise in arkansas where flooding has forced the 
evacuation of more than 300 homes and driven the reptiles from 
nesting areas 
the arkansas river hit a record 276 feet 36 feet above flood 
stage today at little rock 
thirteen deaths have been blamed on the weather in the past two 
weeks one in oklahoma and the rest in texas 
northern texas has had 2206 inches of rainfall in the first 
four months of 1990 the most since 1922 the result the worst 
flooding since 1908 
light rain fell today in eastern texas and there was a chance of 
thunderstorms in the dallas area wednesday but national weather 
service meteorologist john cockrell said that should not compound 
the already severe flooding 
in texas flood warnings for people and livestock were issued 
for today as the trinity river engulfed homes pastures and fields 
south of dallas 
at least 150 people were evacuated and main roads closed in 
trinidad 60 miles southeast of dallas near palestine 90 miles 
below dallas about 50 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in 
the community of long lake where the trinity usually a few 
hundred feet across had bulged to about two miles 
we cant tell exactly how many residences are affected yet 
because we cant count underwater said bill walters manager of 
a red cross shelter set up in a campground 
while about 80 people had been evacuated from long lake by late 
monday many were reluctant to leave walters said these people 
are pretty stubborn as all texans are they think they can stick 
it out but they really cant do it he said 
as the flooding moved downstream the red cross sent teams to 
prepare shelters many farmtomarket roads and some major highways 
were closed 
lake texoma on the oklahoma line fell half a foot monday after 
cresting at a record 64476 feet above sea level the first time 
since 1957 that water flowed out the spillways 
mike mccoy of the army corps of engineers said will take up to 
two months for the lake to return to a decent level as the 
corps plans to lower i by 6 to 9 inches a day 
a preliminary survey sunday found 83 homes at least partially 
submerged in oklahomas marshall county which is partly cut off 
from the outside by the swollen lake 
highway flooding made life strange for judy peterson who works 
in madill okla 
instead of simply driving the 18 miles from her home on sand 
point to the office she and her husband must take a boat a 
halfmile and then drive a circuitous 56mile route around the 
northern edge of lake texoma and back to madill theyd been doing 
that for a week as of monday 
its really getting old she said 
in central arkansas the rising waters of the arkansas river 
have driven snakes from their homes a hospital at pine bluff 
which normally treats one snakbite victim a week has treated eight 
in the last week spokesman bill cheatham said most were bitten by 
copperheads but no one was seriously hurt 
water was reported up to 3 feet deep in homes in the pine bluff 
area 
arkansas gov bill clinton added two more counties to last 
weeks disaster declaration monday bringing the total to 29 an

former west virginia gov arch moore 
today fulfilled an agreement with federal prosecutors by pleading 
guilty to a fivecount corruption indictment 
the maverick republican the only west virginia governor to 
serve three fouryear terms entered his plea before us district 
judge walter hoffman brought in from baltimore because federal 
judges in the state asked to be excused 
moore faces up to 36 years in prison and fines totaling 12 
million sentencing was set for july 10 us attorney michael 
carey said the government agreed to make no sentencing 
recommendation 
moore 67 agreed april 12 to plead guilty to extortion mail 
fraud tax fraud and obstruction of justice after federal 
prosecutors revealed they had secretly recorded a meeting in which 
moore allegedly admitted receiving illegal cash donations in his 
1988 campaign the recording also allegedly showed he planned to 
hide information from federal investigators 
after the hearing carey said additional allegations against 
moore will be detailed at the sentencing hearing 
mr moore use large sums outside the election process it was 
a scheme to run the election outside the limit of the law said 
john campbell an assistant us attorney from the justice 
departments public integrity section 
any time the franchise of the voters is taken away from them 
is a serious offense carey said 
the indictment accused moore of committing acts relating to his 
1984 campaign and his term as governor from 1985 to 1989 
in addition moore was accused of blocking a federal grand 
jurys investigation of him last year and this year carey said 
the indictment further alleged moore used his public position to 
extort approximately 573000 in 1985 carey said it also accused 
him of filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 1985 the 
official said 
it further charged that he schemed to defraud the state of his 
salary and benefits by funneling about 100000 in cash into his 
1984 campaign fund carey said 
it was the second time moore was indicted for improprieties 
allegedly committed while in office he and his 1972 campaign 
manager were indicted in december 1975 for allegedly extorting 
25000 from the president of a shaky financial holding company 
trying to get a state charter for a new bank moore was acquitted 
in 1976 
although registered as a republican moores politics were 
flexible in a state in which democrats outnumber republicans 
2to1 he had friends and foes on both sides of the aisle 
moore served one term in the state house of delegates from 1953 
to 1954 and was in the us house from 1957 to 1969 
he won the governors office in 1968 with a razorthin election 
victory and defied polls four years later to win reelection 
the constitution barred him from a third consecutive term but 
in 1984 he returned for a third nonconsecutive term 
budget problems helped undo him in 1988 when voters turned him 
out in favor of political novice gaston caperton 
he is the second west virginia governor to encounter legal 
trouble with the federal government 
former democratic gov ww wally barron who served from 
196165 and several of his associates were tried on bribery 
conspiracy charges in 1968 barron was acquitted but later went to 
prison for bribing the foreman of the jury that acquitted him

italian voters dealt the newlook communist party a 
sharp setback in regional and provincial elections while groups 
seeking greater local autonomy made surprising gains according to 
results released today 
earthquake at the polls said the national daily la 
repubblica after the lega lombarda a regional political party in 
the milan area won 19 percent of the votes outpolling the 
communists in the wealthy industrial region 
results from the voting sunday and monday confirmed the early 
trends showing the communists who had come to the brink of power a 
decade ago getting no more than 24 percent of the vote 
the communists italys no 2 party won 30 percent of the vote 
in the last regional elections in 1985 and 278 percent in 
parliamentary voting in 1987 
the christian democrats who have led or dominated all national 
governments for four decades suffered small losses and held on to 
about a third of the total votes 
the socialists italys no 3 party advanced but with 15 
percent of the vote were still a long way from overtaking the 
communists 
premier giulio andreotti a christian democrat warned during 
the campaign that major shifts in the voting could cause his 
coalition government to collapse the coalition also includes the 
socialists and three tiny parties republicans social democrats 
and liberals 
but commentators said the results didnt appear to pose major 
risks for the coalition 
however the results were a disappointment for the communists 
who adopted a new course at an extraordinary congress in march 
in an effort to halt the partys steady electoral decline since the 
early 1980s and react to the democratic upheavals sweeping 
communist parties from power in eastern europe 
at their congress the communists gave party leader achille 
occhetto a mandate to restructure the party to try to unite italys 
fractured left this would eventually entail changing the partys 
name and hammerandsickle symbol 
the proposals were opposed by the partys old guard leaders who 
saw them as a denial of the partys history and roots 
the new course didnt stop the hemorrhage of votes that has 
gone on since 1984 said the leading milan newspaper corriere 
della sera 
the biggest gains were made by the lega lombarda and similar 
locally oriented groups in the north 
these groups have been accused of prejudice toward italians from 
the south and immigrants from the third world who have come to the 
more prosperous north seeking work 
but the lega has denied the charge saying its aim is to reduce 
the power of the central government in local matters 
the racist leagues advance headlined romes il messaggero 
but giorgio bocca a la repubblica columnist said the 
mainstream parties would be making a serious error to underplay the 
reasons for the success of the new groups 
this is the reaction to a policy which has led to the 
bankruptcy of the public administration and handed large areas of 
the south to the underworld bocca wrote 
umberto bossi leader of the lega lombarda said its success in 
becoming the secondlargest party in lombardy exceeded its 
expectations 
this is the first step toward our final goal of federalism to 
reduce the power of the central government 
up for election were 15 of 20 regional governments 87 
provincial governing councils and 6374 city governments city 
elections were not held in such major centers as rome naples 
trieste catania and bolzano

the ministry of industry has dismissed the 
director of the staterun oil monopoly blaming him for a 
disruption in supplies that has led to long lines at gas stations 
a ministry spokesman said today 
jerzy szewczyk was fired from his post as director of the 
central oil company for failing to predict a need to increase crude 
oil imports said the spokesman jan golab 
for the last week gas stations across poland have been plagued 
by long lines reminiscent of the chronic shortages during the 
former communist regime when gasoline had to be rationed 
the lines dwindled after the marketoriented policies of the new 
solidarityled government reduced demand by raising gasoline prices 
dramatically to match world market prices more closely 
golab said that due to a shortage of funds szewczyk had kept a 
relatively low supply of gas in poland and had not anticipated 
increased purchases last week as a result of two national holidays 
supplies to gas stations dried up causing long lines to appear 
and requiring rapid imports golab said 
the failure of the soviet union to meet its obligations in crude 
oil deliveries has also contributed to the disruption of gas 
supplies 
some soviet gasoline bound for poland is refined in lithuania 
moscow has sharply reduced oil supplies to the baltic republic as 
part of an economic blockade aimed at forcing the lithuanians to 
back off their declaration of independence 
the offical pap news agency reported that deliveries from the 
soviet union dropped by 10000 tons in april as a result of 
general problems in its economy and trade with poland 
polish newspapers reported today that the situation is likely to 
improve in the short term because tankers with foreign oil were 
either already docked or on their way to the baltic port of gdansk

angolas usbacked rebels today 
claimed they had routed government forces after a threeday battle 
in southeast angola while portuguese media reports said fighting 
could be closing on the capital luanda 
a statement released in the portuguese capital said 139 
government troopers were killed and remaining government forces 
fled trenches near mavinga 700 miles southeast of luanda 
the portuguese news agency lusa reported from luanda that gen 
antonio dos santos ndalu was nominated to command the bengocuanza 
front indicating fighting was as close as 38 miles northeast of 
the capital 
there was no confirmation from officials in luanda that fighting 
was so close to the capital 
government troops launched an offensive last december against 
unita rebel positions in southeast cuando cubango province and 
claimed they captured the airstrip and a strategic unita base near 
mavinga 
in turn the rebels stepped up bombing and sabotage attacks in 
the capital and other towns 
unita never acknowledged defeat at mavinga and todays 
statement signed by chief of staff arlindo pena said recent 
fighting drove government troops from positions six miles north of 
the base 
but angolan president jose eduardo dos santos said last week 
government columns had advanced south of mavinga and could soon be 
within artillery range of rebel headquarters at jamba some 125 
miles further south 
a western diplomat following the angolan conflict from lisbon 
said today the unita claims seemed exaggerated adding he had 
no reports of a major battle in the region 
speaking on condition of anonymity he said any government 
withdrawal from mavinga could be to reinforce units in the north 
where unita rebels are said to have intensified offensives in small 
combat units 
the reports of fighting came as diplomatic efforts continued to 
reach a peaceful end to the 15year civil war 
unita the national union for the total independence of angola 
has been fighting to force the marxist angolan government to share 
power since the country gained independence from portugal in 1975

the accused ringleader in the bensonhurst attack 
gathered a white gang armed with bats because he believed blacks 
were coming into their neighborhood to attack them his attorney 
argued today 
you might convict him of being a jerk he is a jerk stephen 
murphy attorney for keith mondello said in his closing statement 
but its no crime to be a jerk 
meanwhile a separate jury deciding the fate of the accused 
triggerman joseph fama resumed deliberating today they asked to 
review several pieces of evidence including photographs of the 
mostly white bensonhurst neighborhood of brooklyn and a photo 
collage containing pictures of the defendants 
the jurors began deciding famas fate monday without hearing 
that a key witness with a history of hallucinations wanted to 
recant 
state supreme court justice thaddeus owens refused to let famas 
defense lawyer reopen his case to put franklin tighe back on the 
witness stand to say he did not see the shooting 
tighe 20 also a bensonhurst resident has a long record of 
psychological problems including visual hallucinations and severe 
depression he was the only witness who said he saw fama pull a 
pistol and shoot 16yearold yusuf hawkins 
defense lawyer david depetris said monday that after testifying 
tighe contacted him and said he was not standing next to fama when 
hawkins was shot as he told the jury 
in plain simple language i smell a rat here assistant 
district attorney edward boyar said he objected to allowing 
depetris to reopen his case which he rested last week 
in his summation monday in famas case boyar was highly 
critical of silent bensonhurst and its numerous residents who 
saw much or all of the aug 23 attack but refused to come forward 
he spoke of door stoops where the brother and sisterhood of 
bensonhurst sat watching but not seeing hearing but not 
listening when hawkins was surrounded by a white mob and shot 
through the heart 
when the mob turned that corner what did they know about yusuf 
hawkins boyar asked they knew the color of his skin that was 
the only thing they knew about yusuf hawkins 
depetris told the jury the prosecution witnesses were not 
believable and that fama had not been proved guilty 
he told the panel that tighe believed what he was saying when he 
testified but he said the stress of finding hawkins dying on the 
street triggered hallucinations in the mentally unstable man

the other defense lawyers they were cheered by 21 officers accused 
of participating in the december coup attempt

central philippines for nine days 
during the opening session defense lawyers filed several 
motions including one challenging the authority of military chief 
of staff gen renato de villa to appoint the court 
defense lawyer pablito sanidad argued that de villa should not 
personally have appointed the judges because he was in effect a 
coaccuser since his residence was bombed and destroyed in the 
coup attempt 
the defense also argued that the order creating the court and 
appointing its members was not signed by de villa but the military 
judges ruled that the tribunal was duly constituted 
im sorry i cannot stand in behalf of my client and could not 
be a willing instrument over this illegally assembled body 
former appellate court judge alfredo lazaro told the judges before 
leading the walkout of about a dozen lawyers 
lazaro represented lt col romelino gojo a marine commander

leaders of the world jewish congress stood 
outside the villa tuesday where nazi leaders plotted the holocaust 
and recalled the 6 million dead including brides and grooms 
rabbis and students and dreamers of zion 
i will not pray here because i personally believe that god 
turned his face away from this place as he did from auschwitz 
said edgar m bronfman president of the world jewish congress 
the solemn ceremony in front of the wannsee villa where nazi 
leaders in 1942 mapped out the final solution was the most 
emotional part of the threeday world jewish congress in berlin 
which ended tuesday 
it was the first time the congress had met on german soil and 
some delegates refused to attend saying their grief was still too 
great 
wannsee villa is now in disrepair with many of the inside walls 
ripped out and dusty scaffolding covering one part of the facade 
west berlin officials have promised to refurbish the villa and turn 
it into a holocaust memorial 
a tribute composed by nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel a 
concentration camp survivor called to mind the holocaust victims 
it spoke of teachers and their pupils brides and grooms 
intellectuals and workers rabbis and their disciples young 
revolutionaries and old dreamers of zion 
all were doomed simply solely as jews said the 
declaration read on the 45th anniversary of the collapse of nazi 
germany in world war ii 
the declaration recalled how the nazis in the name of their 
criminal leadership on behalf of their nation condemned the entire 
jewish people to death and oblivion 
what does a jew today feel in this place marked by evil and 
malediction said wiesels tribute fear and trembling anger 
incommensurate anger helplessness and grief infinite grief 
the statement was read in english hebrew and german 
if only the walls could speak if only the trees and clouds 
could testify it said we need to hear them for most german 
men and women in the past refused to speak refuse to remember 
jewish leaders for years have said that older germans especially 
have refused to face their past west german president richard von 
weizsaecker has drawn acclaim at home and abroad for urging fellow 
citizens to frankly deal with the horrors of the nazi legacy 
as the two germanys rush toward reunification there have been 
fears of a growth of antisemitism 
a topranking official from west germany tried to allay these 
fears during a speech to the final session of the congress 
we will continue with all force the fight against rightwing 
extremism and antisemitism interior minister wolgang schaeuble 
said 
before the ceremony bronfman and other leaders of the 
organization toured the inside of the villa 
they stood in what is known as the fireplace room the room 
that historians say is most likely the one used for the conference 
there nazi ss boss reinhard heydrich and his coconspirators 
planned the final solution the extermination of european jews 
its just absolutely mindboggling when you hear that 
heydrich wanted to come here to a secluded spot because he wasnt 
sure his colleagues would go along with him said bronfman he 
he was so happy they did he took a glass of brandy and had a 
cigar what kind of people were these 
later congress leaders traveled to east berlin for a meeting 
with prime minister lothar de maiziere 
there has never been a germany without jews de maiziere 
told the jewish delegation there can only be a germany with 
jews or there wont be any germany 
the democratically elected east german government in a dramatic 
gesture last month accepted joint responsibility for the 
holocaust for more than four decades the nowousted communist 
authorities had denied any responsibility 
bronfman during the east berlin visit called for a memorial to 
be built at the site of the now crumbling berlin wall to recall the 
significance of nov 9 1938 and nov 9 1989 
on the date last year the berlin wall was opened on nov 9 
1938 nazi thugs throughout germany started ransacking jewish 
stores and homes and killing dozens of jews in what has been called 
kristallnacht because of the masses of broken glass that littered 
the streets afterward

the easiest way for rep stephen solarz to 
become a millionaire is to quit his job ditto for rep dan 
rostenkowski 
solarz and rostenkowski both democrats are among 184 lawmakers 
eligible to put leftover campaign cash to personal use if they 
retire from the house by january 1993 
they can take the money and not run 
until 1979 members of congress were allowed to convert leftover 
campaign funds to personal use when they retired but congress 
voted that year to halt the practice for lawmakers elected after 
january 1980 
last year congress voted to totally ban the practice the 
measure however delayed the effective date of the prohibition to 
january 1993 giving those eligible more than two years to decide 
whether to retire and take the money 
the senate bars members from converting campaign funds but all 
members of congress are allowed to use their campaign accounts for 
political purposes after leaving office 
house members may keep whatever campaign funds they had as of 
nov 30 1989 about 40 million for the 184 house members covered 
by the clause 
sixty of the 184 members had at least 100000 in their campaign 
accounts at the cutoff date a handful had less than 5000 
one kentucky democrat william natcher is eligible but reported 
a zero campaign balance a month after the cutoff date 
most house members are reluctant to discuss whether the deadline 
will affect their political plans for 1992 saying they are 
concentrating on legislative business and the 1990 elections 
but the aging of many senior house members and redistricting as 
a result of the 1990 census has led to speculation that 1992 will 
be a high turnover year 
retirement in 1992 is going to be attractive to a lot of older 
members said william schneider a political analyst at the 
american enterprise institute 
older incumbents who see their safe districts shaken up by 
redistricting may be tempted to just retire and keep their 
campaign money schneider said of course theyll come up with 
any number of other public reasons for deciding not to run 
solarz is among the those whose futures could be affected by 
redistricting new york city probably will lose a congressional 
seat and solarz could end up in a race against a fellow incumbent 
perhaps democrat charles schumer 
but solarz who had a 15 million campaign war chest at the 
cutoff repeatedly has said he has no plans to retire before 1993 
and that he would not convert his campaign cash if defeated 
rostenkowski is unopposed this fall and many of his colleagues 
think the chicago lawmaker will retire after one more term he had 
1 million in campaign funds at the nov 30 1989 cutoff and has 
been vague about his plans 
were focusing on this years agenda and winning reelection 
in 1990 and then well worry about 1992 said rostenkowski 
spokesman jim jaffe 
rostenkowski has not said whether he would take his campaign 
funds with him if he left office before the deadline jaffe said 
but its the law that members can convert and he supports the 
law jaffe said 
a handful of those retiring from congress this year could 
convert their campaign funds to personal use 
one retiring member kansas republican robert whittaker has 
said he would not use his 500000plus in excess campaign money 
for personal purposes 
georgia democrat doug barnard who says his next house term will 
be his last has more than 500000 and has said he might convert 
some for personal use 
retiring rep bill frenzel a minnesota republican who has more 
than 300000 left plans to refund all 1989 and 1990 campaign 
contributions pay bills and give the remainder to other candidates 
most of the others who are eligible avoid the subject 
they dont like to advertise it because it just makes people 
angry schneider said 
once lawmakers retire they dont have to worry about whether 
such criticism will cost them votes 
former rep samuel stratton of new york wrote himself a check 
for nearly 200000 from campaign funds last year retired ohio 
republican rep delbert latta converted 123000 
missouri republican gene taylor closed his campaign account last 
year by giving 52000 to charity and 345000 to himself

chancellor helmut kohl today rejected 
moscows suggestion that the two germanys could unite and decide 
later which military alliances they will join and east germany 
said it was also skeptical 
speaking to reporters kohl said the matter of a united 
germanys military allegiances must be cleared up before the two 
german nations are formally merged 
kohl said the germans need no singularization meaning that 
a united germany should have its sovereignty 
the chancellor was referring to a suggestion by soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze at last weeks unification talks in 
bonn that formal unity could occur before external aspects of 
the merger process are cleared up 
east germany also reacted negatively to shevardnadzes weekend 
proposals 
government officials in east berlin are skeptical of 
delaying a settlement on the external aspects of unification 
said the east german news agency adn and want a quick 
continuation of the sixnation talks 
during saturdays meeting of the two germanys and the four world 
war ii victors shevardnadze also suggested a transition period 
during which the four wartime allies would retain postwar rights 
even after german unity 
shevardnadzes remarks had initially triggered jubilation among 
some west german politicians who sensed the pace of unification 
was rapidly picking up 
but by today that had changed into concern about delaying 
settlement of the international aspects of german unification 
there had even been talk among some politicians of canceling 
west germanys dec 2 federal balloting in favor of elections for a 
united germanys parliament 
but kohl said today without question the dec 2 elections 
will still occur 
the united states the soviet union france and britain jointly 
control many matters in the former german capital of berlin 
they also have special rights outside berlin many involving the 
status of the troops they maintain in what once were their postwar 
military occupation zones 
vernon a walters us ambassador to west germany said today 
that washington supports a united germany with unrestricted 
sovereignty and without special rights for any of the world war ii 
allied victors 
the question of a united germanys military attachments has been 
one of the greatest obstacles to quick reunification the soviet 
union rejects a unified germany as a member the north atlantic 
treaty organization but the nato allies insist the new germany 
belong to the western alliance 
at the weekend meetings shevardnadze said he envisions the four 
world war ii victors keeping troops on german soil for a few years 
after unification until the issue of a united germanys military 
allegiance is settled 
the bonn talks were attended by the foreign ministers of the two 
germanys france britain and the soviet union as well as us 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
the netherlands a nato member expressed doubts monday about 
the latest soviet idea 
i clearly see complications if there is a decoupling of 
german unification from the military question dutch foreign 
minister hans van den broek told reporters 
it sounds like the germans are cutting a deal that would 
allow unification while leaving military links undecided said one 
dutch official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
washington has not reacted to shevardnadzes suggestion

pope john paul ii said today the 
church and state in mexico are reaching a better understanding 
after more than a century of hostility 
the context of the international community is initiating a new 
phase of its history and that will have its repercussions here in 
the near future john paul said in a speech directed to the 
teachers of mexico 
john paul was greeted at the airport here by a crowd of more 
than 50000 people doing the wave he delivered his speech 
under a hot sun for the first time on this trip and a security 
guard held a white parasol over his head 
because the pope was only stopping off at the airport here on 
the third day of his eightday journey the city built replicas of 
important downtown colonial buildings as a backdrop 
a new perspective of contacts between the church and the 
political community of this country is occurring in this day the 
pope said and in this phase of better understanding and 
dialogue the church wants to offer its own support without 
straying from its specific goals and abilities 
the church is severely restricted under mexicos constitution 
although many of the restrictions are ignored the speech was the 
popes most direct public reference to president carlos salinas de 
gortaris moves toward normalization of churchstate relations 
the pope said teachers must strive for a leap in quality to 
move education beyond the basics of reading and writing he said 
the church was not a brake on scientific and cultural progress but 
asked teachers to open the world of instruction to christ 
the pope drew wild cheers when he spontaneously saluted the 
corazones calientes or hot hearts of aguascalientes 
which means hot waters and refers to the areas thermal springs 
come back come back chanted the crowd waving thousands of 
white flags pennants and hats the popes next stop was a shrine 
to the virgin mary at the nearby town of san juan de los lagos 
on monday in the port city of veracruz 200 miles east of mexico 
city the pontiff had defended plans to celebrate the 500th 
anniversary of christianity in the new world from critics who say 
the church came as an agent of conquest repression and disease 
the discovery the conquest and the evangelization occupy a 
decisive luminous place taken all together even though they are 
not without shadows john paul told thousands of people at a 
waterfront prayer service 
in veracruz the pope spoke from a raised platform along the 
gulf coast harbor where conquistadors led by hernan cortes first 
reached mexico in 1519 
they were followed five years later by the first group of 
missionaries 
the celebrations planned for 1992 the 500th anniversary 
columbus arrival in america have prompted a fierce debate in 
latin america critics charge that the european conquerors 
destroyed native cultures and that roman catholic priests were an 
instrument of conquest 
in mexico columbus day is celebrated as the day of the 
indian race and in recent years indian activists have attacked 
memorial ceremonies at the monument to columbus in downtown mexico 
city 
john paul has used the 1992 anniversary as a banner in his 
efforts to launch a reevanglization or revival of catholicism 
in latin america he plans to open a special conference of latin 
american bishops in the dominican republic in two years to 
celebrate the anniversary 
the evangelization of america encouraged by the lord 
encountered many limits and difficulties which even today wait to 
be seen in their true light through an objective study but there 
were also great successes as demonstrated by the splendid works 
that have served as a model and support for your peoples road 
during these centuries the pope said 
john paul cited the examples of three 16thcentury priests who 
defended the rights of mexican indians he said the church 
receives from christ the mandate to go and preach the gospel to 
all nations 
the pope then returned to mexico city and held brief meetins 
with two former presidents of mexico miguel de la madrid and luis 
echevarria 
the private sessions were a further sign of the warmer climate 
between the vatican and mexico which retains some of the most 
restrictive religious laws outside the communist world though they 
are widely ignored 
john paul also held talks monday morning with salinas the 
president named a personal representative to the pope in february 
in a possible step toward reestablishment of diplomatic ties 
broken in 1926 
opposition politicians have criticized salinas for what they say 
is a cynical attempt to shore up the governing institutional 
revolutionary partys flagging support through rapprochement with 
the church 
the whole world can see the political intentions in all 
this leftist opposition leader cuauhtemoc cardenas observed 
after salinas changed plans at the last minute and personally 
greeted the pontiff when he arrived sunday 
the pontiff is making his second visit to mexico and his 47th 
papal trip outside italy

the senate voted today to allow irs cia and 
fbi agents to participate in political campaigns rejecting 
republican attempts to maintain the status quo established in the 
51yearold hatch act 
on a 5146 vote the senate rejected an amendment to exclude 
employees in the spy and tax agencies plus the justice department 
and the federal election commission from a democratic bill that 
removes most current restrictions on political activities by civil 
service and postal workers 
the amendment by senate gop leader bob dole of kansas was one of 
three unsuccessful attempts by republicans today to chip away at 
the unionsought revisions in the hatch act 
laws restricting those people and what they can do are already 
on the books said sen john glenn dohio the principal author 
of the proposed hatch act revisions they cannot use information 
gained on the job politically 
dole contended that the entire bill amounts to a pot of gold 
for the democratic party because unionized public employees and 
their political action committees overwhelmingly favor democrats 
also defeated today were gop amendments to maintain a ban on 
federal workers holding office in the two political parties and 
delaying any changes in the hatch law until after a campaign 
finance reform bill is enacted 
the first amendment by sen william v roth rnh was 
defeated on a 6432 vote and the second by gop whip alan k simpson 
of wyoming was rejected 6136 
dole hinted on monday that republicans might try to attach major 
elements of their proposed campaign finance reform bill such as a 
total abolition of pacs to the hatch act revisions later this 
week the senate already has been debating the bill for a week 
lf we banned all pacs there wouldnt be much demand for this 
bill dole said of the unionsought revisions in the hatch act 
the hatch law now forbids the nations 3 million federal civil 
service and postal workers from participating actively in politics 
the democratic bill would lift some restrictions so that federal 
employees could hold party offices and solicit campaign funds from 
their coworkers but not from the general public 
the only purpose of this bill dole said is to make the 
federal employee union pacs fatter of which 88 percent of their 
campaign donations goes to the other party this is a big pot of 
gold for the democratic party 
democrats have repeatedly denied that intent saying the bill is 
intended to give federal workers the same right to freedom of 
expression enjoyed by other americans 
while democrats want the senate to complete action on the hatch 
law revisions before moving to the campaign finance reform dole 
indicated that republicans might not wait 
he said the gop campaign finance proposal with its abolition of 
all pacs could come on this measure sometime later this week 
democrats denied any linkage between the proposed hatch law 
changes and campaign finance reform and tried to forestall a 
republican effort to bring the two issues together 
despite repeated assertions that president bush will veto any 
changes democrats so far have garnered at least a dozen votes from 
gop senators on several challenges by the republican leadership to 
the bill 
its going to pass said senate gop whip alan k simpson of 
wyoming im sure we dont have 40 votes he said referring to 
the number needed to sustain a filibuster 
simpson said the major task for republican leaders will come 
later when those of us opposed to the changes will have to try 
to sustain the veto of the president with 34 votes 
the house approved a similar but much broader revision of the 
hatch act by an overwhelming 29790 vote more 13 months ago 
the house measure would permit federal workers to seek and hold 
elected public office and solicit campaign contributions from the 
general public the senate bill would retain current prohibitions 
against those two activities

doubledigit mortgage rates and rising prices 
dampened existing home sales in many areas during the first three 
months of 1990 while boosting them in others a real estate trade 
group reported tuesday 
overall the national association of realtors said sales slipped 
16 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 381 million 
units during the januarymarch period down from 387 million units 
during the fourth quarter sales totaled 390 million during the 
first quarter of 1989 
association president norman d flynn said rising mortgage rates 
had the dual effect of spurring sales in moderatelypriced areas 
while curbing them in higherend markets 
buyers in affordable markets decided to buy before rates rose 
further while those in highcost areas held back flynn 
explained 
the trade groups survey showed the median price of existing 
homes rose 52 percent to 95900 up from 91200 during the same 
period of 1989 the median price means half of the homes cost more 
half less 
mortgage rates also rose starting the quarter at 983 percent 
and ending it at 1022 percent according to the federal home loan 
mortgage association rates have continued to rise and hit 1067 
percent at the end of last week 
nevertheless the realtors said resales are expected to remain 
stable during the year as economic conditions improve 
the realtors survey covered sales of existing singlefamily 
detached homes town houses apartment condominiums and 
cooperatives 
sales were up in 29 states ranging from a 491 percent jump in 
south dakota to a 09 percent increase in nevada at the same time 
vermont posted a 248 percent decrease the largest decline in the 
nation 
by region the west saw sales rise 3 percent to an annual rate 
of 680000 units dominated by activity in california flynn 
reported some softening in highcost coastal areas while sales in 
some lowerpriced interior areas increased 
the south had acrosstheboard increases up 07 percent to 146 
million units as many oilpatch areas continued to regain strength 
but the sales pace in the northeast continued to decline 
dropping 55 percent to 690000 units 
last quarters activity in the northeast reflected high home

new birth control pills containing 
onefifth as much estrogen as the original pills are safe for 
nonsmoking women in their 40s and do not raise the risk for clots 
or cancer researchers report 
dr daniel r mishell chairman of the department of obstetrics 
and gynecology at the university of southern california school of 
medicine and other doctors gave the update monday on the latest 
safety studies of the pill and iuds at the annual meeting of the 
american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 
it also was reported that the food and drug administration is 
expected to approve perhaps this year surgically implanted 
hormone capsules that provide birth control hormones for five 
years this birth control method with the contraceptives usually 
placed under the skin on one arm already is used in more than 40 
countries 
the implants are as effective as daily birth control pills said 
dr francine sinofsky of the university of medicine and dentistry 
of new jersey 
because of health concerns most american women stop using birth 
control pills or iuds after their prime child bearing years 
studies show that they are used by less than 5 percent of women 35 
and older and that sterilization is now the no 1 method of birth 
control among women in the age group 
mishell noted that women remain potentially fertile until nearly 
age 50 and said it is often a real problem deciding what to do 
its really up to the woman but there are many highly 
reliable and generally safe methods of contraception available 
the original pills with strong doses of estrogen were found to 
increase a tendency toward blood clots the new pills use a fifth 
as much estrogen and add another hormone progestin and studies 
show that they present no increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
or of breast cancer 
the new pills have labels which say with fda approval that the 
benefits of birth control pills may outweigh the risks 
but mishell said women who smoke should consider the pills 
dangerous because nicotine and estrogen together worsen the risk of 
blood clotting

science teachers should stop spoonfeeding 
facts to students and allow them to discover the sheer pleasure 
of understanding science a report said tuesday 
the american association for the advancement of science called 
for vast reform in science education from preschool to 
university but said change is most critical at the college level 
science the report said should be viewed as a liberal art 
the experience of learning science as a liberal art must be 
extended to all young people so that they can discover the sheer 
pleasure and intellectual satisfaction of understanding science 
the report said 
the report the result of a threeyear study by academics in the 
arts and sciences said conventional methods of teaching science 
should be abandoned for more studentconducted experiments 
specific goal setting and group work to allow students to analyze 
scientific principles 
professors who simply lecture on scientific facts in 
conventional courses often leave students with underdeveloped 
intellectual skills and little awareness of the influences of 
science on their lives the report said 
among the recommendations in the report the liberal arts of 
science agenda for action were 
fifty percent of the instruction in a baccalaureate degree 
program should be devoted to liberal education at least one 
quarter of that to liberal education in the natural sciences in 
most institutions that is equivalent to 15 to 16 semester hours of 
instruction in science for all students 
studentstudent and studentfaculty interaction should be 
increased 
there should be a major reform of national achievement and 
professional licensing tests scientific and professional societies 
must revise their exams to include all the goals of liberal studies 
in science 
institutions must set specific targets for increasing the 
number of science graduates from minority and disadvantaged groups

supporters of voterapproved insurance rate 
rollbacks were stung by a recommendation that insurers be allowed a 
132 percent profit for last year and up to 19 percent in the 
future 
proposition 103 supporters said mondays decision by an 
administrative law judge could kill voterapproved rate rollbacks 
this decision stands proposition 103 right on its head and 
says its business as usual said harvey rosenfield chief 
author of the november 1988 ballot initiative 
in his decision administrative law judge william j fernandez 
recommended a 132 percent profit for the year that ended in 
november the recommendation is 2 percent above the longterm 
industry average 
the profit margin would be allowed before an insurer was 
required to roll back its rates for automobile homeowners and 
other lines of property and casualty insurance covered by 
proposition 103 
rosenfield a frequent foe of state insurance commissioner 
roxani gillespie said its about what we expected from a judge 
hired by gillespie we think gillespie ought to just stop 
trying to implement proposition 103 and leave it for the next 
commissioner 
asked to respond to rosenfields comments a spokeswoman for 
gillespie said i dont think its important enough to 
the important thing is that we have the judges decision and 
the commissioner is reviewing it now said the spokeswoman carey 
fletcher i really think we need to stop this mickey mouse 
politicking 
tom aceituno legal affairs counsel for the association of 
california insurance companies said the industry group was still 
analyzing the decision and would take a waitandsee attitude to 
see what the commissioner does 
gillespie has 100 days to make a final decision which could be 
challenged in court 
fernandez did not propose any firm limits for insurers profits 
after november 1989 when the insurance commissioner took over 
approval of all rate increases but he said the evidence would 
support a range of 112 to 19 percent 
fernandez rejected consumer groups proposals to limit insurance 
executive salaries and subject companies to mandatory efficiency 
levels before calculating their allowable profit rates 
liberal democracy is growing in the nations of the eastern 
bloc he said communism with its regulatory stifling of 
individual initiative is being rejected we in california should 
take heed of what is occurring elsewhere 
proposition 103 mandated insurance rates be cut 20 percent below 
1987 levels and frozen for a year unless a company faced 
insolvency however the state supreme court ruled last year that a 
rollback could not be used to deny an insurer a fair rate of 
return leaving it to the commissioner to set standards 
consumer groups had sought to disqualify fernandez from the case 
because of alleged bias in favor of the insurance industry they 
said he unfairly limited the hearing preventing them from covering 
issues like redlining where rates are pegged to geographical 
areas and crossexamination of industry experts 
fernandez whose wife is an attorney for a law firm whose 
clients include three insurance companies rejected their 
complaint saying he had no financial or conflict of interest

president bush today assured bolivian 
president jaime paz zamora that you and your countrymen will not 
stand alone in fighting cocaine and trying to improve bolivias 
ailing economy 
winding up three hours of talks at the white house bush 
promised he would seek a substantial increase in economic aid for 
bolivia next year beyond the 88 million earmarked for this year 
he said paz in their private talks had stressed the importance of 
bolivia receiving development assistance 
paz standing alongside bush at a farewell ceremony on the south 
lawn pledged full cooperation in antidrug efforts 
we are fervent allies and we are ready to give you all of our 
efforts and all of our cooperation to everything that would be 
of a common interest paz said 
bush credited paz with overseeing the destruction of more acres 
of coca production in the first four months of the year than was 
eradicated during all of 1989 
saying that bolivia deserves us help bush said you and 
your countrymen will not stand alone in the fight against cocaine 
or in the drive for economic development 
because we do want what you want and that is economic benefit 
for your people bush said and so together were going to wage 
a strong fight 
at the start of their oval office meeting bush told paz he had 
great respect for what you have done in your country for the 
economy and for the fight against narcotics that means so much to 
us 
paz greeted bush as a friend and said it was fitting they should 
meet in the white house because it symbolized the cleanliness 
and the transparency of our friendship and of the relationship 
between our two countries 
the visit comes as us officials tout bolivias efforts to 
reduce its role as a major supplier of usbound cocaine 
a us official who briefed reporters on monday said the united 
states plans to double or triple the number of us trainers 
who are helping bolivians in the war against coca leaf production 
at present the number of such trainers rotating in and out of 
bolivia runs between 20 and 50 
bolivia is the worlds second largest producer of coca but 
lately bolivian farmers have been eager to experiment with 
alternative crops the prime reason is that the drug crackdown in 
colombia where coca leaves are processed into cocaine has led to 
a drastic decline in demand for bolivian coca 
in la paz published reports quoted bolivian officials as saying 
paz is unhappy with us aid levels and plans to ask for more 
during his visit the washington post reported today that he would 
ask bush for up to 150 million a year in new aid 
the colombian campaign began last summer with strong us 
encouragement 
bolivia also has been carrying out what us officials describe 
as a highly successful eradication program 1000 hectares of coca 
destroyed in april alone 
the us officials asking not to be identified said 3500 
hectares have been eliminated thus far this year still more than 
50000 hectares are being used for coca production 
bolivia has been singled out as one of the principal recipients 
of us military aid under bushs antidrug program 
the program totaled only 5 million in 1989 but leaped to 35 
million this year and is expected to be around the same amount 
during the next fiscal year the total 1991 aid package requested 
by the administration including economic assistance is 150 
million 
some of the aid is earmarked for a program under which bolivian 
farmers who agree to stop growing coca leaves are given a 2000 
per hectare credit for switching to an alternate crop a hectare is 
about 25 acres 
until the mid1980s us relations with bolivia were not good 
a reflection of american displeasure over the alleged involvement 
of the bolivian military in drug trafficking during the extended 
periods when generals ran the country 
paz an elected civilian is the first bolivian to make an 
official visit in a generation the us officials said

a videotape that federal prosecutors say shows 
mayor marion barry smoking crack cocaine should be admitted as 
evidence at the mayors june trial the government said tuesday 
the defense wants the tape barred when barry faces charges of 
drug possession and perjury 
meanwhile sources familiar with the investigation said us 
attorney jay b stephens will ask the grand jury to return as many 
as five additional indictments against the mayor 
the new indictments would likely be misdemeanors the sources 
said 
the grand jury that indicted barry on feb 15 met tuesday but 
adjourned without taking any action 
barry who already faces five misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charges and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his 
alleged drug use has pleaded innocent to all charges 
in papers filed in us district court stephens argued that the 
videotape of the events before barrys jan 18 arrest was made with 
the consent of rasheeda moore a government witness who cooperated 
with the sting operation 
prosecutors say barry was arrested in moores hotel room after 
he bought crack from an undercover fbi agent and smoked it 
defense lawyer r kenneth mundy has argued that the videotape 
should be barred because it was made before other routine methods 
of surveillance were tried 
stephens said the procedure was valid because moore authorized 
her room to be bugged 
stephens also urged judge thomas penfield jackson to deny 
mundys request that four of the misdemeanor possession charges be 
consolidated saying each was a separate distinct illegal drug 
transaction 
jackson has set a pretrial hearing for may 25 trial has been 
set for june 4 
if barry is convicted of any of the felony charges he would be 
barred from holding office he has not said whether he will seek a 
fourth term in november

with its economy in dire straits israel came 
to the united states in 1982 for a favor would the us pay a full 
years 910 million in economic aid all at once instead of the 
usual quarterly installments 
the government said yes eight years later the israeli economy 
is in better shape but the unique treatment for israels foreign 
aid remains a part of us law 
not only does israel still get its aid money up front each year 
but since it doesnt need it immediately it uses the money to buy 
us treasury bonds lending the united states back its own cash 
and earning an additional 767 million in interest 
and to make the immediate payment to israel each year the 
united states borrows the aid funds at an additional interest cost 
of up to 70 million 
us law is suffused with such special treatment for its middle 
eastern ally with a value this year of 742 million on top of 3 
billion in cash foreign aid and the list of special provisions 
could grow this week when lawmakers deal with a bill containing 
400 million in loan guarantees to build housing for soviet jews 
emigrating to israel 
the senates version of the bill would waive some 25 million in 
administrative fees along with the usual requirements on 
eligibility for the housing and auditing of the money a competing 
house version is silent on the concessions and conferees are 
scheduled to meet to work out the differences 
dozens of provisions already in the law confer special status to 
israel in business and financial dealings trade military 
cooperation and global politics and like the advance aid payments 
many remain in effect even though they have outlived their original 
justifications 
in answer supporters of israel note its strategic position in 
the unstable middle east its valuable sharing of intelligence 
information about the region and about global terrorism and shared 
political and religious values between the two countries 
much of the aid also is portrayed as a reward for the 1979 camp 
david peace accord with egypt in which israel gave up large tracts 
of land 
but a few members of congress are beginning to raise questions 
about the aid particularly in light of new competing demands for 
scarce aid dollars from emerging democracies in eastern europe and 
latin america 
in the long run i do not think the present high levels of aid 
are good for israel or good for the united states said rep lee 
hamilton dind chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on the middle east 
it should not be looked on as an entitlement program said 
hamilton who has sought to change the foreign aid law to eliminate 
specialinterest provisions dealing not only with israel but with 
other recipients as well 
aside from the issue of money availability israels popularity 
has been strained recently many in the united states including 
some in the bush administration resent what they see as harsh 
israeli tactics in quelling a palestinian uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip the administration is also frustrated by 
israels unwillingness to start talks on palestinian self rule 
still the aid to israel seems secure that was demonstrated by 
a test vote last week in the house when a resolution affirming 
jerusalem as the capital of israel passed 378 to 34 that is the 
israeli governments position in the face of arab criticism 
you are not going to see anybody in congress suggest that the 
middle east get less money than the administration asked for 
said rep david obey dwis chairman of the appropriations 
foreign operations subcommittee 
nobody is going to take onto their own shoulders the 
responsibility for blowing up what is already a highly volatile 
situation he said 
one of israels staunchest supporters rep larry smith dfla 
said that to make any fundamental change in aid now would not only 
worsen israels internal situation but would send the worst 
signal of all to neighboring arab states that are privately 
beginning to accept israels right to exist 
a spokeswoman for the american israel public affairs committee 
which lobbied for many of the special provisions said continued 
aid is important because of instability in the region including 
terrorism and the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons 
aid helps to maintain israel as a strong stable staunchly 
prous democratic ally which is fundamental to americas 
interests said the spokeswoman toby dershowitz aid signals 
that the us is willing to invest in peace in a turbulent but 
vital region 
israels preferred status dates to president harry s trumans 
recognition of the newly formed state on may 14 1948 since then 
the united states has paid out 458 billion in direct aid making 
it the top recipient in the world 
that figure does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars 
israel receives in indirect help from the united states such as 
the advance aid payment provision or the likely waiver of housing 
loan guarantee fees 
the united states imposes few conditions on israel in exchange 
for its aid economic assistance for example is not tied to 
specific development projects as it is in other recipient 
countries rather noted a general accounting office report the 
money serves a budget support and political purpose

the bush administration has told salvadoran 
president alfredo cristiani that the investigation into the murders 
of six jesuits is a serious matter that could affect us 
attitudes on continued aid to el salvador 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said today that message 
was delivered by white house chief of staff john sununu cristiani 
and sununu met monday in san jose costa rica where both were 
attending the presidential inauguration 
cristiani sought the meeting with sununu the spokesman said 
fitzwater said sununu told cristiani the killing of the jesuits 
is a serious matter for the us that must be properly addressed 
and that prosecution of this case would have a significant 
impact in america 
nine salvadoran military men are accused of murdering the six 
jesuit educators last november in san salvador critics say the 
investigation has come to a virtual standstill due to footdragging 
on the part of the salvadoran government 
fitzwater said sununu told cristiani there were antiaid 
feelings in congress because of the stalled investigation when 
asked whether the adminisitration would back away from its support 
of new aid for el salvador the spokesman said the 
administration and everyone in america is concerned about the 
prosecution of the murders and that obviously would have an impact 
on american attitudes 
however he said the administration stands by its request for 
90 million in military aid to el salvador for next year 
we take him at his word that hes trying to prosecute this to 
the best of his ability there are these complicating matters 
fitzwater said alluding to reports that key evidence in the case 
is missing including the diary of a salvadoran commander accused 
in the case 
the state department said monday that the us embassy in san 
salvador has been asked to confirm whether the diary is indeed 
missing 
loss of that evidence would hurt the efforts to extend the 
investigation and could impact on the prosecution of those already 
implicated a state department spokesman said 
the administration has avoided directly criticizing cristiani 
but has stepped up pressure on him to get the investigation back on 
track

democrats in congress on tuesday urged the 
bush administration to prevent aid for the basic human needs of 
the chinese people from opening resumed loans to china by the world 
bank 
it would be a very disappointing state of affairs indeed if 
basic human needs were used as a loophole to allow continued 
repression by the beijing government said rep nancy pelosi 
dcalif 
members of the house banking subcommittee questioned the 
administrations policy of no longer opposing world bank loans to 
china for human needs such as a 30 million credit approved in 
february for earthquake reconstruction 
deputy assistant treasury secretary john m niehuss told the 
panel some 750 million in world bank loans to china are still 
delayed as a result of beijings 1989 crackdown on democracy 
demonstrations including about 550 million that would meet basic 
human needs 
niehuss said there was increasingly strong pressure from 
some of our major allies to resume lending to china and stressed 
the united states does not have the voting power to block world 
bank loans on its own 
he declined to name the allies but reports from beijing have 
told of eagerness for resumed lending by japan and canada other

the united states has suggested a joint 
airlift with the soviet union to provide food for ethiopia where 
famine threatens hundreds of thousands of people a state 
department official said tuesday 
the department is awaiting a response from moscow said herman 
j cohen the assistant secretary of state for africa 
cohen said secretary of state james baker iii presented the idea 
to soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze at their recent 
meeting in bonn west germany 
the famine stems in part from a civil war between the marxist 
government of president mengistu haile mariam and secessionist 
rebels in the northern provinces of tigray and eritrea 
mengistu has long received military hardware and logistical aid 
from the soviet union but cohen said the soviets direct 
involvement in the war appears to be tapering off 
cohen and others told a house select committee on hunger that 
the food situation in ethiopia is better than it was two months 
ago but that the situation remains precarious 
eritrean rebels captured the strategically located port of 
massawa in february and agreed to a truce that would allow the food 
to pass through the port the ethiopians have not agreed to the 
truce 
however cohen said the ethiopians may be slowly coming around 
to see that food relief is a humanitarian issue not a military 
one 
three million people are still at risk said andrew natsios 
of the agency for international development until massawa is 
open none of us can sleep comfortably at night 
while recent efforts to deliver food through sudan and the 
governmentcontrolled port of asseb have helped the situation 
remains grim natsios said 
i am very concerned that the success has created the 
impression that we have met the challenge of moving food into the 
north he said we have not

chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday 
firmly rejected moscows suggestion that settling the military 
complexities of a united germany could be delayed until after the 
countries are merged 
it would be a fatal development if the external and internal 
conditions of german unity were not completely clear when the day 
of german unity comes kohl told reporters 
the chancellor was referring to a suggestion by soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze that formal german unity could occur 
before external aspects of the merger are cleared up 
such external aspects would include those issues with 
international implications such as the military stance of a united 
germany west germany currently belongs to nato while east germany 
is a member of the sovietled warsaw pact 
the soviets oppose a united germany in nato 
during reunification talks saturday in bonn shevardnadze also 
suggested a transition period during which the four wartime 
allies would retain postwar rights even after german unity 
the united states the soviet union france and britain jointly 
control many matters in the former german capital of berlin they 
also have special rights outside berlin many involving the status 
of the troops they maintain in what once were their postwar 
military occupation zones 
shevardnadzes remarks initially triggered jubilation among some 
west german politicians who sensed the pace of unification was 
picking up 
but by tuesday that had changed to concern about delaying 
settlement of important issues related to german unification 
there had even been talk among some politicians of canceling 
west germanys dec 2 national election in favor of elections for a 
united germanys parliament 
but kohl said tuesday without question the dec 2 elections 
will still occur 
vernon a walters the us ambassador to west germany said 
tuesday that washington supports a united germany with unrestricted 
sovereignty and without special rights for any of the world war ii 
allied victors 
a united germany should have full control over its entire 
state territory without any sort of new discriminating limitations 
of german sovereignty walters told a frankfurt meeting of west 
german newspaper and broadcast susbscribers to the associated press 
while the united states has promised it wont stand in the way 
of full sovereignty for a united germany it has also made clear it 
wants a merged germany to be part of the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
kohl has also vowed that a united germany will be a nato member 
moscow has suggested as a compromise that a united germany 
belong to both nato and the warsaw pact until stillundefined 
european security structures are created 
both washington and bonn have said they are prepared to allow 
soviet troops to remain on what is now east german territory for an 
interim period but both have rejected a dualbloc membership 
east germany also reacted negatively to shevardnadzes weekend 
proposals 
government officials in east berlin are skeptical of 
delaying a settlement on the international issues involved in 
unification said the east german news agency adn 
kohl said his government is hoping that the sixnation talks on 
unification which began saturday will conclude before the end of 
this fall he said the international aspects of german unification 
will likely be discussed at the ussoviet summit at the end of 
this month and at a special nato summit in london in july

while nelson mandela was in 
prison he sent a lawyer to his wifes house to remove three men 
who had been abducted there and beaten a witness testified tuesday 
in a murder trial 
mandelas wife winnie has not been charged in the case which 
went to trial one week ago but two alleged victims have testified 
that she was the first to beat them using her fists and a whip 
members of her bodyguard later joined in according to testimony 
monday and tuesday 
james stompie seipei a 14yearold activist was also 
abducted and beaten with the men the witnesses have said he was 
found dead in a field in january 1989 with a stab wound in the neck 
jerry richardson one of mrs mandelas bodyguards who lived at 
her home in the black township of soweto is accused of murdering 
seipei he also is charged with four counts of kidnapping five 
counts of assault and one of attempted murder 
one of the alleged beating victims 20yearold barend mono 
testified tuesday he said that it was mrs mandela who began the 
beatings after the four were abducted in december 1988 from a 
methodist church home 
mrs mandela said last year she was not at home when the alleged 
beatings took place but she said the abductions were justified 
because the men were engaged in homosexual activity with a minister 
running the church home the methodist church says it has 
investigated and cleared the minister of the allegations 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress has 
made no comment on the case since he was freed in february from his 
life prison term for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the 
white government 
mono said mrs mandelas lawyer krish naidoo came to the house 
where the men were held one day richardson instructed the men to 
say they were not abducted but chose to leave the church home 
because of homosexual activity mono told the court 
the next day mandelas lawyer ismail ayob visited the house 
and said he was told by nelson mandela to come and fetch us 
mono testified 
he testified that eventually the three men were freed when they 
were taken to the medical offices of soweto community leader nthato 
motlana 
richardson had taken the teenager seipei away earlier he 
said 
leaders of major antiapartheid organizations and soweto 
community leaders accused mrs mandela early last year of 
complicity in the abductions and assault of the four including 
seipei they also said her bodyguards had waged a reign of 
terror in soweto a black township outside johannesburg 
the antiapartheid leaders called on the black community to shun 
mrs mandela but a few months later she began appearing at 
rallies with other leaders 
since mandela was freed she has regularly appeared at his side 
during public events 
on monday another alleged victim kenneth kgase 30 testified 
that mrs mandela assaulted all four of the captives punching and 
whipping them and pulling their hair 
in addition to richardson eight other bodyguards for mrs 
mandela face separate trials on lesser charges stemming from the 
incident

a manhole by any other name could be a 
person entry exit port or personhole contestants say 
in a tongueincheek citysponsored bid to find the neuter form 
for the scruffy iron fixture 
prompted by the sensitivity of the city councils female 
majority to feminist issues the public works department called for 
suggestions to replace the familiar appellation responses much 
to the astonishment of city officials have come in from all over 
the world 
the winning synonym for sacramentos 26379 circular lids is 
expected to be announced wednesday night at a council meeting 
the calls came in from everywhere said christine olsen a 
city spokeswoman but its not really a formal contest its just 
that some of our public works people had ideas for a change and it 
got blown out of proportion she said she had no estimate of the 
number of entries 
many people are calling with lewd and offensive suggestions 
and others angrily want to know about the women who are taking 
over the city council said a city receptionist an employee at 
the city sewer department listed in the telephone directory under 
manhole covers said the controversy has really had no effect 
here its all over at the council 
interest in the issue rose after city civil engineer randy witt 
suggested at a council meeting last month that the city hold a 
forfun manhole terminology change contest to spur interest on the 
engineering staff 
one newspaper headline said the city was blowing the lid off 
sexist manholes while another proclaimed that a tempest in 
a manhole sweeps city 
a radio station in hamilton new zealand sacramentos sister 
city held a renaming contest in which sewer viewer captured 
the top prize other new zealand nomenclature included 
peoplehole peephole and underground service access usa 
hole 
the ninemember city council has had a fivemember female 
majority since last falls elections including mayor anne rudin 
who lauded the public works department for keeping up with 
contemporary standards 
but olsen said the panel did not order any changes in the 
terminology used by the department 
were all just kind of amazed olsen said weve really 
been getting a lot of calls and they seem to think that the female 
majority on the city council ordered the change to nonsexist 
language thats not true actually somebody saw the term manhole 
covers in an internal report and said hey maybe its time we 
made this change just for fun and ask around and see if anybody 
has any ideas on on what to call them olsen said 
for years olsen added many city workers have referred to the 
2footdiameter lids as utility covers 
for decades the public works department employees were 
largely male so the department has been making a concerted effort 
to have women participate in some of the nontraditional jobs 
she said 
its not insignificant said deborah franklin a 
fundraising coordinator for the california chapter of the national 
organization for women we feel language is of importance they 
are not holes for men they are holes for sewers 
but if you suggest a change immediately there is this uproar 
people saying oh those women there they go again some people 
are threatened in something as simple as changing the names of 
manhole covers

old spaghetti may sound cold and clammy but two 
restaurant chains thought it was hot enough to fight over it in 
court 
the old spaghetti warehouse based in suburban garland has 
agreed to drop the word old from its corporate moniker and will 
pay 400000 to settle litigation brought by an older 
competitor of nearly the same name 
about three years ago the owner of a portland orebased chain 
called the old spaghetti factory filed two lawsuits against the 
texas chain 
the owner alleged that the old spaghetti warehouse had stolen a 
recipe using mytzithra cheese a greek cheese made from goats 
milk and copied the use of trolleys as booths 
on monday old spaghetti warehouse announced it would scrap 
old from the signs on its stores and delete any mention of 
mytzithra cheese from its menu but the company which denies 
taking its competitors sauce recipe will continue to be able to 
use the special cheese 
we are pleased that the litigation is finally behind us 
robert hawke president of the 15store 28 million texas company 
said this removes a cloud over our future and will allow us to 
proceed with our franchise plans 
old spaghetti warehouse opened its first restaurant in dallas in 
1972 and has since opened 14 other companyowned stores in eight 
states the company went public in 1985 
the old spaghetti factory chain was established in 1970 and has 
28 stores the lawsuits settled monday were filed in federal court 
in atlanta the only market in which both companies have stores

attorney general dick thornburgh denied 
tuesday that he has abandoned support for tougher penalties for 
whitecollar criminals and promised strong recommendations on the 
subject after it receives more study 
i stand second to none in pressing for nothing less than the 
maximum penalties that we can accommodate under the law for 
corporate offenders thornburgh told the senate judiciary committee 
he said toughened sentencing guidelines that were withdrawn 
recently remain under study and could be reissued later 
thornburgh has made cracking down on crime in the suites a 
theme of his rule at the justice department but last month his 
aides acknowledged that he withdrew the proposed sentencing 
guidelines at white house request 
the administration reportedly acted after an intense lobbying 
campaign by defense contractors oil companies and others that 
envisioned the proposals as something resembling a corporate 
death penalty for a number of firms 
the guidelines produced by the us sentencing commission were 
revealed last fall they would require stiff mandatory fines on 
companies convicted of polluting fraud and other whitecollar 
offenses 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said that when the guidelines 
were withdrawn he was concerned that the department of justice 
has surrendered so easily to pressure from the white house and big 
business to go soft on whitecollar crime 
thornburgh said the department does not repudiate the proposed 
corporate sentencing guidelines but that the recommendations had 
not been given adequate review he said they are now being given 
that review with an eye toward eventually issuing something 
similar 
he said there was no deadline for issuing guidelines on 
corporate penalties but promised that he would make his 
recommendations public at some point i favor strong penalties 
against whitecollar criminals thornburgh said 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio however complained that 
whitecollar offenders are too often staying out of jail your 
prosecutors are wheeling and dealing constantly without anyone 
going to the slammer he said 
but thornburgh said i think youd have a hard time explaining 
that to woody lemons lemons the former chairman of a texas 
savings and loan was recently sentenced to 30 years in prison the 
stiffest sentence so far in the probe of massive fraud in the 
thrift industry 
metzenbaum persisted however urging the attorney general to 
impress government disapproval of corporate fraud on the country 
club set 
thornburgh promised to get metzenbaum a list of whitecollar 
offenders who have been sentenced to prison i will hope to 
disabuse you of what is obviously a mistaken view he said

a man who abandoned his emaciated battered 
7yearold son at a freeway rest stop has been sentenced to 40 
years in prison for four counts of seconddegree assault involving 
the boy 
sadism fits more aptly than any other term i can think of to 
describe the behavior of edward donald tuinman 30 said yakima 
county superior court judge bruce hanson 
the judge reserved judgment monday on whether the sentence would 
run concurrently with a 10year term for abandonment in idaho 
the earlier sentence stemmed from the discovery of ed little 
eddy tuinman emaciated battered and burned by cigarettes at a 
rest stop on interstate 84 near boise on jan 4 1989 authorities 
said the boy who is mute and retarded was abandoned while 
tuinman his wife and their other children were moving from 
washington state to arizona 
tuinmans wife deborah was not charged because authorities 
said she also had been abused by him 
defense lawyer rick hoffman said the exceptional sentence 10 
years on each count to run consecutively would be appealed the 
standard sentencing range for each assault count is 43 to 53 
months hoffman said 
deputy prosecutor steve keller recommended the 40year sentence 
for charges covering four types of abuse shooting the boy with 
bbs from an air gun holding a hunting knife to the boy and poking 
the tip into his feet and legs choking and hitting the boy and 
burning him with cigarettes 
tuinman pleaded guilty and asked to be forgiven by the court 
his family and eddy 
it hurts down inside me he sobbed i cant believe it 
happened 
he hung his head while the judge viewed a videotape of a cabin 
the tuinmans occupied in nearby buena the tape showed blood 
stains dents where the child was thrown against plasterboard bbs 
embedded in the wall and cords used to tie the boy to his bed at 
night 
we dont often see cases where children are repeatedly and 
consistently and sadistically abused in the manner ed junior 
was said sheriffs detective rose roberson our outlook of the 
human race has been jaded just a bit by what weve seen 
other children in the family were forced to join in beating 
their brother roberson said 
the elder tuinman was abused as a child and may have suffered 
brain damage from three head injuries so he did not have all 
things working properly for him hoffman said 
since being placed with a family in the boise area the little 
boy has gained weight and is walking and feeding himself roberson 
said

the reputed mentor of a group holding two 
us hostages said tuesday he fears that a western captive could be 
executed if rumors are true that four longmissing iranians are 
dead 
if the death of the four iranians is ascertained that will 
definitely affect the hostage issue said hussein musawi a 
shiite moslem fundamentalist one of the kidnap groups might 
react by murdering a hostage 
i dont have any concrete information on that musawi said 
by telephone from his headquarters in the east lebanon city of 
baalbek but they have done it before whats there to stop them 
from doing it again 
the four iranians were seized by rightwing lebanese forces 
militiamen north of beirut in july 1982 they are widely believed 
to have been killed either in civilwar shelling or by their 
captors 
in a separate interview with the communistrun voice of the 
people radio station musawi did not specifically rule out further 
releases but he said he did not expect the hostage issue to be 
settled this year because the united states has made no 
conciliatory gesture following the release of two americans last 
month 
this issue has turned into a very complicated one because of 
the negative us stand the hostage issue will be frozen for a 
certain period of time he added 
musawi heads islamic amal a prosyrian faction in the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god hezbollah is believed to 
be the umbrella for shiite extremists holding most of the 16 
westerners missing in lebanon the hostages include six americans 
the captive held longest is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
musawi also is the reputed mentor of the proiranian islamic 
jihad for the liberation of palestine the group that freed us 
educator robert polhill on april 22 after 39 months in captivity 
the move was followed by the organization of islamic dawns 
april 30 release of another american frank reed after 43 months 
as a hostage 
the kidnappers and iranian officials have asked that the fate of 
the four iranians be determined president bush has said the united 
states could try to help account for them and he publicy thanked 
iran and syria for helping secure the freedom of polhill and reed 
musawi said those who wield influence over the hostageholders 
especially iran will resume their efforts when positive 
indications appear from the west 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated monday 
that the united states will make no deals for the release of the 
hostages 
you cannot let terrorists think they can steal american 
citizens and beat them up and just steal more and more and more and 
more he said 
musawi told the ap he believes no more hostages will be freed 
before israel and its militia allies in lebanon free some 400 
lebanese and palestinian prisoners another key demand made by the 
kidnappers and tehran 
and i think they wont he said if the americans want to 
solve the hostage issue they should solve the problem of the 
moslems and oppressed held by israel and its surrogates 
there has been growing pressure on israel to free its arab 
detainees to help win freedom for the hostages 
israel says it is not opposed to a swap in principle but that 
such an exchange should include three israeli servicemen captured 
in lebanon in 1986 and believed held by radical shiites linked to 
the proiranian hezbollah militia 
gen antoine lahad commander of the israelibacked south 
lebanon army said monday he will not release any of the 300 shiite 
prisoners his group holds unless efforts are made to free 
militiamen and israeli soldiers held by shiite groups

dollar terms costing nearly twice as much as it does to live in 
new york according to a survey of 83 cities published tuesday

index of 192 it said an overvalued currency was the main reason 
the iranian capital proved so expensive

middle of last year helped bring down the costs of living in japan 
in comparison with other countries the survey said 
it said tokyo frequently the most expensive city in previous 
international surveys was the secondmostexpensive city with a 
costofliving index of 150 osaka stands at 133

after performing god bless america before 
enthusiastic muscovites outside a hotel near the kremlin members 
of an american legion band were looking forward tuesday to marching 
through red square itself 
but dorothy hill 74 the leader of the band from waltham 
mass said the musicians have already accomplished their main 
mission promoting peace understanding and togetherness between 
the soviet and american people 
mrs hill singlehandedly spent three years working her way 
through the soviet bureaucracy to bring the 70member allmale 
band to moscow as a peace move between the superpowers 
on wednesday the joseph p hill american legion band named 
after mrs hills late husband will become the first american band 
to march in moscows annual victory day parade commemorating the 
defeat of nazi germany 
the bands members range in age from 17 to 82 and include 
veterans of world war ii korea and vietnam 
the band began its 10day trip on saturday and already there 
have been some emotional moments particularly two impromptu 
concerts sunday and monday outside the hotel rossiya across from 
the kremlin 
the band played god bless america the us and soviet 
national anthems and other patriotic tunes and soon curious 
soviets including some bemedaled world war ii veterans were 
clapping dancing and singing along 
it was one of the most emotional times of my life said mrs 
hill speaking in her thick boston accent the people there 
watching and listening were shedding tears we were shedding tears 
it proved my point right there that reaction of your people 
and our people that peace is possible mrs hill told a news 
conference at the headquarters of the soviet peace committee 
people togetherness and weve seen it the last couple of 
nights 
mrs hill a world war ii coast guard veteran began planning 
the trip after having a dream that we should never see another 
war 
with no soviet contacts she used charm and persistence staying 
up through the night to dial telephone operators in moscow to find 
someone to contact 
finally one operator put her in touch with the soviet peace 
committee and once we got them the show was on the road she 
said 
at a ceremony tuesday soviet peace committee chairman genrik 
borovik praised mrs hill as a remarkable wonderful woman 
im happy that she broke american bureaucracy and soviet 
bureaucracy said borovik who as a television commentator often 
criticized us foreign policy before mikhail s gorbachev came to 
power 
borovik called the bands presence unusual because of the 
american legions reputation as a rightwing organization which 
was always let me say not the best friend of the soviet union 
john jake comer of quincy mass a past american legion 
national commander said the tears just came out of my eyes as 
the band played god bless america and he held the soviet and 
american flags during the impromptu concerts 
ive been to 18 countries had an audience with the pope 
visited the oval office with presidents reagan bush he said 
ive done everything but nothing as moving as that 
mrs hill said she didnt always have warm feelings toward the 
soviet union recalling the cold war 
i was as bad as everbody was in those days the communists 
what are they doing to us and so forth she said now however 
we love em we love em we had the opportunity as people to 
prove it

the share of firsttime mothers receiving paid 
maternity leave has nearly tripled in recent years while only half 
as many have quit their jobs the census bureau said tuesday 
more than 60 percent of new mothers quit working from 1961 
through 1965 while only 28 percent did so from 1981 through 1985 
on the other hand almost half received paid maternity leave in 
the second survey period up from 16 percent in the first 
while the study work and family patterns of american women 
includes data only through 1985 it does show historical trends 
starting in the 1960s 
the report was released as congress is considering a bill that 
would require employers with 50 or more workers to offer unpaid 
time off with job and benefit protection for the care of newborn 
newly adopted or seriously ill children as well as to deal with 
personal health problems or ill spouses or parents 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush urges 
companies to provide paid parental leaves voluntarily but is 
unwilling to force them to do it 
the report comes just a day after the national center for health 
statistics reported that the increase in births in recent years 
continued into 1989 with 4021000 births up from 3913000 a year 
earlier 
births have risen steadily in recent years as the giant baby 
boom generation passed through its prime childbearing years 
although this has resulted in an increase in the actual number 
of births birth rates remain well below those of the baby boom era 
of the 1950s and early 1960s 
the census report found that younger women are more likely to 
quit their jobs or to be fired when they become pregnant than are 
older mothers 
from the ages of 18 to 22 43 percent of new mothers left work 
while only 20 percent of those having a first child at age 25 and 
over left their jobs 
overall 63 percent of women having their first children from 
1961 to 1965 did not return to work the study said that fell to 
51 percent in the 197175 period and 28 percent from 1981 through 
1985 
those receiving paid maternity or sick leave when having their 
first baby totaled only 16 percent in the early 1960s by the first 
half of the 1970s it was 23 percent and in the first half of the 
1980s 47 percent 
the share of women receiving unpaid leave meaning they were 
promised a job on their return from maternity leave rose from 14 
percent in the early 1060s to 21 percent in the 1970s then slipped 
to 20 percent in the 1980s 
the share fired from their jobs was nearly constant 50 percent 
in the early 1960s and 46 percent in the later periods 
in the early 1960s 27 percent of firsttime mothers said they 
never stopped working that dipped to 17 percent in the early 
1970s but rose to 28 percent in the early 1980s

libyan leader moammar gadhafi said he 
considered attacking a us military base on the greek island of 
crete with missiles if american planes had resumed bombing libya in 
1986 a newspaper said 
the idea was dropped because of close libyangreek relations and 
the danger to civilians gadhafi was quoted as telling an 
international peace conference saturday 
gadhafi gave a fiery 35minute speech via satellite to the 
international conference for peace in the mediterranean in 
ierapetra on crete last weekend the newspaper eleftherotypia said 
monday 
the united states maintains two bases on the mediterranean 
island an air force communications station near iraklion eastern 
crete and a supply depot for the 6th fleet at suda bay 
the navy base on the western tip of crete about 500 miles from 
the libyan capital of tripoli is within range of libyan missiles 
military analysts said former socialist premier andreas 
papandreou who governed greece from 198189 maintained close ties 
with third world leaders and had praised gadhafi for his 
antiamerican rhetoric 
in his speech gadhafi said us intentions to close the naval 
communications station near the greek capital were a welcome move 
the fact that the us base at nea makri is closing gladdens 
us especially and we hope the same will happen with the us base 
at lampedusa in italy he said 
lampedusa which houses a us coast guard base came under 
libyan rocket attack in april 1986 after us planes bombed 
tripoli but the rockets fell into the sea far short of their mark 
as part of a worldwide austerity plan the united states has 
announced it will close the us air force base adjacent to athens 
international airport the closing of the two bases will leave the 
two on crete and 20 small units in various parts of greece 
the threeday conference was attended mostly by leftistoriented 
participants who called for a denuclearized mediterranean and an 
end to foreign bases and fleets in the region

the government pulled up the welcome mat 
tuesday for the goddess of democracy radio ship saying it would 
not be allowed to broadcast prodemocracy messages to china from 
taiwanese waters 
government spokesman shaw yuming urged the radio ship to 
observe international laws that ban unauthorized broadcasts 
the government has not and will not become involved in the 
operation of the radio ship shaw said 
shaw made his remarks after top government officials met to 
discuss how to handle the touchy problems raised by the radio ship 
the chinese government has warned that any help provided by 
taiwan for the ship would be considered an open provocation 
the ships presence could jeopardize a recent thaw in the 
historically chilly relations between taipei and the communist 
government in beijing tensions across the 100mile taiwan strait 
have eased marked by increased trade and travel between the two 
countries in recent years 
the ships spokesman xu tianfang said the goddess of democracy 
was scheduled to arrive in the northern taiwanese port of keelung 
on friday to refuel and take on provisions before heading to 
international waters to begin broadcasts 
xu deputy secretary of the parisbased boat for china 
foundation the ships main organizer said the ships agent would 
apply for a port entry permit 
the government has not received any applications from the ship 
shaw said 
if that happens we will make proper decisions based on 
humanitarianism international practices and domestic laws he 
said without specifying whether the ship would be allowed into 
keelung 
the communications ministry has said the ship would be allowed 
to dock in keelung unless the government issues instructions to the 
contrary 
wang shihhsiung an independent legislator said he has 
organized a flotilla of taiwanese fishing boats to form a boat 
wall to escort the radio ship into keelung 
xu said the ships sponsors have dropped plans to have leading 
exiled chinese dissidents board the ship in keelung to make the 
broadcasts 
but he would not rule out the possibility that at least one 
prominent dissident yan jiaqi might join in the broadcasts if he 
chooses to do so 
yan chairman of the federation for a democratic china a 
parisbased chinese dissident organization arrived in taipei 
monday for a weeklong visit 
yan a professor and former member of chinas top think tank 
fled china last june following the bloody crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijings tiananmen square 
the 1200ton goddess of democracy sailed from france march 17 
for international waters off the chinese coast from where it plans 
to broadcast music news and prodemocracy messages to the mainland 
the chinese government has refused to rule out the use of force 
to stop the planned broadcasts 
the goddess of democracy took on provisions last week in 
singapore but hong kong refused to allow the ship to enter its 
waters officials in the british crown colony are sensitive about 
relations with china which is scheduled to take over hong kong in 
1997 
the ship is sponsored by a coalition of press organizations 
headed by the french news magazine actuel with the cooperation of 
the federation for a democratic china 
the goddess of democracy is named after the statue erected by 
prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square last may it was 
destroyed during the june 4 military crackdown that left hundreds 
perhaps thousands of demonstrators dead 
the nationalist chinese government fled to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to communist forces in mainland china

the soviet unions chief arms control adviser 
said tuesday that continued us opposition to naval arms talks 
could damage superpower ties 
we think that this policy is unjust and aimed at undermining 
security and gaining military superiority over the soviet union 
marshal sergei akhromeyev said of the american refusal to negotiate 
over a ban on shortrange nuclear weapons in the superpower navies 
akhromeyev made the comments in his first appearance before a 
senate armed services subcommittee and his second trip before a 
congressional panel in less than a year 
president mikhail s gorbachevs principal arms control adviser 
and a member of the supreme soviet akhromeyev said us opposition 
to naval arms talks could jeopardize significant cuts in armed 
forces and weapons down the road 
we consider that sooner or later if we do not want to stop the 
negotiations on reduction of nuclear and conventional arms naval 
forces cuts negotiations are unavoidable said akhromeyev 
he also said the issue of whether the soviets should give up 
their ss24 nuclear missile if the united states gives up the 
multiplewarhead mx missile on railroad cars should be addressed in 
talks once a treaty to reduce strategic weapons by 50 percent is 
signed 
it would be good if experts of our countries in this issue 
really studied this prior to getting into those future 
negotiations that issue is already on the agenda of the day 
akhromeyev said 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the projection forces 
and regional defense subcommittee invited akhromeyev to appear 
before the panel to discuss naval arms reductions 
in a new wrinkle to ussoviet relations akhromeyev said his 
country would be willing to include landbased soviet aircraft used 
to protect its naval forces in talks on banning the navies 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
we think that nuclear weapons of all kinds of systems at sea 
should be the subject of negotiations akhromeyev said in 
other words the nuclear systems which are deployed on aircraft 
carriers on submarines and on aviation 
at the malta summit last december gorbachev pressed president 
bush on such talks and on limiting submarinelaunched cruised 
missiles 
bush rejected gorbachevs call for naval arms talks arguing 
that the united states is a naval power 
and members of the senate subcommittee raised serious doubts 
about imposing limitations on us naval forces 
i am opposed to limiting the qualitative or quantitative naval 
forces said sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on 
the committee and a former secretary of the navy 
sen william cohen rmaine said any reduction in the united 
states access to sea lanes is tantamount to losing oxygen to our 
lungs and added the arms control agenda is already overloaded 
on another issue akhromeyev said the soviet union did not 
violate the ussoviet agreement in december 1987 to eliminate 
shortrange nuclear weapons even though some ss23s have been found 
in east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia 
akhromeyev said the weapons without nuclear warheads were sold 
to those nations prior to the treaty and so they do not violate the 
pact

lithuania is cutting meat shipments to soviet 
ministries by 10 percent in hopes of using the scarce food to 
barter with soviet factories for oil and other supplies a 
government spokesman said tuesday 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has cut off oil and most 
natural gas shipments to lithuania in an attempt to force it to 
rescind laws backing its march 11 declaration of independence the 
breakaway republic which expects to run out of oil by next week 
already has laid off 12500 people for lack of fuel 
lithuania will sell some of the meat to its own people and use 
the rest for barter trade said aidas palubinskas of the government 
press office 
meat is in extremely short supply in the soviet union making it 
a valuable item for trade to workers in factories that produce 
items lithuania needs 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia promptly accused 
lithuania of cutting milk and meat supplies to strike back against 
the soviet sanctions 
lithuania has decided to retaliate izvestia said it has 
nothing to lose meat shops in vilnius now are selling only cows 
hoofs and pigs heads 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis denied that vengeance 
played any part in the decision he cited the soviet failure to 
ship feed grain to the republic 
lithuanias antiblockade committee on tuesday ordered 
preparation of a list of other strategic goods that may be pulled 
from export in the future the press office said 
the soviet union has virtually halted shipments of wood and 
certain plastics since the blockade began last month the press 
office said metal supplies have been cut by half paper shipments 
by 25 percent 
at a news conference tuesday evening landsbergis also advised 
lithuanians not to be bothered by soviet soldiers marching through 
the city in wednesdays parade to mark the end of world war ii 
the best way to react is to completely ignore the parade shut 
your windows and even shut the shutters he said according to 
rita dapkus of the governments press office 
landsbergis added that world war ii is continuing in a sense 
because the soviet union is refusing to give up the territory it 
occupied then lithuania latvia and estonia are all trying to 
regain the independence they had until soviet troops occupied their 
lands they were forcibly annexed to the soviet union in 1940

wannsee a warning 
wannsee the end the final solution 
the target jews all jews everywhere 
only jews 
what does a jew today feel in this place marked by evil and 
malediction 
fear and trembling anger incommensurate anger helplessness 
and grief infinite grief 
cry one must not cry here if you begin you will not stop 
how many tears does one shed for thousands of communities 
how long does one lament the death of tens of thousands of 
hundreds of thousands of inoccent abandoned forsaken victims 
if only the walls could speak 
if only the trees and clouds could testify 
we need to hear them for most german men and women in the 
past refused to speak refuse to remember 
it is here that in a businesslike atmosphere of banality and 
efficiency twelve german high government officials in the name of 
their criminal leadership on behalf of their nation condemned the 
entire jewish people to death and oblivion teachers and their 
pupils brides and grooms intellectuals and workers rabbis and 
their disciples young revolutionaries and old dreamers of zion 
all were doomed simply solely as jews 
at that time children were still playing in the streets of 
sighet and saloniki 
others were still begging for bread in the ghettos of warsaw and 
bialystok 
still others were praying for the coming of the messiah in the 
hidden bunkers and attics of vilna and lublin 
here they were already dead and they did not know it 
it is jewish history that the germans tried to annihilate here 
it is jewish memory that germany tried to eradicate here 
forever 
that is what a jew remembers in wannsee 
but wannsee also means for us jews that memory is stronger than 
its enemies 
it means that jewish hope has vanquished fear 
it means that when we jews visit and listen to the somber and 
dark echoes at wannsee we aim at preventing future generations 
from inheriting our past as their future

president saddam hussein displayed several 
locallymade electric devices tuesday which he said were similar 
to components seized by british customs agents who claimed they 
were triggers for nuclear weapons 
saddam held up the devices before about 2000 arabs attending a 
baghdad rally as he accused the west of trying to hinder iraqs 
technical development 
he refuted charges by britain and the united states that iraq 
was trying to obtain electric triggering devices for use in a 
nuclear weapons program 
the devices seized by customs officers in march at londons 
heathrow airport had been manufactured in the united states 
he also held up what he described as a usmade condenser 
similar to those seized in britain he said iraq had earlier been 
able to import some of the same devices produced by an american 
company 
the ones they seized were not all what crossed he said 
without further elaboration 
saddam reiterated iraqs denial that the devices were nuclear 
triggers he said they were electrical condensers intended for use 
by the university of technology 
at the rally saddam held up two electric devices which he said 
were made by iraqi technicians at the ministry of industry and 
military industrialization 
only five days after the americans said they seized them our 
young men in the military industry managed to produce two 
condensers saddam told the rally called to express solidarity 
with iraq 
if the british or the americans want to import some of these 
devices which are labeled made in iraq they can negotiate a deal 
with the ministry of industry and military industrialization he 
said to cheers from the arab delegates 
saddam said the technicians without being asked produced two 
samples in two different government enterprises 
the iraqi leader also accused the west of conducting a campaign 
to hinder what he described as iraqs technical and scientific 
advancement 
he said the west chases iraq wherever it purchased equipment 
in order to prevent it and consequently the arab nation from 
looking to the future 
saddam said iraq will not abandon its technical research despite 
pressure from the west 
technical and scientific advancement is the new title of 
patriotism so how can an honest and patriotic man retract from 
such a course he said 
saddam said the campaign against iraq started in march after his 
government hanged a londonbased iranian journalist farzod bazoft 
accused of spying for israel and britain 
he accused the west of threatening iraq because of its support 
for arab nationalism 
iraq has denied any intention of developing nuclear weapons but 
saddam created a furor by saying iraq would unleash its chemical 
arsenal against israel in case of an israeli attack 
at the time of the joint usbritish customs sting operation in 
march iraq said the devices described by us prosecutors as 
nuclear warhead detonation capacitors allegedly being smuggled to 
baghdad were intended for a nonnuclear university laser project 
the 40 capacitors seized in march were labeled as air 
conditioning units in an effort to get around us bans on export 
of militarily sensitive technology us officials said 
three people were arrested in england in connection with the 
case after an 18month investigation by us and british customs 
officials 
capacitors can be used to create the first electrical spark in 
the chain reaction that leads to a nuclear explosion

more than 100 million president bush wants 
for building logging roads in national forests should be spent on 
trails and recreational facilities that deteriorated in the 1980s 
environmentalists said on monday 
the us forest service wants to spend 10 times as much money 
on logging roads as it does on trails thats an unacceptable 
imbalance that reflects the misplaced priorities of an agency with 
a timberfirst approach to forest management said jay watson 
the wilderness societys forest specialist 
this fundamental imbalance has resulted in a logging road 
network that would go around the world more than eight times while 
at the same time our trail system has been allowed to fall into a 
state of disrepair he said 
the national wildlife federation sierra club national audubon 
society and amercian hiking society joined in the call to redirect 
road contstruction funds into trail maintenance and construction 
wildlife management and recreation programs 
susan henley executive director of the american hiking society 
said trail usage has doubled since 1970 
theres an increased recognition by the american public that 
trails are are good healthfull recreation the demand is exceeding 
the supply she said 
fran hunt of the national wildlife federation said the forest 
service estimates a benefittocost ratio of nearly 10 for every 
1 spent on fish and wildlife management while the ratio for 
logging and roads is less than 2to1 
if you want to increase the economic values you would 
increase fish and wildlife spending not logging and roading she 
said 
hunt said the roads the forest service builds to help harvest 
timber would also displace wildlife degrade habitats and cause 
erosion that results in tremendous loss of fishing resources 
in some areas the damage to the fisheries exceeds the value 
of the timber harvested she said 
watson said bushs budget proposals represent cuts from levels 
congress approved last year of 17 percent for trail construction 
and 55 percent for maintenance of recreation facilities including 
campgrounds boat ramps and visitor centers 
the coaltion said bush should be held accountable for the 
spending blueprint even though much of the deterioration occured 
over the past 10 years under the reagan administration 
watson said 360000 miles of logging roads currently cover the 
national forest systems 156 units and another 33000 miles are 
planned in the next decade 
about 100000 miles of trails cover the same area but there is 
nearly a 200 million backlog of trail reconstruction and 
maintenance in national forests he said 
the environmental groups said if 100 million were diverted from 
the roads fund toward other programs there still would be 200 
million left for logging road construction enough to build and 
reconstruct more than 5700 miles of roads on national forests

the bush administration can modernize the air 
traffic control system without raising ticket taxes to pay for it 
the congressional audit agency said tuesday 
increased modernization costs and expanded use of the 
aviation trust fund to pay for operations expenses do not 
necessarily require an immediate increase in user fees john w 
hill jr of the general accounting office told a house panel 
the bush administration has proposed raising ticket taxes from 8 
percent to 10 percent to finance the modernization 
the administration has also proposed that the aviation trust 
fund pay a greater share of the operating costs of the federal 
aviation administration 
the trust fund was set up in 1970 to pay for the equipment costs 
of maintaining safety in the skies the fund is financed chiefly 
through ticket taxes but also through fees on cargo and aviation 
fuel 
despite its name it is a bookkeeping account which must be 
spent according to annual congressional directives 
hill testified before the public works and transportation 
investigations subcommittee the subcommittee is trying to 
determine if excess balances are building up and if so why congress 
is not spending them 
since 1971 the aviation trust fund account has been used for a 
share of faa personnel and administrative costs the administration 
has proposed raising the share from the current 58 percent to 85 
percent arguing that private commercial and general aviation 
account for 85 percent of the faas costs 
hill said the faa could afford to use the trust fund to cover 75 
percent of operating costs plus pay for modernization with no 
increase in fees 
hill referred to the national airspace system plan which was 
initiated in 1981 to replace computer radar and communication 
equipment major delays and addons have caused the estimated cost 
to rise from 12 billion to 16 billion 
faa now acknowledges that modernization will need continuous 
funding and not end in 1991 as its preliminary costbenefit 
analysis for the nas plan indicated hill said 
by being used to purchase government bonds that are not counted 
in the deficit the aviation and highway trust funds just mask the 
true size of the deficit instead of being spent to clear congested 
airways and repair highways critics say 
critics also say other similar trust funds elsewhere in the 
government are similarly used 
the transportation department projects a cash balance for the 
aviation fund of close to 15 billion by the end of september it 
was expected to take in 51 billion during the current fiscal 
year about twothirds of which is revenue from the ticket tax and 
a quarter is interest earnings but pay out only 35 billion 
similarly the department projects a cash balance of 18 billion 
in the highway fund by the end of september this year of which 7 
billion is in a mass transportation account 
hill said a real surplus of 34 billion will exist for new 
highway spending when the fiveyear spending authority for the 
highway fund ends in 1991 the highway fund is financed through a 
9centagallon gasoline tax and 15centagallon diesel tax was 
well as other fees 
the highway money goes to states which administer projects 
hill said states can afford much more highway spending than 
congress now allows with its spending ceilings 
he pointed out that in 1989 congress set a ceiling of 12 
billion even though 22 billion was available 
kate l moore assistant transportation secretary for budget and 
programs said the highway fund is highly leveraged with the 11 
billion balance supporting 33 in spending commitments through the 
addition of state funds 
she said much of the balance in the funds represents accumulated 
interest owed by the treasury since the surplus is invested in 
government securities spending down too much money would add to 
the deficit she said

dempsey said frankly i thought no one up here gave a darn 
adams said he received no reaction to his semiannual reports to 
congress over five years until the one last spring that drew 
attention to hud and began unraveling broader scandals of 
influencepeddling fraud and political favoritism at the 
department 
potential fraud and management problems in some of those 
programs were pointed out in previous reports that went unnoticed 
he said 
i believe this inaction allowed huds problems to perpetuate 
and grow to the point of scandal as we all have seen adams said 
in his prepared testimony 
both adams and dempsey spoke to the senate banking committees 
subcommittee on the hud scandals which has been holding hearings 
on ways to improve congressional oversight and hud management the 
panels hearings have gone largely unnoticed while a house 
subcommittee drew attention for its investigation into the hud 
scandals 
under questioning adams said he found startling revelations 
in the testimony last week before the house panel by former hud 
deputy assistant secretary dubois l gilliam who gave detailed 
accusations that politics dominated decisions about who got federal 
housing grants under former secretary samuel r pierce jr 
adams said his office is consulting with justice department 
officials to ensure all gilliams allegations are investigated in 
an interview later adams said he would be consulting also with the 
courtappointed special prosecutor investigating pierce 
gilliam testified under a grant of immunity from further 
prosecution he pleaded guilty to charges of accepting gratuities 
and abuse of hud programs last year after his activities were 
uncovered by adams office 
adams declined to say which of gilliams allegations over three 
days of testimony came as a surprise to him or merited further 
investigation 
hud secretary jack kemp referred angrily to gilliams charges in 
a separate appearance before a senate appropriations subcommittee 
i am outraged that a former hud official would suggest to a 
committee of the congress as dubois gilliam did last week that 
congress had better watch hud becaause its an election year 
kemp said 
there is no room for politicking and profiteering at hud 
kemp said

arch moore the maverick republican who 
became west virginias only threeterm governor this century 
pleaded guilty tuesday to five counts of political corruption 
moore 67 faces up to 36 years in prison and 12 million in 
fines he was released on a 10000 personal recognizance bond 
pending his scheduled sentencing july 10 
us attorney michael carey said the government will make no 
sentencing recommendation as part of its agreement with moore 
the former governor agreed april 12 to plead guilty to the 
indictment accusing him of crimes involving his 1984 campaign and 
his 198589 term moore also served as governor in 19691977 
as other west virginians went to the polls in the states 
primary election moore entered guilty pleas before us district 
court judge walter hoffman to two counts of tax fraud and one count 
each of extortion mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
this is a very serious crime any time the franchise of the 
voters is taken away from them is a serious offense carey said 
moore accompanied by his wife shelley answered to each charge 
in a firm strong voice but he seemed overcome when hoffman asked 
him if he was induced to plead guilty 
moore paused for several seconds his head down before 
answering in a strained voice no 
he then left the courtroom through a side door to be 
fingerprinted and photographed by federal marshals 
hoffman who also has sentenced former vice president spiro 
agnew on tax charges and former charleston mayor mike roark on 
cocaine charges was called in from norfolk va after west 
virginias federal judges recused themselves 
the indictment said moore defrauded the state of his salary and 
benefits by funneling 100000 into his 1984 campaign fund 
extorted 573000 from a coal operator in 1985 filed false income 
tax returns in 1984 and 1985 and tried to block the federal grand 
jury investigation of him 
moore agreed to plead guilty after prosecutors told him they 
secretly taperecorded a meeting during which he admitted receiving 
illegal cash donations in the 1988 campaign and discussed plans to 
hide information from investigators 
mr moore used large sums outside the election process it was 
a scheme to run the election outside the limit of the law said 
john campbell an assistant us attorney from the justice 
departments public integrity section 
moore is the second west virginia governor to be convicted of 
federal charges ww wally barron a democrat who served from 
1961 to 1965 was acquitted of bribery conspiracy charges in 1968 
but went to prison for bribing the foreman of the jury that 
acquitted him 
it also was the second time moore was indicted in 1975 he was 
charged with extorting 25000 from a financial holding company 
trying to get a state bank charter he was acquitted in 1976 
moores political craftiness and flexibility allowed him to 
survive four decades in a state where registered democrats 
outnumber republicans 2to1 
he was elected governor in 1968 and four years later held off a 
challenge by democratic secretary of state jay rockefeller who 
later became governor and us senator 
moore could not succeed himself after his second term and he 
lost a 1978 bid for the us senate in 1984 he staged a comeback 
and won a third fouryear term as governor the states only other 
threeterm governor was arthur ingram borman who served from 1863 
to 1868 
moore could not repeat the success of his 196977 terms 
however and in 1988 was defeated by political novice gaston 
caperton a democrat

the soviet union has been given another 
goahead to buy more grain from the united states the agriculture 
department said tuesday 
undersecretary richard t crowder said moscow now has permission 
to buy up to 22 million metric tons of us grain without further 
consultations an increase of two million tons 
a longterm grain agreement between the two countries specified 
initially that moscow could buy up to 12 million tons of grain a 
year without further us approval that limit was raised to 16 
million tons last october and to 20 million tons in december 
the new limit of 22 million tons applies to the 12month period 
that began oct 1 the agreement itself runs through dec 31 
officials said the increase resulted from talks with the soviets 
in recent days and takes into consideration recent large purchases 
of corn by moscow 
in all since oct 1 the soviet union has bought about 189 
million tons of corn and wheat for delivery in 1989 and 1990 
those orders include more than 156 million tons of corn and 33 
million tons of wheat purchases also include 342300 tons of 
soybeans 12 million tons of soybean meal and 7300 tons of barley 
in 198889 sales were a record of more than 217 million tons 
including more than 163 million tons of corn and nearly 54 
million tons of wheat 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans

a major dietary study suggests that humans 
are a vegetarian species whose risk of disease is increased by 
eating meat and animal products says a cornell university 
researcher 
a plantbased diet is more likely to promote good health and 
reduce the risks of heart problems cancer diabetes osteoporosis 
and other diseases according to the preliminary findings of the 
continuing study in china 
people who eat mostly plant foods and a generous variety of 
plant foods that is the kind of diet that is most likely to be 
associated with reduced risk of the kinds of disease that tend to 
kill us in this country said t colin campbell a nutritional 
biochemist who directed the continuing study 
other dietary studies reached similar conclusions focusing on 
one aspect of a specific disease or on individual foods or 
nutrients but none has taken such an extensive look at the total 
dietary pattern effect said campbell 
animal foods in general are not really helpful and we need 
to get away from eating them he said 
only in the last few thousand years have meat and animal 
products become staples of our diet thats not nearly enough 
time to evolve new mechanisms to give us protection from those 
kinds of foods said campbell who is writing a book on the 
reasons humans have turned into carnivores 
the study began in 1983 to explore dietary causes of cancer but 
was expanded to include heart and metabolic diseases and a variety 
of infectious diseases aiding cornell in the study are scientists 
from the chinese academies of preventive medicine and of medical 
sciences and the university of oxford 
scientists surveyed 6500 chinese each of whom contributed 367 
facts about their diet the preliminary findings will be reported 
in a 900page monograph to be published next month by cornell 
university press 
campbell said there were several provocative findings regarding 
proteins fat and cholesterol among the roughly 8000 correlations 
that were found statistically and biologically significant in the 
study 
the study found that the chinese consume onethird less protein 
than americans and that only 7 percent of their protein comes from 
animal sources compared with 70 percent for americans 
the dietary guidelines that have been formulated in the west 
rather incorrectly protect our intake of animal protein 
consumption of animal protein itself also raises the risk of cancer 
and heart disease he said 
previous studies have urged reducing dietary fat to less than 30 
percent of an individuals daily caloric intake to curb the risk of 
heart disease and cancer but the chinese study suggests that fat 
should account for a maximum of 20 percent and preferably only 10 
to 15 percent of calories 
campbell said the chinese consume 20 percent more calories than 
americans do but americans are 25 percent fatter thats because 
chinese eat about a third of the fat that americans do and twice as 
much starch 
the study also found that the chinese had a lower cholesterol 
level than americans who consume more animal foods and dairy 
products cholesterol levels in china ranged from 88 to 165 
milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood plasma while the us 
range extended from 155 to 274 milligrams 
in addition to reducing the risk of heart disease low 
cholesterol also protects against colon cancer the most common 
lifethreatening cancer among americans campbell said 
the chinese diet contains three times more dietary fiber than 
americans yet the study found no evidence that the high fiber 
level interfered with the absorption of essential minerals such as 
iron 
campbell said the study showed that americans dont have to eat 
meat to prevent irondeficiency anemia the average chinese adult 
consumes twice as much iron as an american adult 
people also dont need animal products to prevent osteoporosis 
a bone disease resulting from a lack of calcium campbell said the 
study showed that people need less calcium than previously thought 
and that the chinese received enough from vegetables 
the findings are only the beginning of the studys benefits 
said campbell the second phase of the research involves 
resurveying the original participants and including people from 12 
counties in taiwan which campbell said is a dietary intermediate 
between china and the united states

federal regulators agreed tuesday to cut 
prices on hardtosell real estate the government is inheriting 
from bankrupt savings and loans 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
endorsed stepping up sales but withheld comment on the specifics 
of the plan 
the resolution trust corp voted unamiously to permit regulators 
to cut a propertys price by 15 percent if it had not sold in six 
months four months for a singlefamily home a further reduction 
of 5 percent is allowed after an additional three months 
the rtc adopted a second policy authorizing auction sales 
allowing no more than a 30 percent discount from appraised value 
meanwhile the joint economic committee said tuesday that the 
1990 budget deficit will swell to 185 billion up from 152 
billion last year and that thriftrelated spending could total 45 
billion this year 
the new sales policy is stirring concern among real estate 
professionals who fear that too many cutrate sales could hurt 
already depressed markets in some areas of the country 
its a fine line that has to be walked they the rtc are not 
oblivious to this fitzwater said 
we are concerned about getting rid of the properties in a way 
that helps reduce the burden on the taxpayer he said we 
obviously dont want to wreck the economy 
regulators said holding a backlog of real estate off the market 
with the hope that prices will rise can be just as harmful 
weve become convinced that holding on to property is too 
costly both for us and the taxpayer and what were adopting is 
designed to move properties without disrupting markets said rtc 
chairman l william seidman 
the proposal originally came before the rtc board two weeks ago 
the board delayed action at the urging of comptroller of the 
currency robert clarke who regulates nationally chartered banks 
clarke said he feared faster sales could hurt stillsolvent 
banks and sampls struggling with deteriorating real estate portfolios 
however clarke said an analysis by the rtc staff convinced him 
the new policy would have little effect on solvent institutions 
weve satisfied ourselves that as far as we can tell and you 
can never tell for sure adoption of this policy would not have an 
adverse effect on any of the institutions not in receivership he 
said 
at the end of february the last month for which firm figures 
were available the rtc owned 164 billion in real estate after 
having sold 21 billion 
it expects its portfolio to swell as it repossesses property 
posted as collateral for nowdelinquent loans 
a treasuryled panel overseeing the rtcs work for the bush 
administration encouraged the agency to offer greater price cuts 
sooner than permitted in the new policy 
in a related development the rtc said it had hired a miami 
company auction co of america to hold an unprecedented auction 
of 200 million to 300 million worth of commercial properties 
regulators anticipate holding the auction in late summer

the federal fraud and embezzlement trial of 
imelda marcos recessed abruptly tuesday for the second time in two 
weeks when her blood pressure soared during testimony about her 
family 
mrs marcos 60 former first lady of the philippines began 
sobbing when defense lawyer gerry spence crossexamined fbi agent 
james trimbach on his testimony about the marcoses using allegedly 
stolen money for their own ends 
spence apparently referring to the marcoses daughter imee 
asked whether there was anything wrong with paying for your 
childrens education 
mrs marcos began to sob and friends said later that she was 
upset by the allusion to her older daughter whom she has not seen 
in four years imee lives in morocco and is not allowed to travel 
on a philippine passport they said 
after the judge declared a recess she was taken to a nurses 
station 
aides to mrs marcos quoted her physician dr rafael zagala as 
saying her blood pressure had jumped 
she later left the courthouse quietly crying on the arm of a 
marshal and climbed into her black van to return to her midtown 
apartment spence said he hoped mrs marcos could return to court 
on wednesday 
earlier prosecutors used a giant flow chart and trimbach to 
explain how mrs marcos and her late husband allegedly used stolen 
money to secretly buy a new york office building 
they said that through money transfers involving 14 banks in new 
york california the bahamas and the philippines the marcoses 
paid 51 million for the crown building a gilded tower across 
fifth avenue from tiffanys 
it was the first of four buildings the prosecution says were 
bought by the marcoses with some of the 220 million allegedly 
plundered from their countrys treasury during former president 
ferdinand marcos 20 years in power 
mrs marcos is on trial in federal court for fraud and 
embezzlement along with saudi arabian financier adnan khashoggi 
who is accused of helping the marcoses conceal their purchases 
marcos died in exile in hawaii in september 
assistant us attorney debra livingston used the board covered 
with boxes and arrows to show jurors how money moved from accounts 
held by the marcoses and their allies to other accounts and 
eventually to the crown purchase 
many witnesses including several former bank officials have 
testified that marcos used philippine banks and governmentowned 
companies controlled by cronies to launder and conceal money 
allegedly drained from the countrys dollar reserves or skimmed 
from government contracts 
the chart purported to show that in september 1981 funds held 
in five different banks were channeled through intermediate 
accounts in six separate transactions and eventually to the crown 
building purchase 
most of the money including 30 million from the traders royal 
bank of manila converged in a 4312823925 deposit to the new 
york branch of banque paribas of geneva 
prosecutors say that the banque paribas account was managed by 
stephane cattuai whom they have described as the marcoses 
personal swiss banker and that the money represented the bulk of 
the payment for the crown building 
among the banks listed on the chart was the california overseas 
bank which on monday was ordered by judge john f keenan to be 
turned over to the philippine government as part of a plea bargain 
by its former owner robert s benedicto 
benedicto a marcos friend originally was indicted as a 
coconspirator but fled to spain and then venezuela he gave up 
ownership of the bank and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in exchange 
for being dropped from the case 
his lawyer wayne w smith said the bank was worth between 20 
million and 30 million 
in a related development the los angeles times said the 
marcoses doled out about 85 million to politicians reporters and 
others in the final days of marcos regime in a desperate bid to 
retain power 
the ledger was among documents found at malacanang palace after 
marcos fled a popular revolt on feb 25 1986 and corazon aquino 
who had defeated marcos in an election days earlier was installed 
as president 
it showed that mrs marcos gave watches and envelopes of cash to 
members of the national press corps during the campaign and that 
as votes were being counted she handed out money gifts at a dinner 
for members of a government agency assigned to investigate election 
fraud

president bush discussed potential tax 
increases with republican lawmakers tuesday as budget director 
richard darman suggested deficitfighting actions totaling as much 
as 100 billion may be needed this year 
a range of suggestions for raising revenues including a 
national lottery a onecent federal sales tax and higher taxes on 
alcohol and tobacco are part of the mix said assistant 
senate republican leader alan k simpson rwyo 
darmans figures he gave a range of 60 billion to 100 
billion were two to three times the size of the savings that bush 
said would be needed when he proposed his fiscal 1991 budget in 
january 
the 100 billion figure is an outside possibility but i was 
citing an extreme case darman said later in an interview 
house speaker thomas s foley said he and other democratic 
leaders would meet wednesday morning with bush on the budget 
he commented after a meeting in which many house democrats 
insisted that bush be forced to specify the economic conditions 
that make major budget cuts necessary 
if this summit is going to come up with very strong proposals 
on deficit reduction were going to have to lay some groundwork 
with the country why its necessary said house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif he suggested major deficitcutting 
action would face a very tough time in the house and senate on 
both sides of the aisle in this election year 
darman said the scope of the action required depends on the 
eventual cost of the saving and loan bailout and thats 
impossible to estimate reliably at this point 
in any event he said automatic spending cuts of over 20 percent 
throughout government loom this fall if congress and the white 
house are unable to agree on a series of major deficitcutting 
steps 
on whether bush will support higher taxes as part of a budget 
compromise darman said hes prepared to talk without any 
preconditions 
there are some ideas were not prepared to put on the table 
he added without elaboration 
although he won office on a no new taxes pledge bush made 
it clear tuesday he was willing to discuss some form of tax 
increase as part of an overall budget compromise gop lawmakers 
said 
simpson speaking to reporters outside the white house 
suggested bush had ruled out higher income taxes as part of any 
budget compromise 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater wouldnt even go that 
far instead he repeated his dayearlier phrase that bush had set 
no preconditions on budget talks not even to rule out raising 
income taxes or reductions in social security costofliving 
increases 
we start these negotiations from scratch fitzwater said he 
said any tax increases that might emerge from a white 
housecongress budget summit were up to the negotiators 
bushs opening of the door to tax increases for the first time 
in his presidency carried the risk of political repercussions to 
republicans and republican lawmakers were clearly uncomfortable 
with the phrase tax increase 
house assistant republican leader newt gingrich of georgia said 
republicans would not agree to any plan that would hurt them 
politically in an election year 
were not going to agree to stupid deals gingrich said 
asked what kind of taxes might be raised gingrich said i 
dont know well have to wait and see what the democrats want to 
discuss 
participants at the white house session said budget director 
darman at bushs behest delivered an unusually pessimistic review 
of the economy 
darman later told gop senators at a lunch in the capitol that it 
appeared the 64 billion fiscal 1991 deficit target under the 
grammrudman law would be missed by at least 60 billion said sen 
john danforth rmo 
the budget official reportedly told both the white house and 
capitol sessions that rising interest rates as well as higher 
estimates of the sampl bailout have swollen the predicted federal 
deficit 
the grammrudman law requires the deficit to be lowered to 100 
billion this year and to 64 billion in the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 mandatory spending cuts in both defense and most domestic 
programs are triggered if the deficit levels arent reached 
democratic senators meanwhile also met tuesday to discuss 
bushs overture for a noproposalsbarred budget summit 
participants said there was general agreement that bush should be 
forced to show his hand on what measures he would support to cut 
the deficit 
there was some talk that taxes may have to be raised but 
democrats wont be the ones initiating tax hikes said sen 
dennis de concini dariz 
after the white house session simpson said that spending cuts 
of the magnitude described by darman which could slash 20 percent 
or more from each programs budget would be totally unacceptable 
to the american people and totally unacceptable to the congress 
bush talked about the absolute necessity of no preconditions 
and putting everything on the table simpson said 
valueadded taxes taxes on booze and cigarettes a national 
lottery a onecent national sales tax all sorts of things like 
that are in the mix simpson said while adding nobodys 
talking about raising income tax rates 
the president is fully aware that hes got a country to run 
and hes got to do that in a responsible way because lots of 
figures have changed simpson said

estonia dropped the trappings of soviet 
power on tuesday changing its name and its flag and proclaimed 
solidarity with latvia and lithuania in the three baltic republics 
drive toward independence 
without formally declaring independence estonias parliament 
reinstituted some paragraphs from its 1938 constitution including 
one proclaiming estonia an independent republic with the supreme 
state power vested in the people 
it dropped soviet socialist to become simply the republic 
of estonia and it adopted its old tricolor national flag in 
place of the hammerandsickle banner of socialism 
parliament said the steps were meant to show solidarity with 
sister republics lithuania and latvia which have issued 
declarations of independence all three states were independent 
until forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
the deputies also adopted a resolution proclaiming baltic 
solidarity and congratulating latvia on declaring independence 
the path to our own statehood is not easy but we are 
convinced that here in the baltics we three acting together 
will arrive at a restoration of our independent states more 
fruitfully than if each were to struggle on its own said the 
statement broadcast on radio estonia and monitored in britain 
lithuanias 38 million people are under an economic blockade 
imposed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in an attempt to 
force lithuania to rescind several laws passed since it declared 
immediate independence march 11 estonia and latvia set unspecified 
transition periods for secession from the soviet union 
on monday lithuanias council of ministers decided to cut meat 
shipments to soviet ministries by 10 percent in hopes of bartering 
scarce meat directly with soviet factories for oil and other 
supplies said aidas palubinskas of the supreme council 
legislatures information bueau 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia accused lithuania 
tuesday of reducing meat and milk shipments to the soviet union in 
retaliation for moscows economic sanctions 
in latvia legislators who oppose independence asked gorbachev 
not to impose sanctions on latvia saying that would hurt many 
citizens loyal to the soviet union 
the group called for a referendum on independence 
activists say the recent parliamentary elections constituted a 
referendum on independence advocates of separation won more than 
twothirds of the seats in the parliaments of all three baltic 
republics 
latvia issued a declaration of independence on may 4 but did not 
ask for an immediate break with moscow or suspend the soviet 
constitution it is waiting to hear if gorbachev will impose 
sanctions similar to those on lithuania 
latvians make up 53 percent of the 26 million people in their 
native land and many russian and other nonlatvian residents 
oppose independence 
in estonia parliament approved the constitutional changes and 
the traditional symbols of state by a vote of 7314 eighteen 
deputies did not vote or did not attend the session 
minutes later a small crowd gathered on the cobblestone square 
outside the ancient parliament building and watched as the red flag 
was lowered it was replaced by the blueblackandwhite striped 
flag used by estonia when it was independent between the two world 
wars 
matt laar a deputy from tallinn the estonian capital said the 
republic already is feeling the effects of the soviet oil and 
natural gas embargo against lithuania because a lithuanian refinery 
processes half of estonias gasoline 
estonians have tried to start talks with the kremlin about 
eventual independence but moscow has refused 
the estonian independent an englishlanguage weekly in tallinn 
reported that gorbachev adviser alexander yakovlev told estonian 
supreme soviet chairman arnold ruutel negotiations could not start 
until parliament suspended its march 30 decision to cancel the 
soviet constitution on estonian territory 
laar said tuesdays action followed two days of negotiations 
among groups in the legislature including the popular front the 
communist party and representatives of the ethnic russian minority 
that makes up 30 percent of the 15 million population ethnic 
estonians comprise 64 percent of the population 
in latvia the united council of work collectives which claims 
140000 mostly nonethnic latvian members called for a strike to 
protest the declaration of independence it gave no strike date 
but leaders previously mentioned may 15 
a frontpage appeal in latvias communist party newspaper said 
proindependence leaders did not consider it necessary to ask the 
people do they want a return to unemployment lawlessness and 
oppression do they want hunger cold and bankruptcy as in 
neighboring lithuania 
it called the declaration of independence an antisoviet and 
anticonstitutional state coup 
anatoly alexeyev head of the interfront movement that unites 
thousand of nonlatvians said he expected a major 
antiindependence demonstration on wednesday during victory day 
celebrations marking the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii 
the west has responded cautiously to the independence movements 
fearing they could weaken gorbachevs attempts at reform president 
bush has been reluctant to do anything that might affect his may 30 
summit with gorbachev

a soviet admiral urged president mikhail s 
gorbachev on tuesday to invoke strict law and order against 
draft evasion desertion and baltic insults against world war ii 
veterans 
the remarks by adm vasily grishanov at a rally in the bolshoi 
theater marking the defeat of nazi germany in 1945 drew prolonged 
applause from a crowd of veterans many of them decorated generals 
and admirals from the second world war 
gorbachev addressing the same meeting on the eve of a victory 
day military parade in red square received tepid applause for a 
speech that lauded veterans but dwelt largely on disarmament and 
josef stalins purge of the officer corps on the eve of world war 
ii 
grishanov a little known threestar admiral did not directly 
criticize gorbachev or the baltic republics of latvia lithuania 
and estonia for seeking to secede from the soviet union the first 
of the 15 soviet republics to take such a step 
but his speech was one of the clearest public expressions yet of 
dissatisfaction among officers of kremlin tolerance toward the 
separatist movements in the baltic republics 
the heart aches grishanov said unfortunately in recent 
years certain political forces have been persistently forming a 
negative attitude toward the soviet armed forces they are trying 
to break down the notion of the motherland for the young people 
as a result there is a phenomenon of pacifism evasion of 
military service and unfortunately even acts of desertion he 
said 
we veterans are calling upon the young men to be real men 
prepare to fulfill your constitutional duty of defending the 
motherland he said 
the whole society must take real care of its defenders in 
general there must be a strict civil law and order in the state 
he said 
the veterans nodded their heads repeatedly during the speech 
and burst into spontaneous applause at the mention of law and order 
the admiral appeared to be in his 70s but was not introduced 
as retired as is customary for officers no longer on active 
duty 
the way they treat war veterans in the baltic republics is a 
tragedy grishanov said alluding to assertions by baltic 
residents that the soviet soldiers occupied rather than liberated 
their nations during world war ii 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania latvia and estonia 
in 1940 as part of a pact with nazi germany the soviet congress of 
peoples deputies in moscow passed a resolution saying that the 
nazisoviet pact was invalid but maintains that the annexation was 
voluntary 
many russians particularly in the military have been critical 
of gorbachev for allowing what they view as the dissolution of the 
soviet union and its alliance in eastern europe much of which was 
consolidated under arms during world war ii and its aftermath 
gorbachev reiterated his view that the reunification of germany 
would be welcome as long as the security of the soviet union and 
other countries was ensured he warned that any effort to change 
postwar borders would be a great fatal mistake 
the soviet union along with wartime allies the united states 
britain and france is now meeting with representatives of the two 
german states to try to work out the formula for reunification a 
major sticking point is the wests demand that a united germany be 
a part of nato 
gorbachev rejects that demand but did not directly address the 
issue in his speech 
he sharply criticized stalins repression of the soviet officer 
corps in the late 1930s and the dictators unwillingness to 
believe that germany was planning an attack 
gorbachev credited stalin with managing the system that turned 
the soviet unions war fortunes around but he said the system only 
worked because during a war stalin had to leave many decisions to 
the intelligence and initiative of subordinates in the field rather 
than managing the war from the capital 
he sat quietly through grishanovs speech twiddling his fingers 
on the green baizecovered table in front of him as he often does 
when listening to speeches critical of his policies 
soviet authorities were planning a military parade in red square 
on wednesday to mark the 45th anniversary of the end of world war 
ii in europe

six alleged violations of federal mine 
ventilation rules contributed to a methane explosion that killed 10 
kentucky miners last year the government said tuesday 
a federal investigation into the blast found that some pyro 
mining co managers knew that explosive methane gas was 
accumulating in the mine four days before the explosion but they 
did not maintain required records that would have alerted others 
a report by the labor departments mine safety and health 
administration also said that autopsies found traces of marijuana 
in one victim and marijuana and cocaine in another but there was 
no evidence that linked the drug use to the sept 13 explosion in 
wheatcroft ky 
james greenlee executive vice president of costain coal inc 
which owns pyro said the company had not reviewed the report and 
would not discuss its findings yet 
the company allowed six violations of federal ventilation 
requirements to occur in the days and hours before the accident 
said william tattersall assistant labor secretary for mine safety 
and health 
the combination of violations set the stage for the 
explosion tattersall said 
the mine safety and health agency does not immediately propose 
fines against companies for allegedly violating safety regulations 
but eventually the company could face up to 100000 in fines an 
agency official said 
the report alleged that managers failed to make required checks 
for the deadly gas in the hours before the explosion failed to 
keep enough clean air in the mine to sweep out methane and made a 
series of changes in air pathways that caused a methane buildup the 
day of the disaster 
the report said mining equipment that did not meet federal 
requirements was operated in the mine 
federal investigators were unable to determine exactly what 
triggered the explosion although they identified five 
possibilities a cutting torch a sccop tractor with multiple 
electrical safety deficiencies detonation of a blasting cap a 
spark generated by falling roof rock or snapping of a steel wire 
under tension

the federal fish and wildlife service has 
recommended a sevenyear study of the environmental impact of a 
proposed 582 million colorado water project that would kill the 
project a congressman said tuesday 
the agency determined that the animasla plata water project in 
southwestern colorado would have adverse effects on so many other 
water projects in new mexico and colorado that further 
investigation is required rep ben nighthorse campbell said 
campbell a democrat said contracts with the southern ute and 
ute mountain ute indian tribes which have senior water rights in 
the region require that the project be completed in 10 years 
this would postpone it so much that it destroys the 
agreement he said 
the project would irrigate 68000 acres of farmland settle a 
lengthy government water rights dispute with the two tribes and 
provide drinking water for durango residents the project would 
include two reservoirs three major pumping plants and a 157mile 
network of pipes and canals 
supporters say the project would assure water for the future in 
southwestern colorado and northwestern new mexico 
critics claim the project would ruin the animas river and 
provide water that would be too expensive for farmers and that 
indian water claims could be satisfied by a cheaper project 
a spokesman for the fish and wildlife service declined to 
comment on the ruling saying the colorado and new mexico 
congressional delegations had to be briefed first 
groundbreaking had been delayed until june so federal biologists 
could complete an endangered species study on possible effects on 
squawfish and razorback suckers 
campbell said the ruling doesnt make sense because the federal 
government previously imposed a program to eliminate the fish it is 
now trying to protect 
campbell was referring to earlier efforts by state and federal 
agencies to eliminate trash fish from rivers in the area in an 
effort to make a better environment for trout 
according to biologists animasla plata would deplete up to 18 
percent of the flows downstream into the san juan river now relied 
upon by rare fish the san juan as it now flows through new mexico 
and utah is one of only five rivers believed to be supporting wild 
populations of the squawfish 
in the last three years biologists have discovered 27 squawfish 
and 13 razorback suckers in stretches of the san juan river 90 
miles downstream of animasla plata 
the colorado squawfish a silvery migratory fish that grows up 
to 5 feet long was placed on the federal list of endangered 
species in 1967 the razorback sucker a humped fish that grows up 
to 30 inches lnog was proposed for protection on the list last 
year

defense secretary dick cheney said 
tuesday he wants nato to maintain the policy that allows for a 
firststrike use of nuclear weapons in the event of a warsaw pact 
invasion of europe 
cheney en route to a nato session reviewing nuclear strategy 
told reporters that the alliances defense ministers will lay the 
groundwork for a lengthy review of nato strategy involving the use 
of conventional and nuclear systems 
president bush called for the review last thursday in light of 
the political and military changes that have swept europe the past 
year 
the presidents request came as he announced he had scrapped 
plans to replace shortrange nuclear missiles in europe with an 
updated version and put aside plans as well to upgrade the nuclear 
artillery shells in natos arsenal 
cheney was to be joined by the defense ministers of 14 other 
nato nations for the first of four sessions leading up to a summit 
in london in july of all nato leaders 
cheney said he intended to brief the allies on bushs 
initiative which comes as the member nations reassess natos 
political and military significance amid the crumbling of its 
longtime foe the warsaw pact 
bushs decision on shortrange weapons does not signal the 
beginning of the removal of us nuclear weapons from europe 
cheney stressed 
that does not mean that you want to walk away from the role of 
nuclear weapons in the overall defense of europe cheney said 
we think us nuclear capability both theater and strategic 
will continue to be an important part of our overall alliance 
strategy 
cheney said the flexible response doctrine allowing for the 
first use of nuclear weapons has provided security for the 
alliance for decades and im not eager to remove one part of it 
i would not give that up he said at another point 
cheney was asked whether the debate will now switch from the 
hotly contested issue of the lance missile to alliance plans to 
modernize airlaunched nuclear missiles known as tasms tactical 
air to surface missile the secretary said he didnt see any 
reason for the defense ministers to discuss the issue 
theres nothing thats happened within the last few weeks that 
in any way changes our approach to tasm cheney said 
nato secretary general manfred woerner who accompanied cheney 
on the flight said monday he expected the defense ministers to 
formally issue a statement supporting bushs initiative on 
shortrange weapons 
he said he also expected them to direct the supreme allied 
commander in europe us gen john galvin to undertake a 
comprehensive study of the alliance need for its nuclear weaponry 
cheney said he expected the meeting scheduled for wednesday and 
thursday to focus on both conventional and nuclear forces and 
where we will go with respect to arms control 
the meeting is with members of the nuclear planning group which 
is composed of the defense ministers of the 16 nato nations except 
france and iceland 
the secretary said it was a reasonable guess that the nato 
review process may last into next year given ongoing eastwest 
talks on reducing conventional forces but that he wouldnt put a 
timetable on the study

the senate voted tuesday to allow law 
enforcement intelligence and tax agents to spend their off time 
soliciting campaign contributions from colleagues and taking other 
active roles in partisan politics 
on a 5146 vote senate democrats rejected a republican attempt 
to exclude employees of the fbi the cia the internal revenue 
service the justice department and the federal election commission 
from a proposal to relax rules on political activities by 
government workers 
the fbi cia and justice department are still in a special 
category said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas i 
do not believe we want to politicize those agencies 
democrats denied trying to politicize those workers or any of 
29 million civil service and postal employees they claim would 
benefit from their proposed relaxation of the hatch act 
sen john glenn dohio said his bill overhauling the 
51yearold law was intended to clarify conflicting rulings on what 
political activities federal workers can participate in while 
totally forbidding such activities on the job 
the hatch act now forbids the nations 3 million federal civil 
service and postal workers from participating actively in politics 
off the job but allows them to wear campaign buttons while at work 
glenns bill would outlaw the buttons but lift most restrictions 
on offthejob activities so that federal employees could hold 
party offices and solicit campaign funds from their coworkers but 
not from the general public 
doles amendment to maintain the prohibitions on campaign 
activities by irs fbi cia and fec workers and career federal 
prosecutors was one of several unsuccessful gop attempts tuesday to 
chip away at glenns bill 
laws restricting those people and what they can do are already 
on the books glenn said they cannot use information gained on 
the job politically 
also defeated were gop amendments to maintain a ban on federal 
workers holding office in the two political parties and delaying 
any changes in the hatch law until after a campaign finance reform 
bill is enacted 
the first amendment by sen william v roth rnh was 
defeated on a 6432 vote and the second by gop whip alan k 
simpson of wyoming was rejected 6136 
republicans have contended the entire bill amounts to a pot of 
gold for the democratic party because unionized public employees 
and their political action committees overwhelmingly favor 
democrats 
lf we banned all pacs there wouldnt be much demand for this 
bill said dole holding open a threat that republicans later 
this week might try to attach to the measure their proposed package 
of campaign finance reforms 
the only purpose of this bill is to make the federal employee 
union pacs fatter of which 88 percent of their campaign 
donations goes to the other party he said 
despite repeated assertions that president bush will veto any 
changes in the hatch law democrats so far have garnered several 
votes from republicans on each challenge by the gop leadership to 
the bill 
the house approved a much broader revision of the hatch act by 
an overwhelming 29790 vote more than a year ago 
but the house bill also would permit federal workers to run for 
public office solicit campaign contributions from the public the 
senate bill would retain current prohibitions against those two 
activities

election year discomfort among republicans was 
obvious tuesday after president bushs lips moved and taxes 
suddenly appeared on the budget negotiating table 
im opposed to having taxes be on the table period said 
rep bill schuette of michigan one of the republican congressmen 
challenging a democratic senator 
schuettes comment was typical of gop candidates who have made 
opposition to tax increases a centerpiece of their campaigns 
as one republican operative put it there is a clear anxiety 
among republican candidates speaking on the condition he not be 
named the source said that candidates and activists feel there 
has been a clear distinction between the parties on the tax issue 
they feel the negotiation would be used by the democrats to muddle 
the distinction 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts the democrat who lost to 
bush in the 1988 presidential election called bushs no new 
taxes pledge a fraud on the american public 
i know it was effective and the election is over dukakis 
said but to make that kind of commitment given the size of the 
federal deficit this savings and loan disaster which is going 
to cost the people of this country hundreds and hundreds of 
billions was irresponsible 
republicans feared the public also would remember the bush 
pledge 
im not going to vote for anything which causes us to lose 
politically said house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia after a 
white house meeting with the president 
the initial reaction of ed rollins cochairman of the house 
republican campaign committee was that injecting the possibility 
of a tax increase this election year was a disaster 
there is something of an antitax movement around this country 
and certainly republicans are on the right side of that at this 
stage of the game said rollins who added that the most 
significant contrast between democrats and republicans is on the 
tax issue the public feels that the republicans are the party 
thats fighting against raising their taxes 
a shift in that perception he said would certainly affect 
our candidates who are challenging democratic incumbents to take 
the tax pledge 
since 1980 the republicans have portrayed democrats as the 
tax and spend party 
read my lips no new taxes was bushs most memorable line 
from the 1988 presidential campaign 
when he stood before the 1988 republican convention to accept 
its presidential nomination bush predicted this day would come 
and the congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no 
and theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again 
declared the presidential nominee and ill say to them read my 
lips no new taxes 
the democraticcontrolled congress refused to push the word on 
taxes sent to the white house from the start of the bush 
administration was after you mr president 
then at a sunday night summit with congressional leaders in the 
white house living quarters the president agreed that everything 
including taxes would be on the negotiating table in the effort 
to come up with a way to cut the federal deficit 
sen lloyd bentsen dtex chairman of the senate finance 
committee called it a question of walking that plank together 
but the 1990 campaign trail is clogged with republicans who 
adopted bushs read my lips stance 
for schuette taxes is a defining issue it separates bill 
schuette from democratic sen carl levin and i think it 
separates many republicans from many democrats 
but does schuette suddenly find himself separated from bush 
the congressman hopes not 
do i think he will in the end agree to something that raises 
taxes he replied no i dont think he will 
kelly mitchell press secretary for rep robert smith rnh 
who is running for the senate seat being vacate by gop sen gordon 
humphrey said smith does not support tax increases he plans to 
maintain that position 
other hardline antitaxers were rep lynn martin rill 
challenging democratic sen paul simon and rep tom tauke riowa 
challenging democratic sen tom harkin 
i am apoplectic said a republican political operative who 
insisted on anonymity this comes out just in enough time so the 
democrats have a shield around them for the rest of the campaign 
republicans were quick to insist that an increase in income 
taxes was not being discussed 
valueadded taxes taxes on booze and cigarettes a national 
lottery a onecent national sales tax all sorts of things like 
that are in the mix said sen alan simpson of wyoming the 
senate republican whip 
sen john chafee of rhode island the thirdranking senate 
republican complained the media were getting the emphasis wrong 
bush thinks news people are making a great mistake to center 
it around taxes said the rhode island senator 
i dont want him to raise taxes said bruce benson the 
colorado republican party chairman i still want him to cut 
government i also know weve got a government that if the 
democrats wont work with you without some kind of a switch 
sometimes you have to bend and let the democrats push you into 
something 
anticipating the republican argument that bush was being dragged 
kicking and screaming to consideration of a tax increase house 
democratic leaders were quick to say they werent putting pressure 
on the president 
democrats are disinclined to drag them kicking and screaming 
anyplace said rep steny hoyer dmd chairman of the house 
democratic caucus 
they called us said rep vic fazio dcalif vice chairman 
of the caucus

president fw de klerk left 
tuesday on a major european tour aimed at convincing western 
leaders that south africa has changed enough to justify an end to 
international efforts to isolate it 
it is wonderful to go to europe with the knowledge that south 
africa is busy taking its rightful place in the international 
community the south african leader said at an airport news 
conference before his departure 
the first stop on the ninecountry 18day tour is france where 
president francois mitterrand has shunned previous south african 
leaders in protest against the system of white minority rule 
although apartheid still exists de klerks historic talks last 
week to settle differences with the african national congress have 
led the french leader and others to agree to give de klerk a 
hearing 
in recent months de klerk also freed political prisoners 
including african national congress leader nelson mandela and had 
taken other steps toward reform 
the evening news on south africas governmentrun television 
said a senior government source described the tour as a concerted 
effort to pull south africa from the morass the country has found 
itself in 
the visit is not only going to be demanding of the state 
president but also of the utmost importance to south africa the 
television said 
after france de klerk will visit belgium italy west germany 
britain spain switzerland greece and portugal his exact 
itinerary is being kept secret for security reasons but he is to 
meet the heads of government in every country 
among his hosts will be british prime minister margaret 
thatcher king juan carlos of spain and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl 
i welcome the opportunity for reevaluating what is happening 
in south africa to the heads of state and heads of government i 
will be visiting de klerk said at his news conference 
many western countries have imposed economic and trading 
sanctions against south africa and cut athletic entertainment and 
scientific exchanges because of apartheid under which the black 
majority of 28 million in this nation of 37 million residents has 
no vote in national affairs 
but de klerk has pledged to end white rule and share power with 
the black majority in the governments firstever talks with the 
african national congress the countrys most powerful black 
political organization the two sides agreed to work together to 
end political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on 
a new constitution 
two months ago mandela had been calling for increased sanctions 
and complete diplomatic isolation of south africa but after last 
weeks talks he said the anc would not seek new sanctions 
government television reported that spain is considering ending 
its entertainment and sports boycott of south africa in response to 
de klerks visit and the talks with the anc 
the south african foreign ministry described it as the most 
extensive foreign trip by any south african head of government 
since the ruling national party came to power in 1948 
there will be no slipping in by the back door government 
television assured viewers in the past south african leaders have 
visited foreign countries as tourists 
de klerk will also be looking for support for his political 
plans western european nations have been an important source of 
aid and support for the anc and de klerk hopes they will help to 
control more radical black elements that oppose any peaceful 
solution with the white government 
de klerk said he was visiting european leaders to tell them that 
instead of pressure south africa needs encouragement 
this does not mean interference he added 
de klerk is accompanied by foreign minister pik botha and other 
officials 
we have such a good case to present at the moment that im not 
worried about the outcome of the tour he said

bush has invited both men to visit the white house an informed

east germanys first democratically elected 
parliament on tuesday eulogized the millions of people who died at 
the hands of adolf hitlers nazi regime 
recalling the horrors of the nazis and the deaths of six million 
jews in addition to millions of russians poles and others 
parliament president sabine bergmannpohl said the insane path of 
german history found its end on may 8 1945 
referring to last falls peaceful revolution that brought down 
east germanys hardline communist leadership and opened the way 
for the reunification of east germany and west germany mrs 
bergmannpohl said today we have the hope that may 8 does not 
remain as the last mutually binding date for german history 
but it will always be closely tied to whatever happens along 
our way into the future she added 
also on tuesday a special ceremony dedicated to the thousands 
of soviet soldiers killed by nazi troops in battles to capture 
berlin was held at east berlins treptow park the site of a war 
memorial to the soviets 
officials say about 5000 soviet soldiers died fighting the 
germans in the last few days of the war in europe and the battle 
for berlin 
the parliamentary ceremonies coincided with a meeting in east 
berlins palast hotel between world jewish congress leader edgar m 
bronfman and east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
bronfman said at the meeting that a memorial should be erected 
at the site of the berlin wall that was opened last nov 9 because 
the date had dual importance 
on nov 9 1938 nazis killed dozens of jews and ransacked 
jewish homes and stores in what became known as kristallnacht or 
crystal night because of the broken glass that littered the 
streets afterward 
let me suggest that the date nov 9 is a really important date 
in black distress and golden hope bronfman said 
prior to the meeting leaders of the jewish congress held a 
memorial ceremony at the wannsee villa in berlin where german 
leaders met in 1942 to map out their socalled final solution 
that led to the death of 6 million jews

john paul ii the whole world loves you 
goes the chant heard in the streets during the popes visit to 
overwhelmingly roman catholic mexico but a few dissenting voices 
can also be heard 
critics are asking whether the papal visit is a means for the 
ruling party to win political mileage they question church policy 
they complain about the exclusivity of one papal mass and skewer 
the commercial hoopla surrounding the pontiffs eightday visit 
as always in mexico some of the most biting commentary has come 
from editorial cartoonists the progovernment newspaper excelsior 
ran a cartoon about church opposition to birth control which 
showed the pontiffs jet approaching mexico amid a huge flock of 
storks 
political analyst adolfo gilly in the daily newspaper la 
jornada criticized the pope for preaching submission theology 
as opposed to liberation theology a doctrine that holds the 
church must actively involve itself in the fight for social justice 
the pope has also drawn complaints over his support of 
celebrations of the 500th anniversary of christianity in the 
americas set for 1992 indian activists say the church served as 
an agent of the conquest which decimated their population and 
shredded their culture 
el financiero mexicos business daily noted that only the 
wellconnected and the affluent got tickets to the popes sunday 
mass at the basilica of guadalupe 
the shrine was a sea of lace pearls richly jeweled rosaries 
silk ties and soft wool suits thousands of others patient in 
their humble clothes had to stand behind police barricades outside 
in the rain 
do you know what happened in those streets you toured in your 
covered car la jornada rhetorically asked the pontiff even the 
government daily el nacional took note of the plight of the 
masses 
hours of waiting was it worth it to see the pope for less 
than a minute ran one of its headlines monday 
the pope and president carlos salinas de gortari have been 
sharply criticized for striking what some see as a rather unholy 
alliance 
the cartoonist helguera for instance drew a crassly grinning 
pontiff holding a crucifix superimposed over the flag of the 
institutional revolutionary party or pri which has ruled mexico 
for 61 years 
the pri clearly hopes to make political points with the papal 
visit and the prospect of establishing formal relations with the 
vatican 
the church which supported conservatives and opposed social 
reform lost its property and many of its rights between 1859 and 
1926 church officials have said they would welcome amendments to a 
constitution that now forbids the church to own property bans 
religious education outlaws clerical garb in public and bars 
priests from voting 
most of those restrictions are ignored in practice nowadays but 
opposition politicians have criticized the pri for what they say is 
a cynical attempt to shore up flagging support by engineering a 
formal rapprochement with the church 
there is still enough opposition in congress to make salinas 
reluctant to try to ram through constitutional changes but 
normalizing relations with the vatican would not require that

four days before the deadline for filing civil 
rights charges a top justice department official said tuesday no 
new evidence has been found to justify reopening the case of the 
bloody confrontation between philadelphia police and the radical 
group move 
but john dunne chief of the departments civil rights division 
told reporters the case will have my full attention for the next 
72 hours i am hopeful that we will able to find any new 
information 
eleven people died including five children when police bombed 
a fortified row house occupied by move on may 13 1985 a fire that 
began when the bomb was dropped destroyed 61 homes 
a group of philadelphia ministers lawyers and community 
activists is still hoping a federal grand jury could be presented 
with evidence and issue indictments before the weekend 
but after meeting with the group for an hour dunne said he 
could offer no assurances 
the federal statutes are very strict dunne said there 
must be hard evidence to prove guilt beyond a resonable doubt that 
a party or parties intended to deny people within our community 
their civil rights which are protected by the federal law 
to date it is our conclusion that there is not sufficent 
evidence he said 
sen arlen specter rpa who organized the meeting said the 
case could be presented to a grand jury in a half a day 
specter has badgered the justice department for two years to 
take another look at the move evidence he won a promise at dunnes 
senate confirmation hearing that the department would keep that 
possibility alive 
a philadelphia grand jury and a federal investigation previously 
have concluded that the evidence would not support indictments

the house approved legislation tuesday to put 
into effect a 1972 treaty against biological weapons 
by a vote of 4080 the house approved a bill which makes it 
illegal to develop and possess biological weapons the bill goes to 
the white house where president bush is expected to sign it into 
law 
under the legislation any individual corporation or government 
is prohibited from developing or possessing any biological weapons 
and prohibited from assisting a foreign state or organization from 
doing so 
biological weapons are harmful forms of bacteria viruses fungi 
or naturally occuring toxins that could be directed at an enemy a 
biological weapon could be unleashed on an unsuspecting public by 
using it in a liquid to contaminate water or in an aerosol that is 
dropped by bomb 
in 1925 the geneva protocol banned the first use in war of 
biological and chemical weapons but did not address the 
development production possession or transfer of the weapons 
fortyfour years later president nixon ordered the defense 
department to destory its arsenal of biological weapons the united 
states then spearheaded the fight for an international ban on 
production and possession of them 
on april 10 1972 in washington moscow and london 111 
countries signed the biological weapons convention which prohibits 
production and possession of the weapons 
the senate ratified the treaty two years later 
according to the pact each nation must take any necessary 
measures to prohibit biological weapons at home legislation was 
introduced in congress over the years to include the prohibition in 
us law but the measures never got far largely because no 
administration or powerful congressional group pushed for passage

talks broke down within minutes 
tuesday between protesters and government and about 8000 enraged 
anticommunists crowded into central university square demanding 
that interim president ion iliescu resign 
another demand is the exclusion of former communists from 
politics 
the crowd swelled from about 1000 at noon as protesters 
streamed to the square following the talks breakdown 
the square is the site of an antigovernment rally that began 17 
days ago demonstrators promise to continue their protest until may 
20 when romania holds its first free national elections in more 
than 50 years 
iliescu and other former communist officials within his national 
salvation front which dominates the provisonal government broke 
with their marxist past after the december revolution here and 
embraced democratic ideals 
but their critics accuse them of clinging to communist ideals 
and of desiring to reimpose totalitarian rule if the front wins the 
elections 
recent polls indicate iliescu and the front are well ahead 
four protest leaders went to government headquarters at 1030 
am for talks with iliescu and other leaders of the provisional 
parliament but stormed out after iliescu and vice president ion 
caramitru kept them from videotaping the proceedings a government 
offer of a stenographer to record the minutes was refused 
it was not clear whether a dialogue would be resumed 
protest groups coordinating the rally said they want a dialogue 
but they want it recorded 
iliescu spokesman paul financu told a news conference a 
dialogue is still possible if protest leaders clarify their own 
position 
he said their demand to film the talks showed they were 
interested in publicity and not substance 
iliescu reversed his earlier position and agreed friday to hold 
a dialogue with a delegation from the demonstrators but then ruled 
out any discussion of their demands to change the electoral law and 
delay the balloting 
the protest delegation tuesday included stelian tanase of the 
intellectual group for social dialogue and leading former dissident 
doina cornea 
iliescu a former communist party functionary fell out of favor 
with dictator nicolae ceausescu in the early 1970s and was 
relegated to lesser posts he rose to prominence after the december 
revolution that led to ceausescus ouster and execution 
a government statement tuesday deplored the reprehensible 
attack on presidential candidate radu campeanu of the national 
liberal party during a campaign stop saturday in braila 180 miles 
northeast of bucharest 
liberal party officials said campeanu suffered a cut face 
the statement directed police to do their duty to ensure order 
and peace at electoral meetings and protect candidates from any 
violent acts 
it expressed confidence no political parties are behind the 
violence 
but liberal party and national peasant party officials blamed 
national salvation front supporters for attacks on their candidates 
for parliament and the presidency and threatened to boycott the 
elections if political violence continues 
a mile from the rally in university square visiting mother 
teresa the 79year old missionary and nobel peace laureate met 
students and implored them to prayer love and peace 
she is in romania with four other nuns to set up a permanent 
mission in chitila eight miles northwest of bucharest

a greyhound meeting with union officials only 
hours after the bus line declared victory in the drivers strike 
shows the company still needs the unions help to rebuild its 
struggling company a union official said tuesday 
union president edward m strait said he met with greyhound 
chairman fred currey monday afternoon just a few hours after 
currey held a news conference to declare the strike over 
if they continue to hire drivers who dont know where they are 
going the traveling public is the one that suffers strait said 
of the companys pledge to hire nonunion replacements for 
rebuilding the bus line which lost 56 million in the first 
quarter 
greyhound vice president anthony lannie said bus company 
officials met with union officials monday despite their 
declaration of victory in the 2monthold strike because theyd 
rather give 1300 remaining jobs to union drivers than spend 5000 
to train each new driver 
officials on both sides kept the monday afternoon meeting under 
wraps until tuesday in a letter tuesday to local greyhound union 
presidents strait described the meeting as less than cordial 
and said it produced absolutely nothing 
my only hope at this juncture is that his creditors will take 
the initiative to tell fred currey to get back to the bargaining 
table straits letter said 
curreys victory declaration is merely another smoke screen to 
avoid the real issue a fair and equitable contract for the 
professional employees who built the company straits letter 
said 
over the weekend the two sides held their first bargaining 
talks since midmarch but the talks quickly broke down after the 
company offered a fouryear wage freeze and proposed an elimination 
of 4500 union jobs the union called the offer an insult 
the union represents 6300 drivers and about 3000 office and 
maintenance workers who walked off the job march 2 
as of monday the company said 548 union drivers had crossed 
picket lines it also had hired 2888 new drivers and had 501 
others in school which would give it 3937 available drivers by 
may 16 
greyhound which is in the midst of scaling backs its services 
has said before it could operate a full system with about 3200 
drivers although more are needed for the busy summer travel season 
it told the union over the weekend it had immediate openings for 
about 600 union drivers and could probably make way for another 700 
within a few months

a lawyer for three droughtplagued western 
states asked a federal judge tuesday to order the us army corps 
of engineers to maintain water levels in a crucial reservoir along 
the missouri river 
but lawyers for the corps which wants to lower the rivers 
reservoirs to support shipping downstream contended a federal 
judge has no authority to dictate how the corps should manage its 
system of six missouri river dams 
former south dakota gov william janklow who is representing 
the three states said lowering the level of lake oahe would 
destroy this years hatch of millions of walleye eggs that would 
deal a 20 million blow to north dakota and south dakotas tourism 
industries he said 
both north dakota and south dakota rely on fishing and attendant 
tourism to boost their economies janklow told us district judge 
patrick conmy 
we dont live in wealthy states we have very limited 
economic opportunities available to us he said 
south dakota north dakota and montana are suing the corps in an 
effort to block the agencys plans to allow the water level of lake 
oahe to fall 3 feet before june 1 the lake stretches from 
southcentral north dakota into south dakota 
the three states are seeking a preliminary injunction to force 
the corps to maintain the lake at its current depth until june 1 
on tuesday the lake was measured at 15884 feet above sea level 
the judge said he would rule by noon wednesday on the request 
the lawsuit was filed friday and tuesday was the only day of 
arguments 
but charles findlay a justice department attorney representing 
the corps said conmy had no authority to intervene in the agencys 
management of the river reservoirs 
a judge may step in only if the corps acted in bad faith and 
the agency has consulted the affected states extensively in making 
its management decisions findlay said 
the three states request would block shipping in the missouris 
navigation channel which stretches from sioux city iowa to st

keeping the rivers level low also could disrupt the nesting of 
two federally protected rare birds the piping plover and interior 
least tern he said 
janklow countered that the birds would not be affected and any 
harm to the shipping industry was exaggerated

janklow said 
south dakota gov george mickelson and north dakota gov george 
sinner attended tuesdays hearing as did attorneys representing

the trial of four mexican men charged in the 
murder of us drug agent enrique camarena may be one of the most 
interesting cases a jury could address a judge told prospective 
jurors tuesday 
us district judge edward rafeedie urged the panelists to 
search your hearts and minds before asking to be excused from 
the case because of hardship 
the trial focusing on the internationally sensitive 1985 
slaying of the drug enforcement administration agent is expected 
to last about two months 
more than half of the 250 possible jurors said it would cause 
financial or other hardships to be away from their jobs for so 
long but 118 prospects said they could serve and were given a 
37page questionnaire to fill out before actual questioning begins 
in court wednesday 
the questionnaire asked how much jurors had read or heard about 
the highly publicized camarena investigation 
they were asked to disclose whether they had read about 150 
people including mexican drug lord rafael caroquintero and an 
array of alleged participants in camarenas torture murder 
the list also included the name of elaine shannon author of a 
book on the case which was turned into a tv movie 
this case will perhaps be one of the most interesting cases on 
which you will have the opportunity to serve the judge told jury 
candidates 
camarena 31 was kidnapped off a guadalajara mexico street in 
february 1985 testimony at the trial of three other men convicted 
in 1988 showed he was tortured and interrogated by drug lords 
before he was killed along with his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles 
outside gudalajara the killings were said to be in retribution for 
dea seizures of 10000 tons of marijuana 
the four men on trial are ruben zuno arce the brotherinlaw of 
former mexican president luis echeverria juan ramon matta 
ballesteros a convicted honduran drug kingpin juan jose bernabe 
ramirez a former mexican homicide officer and javier vasquez 
velasco who is accused of murdering two american tourists in an 
apparent mistake killing 
the dea has vowed to capture every person involved in the 
camarena slaying so far 22 people have been charged in this 
country and more than 20 were convicted in mexico 
jurors were also asked whether they had read about antonio 
garate bustamante a former mexican police officer who said he 
arranged the abduction of dr humberto alvarez machain another 
defendant in the camarena killing 
the alleged kidnapping strained us relations with mexico 
where president carlos salinas de gortari has called the action a 
violation of mexican sovereignty 
rafeedie presiding over separate proceedings in the doctors 
case has demanded to know how alvarez was brought here from mexico 
and has set a may 25 hearing on the matter alvarezs trial has 
been indefinitely delayed pending that hearing

nineteen european and moderate arab countries on 
tuesday urged that the plos bid to make its selfdeclared state of 
palestine a full voting member of the world health organization be 
put on hold indefinitely 
in a draft resolution to the un agencys annual assembly the 
countries including egypt and morocco called on whos 
directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima to continue studying the 
issue and report back at an appropriate time 
but iraq indicated it would try to force a vote on the issue 
the move followed renewed us threats to cut off all funding to 
who if its 167nation assembly approved the application by the 
palestine liberation organization such a move would boost the 
plos campaign for international recognition of its state 
the state department maintains the plo is not entitled to full 
membership in any un organization because it does not meet 
internationally recognized criteria of statehood including control 
of territory 
we should use political means to attain health objectives but 
not health issues to serve political ends nakajima told 
delegates attending the twoweek meeting that opened monday 
although the assembly is due to discuss issues such as 
nutrition poverty and health risks from hazardous wastes the plo 
application topped the agenda it was scheduled for consideration 
thursday 
nakajima has warned that who would have to slash all its 
important programs if the united states withdrew its funding 
including the fight against tropical diseases aids and child 
vaccination programs 
the united states is pledged to contribute 78 million to who 
this year or 25 percent of the agencys regular budget washington 
also provides much of the funding for programs outside the regular 
budget such as the campaign against aids 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said funds 
would stop immediately if the plo were admitted 
the draft resolution was sponsored by austria denmark egypt 
finland france greece ireland italy luxembourg morocco new 
zealand oman pakistan portugal senegal spain sweden 
switzerland and yugoslavia 
more than 100 countries many in the third world have 
recognized the independent palestinian state declared by the 
movements parliamentinexile the palestine national council in 
november 1988 
the palestinian state roughly encompasses the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip though no boundaries have been declared 
in a letter to nakajima last month the plo warned the assembly 
against yielding to pressure and political blackmail by the 
united states and israel

blacks who paralyzed selmas school system 
after a whitedominated vote to fire the citys first black 
superintendant promised tuesday to keep the protest going despite 
his decision to quit for 150000 
schools superintendant norward roussell 55 announced his 
resignation monday after accepting 150000 to drop a 10 million 
lawsuit against the whitemajority school board contesting his 
dismissal as racial discrimation 
this issue in selma is larger than dr roussell said dallas 
county commissioner perry varner a black protest leader who on 
sunday completed a fiveday jail term for contempt of court 
we dont see this as a sellout he said of the settlement 
in this focal point of the civil rights movement its a victory 
for us 
in december the board voted 65 along racial lines not to 
renew roussells contract when it expires june 30 the end of his 
third year 
roussells supporters contend he was fired because of his race 
his critics cite an evaluation that said he lacked managerial 
skills roussell said the evaluation was unsubstantiated 
the months since the boards vote have been marked by marches 
picketing sitins and school boycotts by black adults and students 
who said roussells firing was racist all schools in the 
6000student public system were closed for about a week in 
february dozens of people have been arrested for violating court 
orders limiting the protests 
but daily the demonstrators have returned to city hall 
varner said he and others would continue to push for an elected 
school board to preside over a public school system that now is 80 
percent black the system has shrunk to about 5700 students after 
some 300 mostly white pulled out amid the racial turmoil 
the school board currently is appointed by the city council 
which also has a white majority this city of 25000 is about half 
white half black 
the majority of the people here are good people who want the 
best for themselves and want the best for their children 
roussell said in an interview prior to his resignation but like 
any town youve got politics and racism racism feeds the 
politics and politics feeds the racism 
conflictweary students hoped to be free of both during the 
upcoming summer vacation 
it used to be perfect said carlos browning a black 
17yearold selma high school junior now it seems like white 
kids are afraid to talk to blacks 
the threemonth vacation which begins june 1 will give 
everyone time to cool down so things can get back to normal next 
year browning said 
jim walker a white senior who transferred from selma high 
school to central high school in tuscaloosa said blacks and whites 
got along great until the protests 
i had to get away from all this mess said walker this 
was supposed to be my best year and its been my worst 
roussells departure left at least one school board member 
wondering if anyone can handle the racial conflicts and please the 
whole community 
i would be afraid to apply for this job said sheila okoye 
a black board member who had opposed roussells firing 
whoever gets the job is going to be in hot water if a 
black one comes in and all the white people like him the black 
people are going to wonder what hes selling she said 
if hes a white one black people are going to feel that hes 
getting the job because hell do what the white community wants him 
to do 
a white board member dick bean said he feels the board can now 
move forward in a positive manner 
he said an interim superintendent would be chosen and a search 
begun for a permanent one

hopes raised by the release of two american 
hostages in lebanon have turned to frustration for families of 
british captives and some are demanding a conciliatory gesture 
from author salman rushdie 
david waite the brother of hostage terry waite has said 
rushdie should apologize for his book the satanic verses 
which many moslems consider blasphemous to islam 
the father of hostage john mccarthy was quoted as saying the 
satanic verses should never have been published 
rushdies defenders say it is unfair to blame the british author 
for the plight of the hostages most of them were kidnapped before 
the publication of the book in september 1988 and the subsequent 
decree issued against the author by irans ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini the religious decree or fatwa called for rushdies 
death on grounds the book blasphemed islam 
despite this a gallup poll published tuesday in the daily 
telegraph found broad public support for some sort of gesture from 
rushdie of the people queried 58 percent said rushdie should 
apologize to moslems and 36 percent thought he should withdraw the 
book 
rushdie has been in hiding since khomeinis decree was issued in 
february 1989 in an interview from hiding last month with bbc 
radio he said it was not his reponsibility to end the controversy 
over the book the people who are attacking me have the business 
of solving the problem he said 
he also told the interviewer the question was unfair 
sounding exasperated 
iran broke diplomatic relations with britain after khomeinis 
decree 
syria was a broker in gaining the release of the two americans 
last month robert polhill and frank reed however britain broke 
relations with syria in 1986 over the syrian embassys alleged role 
in attempting to bomb an israeli airliner in london 
the lack of diplomatic ties with iran and syria has been cited 
as a key obstacle to the release of waite the archbishop of 
canterburys special envoy journalist john mccarthy retired pilot 
jack mann and teacher brian keenanwho has dual irish and british 
citizenship 
paul handley archbishop robert runcies press secretary said 
tuesday night the anglican leader is considering meeting sayed 
quddus a leading british moslem who says waite is alive and well 
quddus president of a moslem group in bradford northern 
england requested the meeting he said he was told in iran 
recently that while waite was well and in good spirits he would be 
freed only in exchange for rushdie 
mann who disappeared may 12 1989 is the only british hostage 
to disappear since the rushdie controversy erupted 
manns wife sunnie 78 flew to london tuesday and said she 
thought the british government could be doing more to help the 
missing britons 
i think they could be doing a bit more to help the hostages 
but i am not in politics it is not my line she said at 
londons heathrow airport 
peter templemorris a conservative party lawmaker who chairs 
the angloiranian parliamentary group said last week that rushdie 
should consider the effect he is having on britishiranian 
relations and also the effect he is having on the british 
hostages 
he urged rushdie not to further postpone a decision about 
publishing a paperback edition of the satanic verses either 
publish and get it over with or cancel it templemorris said 
george foulkes the opposition labor partys foreign affairs 
spokesman said if rushdie scrapped the paperback and apologized 
it would help the hostages 
rushdie has said he wants a paperback but publisher viking 
penguin has not announced a decision 
frances dsouza who chairs the international committee for the 
defense of salman rushdie and his publishers said the hostages 
families have been frustrated by the governments lack of a 
strong energetic forceful policy 
she said she understood the families tremendous 
frustrations but warned that giving in to irans demands on 
rushdie would set a dangerous precedent what will they ask next 
that we extradite mr rushdie 
an editorial tuesday in the independent newspaper said rushdie 
has already apologized for the shock and pain caused by his 
novel this was a reference to an essay rushdie wrote in which he 
expressed regret for the tensions the book had caused 
in the essay that appeared in the independent on sunday weekly 
newspaper rushdie said he never intended to blaspheme islam but 
recognized that many moslems were shocked and pained by his book 
among the scenes moslems found offensive were one in which 
prostitutes are given the names of the wives of the prophet 
mohammed the book also implies that mohammed wrote the koran the 
moslem holy book instead of it being dictated by allah

widespread torture and other abuses continue 
unabated in turkey six months after the government proposed new 
human rights safeguards according to a report by amnesty 
international 
in early 1990 thousands of people remained imprisoned for 
political reasons including hundreds of prisoners of conscience 
convicted for their nonviolent political or religious 
activities the international human rights organization said in a 
report being released wednesday 
among them are members of political organizations trade 
unions and kurdish groups as well as journalists and religious 
activists the use of torture continues to be widespread and 
systematic in some cases resulting in death 
turkey ratified the united nations convention against torture in 
1988 the report said 
in september and november last year the government announced 
proposals governing length of detention access to lawyers and 
protection for prisoners of conscience none of those proposals has 
been enacted 
under the government proposal the maximum detention period 
under police custody would be reduced from 15 days to four to 10 
days though longer detention would be permitted under emergency 
legislation 
the government also proposed abolishing the death penalty for 13 
categories of offenses but not for murder and political offenses 
that produce the most death sentences the report said 
while these draft amendments if passed would represent a 
step in the right direction they nevertheless would fall short of 
international standards in important respects amnesty 
international said 
the report included testimony from several prisoners who said 
they were tortured with beatings on the soles of their feet 
electric shocks showers of ice cold water and being hung by their 
arms 
torture is still routine even among those detained for only a 
few days amnesty reported 
the testimony of prisoners shows anyone is at risk from 
torture in turkey particularly if held on political grounds the 
report said 
many prisoners sign confessions under torture which are then 
used as evidence against them in violation of international 
standards it said

there wasnt much doubt that kevin kline could 
play hamlet 
he did it four years ago at the new york shakespeare festival in 
an odd uneven production directed by liviu ciulei its biggest 
plus was kline who offered a thoughtful clearspoken but 
lowkeyed portrait of the danish prince 
now hamlet and kline are together again for a second time as 
part of the festivals sixyear marathon of all of shakespeares 
plays in addition to playing the title character kline now has 
taken on the task of directing the play himself 
kline the director may not yet be the equal of kline the actor 
but he has done a respectable job this is a nononsense cleanly 
performed hamlet done with a minimum of production clutter in 
this version the text is all and no one speaks it better than 
kline 
kline the actor has improved since his last outing hes more 
relaxed freer and a little looser with the plays tragedy and 
moments of comedy than he was in 1986 yet he doesnt neglect the 
poetry that is such an important part of the role 
this hamlet has more passion than klines previous incarnation 
he grieves openly for his dead father his outrage at his mothers 
marriage to his uncle is fiercer his relentless humiliation of 
ophelia is more unnerving almost sadistic his wit and bitter 
sense of humor is more sharply defined particularly in the 
gravediggers scene when he ruminates on the nature of life and 
death and his realization of what he must do to avenge his 
fathers death is more carefully plotted out it builds 
appropriately to a bloody climax that seems inevitable from what 
has gone before 
kline has staged the play simply with few props and the barest 
of stage sets just a burgundy curtain hanging on a back wall the 
costumes are modern dress when hamlet first appears wearing a 
buttonedup white shirt with a high collar and a black suit he 
looks like a refugee from one of new yorks downtown rock clubs 
claudius done up in red sash and a blue military uniform 
resembles an admiral in dry dock and gertrude wears a ballgown 
that would be just as appropriate at the plaza as at elsinore 
there are a few awkward touches the playwithinaplay is oddly 
staged with claudius and gertrude on the platform with the actors 
who are reenacting claudius crime and the duel at the end of the 
evening seems cramped on the anspacher theaters small playing 
area the fight almost careens into the audience 
for the most part the play has been cast with remarkable care 
brian murray is an unctuous claudius who nevertheless manages to 
generate some sympathy for his nasty predictament 
dana ivey in the plays most thankless role is a regal 
unyielding gertrude while diane venora is a vulnerable ophelia 
able to make the characters famous mad scene shattering rather 
than silly best of all is joseph sommers polonius priggish 
without being petulant and whose death can be seen as a loss even 
by hamlet 
kline is a generous actordirector allowing each performer 
down to the smallest role a chance to shine but what makes this 
an enriching hamlet is klines fidelity to the play itself as 
an actor and now as a director

a white teenaged murder defendant was a 
jerk to pick up a bat and go after four young blacks to protect 
his neighborhood but it was not his fault one of the blacks was 
shot to death his lawyer said tuesday 
prosecutors however said the defendant keith mondello was 
accountable because he organized the white mob that surrounded and 
trapped yusuf hawkins 16 in the moments before hawkins was shot 
aug 23 in brooklyn 
after final arguments tuesday the jury was charged by justice 
thaddeus owens of brooklyns state supreme court jurors began 
deliberating at 530 pm 
a second panel already was weighing the case against joseph 
fama the accused gunman in the hawkins killing the cases were 
tried in the same courtroom but heard by separate juries 
both juries retired for the night at about 7 pm 
fama and mondello both 19 would face 25 years to life in 
prison if convicted of murder 
outside the courthouse tuesday about a dozen protesters 
chanting justice for yusuf were arrested for disorderly conduct 
in his closing argument mondellos lawyer stephen murphy said 
the incident was not motivated by race and sought to place the 
blame on a local young woman gina feliciano for inviting black 
and hispanic drugdealer friends to a party in the mostly white 
bensonhurst neighborhood 
he said mondello believed the blacks were coming to attack the 
local whites 
everyones going to say ginas not the cause of this thats 
garbage murphy said she put the wheels in motion 
but assistant district attorney paul burns said it was 
preposterous for mondello and the gang he assembled to believe 
they had the right to arm themselves and go out on a public 
street to protect their neighborhood 
burns said the batwielding white mob stalked and surrounded 
hawkins and his three black friends and pushed hawkins into a 
doorway 
after one of the whites allegedly fama pulled an automatic 
pistol and fired four shots the white mob scattered without 
pausing to help their fatally wounded victim burns said 
like a mob they came like a mob they left group courage 
masking individual cowardice he said 
burns charged that mondello organized armed and set in motion 
the actions of the mob 
thats depraved indifference to human life he said urging 
a murder conviction for mondello hes responsible under the 
law 
murphy called hawkins shooting a horrible thing but argued 
that mondello who admitted he was at the scene with a baseball 
bat had nothing to do with it 
as they were walking away some lunatic comes out and shoots 
him murphy said 
he said mondello was foolish to believe miss felicianos threat 
and foolish to sign a police statement confessing to his role in 
the attack 
he is a jerk murphy said he let her make a jerk out of 
him he let the cops make a jerk out of him but its no crime to 
be a jerk 
mondello is charged with two counts of murder two counts of 
manslaughter three counts of unlawful imprisonment three counts 
of menacing one count of riot four counts of discrimination and 
one count of weapon possession

were unchanged five percent said antisemitism was declining 
the poll of 506 randomly chosen moscow adults found 91 percent 
of the respondents thought jews should be alllowed to decide for 
themselves whether to emigrate 
the american jewish committee along with the national science 
foundation the university of houston and the soviet academy of 
sciences paid for the poll 
the likely uncertainty in a sample of 506 people would be more 
than four percentage points either way according to a standard 
statistical calculation 
another survey conducted by the jewish research center of the 
soviet sociological association in moscow focused on about 500 
soviet jewish leaders

of antisemitism in the last six months of 1989 
the polls were released at a hearing of the congressional human 
rights caucus 
richard schifter the assistant secretary of state said 
official antisemitism has declined since soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev instituted reforms in 1986 
at the same time liberalization inside the soviet union has 
allowed groups pressing the antisemitic case to become more 
visible 
the number of jews leaving the soviet union has increased 
dramatically with thousands leaving the country each month in 
1989 71000 jews emigrated up from 914 in 1986

fritolay inc must pay singer tom waits 
almost 25 million for imitating his gravelly style in a radio 
commercial hawking corn chips a federal court jury decided tuesday 
now i have a fence and a gate around my voice waits said 
following the verdict 
the jury deliberated abut eight hours over two days before 
deciding waits should receive 2475000 the entertainers lawyer 
had asked for 15 million 
this was a humiliation to mr waits they picked on the wrong 
guy said waits attorney howard king 
waits 40 was portrayed as a street poet with a loyal following 
who had refused all offers to do commercials turning down such 
corporations as honda kraft and burger king 
many of his songs are paeans to gritty life at the margin 
describing nighthawks at the diner truck drivers hard drinkers 
and prostitutes in dingy worlds filled with cigarette smoke 
fritolay attorney anthony liebig argued waits wasnt wellknown 
enough to be imitated 
there is no question he is widely known to extreme insiders in 
the rock industry but that has nothing to do with being known by 
the broader segment of the population liebig said 
waits sued fritolay and ad agency tracylocke inc which hired 
dallas singer stephen carter to launch ads for its salsa rio doitos 
in september 1988 
he sued in us district court under federal trademark laws and 
under a california common law established in a case involving 
bette midler that outlaws imitating a professional singers 
distinctive voice for commercial use 
i was shocked waits testified during the trial when asked 
his reaction to hearing the corn chip commercial for the first 
time i think he studied me closely i heard things i do with my 
voice that ive never heard anyone else do a certain intimacy 
waits said carter copied my phrasing my timbre my voice my 
approach 
it embarrassed me he testified i had to call my friends 
and tell them if you hear this thing please be informed its not 
me i was on the phone for days and people kept calling me 
waits has been featured on such albums as franks wild years 
rain dogs swordfish trombones and closing time he has 
also been an opening performer for such acts as frank zappa 
the singercomposer also contributed to the motion picture score 
of one from the heart and he appeared in the films rumble

columbias scheduled launch next 
week with the 100 million astro observatory could be delayed days 
or even weeks because of a problem with the shuttles cooling 
system nasa said tuesday 
engineers need time to assess the situation said nasa 
administrator richard truly i dont see it to be an 
earthshattering problem 
the launch had been scheduled for may 16 or may 17 
if a valve that doesnt seem to be working properly has to be 
changed nasa would prefer doing that at the launch pad truly 
said the procedure has never been performed there however and 
officials are uncertain how many days that might take 
bascom murrah a nasa official in charge of prelaunch operations 
for columbia estimated it would be a 10day to twoweek hit 
its a big job murrah said you would have to drain the 
system of coolant and clean it 
rolling the shuttle back to its hangar to change the valve or 
another part of the cooling system such as a filter would mean an 
even longer delay truly said two shuttles already are in the 
hangar atlantis and the newly returned discovery and work on 
them would be disrupted he said 
its hard for me to speculate because i dont know if we have 
to change anything truly said but he added well think a 
long time before we decide not to fix it on the pad 
the valve in question in one of columbias two freon cooling 
loops controls the proportion and rate of freon distributed 
between the crew cabin heat exchanger and the cooling system for 
payloads 
engineers on sunday saw an unexplained change in the flow of 
coolant nasa said 
the system is still operating with a reduced flow and 
engineers are reviewing data on the system and conducting 
troubleshooting activities the national aeronautics and space 
administration said in a statement 
in parallel with troubleshooting managers are also assessing 
what would be required to change the valve and where that activity 
would be performed the agency said 
nasa managers are reviewing the situation at the twoday flight 
readiness review meeting which began tuesday the agency had hoped 
to confirm a launch date by the end of the meeting wednesday 
columbias nine to 10day flight will be the first spacelab 
mission since 1985 four astronomers who are part of the sevenman 
crew will operate the onboard observatory which will probe 
sources of ultraviolet and xray radiation 
up to 100 mission managers and other officials meanwhile went 
through a simulated shuttle accident tuesday to test emergency 
procedures and better prepare for a reallife disaster 
it worked better than we thought it would said william 
lenoir head of nasas space flight program there were very few 
lessons 
during the 1hour exercise at kennedy space center television 
monitors showed a shuttle returning to the launch site shortly 
after liftoff the shuttle in the video veered off the runway 
injuring two of five astronauts 
the simulated problems included main engine shutdown less than 
two minutes into the flight a leaking power unit inability to 
purge the shuttles hydrogen lines and excessive winds such 
failures when combined are extremely unlikely lenoir said 
truly said a series of simulated shuttle accidents are planned 
to make sure the communications loops are in place 
an accident on board an orbiting shuttle will be simulated at 
johnson space center in houston around late june followed by a 
mock crash landing at edwards air force base calif in august

eighty contra rebels turned in 
their weapons tuesday to un peacekeeping troops on the first day 
of their demobilization after nearly a decade of battle a rebel 
leader said glumly we did not have the ending we all wanted 
the disarming was the first under an accord reached last week 
between the government of president violeta barrios de chamorro and 
the leadership of the nicaraguan resistance the contra umbrella 
organization 
many of the weapons turned in tuesday were old and rusty and 
some of the fighters were preadolescent boys in olivegreen 
uniforms several sizes too big 
all beginnings are difficult said jose pallais vice 
minister of security forces in the new government 
the usbacked contras had waged a nineyear insurgency against 
the leftist sandinista government defeated in elections by mrs 
chamorros coalition she took office april 25 
the disarmament process is to continue until june 10 
armando orozco guzman 28 was the first contra to formally 
disarm he turned in a battered ak47 assault rifle that he claimed 
he had used during his five years with the rebels 
orozco was photographed for a temporary identification card to 
use until he receives permanent identity papers from the nicaraguan 
government an organization of american states representative 
registered his name and identification number 
he picked up new civilian clothes blue denim pants a cotton 
shortsleeved shirt underwear socks and boots and turned in his 
uniform which oas representatives burned 
then he stood in line waiting for a truck to take him home 
un officials said there are about 13800 rebels in seven 
security zones that were set up throughout the country for the 
demobilization 
el almendro a dozen wooden homes on the banks of a small river 
is the assembly point in security zone 5 which straddles rio san 
juan province 180 miles southeast of managua 
un officials said there were about 1600 contras in zone 5 but 
that more were coming in from the surrounding countryside 
we did not have the ending we all wanted to do away with the 
uncertainty that remains in all the nation israel galeano the 
top contra commander told troops standing at attention under a 
broiling noon sun 
but we will be strong as long as we remain united he added 
galeano and other contra leaders had objected strongly to mrs 
chamorros temporary retention of gen humberto ortega brother of 
sandinista former president daniel ortega as commanderinchief of 
nicaraguas armed forces 
the contras had demanded gen ortega and all other sandinistas 
be removed from the military before they disarmed that demand was 
not mentioned in the twopage accord signed friday 
today those who deposit their weapons should not be afraid 
you are not alone galeano told the troops we are not doing it 
in exchange for a ration or a pair of shoes we are doing it to 
help the nation 
after fighting the sandinistas since 1981 the contras have 
agreed to return to civilian life while the sandinistas remain in 
control of the army 
galeano told his soldiers those wanting to disarm voluntarily 
should step aside and do so only 80 of the assembled troops did 
the oas will provide nonlethal aid to the contras after they 
hand their rifles over to the un peacekeepers 
most of the weapons turned in were sovietmade ak47 rifles in 
a warehouse the rifles were being split into two or three pieces 
mines and grenades were to be destroyed elsewhere 
on hand for the disarming were gen agustin quesada of spain 
who heads of un peacekeeping troops and representatives of mrs 
chamorro and cardinal miguel obando y bravo

oliver north met with thenvice president 
george bush a few hours after lying to the house intelligence 
committee about assisting the nicaraguan contras an entry in 
norths white house diaries suggests 
portions of the diaries released tuesday renew questions about 
whether bush was more deeply involved in assisting the contras than 
he has acknowledged 
the 1400 pages of notebook entries were obtained by a private 
group the national security archive as the result of a lawsuit 
filed against the government us intelligence agencies still are 
reviewing the remaining 1200 pages of norths diaries 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the vice 
presidents role in the irancontra affair was completely examined 
in the congressional inquiry and we have nothing to add 
among the disclosures in the newly released material 
on dec 20 1985 north laid out a 3rd country solicitation 
plan in support of the contras that included trips by bush to 
honduras for an inauguration there the plan also called for 
president reagan to meet with ecuadors president 
bush went to honduras in january 1986 for the inauguration of 
president jose azcona hoyo and reagan met in washington that month 
with ecuadoran president leon febres cordero 
there was an elaborate plan in the reagan administration to 
induce third countries to support the contras according to 
evidence introduced at norths trial last year bush has denied 
being involved in any quid pro quo arrangements providing 
additional economic and military aid to honduras in exchange for 
allowing the contras to use base camps there 
norths notes refer to a noon meeting w vp on aug 6 
1986 that would have been just 3 hours after north lied to the 
house intelligence committee by denying he was supplying military 
advice to the contras north admitted he had lied when he took the 
witness stand at his own trial last year and when he testified in 
the recent trial of former national security adviser john 
poindexter 
shortly before meeting with bush according to norths diaries 
the white house aide had a meeting w don gregg bushs top 
national security aide 
gregg now the us ambassador to south korea has said he found 
out about norths involvement with the thensecret contra resupply 
network on aug 8 1986 gregg asserts he didnt tell bush about 
norths involvement until four months later after the irancontra 
affair became public 
the notebooks provide offer no elaboration on the aug 6 meeting 
entries but earlier that day the diaries show north got a call 
relating to problems in the contra resupply operation the call was 
about felix rodriguez a former cia operative sent to el salvador 
with the blessing of gregg 
rodriguez wound up working in norths contra resupply network 
but had a falling out with him rodriguez complained to gregg on 
aug 8 1986 that private operators were getting rich off of 
norths network 
us rep lee hamilton dind said he didnt believe congress 
had seen the page referring to bush and gregg and aug 6 meetings 
it clearly at the very least would raise questions which ought 
to have been put at the time to appropriate witnesses hamilton 
said of the aug 6 entries i would have if i had seen them 
the former house irancontra committee chairman suggested that a 
congressional investigation might be in order 
if there is evidence relevant diaries were withheld redacted 
or blacked out then i would want the house intelligence or 
judiciary committees to conduct an investigation said hamilton 
i would expect the same of the independent counsel he 
added referring to the irancontra prosecutors office 
north and others in the us government who arent identified 
by name in his notes met with panamanian gen manuel noriega in 
march 1984 where the discussion focused on the role of costa rica 
as a buffer between nicaragua and panama 
a march 6 1984 entry focused on the vulnerabilities of 
roberto daubuisson referring to his inability to deliver us 
aid saying he was a poor military officer and alleging he 
bumped off best friend daubuisson is the founder of arena 
now the ruling party in el salvador 
what were the quids and the quos with all these countries 
tom blanton deputy director of the archive asked at a news 
conference what did the vice president know and when did he know 
it how much did don gregg know 
the justice department released the new material from norths 
notebooks in response to a lawsuit filed by the group and by public 
citizen a group founded by ralph nader 
north still has the notebooks but he supplied copies of 900 
pages in 1987 to the irancontra congressional committees his 
lawyers heavily censored the portions they turned over to congress 
asked whether north attorney brendan sullivan had withheld 
relevant material from the irancontra congressional committees 
blanton said you bet 
blanton cited a jan 5 1984 entry stating costa rica 
project approved a reference to planned military exercises and 
other steps designed to counter the threat posed by nicaragua one 
entry said that thencosta rican president alberto monge needs to 
be stroked 
reached by telephone at his office sullivan said that he has 
not commented in the past on the irancontra affair and would not 
do so now 
this material should never have been withheld from congress in 
the first place said sen john kerry dmass whose senate 
subcommittee investigated allegations of narcotics trafficking in 
connection with the contras 
kerry said the executive branch should produce the remainder of 
the material without further delay 
north turned over copies of all 2600 pages of his notebooks to 
the irancontra prosecutors office at his trial last year 
prosecutors did not object to the turning over of the new batch of 
material to the private group

brazils environment czar vowed tuesday 
to curb the destruction of the amazon rain forest and to develop 
the biologically sensitive area in a rational humane and 
ecological manner 
we cant stop development and growth but yes we can make 
human occupation compatible with the survival of the planet said 
national environment secretary jose lutzenberger 
lutzenberger 64 outlined a plan for encouraging development 
and farming while preserving the unique ecological balance of the 
2million square mile rain forest 
a worldrenown ecologist he said the government will introduce 
a program to revitalize the forests soil through organic 
agricultural methods and to reduce the traditional style of 
slashandburn farming that has destroyed 200000 square miles of 
the region 
he said the collor de mello administration which first took 
office in march will also quadruple its firefighting efforts 
in this way we will stop small farmers impoverished by soil 
that only gives two or three harvests from burning other tracts of 
the jungle said lutzenberger he said the world bank and the 
interamerican development bank had expressed interest in financing 
the program but gave no details 
slashandburn farmers clear large tracts of unused land by 
setting fires and then plant crops until the soil is exhausted 
they then move on to fresh land 
lutzenberger said the burnings are now monitored by satellites 
that can detect even small brush fires he said forest rangers in 
helicopters are used to catch and fine violators 
he said brazil will also explore alternative energy sources such 
as solar wind and biomass energy instead of building the huge 
hydroelectric dams that were popular in recent decades 
environmentalists have opposed the dams saying they flood huge 
tracts of amazon land killing trees and animals while providing 
few benefits for the thousands of indians and brazilian farmers 
living in the area 
he specifically singled out the itaipu dam built by brazil and 
paraguay on the parana river dividing the countries and the tucurui 
project in the amazon jungle 
itaipu only produces at 60 percent of its capacity and we 
dont even know what to do with so much energy lutzenberger 
said tucurui generates electricity for large aluminum factories 
that export minerals at low cost and the amazon natives dont see 
any benefit 
lutzenberger said brazil should scrap plans for large dams in 
the rain forest and concentrate instead on promoting small 
generators and floating river turbines financed and run by local 
municipalities and private businessmen 
the appointment of lutzenberger an agronomist educated in the 
united states was seen as a victory for conservationists who 
claim brazil has traditionally done little to preserve the amazon 
there are many people who would like to see the jungle 
disappear to raise cattle but they wont do it with my approval 
he said

but in the past has given about 100000 in money from prizes to 
causes for saving the environment 
vikas amte said his father was not religious but he believed in 
god and saw god in human beings

the prize citation for birch called him an original thinker 
who uses modern discoveries in natural science to expand mans 
understanding of god as designer and creator of the universe and 
its creatures 
birch said he will use his prize partly to fund an annual

of theology in claremont calif and a christian social ethics 
project in geneva 
templeton 77 a presbyterian elder from nashville tenn is a

hindus a buddhist and a moslem 
templeton told a news conference the prize was not for 
saintliness nor good works but is limited to people who have 
done something of an original nature that led to a great increase 
in mans love of god or mens understanding of god

a judge said tuesday he again 
summoned two cadets who may have crucial knowledge involving the 
massacre of six jesuit priests to testify in the trial of nine 
military men accused of the murders 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday the bush 
administration has told president alfredo cristiani the murder 
investigation is a serious matter that could affect us 
attitudes on continued aid to el salvador 
up to now the only evidence against the accused is testimony by 
other suspects in the case under salvadoran law such testimony is 
not considered valid 
a squad of uniformed soldiers roused the victims the six 
priests as well as their housekeeper and her daughter from their 
home at the central american university campus on the night of nov 
16 the eight were shot to death 
the crimes were committed during a monthlong offensive by 
leftist guerrillas in a militaryheld area which was under a 
dusktodawn curfew 
col guillermo benavides commander of the military school at 
the time and three lieutenants and five soldiers were charged with 
the murders pretrial evidence purported to show the death squad 
left from the school 
four cadets were on guard duty at the school that night and may 
be able to shed light on who left and who entered the building then 
but when judge ricardo zamora of the 4th criminal court asked 
them to appear as witnesses the army told him they had been sent 
out of the country on a study mission 
cadets jose wilfredo aguilar alvarado cesar moises rivera perez 
and raul galan hernandez are at fort benning ga and erick 
othmaro granados is at a military school in panama 
zamora said tuesday he again summoned aguilar alvarado and 
granados to testify 
a court source told the associated press monday that the 
military reported as disappeared a guard logbook at the school 
that the court wanted as evidence and benavides denied having a 
personal diary he was supposed to have kept the source insisted on 
anonymity 
zamora said tuesday that two officers summoned to testify have 
not appeared adding that it has become virtually impossible for 
the case to be presented to the jury because of lack of 
evidence 
at least one retired officer said publicly that benavides acted 
under orders from higher ups to assassinate the jesuits whom the 
progovernment press had been attacking as leftist sympathizers for 
weeks before the murders 
more than 72000 people have been killed since guerrillas of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln launched a war 
for power a decade ago most victims were civilians suspected of 
being leftist sympathizers slain by rightist death squads with 
links to the military 
the fmln announced tuesday it will continue attacking military 
targets until an accord is reached with cristianis rightist 
government to end the war 
a rebel news release said the fmln recently presented un 
official alvaro de soto who is acting as a gobetween with the 
cristiani government an outline of their demands for ending the 
war 
in the document rebel leaders reiterated earlier demands for 
political reforms and that the size of the military be reduced and 
its command structure purged of rightist officers

the leader of a separatist party 
declared victory tuesday after preliminary results showed his 
croatian democratic union had won at least 158 seats in the 
356seat state legislature 
the final round of parliamentary elections held sunday and 
monday was croatias first free vote in 50 years 
with about 70 percent of the 2 million votes counted the party 
for democratic reform which ruled the republic as the croatian 
communist party before the elections had 42 seats 
a centrist coalition of independents and other smaller parties 
won six seats with distribution of the rest still uncertain 
democratic union leader franjo tudjman said his partys first 
task would be to prepare a new westernstyle constitution for 
croatia and to discuss yugoslavias future with the other five 
republics in the yugoslav federation 
tudjmans centerright party advocates croatias independence 
from the rest of yugoslavia its apparent victory is likely to 
exacerbate political and ethnic tensions with other republics 
particularly serbia which remains under orthodox communist rule 
the 66yearold tudjman who was once the yugoslav armys 
youngest general spent almost five years in jail in the 1970s for 
croatian nationalism and hostile activities against the state 
he said he was once a true communist believer but now im 
glad that croatia is free of marxist oneparty hell 
tudjmans campaign was based largely on nationalist sentiment 
and the appeal for independence under his formula yugoslavias 
six republics would become independent states under a loose 
confederation and would maintain relations only in areas of common 
interest 
croatia followed the neighboring republic of slovenia in holding 
multiparty elections after more than four decades of oneparty 
rule macedonia and bosniahercegovina are planning free elections 
later this year communistruled montenegro and serbia have not yet 
legalized opposition parties

pope john paul ii said tuesday the 
church and state in mexico are reaching a better understanding and 
issued a veiled appeal for a repeal of the decadesold 
constitutional ban on catholic schools 
open the world of teaching to christ the pope cried in a 
speech to a crowd that included many schoolteachers 
later before the biggest throng of the trip john paul called 
on young mexicans not to lose hope in the face of injustice and 
poverty and to seize faith in christ as a weapon against despair 
many of todays young are wounded by despair the pope said 
citing evasion abandon hedonism discotheques drugs 
indifference pessimism the artificial paradises in which so many 
find refuge 
thousands of youths waved white yellow and green handkerchiefs 
pennants and caps as the pope spoke to more than 200000 people 
gathered on the slopes of a bowl in the hills at san juan de los 
lagos about 50 miles south of aguascalientes 
the popes talks to the youth of mexico and their teachers came 
on the third day of his second trip to mexico 
on tuesday night back in mexico city the pope met with the 
foreign diplomatic corps and urged a more moral approach to the 
problems of refugees and the foreign debt 
i feel the obligation to underline the ethical dimension 
of this imprisoning crisis the pontiff said speaking about the 
foreign debt 
mexico has a 93 billion foreign debt second highest in the 
developing world after brazil 
in aguascalientes 275 miles northwest of mexico city the pope 
stopped off at the airport before flying on to san juan because 
the pope did not enter the city replicas of downtown colonial 
buildings were installed as a backdrop to his speech to teachers 
john paul speaking under a white parasol to ward off the 
blazing sun noted recent increased contacts between the vatican 
and mexico whose constitution has harsh restrictions on religious 
activity 
a new perspective of contacts between the church and the 
political community of this country is occurring in this day the 
pope said and in this phase of better understanding and 
dialogue the church wants to offer its own support without 
straying from its specific goals and abilities 
it was the popes most direct public comment on the gradual 
relaxation of the churchstate relationship in mexico that was 
symbolized when president carlos salinas de gortari met john paul 
at the mexico city airport on sunday 
the 1917 constitution says all schools must be governmentrun 
with a curriculum set by federal authorities 
in practice however catholic schools and universities have 
long existed and are growing in number in one of the paradoxes 
that characterizes churchstate relations many government leaders 
send their children to catholic schools which are generally 
considered of higher quality 
the pontiff said he hoped that mexicans would overcome the idea 
raised by critics that the church had obstructed cultural and 
scientific progress 
it is enough to remember the secular educative efforts of the 
religious and ecclesiastical institutions from the first 
evangelization until the present day he said 
the church lost the right to religious schools because its 
liberal opponents during the late 19th and early 20th centuries 
believed it was a regressive force in mexico that retarded social 
progress 
the pope drew wild cheers when he spontaneously saluted the 
corazones calientes or hot hearts of aguascalientes 
which means hot waters and refers to the areas thermal springs 
the throng did the wave and also waved white handkerchiefs 
and flags bearing the image of the pope 
john paul then traveled to the nearby shrine of the virgin of 
san juan de los lagos the 18thcentury sanctuary in a pink stone 
basilica contains an image of the virgin made of corn husks 
millions of pilgrims annually pay homage to the statue which was 
credited with resurrecting a dead little girl in 1623 
i the afternoon mass for youth the pontiffs homily was 
interrupted for minutes at a time by cheers and chants when the 
pope asked if those present would allow themselves to be tricked by 
drugs hedonism or false ideologies they roared no 
young people dont lose hope you are pilgrims of hope the 
pontiff said 
john paul called the mass for youth the moment of my trip to 
mexico that i have most looked forward to the pope has a special 
affection for the young and in mexico about 65 percent of the 
population is under 29 
john paul appeared sunburned after a day in the sun even though 
he spoke from the protection of a canopy priests on the temporary 
altar at san juan wore yellow baseball caps to shield themselves 
john pauls eightday visit is his 47th trip outside italy as 
pope and his 10th journey to latin america

the navy has reversed its ruling that an rotc 
cadet discharged for homosexuality will have to repay the 
government 38612 in scholarship tuition the cadet learned 
tuesday 
rob bettiker a chemistry major at massachusetts institute of 
technology received a letter from the navy saying the military 
would drop its bid to force him to reimburse the government for the 
tuition 
bettiker who had been fighting the navy over the issue said he 
thought the turnaround was great 
i was really surprised i thought the best case that would 
ever happen to me is that the secretary of the navy would just 
consider my case indefinitely he said 
bettiker said he hoped the navys decision would have 
implications for other reserve officer training corps cadets 
discharged for their sexual preference 
the way its worded they tried to make it as particular to me 
as possible but i feel its a precedent he said 
the navy quit paying bettikers tuition after the fall semester 
bettiker was discharged jan 31 
the 22yearold ohio native had planned to enter the navys 
prestigious nuclear propulsion program after graduation next month 
but will now be working in a cancer research laboratory at the 
university of california at berkeley 
david carney a second homosexual cadet has reportedly also 
been exempted from the navys demand that ousted homosexual cadets 
repay the government for tuition 
carney a harvard university graduate is studying in britain 
and could not be contacted for comment 
in an interview earlier carney said in my view the us 
navy broke its contract with me not vice versa 
a navy spokesman said the two cases were reviewed on their 
merits and the decision was made not to seek recoupment but 
that there had been no changes in the defense departments policy 
barring homosexuals from the armed forces the new york times 
reported in wednesdays editions

nato is at a critical phase as it struggles to 
adapt to change in europe and tries to make a partner in 
security out of the soviet union the alliances secretary 
general says 
we are looking at this alliance not as an instrument of 
confrontation but as an element of cooperation in a new security 
structure manfred woerner said monday 
speaking on the eve of the opening of a new round of nato 
meetings woerner also dismissed soviet suggestions that a unified 
germany become neutral or hold dual membership in both the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
neutrality is no alternative and to be a member of both pacts 
is just neutrality without a word the former west german defense

the charred remnants of americas 
two worst space tragedies the 1967 apollo fire and the 1986 
challenger explosion will soon be united in an abandoned missile 
silo miles from any plaque or memorial 
the apollo capsule will be moved from nasas langley research 
center in hampton va where it has been in a shipping container 
for 23 years and buried atop the remains of the shuttle 
no ceremony is scheduled when the capsule its heat shield and 
31 cartons of hardware and investigative material arrive on a 
flatbed truck around may 20 no marker is planned 
its not as if by putting this in the silo we have forgotten 
the contribution these guys have made to the program there are

president bush met with republican leaders 
today to push his idea for a no preconditions budget summit 
designed to reduce the deficit 
democrats were holding separate meetings to map strategy for 
their participation in what could be the first formal taxincrease 
discussions of bushs presidency 
gop leaders have hailed bushs icebreaking overtures on the 
budget 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said on monday he 
believed democrats would join in the process 
i believe the answer will be in the affirmative said dole 
we need to do it 
democratic leaders of the house and senate meantime were 
meeting with rankandfile members to gauge their feelings about 
budget bargaining in an election year 
sixteen top democrats met for an hour monday in a closeddoor 
session 
weve had different views expressed house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash said afterward 
pressure has been building for action on the budget because of 
the slowing economy and the increasing cost projections of the 
federal bailout of the savings and loan industry 
the weaker the economy the less revenue the government can 
expect to collect and the greater the federal deficit 
as a result the amount of budget cuts the administration says 
will be er taxes and cuts in benefit programs 
you sure arent going to get that without starting this 
process and having the right people there arguing all of it on the 
table said sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican 
on the senate budget committee 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there would be no 
preconditions to holding the negotiations republicans denied 
that such a statement is inconsistent with bushs campaign pledge 
of no new taxes 
there isnt any president who hasnt tried to make good on his 
promises theres no president who hasnt lived through times that 
change and maybe outdate some promises said rep bill frenzel 
of minnesota top republican on the house budget committee 
frenzel said he favors a package paring next years deficit by 
55 billion including some form of new taxes would be the only 
way bush can do the job frenzel said 
domenici said he would want to reduce the shortfall by between 
42 billion and 50 billion higher taxes should be open to 
negotiations he said 
last week the house passed a democraticwritten spending plan 
that includes 36 billion in deficit reduction the senate budget 
committee approved another democratic plan containing 43 billion 
in savings both proposals would give the military nearly 10 
billion less next year than bush wants 
bush proposed a budget in january that claims to shrink the 
shortfall by 36 billion to just under 64 billion the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law requires that next years budget 
gap not exceed 64 billion

somewhere out there is an economic boom in the 
pacific rim in eastern europe in western europes unified market 
of 1992 in latin america even in the united states 
you can feel it and read about it in daily newspaper reports in 
the economic analyses of brokerage houses in academic writings 
the worlds politics and markets are being restructured 
opportunity is out there 
seizing it however may be another matter akin to reaching for 
a rainbow or grasping for a dream or walking into a mirage or as 
it has been put like trying to spend the socalled peace dividend 
a decade or more ago the boom was to be in latin america with 
us banks financing the way toward swift industrial development 
somehow it didnt work out that way now some of those nations 
cant afford to repay the loans 
the pacific rim was the rage a few years ago economies on the 
asian shore of the pacific ocean were exporting huge amounts of 
products and rapidly raising their living standards moreover 
there was china an awakening giant 
but the united states got tired of importing so much and began 
insisting on freer trade china lost a great deal of enthusiasm for 
westernstyle development the future of hong kong once more was 
thrown into question 
the european economic communitys barrierfree market scheduled 
for 1992 became an outlet for the emotions of economic boomers 
the united states of europe thats what it would be 
what a market declared the boomers europe will produce more 
efficiently what they make best and the united states will do what 
it does best and the two massive entities will trade themselves 
into greater wealth 
it might come true but experience flashes caution it could 
mean more competition than cooperation trade relations always are 
touchy each side feels it gives too much neither side believes it 
receives reciprocity 
thank goodness for the east european option said american 
business people the sudden development of free markets in the 
socialist states will provide an enormous opportunity for 
industrial and consumer goods they said 
questions will people accustomed to governmental paternalism 
adjust to the uncertainies the risks of competition who will pay 
the bills for cleaning up the polluted environment what goods can 
these nations offer in trade 
where will the boom occur how perhaps some say right here in 
the united states with the peace dividend being the lever that 
thought had currency for awhile but the thesis slammed into 
reality 
it probably is true that money will be saved on military 
defense but everyone knows that dozens of new ways to spend 
already are waiting for sponsorship and that every one of them 
will be deemed urgent by somebody 
to date the peace dividend has been layoffs not just from cuts 
in government spending but from efforts by companies to lessen 
their dependency on government contracts why taxes might even be 
raised not lowered 
the lack of success in finding an economic boom or the 
potential for one is not discouraging the seekers brokerage 
houses arent just looking one year ahead difficult as that is to 
do but an entire decade into a new century 
the forecasts are laden with terminology such as new era decade 
of globalization era of change new world gay nineties all over 
again the century of space most have a world view or even a 
spatial perspective 
but when the future becomes history it might be seen all over 
again that the greatest boom of all was created right in the homes 
in the insatiable appetite of human beings for new consumer 
products services and dreams

people dont fear the military as 
they did when gen manuel antonio noriega was in power but 
deciding on its role and personnel is a problem for the new 
government 
the new public forces include officers who were loyal to 
noriega many panamanians question whether highranking officials 
of the old regime have a place in the new order 
panamanians wont accept that officers of the old defense 
forces could be those who in a democracy control the police 
the newspaper panamaamerica said to think about putting into 
uniform and arming those who for many years oppressed punished and 
tortured is not an easy task 
the militarys makeup should be submitted to a referendum said 
alberto conte leader of the civic crusade a business and 
professional organizaion that led the opposition to noriega 
keeping noriegas old officers doesnt offer any guarantee 
that the new public forces will be efficient respectful and 
demilitarized he said 
eusebio marchosky in charge of an effort to recover state 
property stolen by noriega and his cronies said officers who had 
served the dictator were hindering his work and retaining them is 
against the national will 
ricardo arias calderon who is second vice president interior 
minister and justice minister has said panamas leaders chose to 
keep noriegas officers after the us invasion in december because 
to exclude them would be to judge them categorically and not as 
individuals 
officials of the civilian government have accused members of the 
new public forces of crimes 
special prosecutor rodrigo miranda charged capt leslie loaiza 
head of the judicial police academy with involvement in the 
kidnapkilling of marcos rodriguez justines 3yearold nephew of 
former col marcos justines who was noriegas second in command 
and now is in jail 
officials say the apparent reason for the abduction was to force 
justines jailed on charges of helping steal 47 million in a bank 
scandal to share the money why the child was killed is uncertain 
fortyseven other other noriega officers are jailed on charges 
ranging from misdemeanors to murder 
noriega took refuge in the vatican embassy but surrendered to 
us forces jan 3 and now awaits trial on drug charges in miami 
arias said many panamanians had suggested firing everyone and 
recruiting from zero on the second day of the invasion he said 
the leadership had to decide between that and issuing a call to 
service on new terms 
forming an entirely new military and police force would have 
meant asking us soldiers to remain three to five years while it 
was done arias said 
mario rognoni a legislator from noriegas democratic 
revolutionary party said the idea of demilitarizing the country 
is an error because a modern state must have the necessary elements 
of security 
he said panama is made vulnerable by its location and the fact 
that it will assume control of the panama canal at the end of the 
century 
for more than two decades the panama defense forces were 
responsible for all military and police functions which now are 
under civilian control 
this years military budget is 80 million about 70 million 
less than under noriega and only 35 percent of the total national 
budget 
several specialized battalions noriega controlled have been 
disbanded along with six schools or bases generally used for 
military instruction a civilian police academy is in the planning 
stages 
panamas air force is run by the national air service and 12 of 
its more costly planes are assigned to the treasury ministry the 
navy and marines no longer exist 
there will be nobody in uniform in charge of all services a 
role reserved for the civilian president arias said 
he said a commission concluded the ratio of security forces to 
citizens should be 4 to 1000 meaning 8000 officers but that 
panama needed 12000 because of its forests and special maritime 
needs the commission was made up of security officials from spain 
argentina and costa rica which disbanded its army more than 40 
years ago 
noriegas defense forces numbered about 15000

the youngest president of the one of the worlds 
largest record companies has an itchy ear for alternative music and 
is pushing those bands harder than such superstar staples as 
michael jackson and bruce springsteen 
don ienner 36 became president of columbia records a year ago 
after being lured from arista records where he was executive vice 
president and general manager while at arista he helped launch 
singer whitney houston into popstardom 
but within just 48 hours at columbia ienner seized upon the 
sound of poi dog pondering an eclectic folkethnicrock band from 
hawaii and texas who had two eps out on the tiny label of texas 
hotel records 
the idea ienner said in an interview was to get alternative 
bands and work with them over the years to create a mainstream 
following 
we had bruce springsteen covered ienner said the 
previous regime had no idea what we were doing with alternative 
music they didnt break the psychedelic furs they didnt break so 
many great bands nothing nobody the philosophy before was 
if you cant sell 2 million albums dont work it 
cbs records which owns columbia records in the past rode high 
with mainstream successes such as jacksons thriller and 
megahits from springsteen george michael barbra streisand billy 
joel neil diamond and james taylor 
but columbia records was in a slump after sony corp bought the 
parent company in 1988 
we needed to change direction ienner said there was 
nothing just retreading the superstars just one after another 
after another thats why we were losing market share thats why 
we were losing people thats why we werent getting any new 
bands 
ienner speaks in a booming staccato about his professional 
passion music 
im not a harvard mba he said im not the accountant and 
i never even finished high school music has been my life and 
thats the thing i love the most 
he started his career as a teenager working in the capitol 
records mailroom in 1969 from 197277 he was in partnership with 
his brother jimmy ienner in a publishing management and 
production company he went to arista from millennium records a 
label he cofounded in 1977 
besides poi dog pondering the first band he signed as president 
after a heated battle with almost every other major record label 
he picked a young band called toad the wet sprocket from santa 
barbara calif 
poi dog has befuddled music critics trying to describe its 
peculiar sound the ensemble plays everything from the standard 
guitar bass drums to the notsostandard accordian flugelhorn 
tin whistle wood block congas banjo and somebodys used frying 
pan 
among other things the ensuing musical mesh has been called 
hillbillyluauearth mother rock a wild stew of global folk 
styles and a blissful aural buzz 
toad the wet sprocket relies heavily on an accoustic guitar has 
a sound in the vein of the smiths and fuzzy resonant vocals 
similar to rems michael stipe 
it was important that we get and use poi dog pondering as our 
signature band ienner said poi dog and toad would show our 
musical sensitivity 
it would also help columbia cater to a huge audience carved out 
in large part by college radio stations looking for an alternative 
to top 40 music 
the hope is also that the smaller dormant bands will blossom 
into big hits further down the line similar to the success of 
bands and artists such as rem the replacements the b52s the 
violent femmes new order lou reed and elvis costello all on the 
warner bros label 
if you work the baby bands as hard as you work the big bands 
or maybe work the baby bands more than you work the big bands 
youll have something that youll be proud of in the next five 
years said ienner

it wasnt long after the 
first tourists appeared in the valley carved amid granite peaks 
that conservationists mourned the impact of humans here 
frederick law olmsted a member of the first yosemite 
commission wrote in 1865 of picturesque rocks stenciled over 
with advertisements of patent medicines naturalist john muir 
complained the valley looked like a frowsy backwoods pasture 
after a visit in 1889 the year before yosemite became a national 
park 
yosemite national park turns 100 this year so do its problems 
in muirs day no more than a couple of thousand hardy folk each 
year trekked through the wilderness to refresh themselves in the 
mists of yosemite falls and marvel at the parks granite monolith 
el capitan 
last year 34 million people came through the valley bringing 
with them some of the very problems they were trying to escape in 
the city park officials are struggling with the best way to deal 
with the crowding pollution development and traffic that threaten 
its natural beauty and serenity 
yosemite for a number of reasons really just ranks very 
highly in peoples level of care said allan bedwell national 
park service spokesman it goes back to yosemite playing a major 
role in this country as a symbol of wilderness or nature or 
primeval heritage 
i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that its 
accessible to people those cliffs those waterfalls represent 
wilderness even though you have to view that wilderness in a 
fairly urban setting 
visitors can order anything from pizza to prime rib in 
yosemites snack bars and restaurants or buy tshirts tennis 
balls and mugs in park gift shops then get extra cash from an 
automatic teller machine a beauty shop and video rental cater to 
park service and concession employees who live in the valley 
law enforcement officers booked 500 people into the jail last 
year 
it was anticipated a decade ago that yosemites 100th birthday 
on oct 1 1990 also would be a celebration of the ambitious 1980 
general management plan that promised to balance convenience with 
conservation 
but 10 years proved too short a time to meet such grandiose 
goals as eliminating cars from the valley and removing nonessential 
businesses offices and personnel to locations outside the park 
boundaries 
the park service has acknowledged the failure to fully implement 
the plan and is cataloging nearly 4500 letters of comment from 
park enthusiasts as it decides how to plan realistically for 
yosemites next 100 years 
the plan was formulated at a time when there was a different 
administration and different political climate park 
superintendent michael finley said 
its implementation was hindered in part by a lack of money 
and in some instances by proposals that proved unrealistic 
finley said 
for example a landscape architect has found there is not enough 
suitable land to expand employee housing in the community of el 
portal outside the park as the plan proposes finley said 
the park service did succeed in eliminating 650 parking spaces 
as planned but a parking garage that was supposed to replace some 
of the lost spaces never materialized 
pressure to remove facilities from the park has remained 
constant from environmentalists who complain many of the services 
interfere with the mandate to preserve yosemite 
we want to make it accessible to people but do you need to be 
able to buy mugs and tshirts and a badminton racquet in order to 
enjoy yosemite national park asked patricia schifferle regional 
director of the wilderness society 
superintendent finley argues that visitors who soothe their 
muscles in a swimming pool after hiking to the top of yosemite 
falls or spend a night in a 180 room at the ahwahnee hotel also 
gain an appreciation of the park 
if you look at it one way you could be shocked and say in 
john muirs holy temple there are swimming pools finley said 
but if john muir could keep 200000 people from churning up the 
merced river would he do it by putting in three swimming pools 
at the heart of the controversy over what services are 
appropriate for a national park is the yosemite park and curry co 
a subsidiary of mca which provides guest services in the park 
critics argue that curry wields too much influence over the 
park schifferle cites currys proposal to remove some existing 
employee housing and replace it with dormitories near yosemite 
lodge schifferle says the plan is contrary to the goal of removing 
unnecessary employee housing from the valley 
a lot of whats been said critical of the curry company is 
flat erroneous theyve said we want to build more facilities here 
not true said curry spokesman john poimiroo he defended the 
dormitory plan saying it would decrease traffic between el portal 
where it was proposed employees would be moved and the valley 
floor 
critics also say the company profits from a 30year contract 
that requires it to pay the government only 75 percent of its 
annual sales while not contributing to the goals of the general 
management plan 
the national park service revealed that in 1989 curry paid 
635000 to provide without competition most guest services 
poimiroo admits the fee is low he points out however that 
currys financial commitment to the park does not end with the 
concessions fee 
curry also has invested 100 million in the park since 1973 
when mca bought the concessionaire in maintenance and capital 
improvements which included 8 million to repair and restore the 
ahwahnee hotel poimiroo said 
but claims that the money represents an investment in the park 
are met with skepticism by environmentalists who say curry 
ultimately makes money on that type of spending 
are they spending money on the park or are they spending 
money to do business in the park schifferle said thats why i 
find the 100 million is probably more pr hype than reality as far 
as actual benefit to the park its probably benefiting curry 
company enormously 
attempts to renegotiate the concessions fee before the contract 
expires in 1993 have failed but many expect the new contract to 
include clauses requiring curry to invest some profits in specific 
programs 
finley points out that even successfully raising the fee would 
not necessarily mean more money for yosemite itself the 
concessions fee is deposited in the us treasury where it is 
reappropriated by congress leaving the park service to compete 
with other interests finley said 
the lively debate on how to protect yosemites natural beauty 
inevitably leads to the park services conflicting missions 
preserving the park while making it accessible to the public 
yosemite always has been on the political hot seat because 
probably more than any other park it mirrors that tension every 
day of every year said jim snyder park historian the issues 
have become national because they symbolize what could happen to 
the national parks

the odd thing about the dan quayle rumor is 
how few people believe it yet it refuses to die 
three years in advance of election day 1992 president bush told 
the dallas morning news that quayle absolutely would be his 
running mate again hes doing a very good job an outstanding 
job said the president 
then why is washington awash in a new flurry of dump quayle 
rumors 
the poll numbers certainly have a lot to do with it bush enjoys 
approval ratings of close to 80 percent while fewer than half the 
people questioned give quayle passing grades in a recent gallup 
poll 54 percent described quayle as unqualified to be president 
it all has to do with the news business said walter f mondale 
who spent four years as vice president without anyone suggesting he 
was about to be dumped by jimmy carter 
on every national political news reporters calendar oh 
about october of the first term of a president he always writes 
the vice presidential failure story said mondale 
the reason i never had one is we would usually get a hint the 
story was coming and carter would call the reporter personally 
hed say i want you to know mondale is the best vice president 
anybody ever had and im very happy with him 
but mondale was the exception 
conservatives wanted to dump george bush liberals wanted to 
dump lyndon johnson moderates wanted to dump richard nixon 
conservatives wanted to dump nelson rockefeller in restrospect it 
seems like lots of people wanted to dump spiro agnew 
its part of the job description for vice presidents 
preside over the senate attend funerals and be the target of 
rumors the president wishes hed picked someone else for his 
running mate 
but switches are rare 
gerald ford dumped rockefeller in 1976 in favor of sen bob dole 
of kansas who campaigned at a low growl and shocked viewers of his 
debate with mondale when he blamed democrats for all the wars of 
the 20th century 
dole has quipped that in the 1976 campaign he went for the 
jugular and got his own 
richard viguerie a conservative activist recalled the save 
agnew effort mounted by the political right in 1971 when there 
was talk that nixon might dump the former maryland governor from 
the ticket in 1972 
conservatives made a big effort to make sure agnew stayed on 
the ticket he said they neednt have bothered soulmate pat 
buchanan later said that nixon had no thoughts or intentions of 
dumping agnew 
viguerie and his ideological comrades would have liked someone 
other than bush as ronald reagans running mate in 1984 
but said viguerie conservatives never thought there was any 
hope of dumping bush 
one nearunanimous view in assessing the quayle rumor is that 
bush has a highly developed sense of loyalty and would not dump the 
man he picked to run with him in 1988 
if anybody really knows george bush they know he is long on 
loyalty said tom griscom who served as white house 
communications director during the reagan presidency 
george bush is about as intensely loyal a person as youll 
ever find in politics said viguerie 
and yet the rumor continues to have currency 
a recent version noted that secretary of state james a baker 
iii had bought a ranch in wyoming and thats a fact bakers real 
estate deal prompted speculation that he would change his voting 
residence to wyoming so that he could run in 1992 on a ticket 
headed by fellow texan george bush 
the constitution bars presidential electors from casting their 
votes for two candidates from their own state thus if two texans 
were paired on the national ticket only one of them could receive 
that states electoral votes 
absolutely positively he has no plan to change his voting 
residence said margaret tutwiler a longtime baker aide who now 
is chief state department spokesman 
washington loves a good rumor and even many of those who 
shrugged off the quayle speculation did so in a way that somehow 
kept it alive 
the problem with this is the timing is all wrong said a 
political consultant who insisted on anonymity as quickly as he 
dismissed a bakerforquayle trade as improbable the consultant 
went on to speculate that quayles standing in the polls will 
never improve in this age of mass media once the public has 
decided something theres just no way to reverse it 
another consultant pointed to a magazine article about columnist 
george will who happens to be one of bushs least favorite people 
take note said the consultant who insisted on being nameless 
that the article was written by bush friend vic gold further said 
he it points out that will and quayle have been lunching together 
a sure sign to the devious of mind that the president is peeved 
with his veep 
mondale offered a little sympathy 
you can always find someone in any administration who thinks 
the vice president should go and usually you can find quite a 
chorus if you put in an hour or two said the former vice 
president 
but mondale also said that quayles problem appears different 
in depth and scope quayle he said is a troubled occupant of 
that position

the labor department issued a report friday that 
created quite a shock hardly anybody concerned with the future of 
the economy failed to react to it within minutes 
many economists were unnerved after reading the report they 
wondered what had gone wrong with their interpretation of the data 
and why they had not foreseen what occurred 
some viewed the new report as indicative of an economy even 
weaker than realized some saw it as a sign the bottom had been 
reached and that the economy would begin strengthening the stock 
market suddenly came alive 
whatever they made of the numbers hardly an economist who wants 
to remain in the public eye failed to offer an explanation 
interpretation or forecast 
most significant of all the reactions was the widespread view 
it seemed to sweep through the investment community in minutes 
that the numbers would force the federal reserve to reconsider 
lifting interest rates 
what caused this commotion 
the april jobless rate and numbers that created it thats what 
what did the rate do it rose to 54 percent in april from 52 
percent in march or if you include military to 53 percent from 
51 percent 
you might wonder how little numbers like that can cause big 
reactions like those that occurred and your wonderment is 
justified after a weekend of reflection you may be sure that many 
people are less excited than before 
that short period of reflection for example might have caused 
some of them to realize that the change in the numbers might be a 
matter of methodology rather than reality and that the numbers 
might yet be revised 
revisions are common and they include the march numbers after 
studying their data for example labor department analysts raised 
by 103000 their estimate of payroll increases in that month the 
earlier figure was 26000 
a single months data has always been suspect simply because it 
could be an isolated event that event could be a real one an 
actual occurrence but it also could be due to faulty counting or 
to seasonal adjusting 
while realizing this the economic fraternity nevertheless 
reacted as if to a major event and one conceivable explanation 
might be boredom a look at the statistics over the past year or so 
provides the basis for that theory 
since last april that is the most inclusive monthly 
unemployment rate one that includes military has varied from 53 
percent only once that was last may when it dipped to 52 percent 
of the labor force 
in short the jobless rate has provided little if any clue to 
the economys direction in that time a time in which the economic 
fraternity was looking far wide and everywhere for any little 
indication of direction 
placed in that perspective therefore the april jobless rate 
represented a big change and to be sure some other elements in 
the report were significant such as a continued decline of 
manufacturing employment 
but even janet norwood commissioner of labor statistics 
thought the report wasnt really of major significance and she so 
informed congress she told them that 
thus far we can discern no meaningful changes in the 
measures that might signal a deteriorating unemployment situation 
in particular mrs norwood said neither the number of newly 
unemployed those jobless less than than five weeks nor the 
number of job losers has started to climb

greyhound lines inc has resumed most of its 
operations but some analysts question whether the company has 
enough cash to avoid bankruptcy as it tries to recover from a 
9week walkout by bus drivers 
chairman fred g currey said monday the strike was in effect 
concluded from the point of view of daytoday operations he 
said greyhound is serving areas which brought in 98 percent of its 
revenue last year and will be running at 90 percent of scheduled 
prestrike miles by june 19 
union officials challenged the claim pointing to the companys 
recent announcement of a 558 million firstquarter loss they 
said curry was trying to scare striking drivers back to work 
in addition to the loss greyhound has said it would not make a 
975 million interest payment due may 15 the company also did not 
pay about 5 million in lease payments due at the end of april 
some analysts have questioned whether the dallasbased company 
will be able to pay bills to operate even if creditors dont call 
in their loans and force the company into bankruptcy a 
possibility because of the missed payments 
greyhound had amassed a strike fund of more than 50 million but 
has said the frequently violent walkout in which some buses have 
been hit by gunfire has cost more than anticipated 
in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission 
last week greyhound said it had spent 20 million on beefed up 
security legal fees and extra driver training 
im surprised at how much cash theyre burning said leigh 
walzer an analyst with rd smith amp co in new york cash could 
become a real bind walzer gave the company only a 20 percent 
chance of surviving the strike without having to file for chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection from creditors 
currey would not disclose greyhounds cash resources in an 
interview monday but he said money that would have been used to 
cover interest and lease costs is being used to help operate the 
company 
nevertheless currey said creditors recognize greyhound can be 
rebuilt and we expect and weve received cooperation 
currey said ridership increased last week to its highest levels 
since the strike began although it remains between 65 percent and 
75 percent of yearago levels 
revenue is running at about the same level he said and remains 
less than expenses although the carrier is near breakeven 
he suggested revenues would be 85 percent to 90 percent of last 
years levels by mid to late summer curry also said the company 
could post a profit by next year 
union officials have challenged the companys claims of restored 
service and said curreys victory cry was a publicity stunt 
its a common ploy to try to scare a few more strikers into 
scabbing by announcing that theres no hope said aflcio 
spokesman rex hardesty 
mr curreys claim that the greyhound strike is over is like 
napoleon claiming victory at waterloo its both ridiculous and 
false said jim la sala international president of the 
amalgamated transit union the umbrella organization for the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions 
the company proposed a contract offer saturday that would have 
eliminated 4500 union jobs changed from permile wage rates to 
hourly wage rates and imposed a fouryear wage freeze union 
officials called the proposal an insult and refused to put it 
to a vote no further talks were scheduled 
currey did not rule out resuming negotiations with the union 
noting it remains the licensed bargaining agent for the drivers he 
said the company would continue to need drivers as it expands 
the union which represents 6300 drivers and about 3000 office 
and maintenance workers walked off the job march 2 
as of monday the company said 548 union drivers had crossed 
picket lines it also had hired 2888 new drivers and had 501 
others in school which would give it 3937 available drivers by 
may 16 
greyhound has said before it could operate a full system with 
about 3200 drivers although more are needed for the busy summer 
travel season 
the company also said it would reduce its charter operation 
sharply from 197 cities to 19 cities and cut unprofitable miles 
company officials could not provide the number of destinations 
that will lose service but currey said local carriers already 
have moved on to many of those routes and greyhound is trying to 
locate new carriers for the others 
it would appear that the company needed this strike to justify 
abandoning bus service to rural communities across the country 
said the atus la sala

mci communications corp chairman william g 
mcgowan has a surprise for shareholders of the phone companys 
common stock the firstever dividend 
mci the nations secondlargest longdistance company will pay 
a twiceayear dividend of 5 cents mcgowan told applauding 
shareholders at the companys 18th annual meeting monday 
he said the dividend would be payable june 11 to shareholders of 
record as of may 21 
that is going to be an mci policy said mcgowan adding 
hopefully well even increase it someday 
we didnt want to borrow to pay a dividend and we didnt go 
cashpositive until the third quarter of 1988 said daniel f 
akerson mcis chief financial officer 
he said that for nearly two years mci paid its bills as well as 
financed expansion through internally generated funds 
that practice was broken last month when mci said it would 
borrow money from banks to buy telecom usa inc of atlanta the no 
4 longdistance company for 125 billion 
we didnt want to send the wrong message to investors 
akerson said adding thats why its a modest dividend we still 
feel investors that invest in mci are primarilly interested in 
growth 
still he said the company decided to start paying a dividend in 
part to attract institutional investors such as pension funds many 
of which are barred by their own rules from investing in companies 
that do not pay dividends 
mcgowan who ran the 90minute meeting at the kennedy centers 
concert hall appeared in good spirits despite having undergone 
chest surgery in april mcgowan who underwent a heart transplant 
in 1987 was released april 16 from a pittsburgh hospital the most 
recent surgery was described as unrelated to the transplant 
mcgowan said the board of directors approved the dividend 
despite having second thoughts about committing the 
washingtonbased company to the expense while acquiring telecom 
usa the acquisition announced april 9 awaits approval by 
telecoms shareholders and several government agenies 
mci earned 156 million in the first quarter on revenue of 18 
billion for all of 1989 the companys profit rose 58 percent to 
529 million on revenue of 647 billion

the jurisdictional turf battle between the 
federal agencies regulating securities and futures markets moves to 
the senate panel that oversees one of the rivals the commodity 
futures trading commission 
the cftc has been locked in a war of words with the securities 
and exchange commission the stock market regulator over which 
should oversee financial products that have elements of both a 
security and a futures contract socalled hybrid products include 
stock index futures 
the senate agriculture committee was scheduled to hear this 
afternoon from top officials of the four agencies that make up the 
white house working group on financial markets the federal 
reserve board the sec cftc and the treasury department the group 
was set up in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash to handle 
intermarket issues 
fed chairman alan greenspan sec chairman richard breeden cftc 
chairman wendy gramm and treasury undersecretary robert glauber 
were scheduled to appear at the hearing 
the four already have aired their views before congressional 
panels and in numerous speeches and interviews breeden and glauber 
are on one side gramm on the other with greenspan somewhere in 
between 
breeden and glauber think at the very least the sec should be 
given control of stock index futures these products now 
controlled by the futures exchanges with cftc oversight allow 
investors to speculate on the stock market without buying the 
underlying stocks 
a federal appeals court last year ruled that such hybrid 
products come under the purview of the cftc if they have the 
slightest similarity to a futures contract 
breeden has complained that the court ruling discourages 
financial innovation and drives new products to foreign markets 
greenspan says he is slightly in favor of giving the sec 
control of stock index futures 
but he is against merging the sec and cftc which has been 
proposed in legislation introduced in the house last month 
greenspan also says one agency should be responsible for setting 
margin limits but he doesnt know which one margins are the down 
payments investors must make to buy securities or futures contracts 
on credit 
margins for the securities markets usually 50 percent of the 
total price are set by the fed margins for futures contracts are 
set by the exchanges with limited input by the cftc and typically 
are much lower 
critics claim that the disparity in margins limits leads to a 
trading strategy known as index arbitrage in which speculators 
trying to take advantage of brief price differences between the two 
markets move huge blocks of stock back and forth 
that say critics leads to wild price swings that frightens 
small investors from the stock market 
but gramm disagrees with those criticisms in a speech to a 
futures industry conference last week she said the attempt to grab 
cftc authority over stock index futures is driven by jealousy 
on wall street and regulatory imperialism at the sec 
in an informal session with reporters last friday breeden said 
his bid to acquire control of stock index futures was for the good 
of the economy 
this is a policy dispute he said this isnt a question 
of turf

carl icahn virtually conceded defeat in his 
latest battle with usx corp but he remains convinced he will 
ultimately win his crusade to boost the price of the steelenergy 
conglomerates stock 
icahn told shareholders at the usx annual meeting monday he 
might not have the crucial support of several big institutional 
investors he said his plan to break up usx and spin off its us 
steel subsidiary apparently would fail 
but the takeover strategist who is usxs largest stockholder 
with a 133 percent stake told reporters he found a strong 
nucleus of shareholders who believe management should do more to 
improve the companys stock price 
icahn said he would keep talking to these shareholders and he 
predicted i think there will definitely be some changes 
i think we made a statement icahn said of his nonbinding 
proposal which would have separated the lackluster us steel from 
the more robust marathon oil co 
icahn may have been undaunted because he knows how to win this 
game hes done it before 
in 1988 icahn lost a fight to unseat texaco incs board of 
directors at the oil giants 1988 annual meeting but several 
months later texaco management decided to undertake a 
restructuring including the sales of billions of dollars worth of 
assets that icahn had campaigned for as a means of boosting share 
values 
we were right at texaco icahn told reporters monday 
well stick around to see that stock value appreciate he 
said of usx 
icahn made a hostile takeover bid for usx in the mid1980s but 
he said another buyout offer is unlikely because the companys 
poison pill defense limits the number of shares he could buy 
before the meeting observers said icahn eventually could force 
management to restructure aggressively even if his proposal failed 
the company has said it will continue its 10yearold 
restructuring but management wants to accomplish it on its own 
terms 
there was no surge of support for icahn apparent at mondays 
gathering he received polite applause for his comments but 
shareholders who spoke in favor of management and against breaking 
up the company got a slightly more enthusiastic response 
the 3hour meeting was attended by some 600 shareholders most 
of them individual stockholders and retirees of usx subsidiaries 
the meeting largely was uneventful the companys biggest 
shareholders the institutional investors did not speak and many 
already had submitted their proxies results of the vote were not 
expected for at least a week 
icahn got the most support from the crowd when he complained 
about the usx stock price which he contended would improve if his 
plan were carried out and shareholders were issued separate stock 
for us steel and for marathon 
the outcome of mondays vote was being watched as an indicator 
of how much strength takeover strategists have in the 1990s now 
that the debtfinanced takeover boom has ended 
in march takeover strategist harold simmons lost a proxy fight 
that sought to remove the board of directors at lockheed corp the 
biggest winners in that battle were institutional investors who 
extracted concessions from lockheed management

usx corp may have won its latest battle 
with carl icahn but the level of support for the takeover 
strategists breakup plan should keep pressure on management to 
bolster the companys stock price 
this is a corporation that has changed and will continue to 
change that is inevitable usx chairman charles a corry said at 
the companys annual meeting monday 
most of the shareholders in attendance showed support for 
managements fight against icahns proposal it called for the 
company to spin off its us steel subsidiary to shareholders 
leaving usx as an energy company with its marathon oil co unit 
which is based in findlay 
icahn conceded his plan was likely to be defeated but he said 
he found a significant amount of support among major shareholders 
shareholder bruce schoenberger a toledo attorney said he 
favored icahns proposal because it would force management to 
consider taking some kind of action to boost the stocks value 
it requires them to at least look at some alternatives he 
said 
about 600 people mostly small shareholders and retirees 
attended the meeting in the auditorium of a junior high school 
institutional investors the companys major shareholders did 
not speak and many already had submitted their proxies 
it will take a week or longer to count the votes said usx 
spokesman william keslar 
icahn contends the relatively weak steel business is hampering 
usxs stock price and is a potential drag on the company if there 
is an economic downturn 
he said he was certain he had the support of the holders of 
about 80 million shares nearly onethird of the companys 
outstanding common stock but he said several key institutional 
investors had not told him whether they would support his plan 
which icahn said indicated they might have been leaning towards 
management 
he conceded he may lose the vote but was confident he had 
succeeded in forcing management to make future changes to enhance 
shareholder value 
if we lose we still have an excellent mandate icahn said 
several of the large investors have said we agree with you he 
said they agree conceptually something has got to be done 
most of the shareholders who spoke at the meeting supported 
management saying us steel needs the capital provided by the oil 
business they expressed fear the company could become a takeover 
target if it sheds the steel business 
i agree wholeheartedly there will be great need for capital 
both in the oil and steel business icahn said in response to one 
shareholder but why should usx jeopardize the future of the oil 
business which is a jewel and use that capital for steel 
icahn received the most applause when he said usx stock is 
greatly undervalued the financier has argued that stock in 
separate steel and energy companies would be worth a total of 48 a 
share 
usx closed down 50 cents at 3350 a share monday on the new 
york stock exchange 
peter rosko a shareholder and finance professor at the 
university of minnesota said it was uncertain whether the stock 
would appreciate that much but he still favored icahns proposal 
neither division should subsidize the other neither should 
cover the sins of the other he said 
in response to corrys upbeat assessment of the companys 1989 
results rosko asked why hasnt the stock moved 
the audience clapped when rosko asked corry to predict what usx 
stock will be worth in 1992 
corry declined to answer but said icahns analysis of past 
growth could be misleading because it is based on certain narrow 
periods 
the stock price is what it is corry said the real 
question before stockholders doesnt deal with that 
the question before stockholders is does this idea make 
sense is it likely to improve things

chrysler corp today begins tooting 
its own horn in advertisements that say two pairs of its cars beat 
two hondas in consumer testing 
the campaign is the latest effort by the company to shore up its 
declining sales by attacking japanese competition head on 
were attacking the myth of complete infallibility of the 
japanese carmakers chrysler marketing vice president john 
damoose said monday at a media briefing on the new television 
radio and print advertising campaign 
the companys campaign began in march with a television ad 
showing chairman lee iacocca pacing around a table of company 
executives and saying the no 3 us automakers cars are just as 
good as their japanese rivals but that no one knows it 
the campaign also has included a sixcity road show that winds 
up later this month in los angeles with iacocca reiterating that 
theme 
the automaker also has a safety campaign aiming at japanese 
automakers which supply far fewer cars with air bags than chrysler 
does 
late last week general motors corp began a campaign enlisting 
all of its active and retired employees and dealers to tell 
friends neighbors and acquaintances that the quality of gm cars 
has improved during the last five years 
ford motor cos latest automobile advertisements make no 
quality comparisons with japanese products it began its quality 
is job one theme nine years ago and has no plans to change it 
in its new ads chrysler will cite a study it commissioned 
involving 200 southern california owners of gm or ford cars who 
called themselves likely importcar buyers the study had consumers 
compare the honda accord with the dodge spirit and plymouth 
acclaim and the honda civic with the dodge shadow and plymouth 
sundance 
the spirit and acclaim are essentially the same car as are the 
shadow and the sundance 
the researchers from us testing co market research inc of 
wheeling ill found that after quizzing the consumers on 33 
facets of the cars operations 83 percent preferred the 
spiritacclaim over the accord and 76 percent preferred the 
sundanceshadow over the civic 
those results certainly are at odds with recent sales figures 
the accord was the best selling car in the united states last 
year with 362707 driven off dealer lots the bestselling 
chrysler car was the dodge dynasty far down the list with 109250 
sold 
dennis hill president of the research company said he didnt 
know how many of the surveys participants actually bought one car 
or the other chrysler spokesman ac liebler and hill declined to 
say how much the study cost or how much the automaker was spending 
on advertising 
the ad campaign comes at a time when chryslers us car sales 
need a boost 
sales of chryslers cars slipped 218 percent through the first 
four months of this year compared with last year at the end of 
april the companys cars held 87 percent of the total car market 
compared with 107 percent at the same time last year 
meantime sales of hondas cars have risen 44 percent and 
market share rose to 83 percent from 74 percent last year 
part of the slide in chryslers market share was due to scaling 
back its presence in the fleet market which chrysler said was too 
costly and the absence of a subcompact car a lack caused when the 
company shut down a detroit assembly plant in february 
we knew this would happen liebler said of the market share 
decline 
damoose and liebler declined to say when the effects of the 
advertising campaign should begin showing up in sales figures but 
both were confident that the ads would make a difference

at the supermarket industrys international trade 
show executives are finding out what its like on the other side 
of the cash register 
theyre taking a fourday shopping excursion and the emphasis 
along the aisles of the marathon mccormick place convention center 
is on the healthy convenient and environmentally friendly 
in past years the convention has served as a springboard 
for virtually all of the industrys significant innovations from 
scanning to microwaveable foods said michael muldoon an 
official of the shows sponsor the food marketing institute 
in 1990 the convention will continue to play a vital industry 
role taking a hard look at the issues likely to dominate the 
business in years to come especially food safety health and 
nutrition environmental concerns and human resources muldoon 
added in a statement 
the trade show spanning 25 acres is billed as the largest annual 
exhibition of its kind and is complete with pyramids of shiny red 
apples and the aroma of buttery garlic bread samples 
an estimated 35000 visitors are expected to view the stocked 
displays featured by about 1000 companies during the show which 
ends wednesday 
grocers of the 1990s are becoming increasingly concerned about 
health convenience and environmentally sensitive packaging as they 
restock their supermarket shelves said timothy m hammonds the 
institutes senior vice president 
its happening largely because the babyboom generation that 
built the fastfood industry now have families and dont have 
time hammonds said 
at the same time the industry is using more recyclable 
material and paying more attention to solid waste he said 
jerry greenfield cocreator of ben amp jerrys ice cream 
typified the marketers increased consumer awareness 
on monday for example greenfield was busy scooping samples of 
the companys new reducedcholesterol ben amp jerrys light an ice 
milk that the waterbury vt company introduced early this year 
you wont get skinny eating ben amp jerrys light but you will 
get onethird less fat and 40 percent less cholesterol the 
companys promotional material says 
like many other americans greenfield said im getting 
concerned with my fat intake 
among the executives sampling the ice milk was richard turici a 
general manager for entenmanns inc the bakedgoods company based 
on new yorks long island is removing the fat from its products 
turici said a new line of about 12 cholesterolfree fatfree 
cakes and cookies has pushed entenmanns sales up 40 percent 
healthier food is whats hot among todays consumers turici 
said 
kellogg co of battle creek mich is promoting its 
healthconscious image by offering to measure cholesterol levels in 
a booth displaying packaging of two new cereals the company will be 
marketing 
it supports our image our products have no cholesterol 
said bud w morgan vice president of the companys central zone 
cereal he said also fulfills customers need for convenience 
the new cereals are bigg mixx and kenmei rice bran bigg mixx is 
a combination of wheat oat corn and rice aimed at youngsters 
the cereal is packaged in a box featuring an animal thats a 
curiously humorous combination of a chicken a pig a wolf and a 
moose kenmei rice bran is a rice flake that kelloggs hopes will 
catch on the way oat bran cereals have 
responding to increased environmental awareness several 
companies exhibited recyclable grocery bags continental extrusion 
corp of garden city ny for example is marketing a reusable 
bag with handles of recyclable polyethylene resin 
the customer buys a bag for 50 cents and gets 5 cents back each 
time he or she brings it to the market the bag should easily last 
the 10 trips it takes to recoup the cost said robert pachelbel a 
sales executive 
the crux of the matter is youre reducing the amount of 
waste being put out in landfills said pachelbel 
the washingtonbased food marketing institute is a nonprofit 
international association with 1600 members operating about 17000

karl eller an expansionminded leader whose name 
was synonymous with circle k corp for seven years has resigned as 
chairman and chief executive of the debtridden convenience store 
chain 
eller 61 presided over an expansion that saw circle k grow 
from 1200 stores in 1983 to the nations secondlargest 
convenience chain with 4685 in 33 states last november in the 
process it rang up debts of 13 billion 
no replacement was named monday but the company said president 
robert a dearth jr 45 would manage operations with oversight 
from the board of directors 
spokesman ray cox said eller resigned to pursue personal 
business opportunities 
cox said eller and circle k executives agreed not to comment 
beyond a statement announcing the resignation 
eller said in the statement that with the company in the process 
of restructuring it was time for him to step aside and give the 
directors the latitude to establish new objectives 
circle k last month halted interest payments to bondholders 
under a plan designed to restructure its debt load the agreement 
with its senior creditors and its largest shareholder american 
financial corp gave it a sevenmonth moratorium on debt and 
interest payments 
circle k had threatened to file for reorganization under chapter 
11 of us bankruptcy laws if it was denied a reprieve on its debts 
the agreement gave bank lenders that have extended nearly 800 
million in senior debt to circle k the right to determine whether 
the company can pay interest on subordinated debt officials have 
said the restructuring could include exchanging some outstanding 
subordinated debt securities for new bonds stock or cash 
circle k is the nations secondlargest convenience store chain 
behind southland corp owner of 7eleven circle k has announced 
plans to sell 350 stores in the pacific northwest and another 25 in 
hawaii but cox said neither sale had closed 
eller a circle k director since 1972 became chairman and chief 
executive in june 1983 
the growth in the number of us stores in addition to 1400 
licensed or joint ventures overseas cost circle k 850 million 
much of it raised through risky highyield junk bonds issued by 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
in addition to rising interest payments company officials have 
blamed circle ks problems on intense competition in the industry 
including the spread of convenience stores run by oil companies 
able to sell gasoline more cheaply 
circle k in march announced a 40 million operating loss for the 
quarter ended jan 31 
analysts said eller who in late 1988 told stockholders 
expansion was the key to the companys survival failed to provide 
for stability after growth 
he built the empire but its clear there wasnt anybody 
beneath him he didnt build the infrastructure to operate it 
said dennis telzrow an analyst with the dallas brokerage eppler 
guerin amp turner 
telzrow said ellers departure was expected after circle k hired 
dearth away from united brands co in january 
sheryl gillett caudana granddaughter of circle k founder fred 
hervey also criticized ellers management 
i felt that he was making some decisions that were not in the 
interests of either the longterm survival of the company or the 
stockholders she said 
eller in 1968 founded combined communications corp and in the 
next decade built the company into one of the nations largest 
massmedia enterprises 
he sold the company in 1979 to gannett co and spent the next 
four years as director of the communications division of columbia 
pictures industries and as a financial consultant in phoenix

the european community signed accords 
tuesday with east germany and bulgaria virtually completing the 
first stage of a bid to boost trade and economic links across a 
oncedivided continent 
the ec already signed trade and economic cooperation pacts with 
the soviet union hungary and poland and on monday it finalized an 
agreement with czechoslovakia 
romania remains the only east european nation changing to 
democracy and free enterprise with which the ec has no such accord 
negotiations to replace a 1980 pact are expected to open soon 
the 10year accords with eastern europe provide for economic 
cooperation in many sectors including farming the environment and 
easing curbs on imports of east european goods 
currently trade between eastern europe and the european 
community totals 50 billion a year half of which involves the 
soviet union 
on april 28 the ec said it was ready to start a second stage of 
economic relations with eastern europe talks for association 
accords that also cover political consultations 
yet some east europeans are eager to become ec members quickly 
czechoslovakia wants to join by 1999 but the ec citing 
dramatic differences in economic development has ruled out full 
membership for the time being for any east european nation 
one exception is east germany which will join after merging 
with west germany 
the 10year eceast german accord on trade and economic 
cooperation signed on tuesday is a formality it will be changed 
once the two germanys create an economic and monetary union and 
will disappear with formal unification 
until then irish foreign minister gerard collins said this 
trade and economic cooperation agreement will help to bring the two 
parties closer together 
collins whose country holds the ecs rotating presidency 
signed the east german and bulgarian accords on behalf of the ec at 
two separate ceremonies economics minister gerhard pohl signed for 
east germany and bulgarian prime minister andrey loukanov signed 
for his country 
pohl said east germany hoped to boost exports of machine tools 
textiles chemicals and electronic products and looked forward to 
foreign investments from the ec nations 
via technology transfer we will be able to get support for our 
industries he said 
the ecbulgaria accord provides for improved market access 
for bulgarian products and commercial cooperation which is an 
important step towards bulgarian membership of the general 
agreement of tariffs and trade collins said

singer and actress madonna reportedly has signed a 
deal to do commercials for reebok shoes 
the deal with the leading athletic shoe manufacturer is for at 
least two commercials the boston herald reported in tuesday 
editions quoting a source it didnt identify 
neither reebok nor its advertising agency hill holliday 
connors cosmopulos in boston would confirm the deal 
the association with reebok and madonna is a rumor we have a 
policy that we dont comment on rumors said bernadette mansur a 
reebok vice president in charge of marketing and communications 
as a general matter we dont talk about advertising until 
such time as it is produced or aired said scott cheyne of the 
advertising agency 
the star is beginning the united states part of her blonde 
ambition world tour the dick tracy movie in which she stars with 
warren beatty is due out next month 
reebok and madonna have been involved in separate controversial 
advertisements 
madonna made a commerical for pepsi cola last year that was 
shown once and pulled because of viewers confused it with a 
separate music video the madonna released at about the same time 
that mixed sexual and religious imagery 
reebok based in stoughton mass was criticized this year for 
its commerical showing two bungee jumpers one wearing reebok 
pump shoes the other wearing a competitors athletic shoes 
the one wearing reeboks bounces back on a bungee cord but the 
other apparently doesnt make it because the cord comes back 
without the jumper

old spaghetti may sound cold and clammy but two 
restaurant chains thought it was hot enough to fight over in court 
the old spaghetti warehouse based in suburban garland has 
agreed to drop the word old from its corporate moniker and will 
pay 400000 to settle litigation brought by an older 
competitor of nearly the same name

milk and copied the use of trolleys as booths 
on monday old spaghetti warehouse announced it would scrap 
old from the signs on its stores and delete any mention of 
mytzithra cheese from its menu but the garland company which 
denies taking its competitors sauce recipe will continue to be 
able to use the special cheese 
we are pleased that the litigation is finally behind us 
robert hawke president of the 15store 28 million texas company 
said this removes a cloud over our future and will allow us to 
proceed with our franchise plans

west end in 1972 and has since opened 14 other companyowned stores 
in eight states the company went public in 1985 
the old spaghetti factory chain was established in 1970 and has

j richard munro who led publishing giant time 
inc into a combination with entertainment powerhouse warner 
communications inc said today he is stepping down as cochairman 
and cochief executive of time warner inc 
the announcement which came at the annual shareholders meeting 
of the worlds biggest media and entertainment concern came as no 
surprise 
when time and warner announced last year they planned to merge 
munro said he planned to stay on for only a short time to share the 
chairman and chief executive posts with warner boss steven j ross 
as part of his employment contract munro also had a powerful 
incentive to step down he is eligible for deferred compensation of 
nearly 43 million if he retires on or before may 31 
his departure effective wednesday automatically elevates 
nicholas j nicholas the president of time warner into the post 
of cochief executive with ross nicholas 50 is expected to 
become the sole chief executive on rosss retirement from that post 
in july 1994 
munro 59 joined the company in 1957 and became president and 
chief executive in 1980 he has been chairman and chief executive 
since sept 1 1986 sharing those posts with ross since time 
acquired a majority of warners stock last summer the buyout was 
completed earlier this year 
some time warner shareholders are unhappy that they were not 
allowed to vote on a 200 a share takeover offer from paramount 
communications inc that time spurned in favor of its 14 billion 
deal with warner 
times stock rose as high as 18275 a share during last 
summers threeway takeover fight but the stock of its successor 
company time warner closed monday at 9450 a share on the new 
york stock exchange 
munro ross and nicholas have argued that their plans to 
combine time and warner was a better deal for shareholders in the 
long run than paramounts 122 billion offer for time would have 
been 
the delaware chancery court backed them up ruling in favor of 
managements right to follow its own business judgment that a 
combination of time and warner was the better course despite what 
shareholders might have wanted 
that comes as little comfort to some shareholders and their 
advisors who note the companys stock is trading for less than half 
of what paramount offered and near its 52week low of 8750 a 
share 
why should shareholders risk their money in american companies 
when they are treated this way william steiner a time warner 
shareholder from great neck ny asked on the eve of the annual 
meeting 
institutional shareholder services inc a washington 
dcbased consulting firm that advises big shareholders 
recommended withholding votes for four former time inc directors 
up for election at todays meeting 
time management was faced here with a choice between a deal 
carefully crafted to protect its own managers and one that was not 
but offered a substantial premium to shareholders the consulting 
firm said 
the deal was completed earlier this year 
the combined company is a leader in magazines film production 
recorded music pay television services and cable tv systems 
operations 
despite a big debt load stemming from the merger time warner 
has launched a new weekly magazine entertainment weekly bought 
the west coast magazine and book concern lane publishing and 
acquired a 195 percent stake in the theme parks operator six flags 
corp it sold the textbook publisher scott foresman and co 
the company recently reported a 187 million loss in the first 
quarter compared with a loss of 217 million a year earlier the 
losses reflected the costs of the buyout of warner

president bush likely will rule out raising 
income taxes but is willing to discuss other tax increases ranging 
from a national sales tax to higher levies on alcohol and 
cigarettes republican lawmakers said today 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater however said that the 
white house would withhold comment on any specific tax including 
income taxes in an effort to get unbiased deficitcut talks 
launched 
we start these negotiations from scratch fitzwater said he 
said the type of tax increases that might emerge from a white 
housecongress budget summit were up to the negotiators 
we arent specifying whats under consideration there are no 
preconditions fitzwater said 
bush having abandoned his nonewtaxes pronouncements 
discussed taxes with congressional gop leaders after budget 
director richard darman delivered a gloomy assessment of the 
economy said participants at a white house meeting 
darman told the gop lawmakers that automatic budget cuts in the 
range of 45 billion to 55 billion and possibly even more 
could take place next fall in the absence of major additional 
deficitcutting steps according to both gop lawmakers and 
fitzwater 
republicans said that a range of possible taxes and new ways of 
ranging revenue were discussed at todays white house meeting 
valueadded taxes taxes on booze and cigarettes a national 
lottery a onecent national sales tax all sorts of things like 
that are in the mix said assistant senate republican leader alan 
k simpson of wyoming 
however he added nobodys talking about raising income tax 
rates 
at the hourlong white house session participants said darman 
told the lawmakers that an automatic budget cut in excess of 55 
billion was likely this fall in the absence of major new 
deficitcutting steps 
that could chop about 20 percent across the board in defense and 
most domestic programs 
despite the presidents earlier pledge against new taxes 
simpson said bush is fully aware that hes got a country to run 
and hes got to do that in a responsible way because lots of 
figures have changed 
simpson speaking to reporters in the driveway outside the white 
house said darman had spelled out spending cuts so massive that 
they would be totally unacceptable to the american people 
participants said bush listened as gop lawmakers discussed a 
variety of tax options but that he did not voice his own opinion 
on any particular tax 
however the president reiterated his position that there be no 
preconditions 
were going to see the economic jitters set in unless somebody 
assumes some responsibility for the budget said sen thad 
cochran rmiss the president is trying to do this and i 
applaud him for it 
house assistant republican leader newt gingrich of georgia said 
republicans would not agree to any plan that would hurt them in an 
election year 
im not going to vote for anything which causes us to lose 
politicallyand were not going to agree to stupid deals 
gingrich said 
asked what kind of taxes might be raised gingrich said i 
dont know well have to wait and see what the democrats want to 
discuss 
gop leaders have hailed bushs icebreaking overtures on the 
budget 
democratic leaders of the house and senate meantime were 
meeting with rankandfile members to gauge their feelings about 
budget bargaining in an election year 
sixteen top democrats met for an hour monday in a closeddoor 
session 
weve had different views expressed house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash said afterward 
pressure has been building for action on the budget because of 
the slowing economy and the increasing cost projections of the 
federal bailout of the savings and loan industry 
the weaker the economy the less revenue the government can 
expect to collect and the greater the federal deficit 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said erlier there would 
be no preconditions for budget negotiations republicans denied 
that such a statement is inconsistent with bushs campaign pledge 
of no new taxes 
there isnt any president who hasnt tried to make good on his 
promises theres no president who hasnt lived through times that 
change and maybe outdate some promises said rep bill frenzel 
of minnesota top republican on the house budget committee 
last week the house passed a democraticwritten spending plan 
that includes 36 billion in deficit reduction the senate budget 
committee approved another democratic plan containing 43 billion 
in savings both proposals would give the military nearly 10 
billion less next year than bush wants 
bush proposed a budget in january claiming to shrink the 
shortfall by 36 billion to just under 64 billion the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law requires that next years budget 
gap not exceed 64 billion

the white house today defended its threat to 
veto a bill guaranteeing unpaid leave for workers with family 
emergencies saying that requiring the benefits could drive up 
unemployment 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush urges 
companies to provide paid parental leaves voluntarily but he is 
unwilling to force them to do it 
fitzwater defended the adminstrations stance amid criticism 
from the measures sponsor that it is a rebuff to working families 
it would be most unfortunate if my party which so strongly 
supports family values were to turn its back on working families 
women children grandma and grandpa said rep marge roukema 
rnj 
at one point in his daily news briefing fitzwater suggested that 
workers look for other jobs if they or their unions could not 
negotiate parental leave with their employer 
he later backed off that suggestion saying the high priority 
is to make work and family complementary we urge all employers 
to find sensitive and flexible leave policies but the government 
should not dictate it 
these are the kinds of rigidity that cause companies to not be 
able to hire people and cause greater levels of unemployment 
fitzwater said 
its at the point at which it becomes mandatory that we say 
the negative risks outweigh the benefits he said 
white house chief of staff john sununu assured business leaders 
in a private meeting monday that bush would veto the family and 
medical leave bill scheduled for house action wednesday his threat 
was recounted by business lobbyists who attended the session and 
was confirmed by a sununu aide who asked not to be identified by 
name 
the bill has bipartisan support but is opposed by business 
groups it requires employers with 50 or more workers to offer 
unpaid time off with job and benefit protection for the care of 
newborn newly adopted or seriously ill children as well as to 
deal with personal health problems or ill spouses or parents 
roukema the chief republican sponsor called the veto threat 
a complete surprise she earlier had urged the white house to 
avoid veto threats or rash statements 
its a job security issue for working families roukema said 
the bills democratic sponsors denounced the veto threat and 
said the move would be at odds with bushs 1988 campaign support 
for family values 
i cant believe the kinder gentler president is going to veto 
it said rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
she said sununu took leave from his job as a professor at tufts 
university while he served as governor of new hampshire and kept 
job benefits from the university 
sununu took family leave himself and i think he has a lot of 
nerve mrs schroeder said 
mary tavenner a lobbyist for the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors said businesses opposed the measure 
because of its cost and contended that many employers already offer 
better benefits 
theres only so many things an employer can offer she said 
tavenner and christine russell lobbyist for the us chamber of 
commerce were among the business representatives invited to the 
white house meeting although there have been proposals to change 
the length of guaranteed leave they quoted sununu as saying bush 
would veto any period that was required by law 
he basically said the president would veto anything that is a 
mandated benefit tavenner said 
under the house bill employers would have to offer up to 10 
weeks of unpaid family leave over a twoyear period and up to 15 
weeks in one year for a sick worker 
an employee returning from leave must be restored to his or her 
previous job or an equivalent position and employers would have to 
continue health insurance benefits for those on leave 
federal workers would have the same guarantees with a longer 
unpaid leave 18 weeks for family leave over two years and 27 weeks 
a year for medical leave

the european communitys executive 
commission tuesday opened an antidumping inquiry into car radio 
imports from south korea after receiving a complaint from an 
industry group 
the antidumping complaint was brought by the association for 
legalauto radio measures comprised of major european 
manufacturers philips nv grundig ag and blaupunktwerke gmbh 
the group which makes more than 70 percent of ecmade car 
radios said that by forcing ec car radio prices down the south 
korean exporters had caused considerable profit cuts and job cuts 
among ec manufacturers 
according to the complaint 58 million south korean car radios 
were sold in the 12nation trade bloc in 1988 up from 17 million 
in 1985 raising south koreas market share to 32 percent from 14 
percent 
the ec manufacturers share in their own market fell during the 
same period to 33 percent from 49 percent 
if the south korean companies are found to have been dumping car 
radios on the european market at prices lower than at home the ec 
can impose retaliatory duties on their car radio exports 
in a statement the commission said a comparison between 
internal south korean prices for car radios and prices charged for 
comparable exports to the ec showed that the alleged dumping 
margins are important 
the south korean concerns named in the complaint are sinbang

fewer dollars may be involved but prosecutors 
say the trial of three futures traders concerns offenses no less 
serious than those committed by wall street felons ivan boesky and 
michael milken 
cheating is cheating said us attorney ira raphaelson 
jury selection began today in the us district court trial of 
robert d mosky danny l scheck and david zatz three traders of 
swiss franc futures on the chicago mercantile exchange they are 
accused of swindling customers 
they represent one of four groups of chicago futures traders 
47 in all who were indicted last year after an unprecedented 
sting fbi agents posing as corrupt traders secretly tape recorded 
conversations that the government contends reveal organized fraud 
among traders at the merc and the rival chicago board of trade the 
worlds two largest futures exchanges 
us district judge ann c williams decided monday and today to 
allow defense lawyers to introduce evidence of their clients 
lawful behavior to show that the difference between legal and 
illegal trading is unclear 
also stung by the investigation was a clerk who has pleaded 
guilty along with 15 of the traders to reduced charges in 
exchange for cooperation with prosecutors none has been sentenced 
prosecutors have not revealed how much money they believe was 
stolen by traders saying only that the alleged schemes involved 
hundreds of investors and thousands of trades 
the scandal dealt a black eye to the reputation of the futures 
markets which already were perceived as freewheeling in much the 
same way the insider trading cases of the 1980s tarnished the image 
of the stock market 
the chicago exchanges and their federal regulators responded 
with tougher antifraud measures and congress is considering 
proposals to strengthen the integrity of the markets 
new york commodities lawyer thomas russo said the scandal 
probably involves less money and public harm than the wall street 
insider trading cases in which boesky and milken paid fines and 
restitution totaling 700 million to settle criminal charges 
but russo said i think the amount of money is not the 
material issue in these cases it goes beyond dollars to the 
integrity of the markets 
mosky scheck and zatz are charged with multiple counts of mail 
or wire fraud and violations of the federal commodity exchange act 
each count carries up to five years in prison 
mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy for which he 
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit 
personal assets including exchange membership 
in court documents the government has portrayed mosky as a 
ringleader who persuaded scheck and zatz to accept the 
responsibility and costs of trading errors he made while executing 
customer orders in the swiss franc trading pit 
the government contends mosky later repaid scheck and zatz by 
manipulating customer orders sometimes via trades conducted 
illegally outside the pit 
the governments evidence includes the fbi tapes mountains of 
trading records and the expected testimony of two other swiss franc 
traders each of whom pleaded guilty in august

teamsters general president william mccarthy 
has warned congress that the 18 millionmember union will not 
contribute to any political candidates who do not support a bill 
that protects strikers jobs 
union officials attending a convention of about 800 union 
members that began monday voiced praise for the bill sponsored by 
us rep william clay 
mccarthy said the bill was critical to the survival of the labor 
movement 
the bill would bar companies from permanently replacing striking 
workers with new employees clay dst louis is one of labors 
strongest allies in washington 
in a statement recalling clays criticism of former president 
ronald reagans firing of striking airtraffic controllers in the 
early 1980s clay said his bill would stop this insanity and 
save the labor movement from annihilation 
rep richard gephardt dst louis told the teamsters that such 
a law was needed because most us companies had adopted an 
attitude that greed is good 
the majority feel that the way to compete is to beat it out of 
your workers break them if you can gephardt said 
daniel ligurotis chairman of the central conference of 
teamsters said the right to strike was being abridged by the 
hiring of replacement workers 
this repulsive practice which in the past was done only by 
the most vicious employers is now the rule rather than the 
exception he said 
the teamsters union contains five conferences central south 
east west and canadian the central is the largest with 491000 
members in 13 midwestern states including missouri and illinois 
missouri has 50000 teamsters 
the central conference meets every four years this years 
convention is being held at the st louis sheraton hotel and runs 
through friday

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade as traders sold to take 
profits despite reports the soviet union was in the market for a 
major wheat purchase 
at the opening wheat prices gained support from reports the 
soviets were buying 550000 metric tons of wheat under the export 
bonus program 
but technical selling set in with the lack of followthrough 
buying by traders 
corn was performing well through most of the day as the market 
reacted to mondays announcement that the soviets purchased 175 
million metric tons of corn 
william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc said many 
traders have concluded there will be no further purchases by the 
soviets 
soybean prices drifted lower due to low buyer interest at 
current prices biedermann said 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 378 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
lower to a cent higher with may at 288 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 2 cents lower with may at 165 a bushel soybeans were 
4 cents lower to 1 cent higher with may at 634 a bushel

texaco inc said tuesday that bad weather in 
the gulf of mexico prevented divers from investigating and 
repairing a broken pipeline that has leaked about 37000 gallons of 
oil 
texaco spokesman max hebert said the leak in the 20inch 
pipeline apparently had stopped and oil was breaking up in rough 
seas the largest slick is about a mile long and 400 yards wide 
though still far from shore he said 
the leak from the texacooperated eugene island pipeline 
occurred about 100 miles off the louisiana coast 
winds of 25 miles per hour and fourfoot to sixfoot seas 
prevented texacos three skimmers from removing any oil from the 
water more bad weather was forecast for thursday 
the 112milelong pipeline which serves 36 drilling platforms 
is operated by texaco and owned by texaco marathon oil co exxon 
corp mobil corp chevron corp and conoco inc 
the system in which oil from offshore wells is piped to shore 
was shut down early monday the pipeline normally handles about 
95000 barrels a day 
texaco chairman alfred decrane mentioned the spill at the 
companys annual meeting tuesday and said texaco was committed to 
the environment and had has practiced ways to deal with spills 
separately texaco president and chief executive james kinnear 
said the company plans to invest in new technology to increase 
reserves from existing fields by 14000 barrels a day in 1990 and 
1991

billion in notes and bonds sold over three days at the first 
segment of the auction held today the government sold 105 
billion worth of threeyear notes at an average yield of 874 
percent 
the note sale whose results were released minutes before the

unemployment report for april which showed lower job growth than 
expected the report makes it less likely the federal reserve would 
act to raise rates as an inflationfighting move

supermarkets will have to offer more lowfat 
products environmentally conscious policies and onestop shopping 
conveniences like banking to compete in the 1990s industry leaders 
said tuesday 
the mom and pop grocery may be taking a step into the past 
at the food marketing institutes trade show which covers more 
than 1 million square feet of space and involves more than 1000 
companies chiefly food retailers 
topics of discussion include newage trends such as 
micromarketing to target individual tastes of shoppers and 
hiring more minorities to help erase an image of a whitemale 
dominated business 
the supermarket truly is the microcosm of the lifestyle of 
america and must reflect the changes in lifestyle to survive 
said timothy hammonds senior vice president of the food marketing 
institute 
the washingtonbased group whose 1600 members operate about 
19000 retail food stores nationwide said a survey of 1005 
shoppers found that fat content beat cholesterol and salt as the 
biggest nutrition concern for consumers 
the nationwide survey based on telephone interviews was 
conducted in january and released tuesday the third day of the 
fourday meeting 
two years ago cholesterol was the biggest concern hammonds said 
shoppers surveyed this year said they are buying more fruits and 
vegetables more chicken and fish and less meat and fatty 
products store managers are responding to these changes by 
stocking their shelves accordingly hammonds said 
an increasing number of supermarkets are addressing the nations 
solidwaste crisis by recycling said patrick collins president of 
ralphs grocery co a supermarket chain based in the los angeles 
area 
collins said 87 percent of wholesalers and retailers pick up 
recyclable waste products from their stores for consolidation at 
distribution centers 
another trend is onestop shopping which has turned the 
neighborhood grocery store into a selfcontained minimall offering 
services ranging from instore restaurants to banking 
all supermarkets will be doing that to meet the needs and 
time pressures of twoincome families hammonds said 
it doesnt mean the small store or convenience store is going 
to go away but theyll have to specialize to stay afloat he 
said 
as more women and minorities enter the work force supermarkets 
must make an effort to hire them and not just for entrylevel 
positions said henry hailstock manager of minority affairs for 
giant food inc a washingtonbased supermarket chain 
giant has worked with local college placement directors to 
recruit minority students and has established internships designed 
to provide onthejob training for minorities 
the effort is aimed in part at promoting the retail industry as 
a career and not just as a parttime job hailstock said

the massachusetts institute of 
technology which took credit last year for the explosive growth of 
the new england economy in the 1980s now can point to a new study 
that says its graduates have built up silicon valley too 
but the reports author and officials at other schools caution 
against reading too much into the work 
mit alumni have started some 176 companies in northern 
california accounting for about 22 billion in sales and more than 
90000 jobs according to a report conducted by chase manhattan 
bank for the research university 
about 90 of the companies are in silicon valley the region 
south of san francisco named for its concentration of hightech 
businesses 
it shows theres been a remarkable concentration of mit alumni 
who have contributed to the formation and growth of silicon 
valley said john larson an mit fundraiser 
but the reports author said the findings did not necessarily 
point to a singleschool domination of the region 
if you added up for all the schools in the nation the list 
of the companies they considered to be related to the school the 
sum of all those on the list would exceed the population of 
companies in this country by a wide margin said richard 
aspinwall the chase manhattan vice president and economist who 
conducted the study 
also many companies have several founders not all of whom went 
to the same school and many founders may have been educated at 
more than one institution for example a company might have been 
founded by three people who are graduates of mit harvard and 
stanford aspinwall said 
officials at other schools also discouraged drawing too many 
conclusions from the study 
we have an awful lot of graduates too that are walking around 
silicon valley said a professor of electrical engineering and 
computer science at the university of california at berkeley 
its very difficult to get in to mit students have to be very 
bright and ambitious but exactly the same is true for stanford 
exactly the same is true for us said the professor who declined 
to be identified 
the tie in silicon valley to stanford is much stronger than 
to mit said karen bartholomew a stanford spokeswoman 
jim aisner a spokesman for harvard business school echoed 
im sure a lot of harvard business grads have founded lots of 
firms a good number of our grads go on to be entrepreneurs 
still he said there are an awful lot of good schools this 
makes perfect sense that a lot of those firms were founded by mit 
graduates 
the chase report is not the first such study for mit last year 
the bank of boston did a study of the companies begun by mit 
graduates in the massachusetts area 
that report released in june said 636 businesses started by 
mit graduates in massachusetts accounted for more than 300000 jobs 
in the state and about 10 billion in annual income for state 
residents 
although the massachusetts economy has hit hard times and 
growth in california has slowed as well mit can point to its 
graduates as a driving force in silicon valley aspinwall said 
the companies started by mit graduates in silicon valley have 
been sources of strength aspinwall said the companies have 
grown more rapidly than their industry as a whole and theyve 
grown more rapidly than companies in silicon valley as a whole 
abe lederman who graduated from mit in 1981 with a masters 
degree in computer science was one of five mit alumni who founded 
verity inc a computer software manufacturer based in mountain 
view calif 
mit prepared you to work really hard and taught the 
entrepreneurial ethic and stuff at mit people are pretty smart and 
all that said lederman 32 what helps being at mit is having 
all these really bright people that work really hard

surprisingly good sale of new us debt securities at a quarterly 
treasury refunding auction in washington

treasury auction discouraged dollar buying because it suggested 
us interest rates wont rise significantly some traders said 
that could make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors 
relative to other key currencies 
despite the treasury auctions immediate effect zlatko 
glamuzina chief dealer at the new york branch of banco di sicilia 
suggestedthe longterm trend for dollars would remain strong 
but scott greene chief dealer for the new york branch of 
switzerlands banco julius baer amp co suggested that the currency 
of choice increasingly looked like the west german mark reflecting 
the optimism about the economic dynamism expected from a reunited 
germany 
the vulnerable side is the down side for the dollar greene 
said all we need is a slight push there 
others expressed reluctance to trade dollars preferring to 
await the final outcome of the treasury auction which goes through 
thursday as well as any economic insight derived from statistics 
on april us retail sales and inflation due to be released friday

coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange as rain forecasts improved crop 
prospects in africa and south america 
on other markets frozen orange juice futures surged livestock 
and pork futures declined grain and soybean prices retreated 
energy futures were mixed and precious metals declined 
cocoa futures settled 55 to 68 lower with the contract for 
delivery in may at 1215 a ton 
judith ganes an analyst with merril lynch amp co in new york 
said cocoa prices in recent weeks had been supported by reports of 
dry weather in west africa and brazil 
weather forecasts call for the end of the dry pattern and the 
start of a rainy period 
contributing to the drop in cocoa prices was the triggering of 
sell stops as futures broke through the 1250aton support level 
frozen orange juice prices surged on new yorks cotton exchange 
as the market reacted to continued tight supplies 
the us department of agriculture crop report due out thursday 
is expected to increase the orange juice crop estimate ganes said

million boxes but the increase will not make much difference in 
the supply and demand balance 
frozen orange juice was 25 cents to 46 cents higher with may 
at 1968 a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the chicago board 
of trade as traders sold to take profits despite reports the soviet 
union was in the market for a major wheat purchase 
at the opening wheat prices gained support from reports the 
soviets bid for 550000 metric tons of wheat under the export bonus 
program 
but technical selling set in with the lack of followthrough 
buying by traders 
corn was performing well through most of the day as the market 
reacted to mondays announcement that the soviets purchased 175 
million metric tons of corn but sold off towards the end of 
trading 
william biedermann an analyst with allendale inc said many 
traders concluded there will be no further purchases by the 
soviets but after the close of trading the usda announced it has 
raised the amount of grain the soviets can purchase in 19891990 to 
22 million metric tons from 20 million metric tons 
soybean prices drifted lower due to low buyer interest at 
current prices biedermann said 
wheat was 3 cents to 6 cents lower with may at 378 a bushel 
corn was unchanged to 1 cents lower with may at 289 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 166 a bushel 
soybeans were 4 cents lower to a cent higher with may at 633 
a bushel 
precious metals prices declined on new yorks commodity exchange 
as the soviets and other countries sold gold and other metals to 
finance their grain purchases said richard levine an analyst with 
elders futures inc in new york 
gold was 190 to 2 lower with may at 370 a troy ounce silver 
was 27 cents to 3 cents lwoer with may at 4989 a troy ounce

calif refinery and a leak in a texaco pipeline in the gulf of 
mexico 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 25 cent lower to 3 cents 
higher with june at 1828 a barrel heating oil was 32 cent lower

mexico is considering a cut in oil exports in 
order to take care of domestic industrial needs the government 
said in a fiveyear energy plan 
the cut in exports would be to 1 million barrels a day from a 
current 123 million barrels almost all of the exported oil would 
go to the united states japan and spain the plan by the secretary 
of energy mines and industry said 
the report said production levels likely will remain at the 
current level of about 25 million barrels a day through 1994 
the static production along with domestic needs for refined 
petroleum and the existing refining capacity means the volume of 
crude destined for export necessarily will see a gradual drop 
the report said 
the plan released last week calls for a more efficient use of 
energy and increased energy prices within mexico it said mexico 
would save its resources and put money it might have spent on the 
oil infrastructure into other areas 
mexico said oil prices were not expected to increase 
significantly soon and likely would not reach record levels set in 
198081 before the end of the century 
mexico which is not a member of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries gets 33 percent of its export 
revenue from oil and lists itself as sixth in the world in oil 
production

companys june 5 annual meeting shows that 17 current or former 
columbia executives received a total 95 million in compensation 
last year including the bonuses 
the statement also shows that government regulators were so 
unhappy with the extraordinarily high pay of former columbia chief 
thomas spiegel that they forced him to return or forgo at least 
11 million in compensation 
columbia said friday it lost 2933 million during its first 
quarter due to continued losses on its 3 billion portfolio of junk 
bonds the biggest collection of the highyield highrisk 
securities assembled by any sampl 
spiegel who stepped down as chairman and chief executive at the 
end of last year is trying to find a buyer for the bonds spiegel 
was a close associate of convicted drexel burnham lambert financier 
michael milken whose network of junk bond buyers included many 
thrifts 
spiegel a former wall street bond trader whose father founded 
columbia once was the highest paid thrift executive earning 9 
million in cash and bonuses in 1985 he earned 898922 in salary 
and other compensation last year 
in november 1989 under pressure from federal regulators he 
repaid 600000 he received as part of a 41 million pay package 
in 1988 the proxy showed 
the proxy also reveals that spiegel was to have received 
500000 per year in return for his efforts to sell the junk bond 
portfolio which were announced when he stepped down at the end of 
1989 
due to objections from the office of thrift supervision 
however that amount was reduced to a nominal 1 per year the 
proxy shows spiegel continues to receive a benefits package and an 
administrative budget of 17400 per month to cover an office an 
assistant a secretary and other costs 
columbia once one of the nations strongest thrifts now has a 
negative net worth of 2156 million and is in danger of being 
seized by federal regulators 
it is 3383 million short of the capital it is required to 
maintain under the standards adopted last year when the government 
bailed out the federal insurance fund for thrifts 
besides spiegel many of the other executives who received large 
1989 bonuses have since left the company 
the largest amount went to christopher s moore an executive 
vice president in corporate finance who received 135 million in 
1989 including a 115 million bonus he resigned two months ago 
lawrence k fish who resigned as president in august received 
132 million in compensation last year including a 820000 
payment when he left 
edward g harshfield hired to replace spiegel is guaranteed a 
500000 yearly salary but has performancelinked bonus provisions 
in his contract that could bring his total pay to as much as 3 
million 
harshfield also is permitted to continue as a general partner of 
a merrill lynchsponsored investment fund he had headed before 
joining columbia in march the fund was established to bail out 
struggling savings and loans it had hoped to raise 100 million 
but managed to find investors willing to put up only about 30 
million

the son of a washington real estate magnate 
was accused tuesday of illegally passing confidential information 
about one of his fathers deals to a friend who allegedly traded on 
the inside information 
in a civil complaint filed at federal court in chicago the 
securities and exchange commission accused b francis saul iii of 
violating the insider trading act of 1984 the sec also charged 
sauls friend peter david garvy 
both men are 28 and chicago residents 
in 1988 the sec alleged saul son of b francis saul ii of 
chevy chase md told garvy a former school roomate about a 
proposed tender offer one his fathers companies westminster 
investing corp had made for another saul concern the bf saul 
real estate investment trust 
according to the complaint garvy bought 5500 shares in the

70 of hinsdale ill and a friend betsy perk 29 of chicago 
about the pending deal and they purchased shares in the saul trust 
the complaint does not accuse the elder saul garvys father or 
ms perk of any wrongdoing 
this kid is totally innocent hes taken a lie detector test 
and passed it 100 percent said sauls attorney george rogers 
we intend to fight it immediately as soon as we can get to trial 
and we expect to win

merger information from a client whose family owned the company in 
question 
sometimes people have to be told twice no ones ever accused 
the government of being smart said robert stephenson garvys 
attorney in chicago adding that his client also denied the charges 
and would seek a quick trial 
the sec charged that garvy his father and ms perk made a total 
of 61000 in profits using the information supplied by the younger

not accused of trading for himself a total of three times the 
total illegal profits or 183000 in penalties

the bush administration said tuesday it will 
introduce legislation this week stripping the commodity futures 
trading commission of control over stockindex futures 
the announcement marks a victory for the securities and exchange 
commission which regulates the nations stock markets in a turf 
battle with the rival cftc which oversees us futures markets 
treasury undersecretary robert glauber told a senate panel the 
administration wants the sec to have authority over all 
stockrelated financial products including stockindex futures and 
stockindex options 
the committee chairman sen patrick j leahy dvt after 
complaining that the proposal would further delay futures market 
reform legislation said he would ask senate leaders to bring it to 
the floor for action 
in chicago thomas r donovan chairman of the chicago board of 
trade complained that the proposal would solve a perceived 
problem only to create a very real one by placing futures markets 
under two regulators 
such a transfer of authority is clearly just the first step of 
creeping regulatory imperialism he added in a lengthy statement 
released by the cbot 
glauber said the administration believes that one market 
regulator should control all aspects of the financial community 
but that creating a new agency or merging the sec and cftc could 
take too much time 
instead the administration supports a less sweeping approach 
that would only unify regulation of the one market of stocks 
stock options and stockindex futures under the sec he said 
glauber described the sec as the agency with the greatest 
expertise in the combination of these products 
while the cftc and sec are doing a good job under difficult 
circumstances glauber said the answer to the jurisdictional 
dispute was to simplify regulatory fragmentation 
the administration plan also calls for giving the sec control of 
setting margins the down payment investors must make when buying 
stocks or futures contracts on credit 
glauber announced the administration plan in testimony before 
the senate agriculture committee which oversees the cftc 
the dispute centers on which agency should oversee financial 
products that have elements of both a security and a futures 
contract these socalled hybrid products include stockindex 
futures 
leahy complained the dispute has held up passage of a bill that 
adds several market reform measures to the cftcs reauthorization 
congress remains blocked from enacting the tough reforms we 
all agreed are needed he said leahy also said the committee 
should consider responsible appropriate solutions possibly 
even the ultimate merger of the sec and cftc if this is shown to be 
justified and feasible 
john damgard president of the futures industry association who 
sat in on the hearing said therell be no jurisdictional change 
this year but it sure mucks up the reauthorization scene which i 
think everybody will agree is unfortunate 
the senate hearing began as the first trial stemming from a 
massive fraud investigation into the chicago futures exchanges got 
under way with jury selection tuesday 
last year 47 traders and one clerk were indicted on various 
fraud charges following an fbi undercover probe at the chicago 
mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade the worlds two 
largest futures exchanges 
in the wake of that scandal the cftc was criticized roundly by 
several members of the senate agriculture committee last fall for 
being too lax a watchdog 
the committee was scheduled to hear from representatives of the 
four agencies of the white house working group on financial 
markets which was set up in the wake of the 1987 stock market 
crash to handle intermarket issues 
in addition to the treasurys glauber other witnesses 
testifying were federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan sec 
chairman richard breeden and cftc chairman wendy gramm 
the four already have aired their views before congressional 
panels and in numerous speeches and interviews breeden and glauber 
are on one side gramm on the other with greenspan somewhere in 
between 
breeden and glauber have said the sec should be given control of 
stockindex futures which now are controlled by the futures 
exchanges with cftc oversight the products allow investors to 
speculate on the stock market without buying the underlying stocks 
gramm has said the attempt to grab cftc authority over 
stockindex futures is driven by jealousy on wall street and 
regulatory imperialism at the sec 
previously greenspan has said he is slightly in favor of 
giving the sec control of stock index futures but he is against 
merging the sec and cftc which was proposed in legislation 
introduced in the house last month

a jury on tuesday said the dallas times herald 
was not harmed unfairly by the loss of 26 comics and features last 
fall to its larger rival the dallas morning news 
the jury voted 102 in declining to award damages to the times 
herald which contended that the morning news and its parent ah 
belo corp violated antitrust laws by taking over the features in 
a move to drive the times herald out of business 
the times herald had asked for 33 million in actual damages and 
what its attorneys termed significant punitive damages the 33 
million under texas antitrust and conspiracy laws would have been 
tripled if the times herald lawsuit had been successful 
we feel strongly we have been vindicated said robert 
decherd belo chairman the law and the facts of this case have 
been with us all along we never doubted the outcome if you apply 
the law to this case there was no case 
times herald publisher john buzzetta said im disappointed 
then hurriedly left the courtroom with his attorneys 
well keep on fighting said times herald attorney wayne 
fisher 
the times herald released a statement later saying we 
disagree that the conduct of our competitor was legal or proper in 
any way in fact it was wrong in many ways wrong morally wrong 
ethically wrong for the profession of journalism and wrong for 
dallas and its people 
the lawsuit challenged a belo joint venture with universal press 
syndicate that stripped the times herald of features including 
doonesbury dear abby the far side and erma bombeck 
jurors deliberated five days before reaching the verdict tuesday 
afternoon the jurors were asked did ah belo corp or the 
dallas morning news co willfully attempt to achieve monopoly power 
in a relevant market or markets 
jurors earlier asked about the definition of willfully and 
whether the relevant market in the case was the newspapers or the 
features 
state district judge david west accepted a response proposed by 
belo and morning news attorneys and over the objections of times 
herald lawyers 
the times herald had contended the features transfer violated 
antitrust laws was intended to strengthen belo and morning news 
market dominance in dallas and drive the times herald out of 
business 
the suit also alleged that morning news and belo officials 
conspired to get the features and interfered in the times heralds 
contract with kansas citybased universal press syndicate 
belo and the morning news defended the deal as a good business 
decision it will use syndicate comics characters in television 
programs and commercials to encourage newspper readership 
a syndicate requirement of the venture mandated that all 
universal press features in the times herald be moved to the 
morning news 
the times herald said the fiveyear deal and the morning news 
right of first refusal for any new syndicate features amounted to a 
restraint of trade 
the times herald estimated the features loss cost it a permanent 
circulation drop of 10800 which their experts calculated was 
worth the 33 million 
morning news attorneys repeatedly referred to circulation 
figures that showed the times herald is in better shape now than it 
was before the features were moved 
times herald officials however testified that in order to stop 
the circulation slide they began a 1 million reader lottery 
promotion to boost circulation times herald witnesses termed the 
lottery a shortterm and temporary solution 
the morning news daily circulation was an estimated 355000 and 
the times heralds 225000 according to the 1989 editor amp 
publisher yearbook

international monetary fund officials approved 
a record 60 billion increase in resources tuesday to meet growing 
demands for assistance from emerging democracies in eastern europe 
and debtstrapped nations in latin america 
the authorization from the imfs policysetting interim 
committee came after the panel adopted a usbacked proposal to 
crack down on countries that are delinquent in repaying their imf 
loans 
the 50 percent increase which still must be approved by the 
voting membership of the 152nation fund would boost imf lending 
resources to 180 billion 
third world countries had fought to double imf resources 
contending 240 billion is needed to ensure that economic 
assistance to eastern europe does not crowd out support for latin 
america and africa 
btg chidzero finance minister for zimbabwe said greater 
support from the imf and its sister lending organization the world 
bank was critical to avert falling into a crisis of 
international development finance in the present decade 
on another matter the finance officials stopped short of 
endorsing a proposal to create an environmental fund in the world 
bank to supply 13 billion in lowinterest loans over three years 
the money would be used to address crossborder environmental 
problems such as global warming the growth of deserts river 
system pollution and destruction of the ozone layer 
france is backing the new fund but the united states and 
several other countries are opposed 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady in remarks prepared for 
tuesdays closeddoor sessions of the development committee called 
the environmental issue of great importance to the united 
states but he said approval of the new fund should be delayed 
until questions concerning current world bank environmental 
programs were addressed 
in a statement the development committee said that it had 
agreed that further work was necessary on the proposal and that 
in the meantime the world bank should take steps to reinforce its 
existing environmental programs 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy had pleaded with other 
countries to approve the program now and warned time is 
passing 
bargaining over the increase in imf resources at times became 
intense according to participants in the meetings arguing for the 
us position brady noted the administration must win suport for 
the proposal from a democraticcontrolled congress 
canadian finance minister michael wilson head of the interim 
committee said that to get the final agreement each country had 
to put a little water in its wine and accept compromises 
the united states which had wanted to delay the next round of 
funding negotiations until 1995 agreed to a 1993 date in return 
the united states achieved a key demand for tougher procedures for 
poor countries that owe 4 billion in back payments to the imf 
delinquent countries who adopt economic reforms would be 
eligible for money from a special imf fund however nations behind 
in their payments could lose their voting rights also the agency 
could sell gold roughly equivalent to the members original 
contributions to meet the obligations of defaulting debtors 
the 11 nations behind in their payments are the sudan zambia 
peru costa rica honduras guyana somalia sierra leone 
cambodia vietnam and panama 
the imf increase was also tied up with a diplomatic question of 
the rankings of the biggest economic powers in the fund the 
rankings govern how much voting power the nations have 
americas no 1 ranking and voting strength was left unchanged 
at 19 percent however japan vaulted from no 5 to no 2 tied 
with west germany britain previously ranked no 2 dropped into a 
tie for fourth place with france 
on another matter polish finance minister leszek balcerowicz 
told reporters he had held discussions during the twoday meetings 
on polands efforts to reduce its 41 billion foreign debt 
balcerowicz reported progress in negotiations with commercial 
banks using debtreduction guidelines called for by brady but he 
indicated less success in the effort to cut polands debt owed to 
other governments 
reducing the debt burden is critical for poland to keep 
political support for its crash program to replace four decades of 
communism with a freemarket economy he said
