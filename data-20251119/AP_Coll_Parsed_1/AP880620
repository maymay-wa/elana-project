portauprince haiti ap lt gen henri namphy formed a 
military government monday with himself in charge after deposing 
the 4monthold civilian administration of president leslie manigat 
the 55yearold career soldier named a 12member cabinet that 
included only one civilian and said he would rule by decree as the 
new president 
the army will lead the country this way namphy declared on 
national television shortly after the coup waving an uzi 
submachine gun and flanked by soldiers 
manigat who was seized sunday evening at his hillside villa 
outside portauprince arrived in neighboring dominican republic 
on monday with his family said military sources in santo domingo 
in a statement issued through a spokesman of the hotel where 
manigat and his family were staying the 57yearold ousted 
president said he was not injured in the coup 
the administration of president joaquin balaguer gave no 
official statement but foreign ministry sources said manigat was a 
guest of the dominican government and might travel tuesday 
afternoon to venezuela where he had been offered political asylum 
except for a few random shots heard portauprince was quiet 
monday night there were no reports of unrest in the provinces men 
and women strolled past the national palace and children played 
soccer at a closed gasoline station two blocks away 
in a short live broadcast on staterun television from the 
national palace namphy said manigat betrayed your confidence and 
violated the constitution he swore to uphold 
the future of democracy was at stake said the general who 
was accompanied by elements of every unit in haitis 7000member 
armed forces the army must protect the superior interests of the 
country and must head the country to this end a military 
government has been formed 
namphy who spoke in french for about five minutes pledged to 
guarantee that all the conquests of feb 7 when his threeman 
junta turned over the government to manigat will be respected to 
our powerful friends and to international organizations i 
guarantee the respect of all commitments 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in washington 
the united states government strongly condemns this serious blow 
to hopes for democracy in that troubled land 
namphys action halted at least for now the slow journey 
toward democracy begun after president jeanclaude duvalier fled 
the country feb 7 1986 ending the 29year dictatorship founded 
by his father francois papa doc duvalier 
the general who was jeanclaude duvaliers chief of staff led 
the junta that ruled haiti until manigat won a presidential 
election this year with the armys help 
haiti a nation of 6 million people and the poorest country in 
the western hemisphere shares the caribbean island of hispaniola 
with the dominican republic 
manigat began his disastrous confrontation with the army the 
traditional base of power since independence in 1804 by removing 
namphy as commander on friday manigat also reassigned two dozen 
other officers sunday many of them namphys allies 
he accused namphy of insubordination for ordering the transfers 
of several officers without presidential permission including 
manigats main military ally lt col jeanclaude paul the 
barracks of pauls command the 700man dessalines battalion is 
directly behind the national palace 
paul who has been indicted by a us federal court on charges 
of drug trafficking was in the group standing around namphy during 
the television appearance monday but whether he had allied himself 
with the general was unclear 
the military announced a new cabinet dissolution of the 
national assembly and namphys intention to rule by decree 
col gary leon general secretary of the armed forces read the 
names of the cabinet members on television gen williams regala 
who was defense minister under manigat and signed the order 
retiring namphy will be minister of defense and interior 
no public opposition greeted namphy on his first day back in the 
palace there were no rallies for manigat whose political 
headquarters was ransacked 
the international airport in portauprince was closed along 
with most schools and businesses in the capital car and pedestrian 
traffic was curtailed overseas telephone lines were closed down 
and an employee at the government telephone company teleco said 
namphy ordered it 
few soldiers were in the streets and there were no military 
checkpoints 
namphy had been under house arrest but was freed sunday night 
apparently with aid of the presidential guard and the leopards 
counterinsurgency unit using three tanks 
shooting began in front of the palace at about 730 pm sunday 
as the presidential guard and leopards battled pauls dessalines 
battalion at 130 am monday namphy announced the coup on 
television in a broadcast from the palace 
there were no official reports on casualties but haitian 
journalists said some soldiers loyal to manigat were killed us 
embassy spokesman jeffrey lite said no americans were injured

shallow water halted barge traffic on the droughtpinched 
mississippi river again monday and officials in ohio and nebraska 
set up hay hot lines to organize shipments of food to hungry 
cattle in the midwest 
commodities prices rose and democratic presidential candidate 
jesse jackson called for a moratorium on farm foreclosures as dry 
weather continued 
showers and thunderstorms teased farmers in some 
droughtstricken areas but gave little relief and temperatures on 
the plains reached for 100 degrees 
this hot dry pattern is going to continue probably for the 
rest of the month said richard may a meteorologist for the 
national weather service in bismarck nd there will be spotty 
precipitation here and there 
hay hot lines set up to help organize hay shipments from the 
midwest to help farmers in the south during a dry spell two years 
ago are being restarted but this time to move hay into the midwest 
sen david pryor listened to stories of drought from dairy 
soybean and rice farmers monday in his home state of arkansas and 
said he could offer them little comfort except assurances that 
this is a very very high priority issue 
one soybean farmer in southwestern arkansas said the ground was 
so dry it was like planting in powder said pryor a member of 
the senate agriculture committee and of a 16member congressional 
task force formed to deal with the drought other members toured 
the dakotas and montana over the weekend 
looks like youre growing talcum powder pryor told one 
farmer after scooping up a handful of soil 
jesse jackson said monday that debtridden farmers hit hard by 
the drought could fall victim to land speculators 
what we must do is declare a moratorium on foreclosures 
jackson said during a visit to the southeastern minnesota farm of 
dale and nancy snesrud there is nothing we can do about an act 
of god but we must stop an act of the devil 
agriculture secretary re lyng said monday in new orleans that 
the worst threat to the agricultural economy exists in the corn 
belt the midwestern region where corn and cornfed livestock are 
raised but problems also loom for southern soybean growers 
corn is the most important crop in the united states soybeans 
is second lyng said after a speech to the institute of food 
technologists convention if those are lost who can say what it 
will mean its never happened before 
meantime commodities prices were pressured still higher by the 
drought grain and soybean futures prices jumped sharply higher 
monday on the chicago board of trade wheat futures were influenced 
less by the drought than were corn oats and soybeans because the 
winter wheat crop which accounts for 75 percent of us 
production is nearly finished growing and is being harvested 
despite the soaring prices many farmers were hanging on to 
their grain 
every day without rain could translate into more profit for some 
farmers choosing to sit tight 
yet they are caught in a dilemma should they sell now and hope 
for a bountiful harvest that will replenish storage or should they 
hang on to what they have and risk losing money once it rains and 
prices plummet 
i think theres quite a few farmers just waiting for prices to 
go higher my fatherinlaw told me over the weekend that he sold 
his beans a month ago and look what he could have gotten now 
said susan anderson a spokeswoman for the iowa farm bureau 
nebraska farmers arent as affected by the drought as some other 
plains states and many of its farmers use irrigation 
calls for nebraska hay have come from farmers in wisconsin 
missouri kansas and iowa said lane kugler vice president of the 
nebraska alfalfa marketing association he said the association was 
setting up a hot line 
another hay hot line was announced monday by state officials in 
ohio where farmers are scrambling for feed from as far west as 
kansas 
we did this two years ago with the haylift to the south so 
were not new at this said alice walters spokeswoman for the 
ohio agriculture department 
in indiana purdue university will begin providing a tollfree 
drought hot line and hay directory too 
the mississippi river was blocked last week by shallow water and 
sandbars near greenville miss and as many as 1800 barges were 
tied up and waiting by the time dredges completed a new 
9footdeep 300footwide channel saturday 
but on monday shallow water near gunnison miss halted 
shipping again monday and the army corps of engineers said it could 
take as long as three days to dredge a deeper channel there 
a tow went aground about 20 river miles above rosedale early 
monday and fouled the river bottom said michael logue a 
spokesman for the corps at vicksburg nothings getting through 
there at this point 
and coast guard cmdr michael donohoe said a low section of the 
river six miles north of memphis tenn would be closed for 
dredging and could stay closed for two days or more 
the mississippi is more than 20 feet lower than this time last 
year and 40 to 50 feet below its springtime level donohoe said 
the section to be dredged was only 9 feet deep for about 1000 feet 
and its width was down from 500 feet to about 170 feet he said 
but traffic was flowing smoothly monday through the ohio river 
near mound city ill where a sevenmile stretch was shut down 
last week by shallow water said ron blake of the coast guard in 
paducah ky 
the ohio reopened saturday after a 2100foot channel was 
dredged 11 feet deep by 250 feet wide blake said the guard limited 
tows to 10 barges each 
corps officials said that without rain on the parched plains and 
midwest the mississippi will continue to fall 
and on the ohio we are still in a critical situation that 
without any relief by rain we have to monitor extremely closely 
for any hot spots said chuck shumann of the corps of engineers 
in louisville ky 
environmental officials in iowa ordered big irrigators to reduce 
drawing water from sections of four rivers and sections of several 
others could be added if heavy rain doesnt fall in the next week 
to 10 days said allan stokes of the department of natural 
resources 
iowa officials also are concerned about the decreased ability of 
shrunken rivers to carry and dilute pollutants stokes said but 
were not at any major crisis stage at this point

top defense department officials met monday to 
discuss whether to suspend deputies to the navy and air force 
secretaries and three other pentagon officials implicated in a 
defense contracting investigation officials said 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said a highlevel 
meeting was held monday afternoon to discuss whether the pentagon 
employees should be suspended or moved to other jobs the sources 
declined to say whether defense secretary frank c carlucci sat in 
on the meeting but said a final decision was expected after 
another meeting tuesday morning 
they should have something to announce tomorrow said one 
source the lawyers have been doing a lot of work 
the new york times reported in tuesdays editions that pentagon 
officials said monday that the defense department officials under 
scrutiny would be transferred to less sensitive jobs until the 
investigation was completed 
mondays meeting came less than a week after federal 
investigators served 38 search warrants on defense contractors 
military consultants and defense department officials in connection 
with possible bribery and fraud in alleged leaks of classified 
contracting infomation worth millions of dollars 
the us attorney who is coordinating the investigation henry 
hudson of the eastern district of virginia said 270 subpoenas have 
been issued and that additional search warrants may be served 
in a senate speech sen charles grassley riowa rebuked the 
justice department for halting 1985 testimony he said would have 
revealed how defense contractors and private consultants were 
illegally obtaining pentagon weapons secrets attorney general 
edwin meese iii responded that the department has prosecuted 
defense procurement cases vigorously and has never had to be 
dragged into any indictment where the evidence is there 
elsewhere cbs news reported that three congressmen reps 
thomas downey dny andrew ireland rfla and sam stratton 
dny were under scrutiny in the case but that there was not 
yet enough evidence to make them targets of the investigation cbs 
said it got its information from law enforcement sources which it 
did not identify downeys name had been mentioned first in 
mondays editions of the washington times 
spokesmen for downey and ireland said no government official had 
contacted either congressmen or their offices in connection with 
the probe downey blasted as wholly incorrect the newspaper 
article linking him with the investigation cbs news said 
strattons office also said it had not been contacted 
on other matters in connection with the probe meese refused to 
say whether former navy secretary john lehman jr was under 
scrutiny in the investigation two of his former close aides 
melvyn paisley and retired adm james a ace lyons have been 
implicated in the probe 
meanwhile the new york times reported that three large military 
contractors hercules inc gould inc and the electronic data 
systems corp said they had been served with subpoenas in the 
probe eds spokesman bill wright told the newspaper that the 
company had been informed that it is not a target of the grand 
jury investigation 
among the five pentagon officials under scrutiny in the probe 
are james gaines the deputy assistant navy secretary for 
acquisition management and dr victor cohen the deputy assistant 
air force secretary in charge of buying tactical command control 
communications and computer systems cohens office was searched 
last week 
the others include two navy employees george stone an 
official in the space and naval warfare systems command and stuart 
berlin an executive with the naval air systems command and 
marine corps official jack sherman who works in the equipment and 
service acquisition section of the contracts division installation 
and logistics department 
theyre trying to decide what to do with those five until 
the next shoe drops said one official 
it could not be determined immediately monday whether the 
pentagon also was considering suspending defense contractors from 
bidding on new contracts if they had been implicated in the 
investigation 
grassley in his senate speech told of an incident in october 
1985 when a defense department investigator about to testify on his 
findings concerning procurement corruption was stopped from doing 
so by a top justice department official who grabbed the microphone 
away from him 
the testimony would have revealed the contract bribery 
allegations that became public just last week grassley said 
grassley who was then chairman of a senate judiciary 
subcommittee said he halted the hearing after department official 
victoria toensing interrupted the testimony of pentagon 
investigator robert segal she said he was about to touch on areas 
that concerned criminal matters pending against gte corp 
i stopped the hearing at that point grassley said i wish 
now i hadnt there wasnt anything in that testimony that could 
have jeopardized that case 
the public must be made aware of the fact that the justice 
department was asleep at the switch grassley said because it 
was conducting a narrow investigation when segal was finding 
widespread abuse and possible bribery in defense procurement 
attempts to contact segal on monday were unsuccessful 
meese said a number of spinoff cases grew out of the gte probe 
which are being prosecuted he did not identify them 
gte corp was not among the defense contractors searched by 
federal officials last week 
when asked about segals testimony that the department had not 
vigorously pursued the passing along of confidential information 
meese said that i can assure you that at no time has this 
department had to be dragged into any indictment where the evidence 
is there 
the attorney general said that since 1985 the defense 
procurement fraud unit has obtained some 43 indictments and 
criminal informations in significant cases has obtained 35 
convictions and has recovered some 32 million 
segal worked for the defense criminal investigative service and 
was pentagon liaison with the justice departments defense 
procurement fraud unit a special office established to investigate 
waste in the military budget 
his testimony in 1985 would have said private consultants 
regularly received classified pentagon documents that should not 
have been available outside the government grassley said 
according to grassley segal planned to say that many of these 
defense companies appear to have espionage units whose main 
function is to obtain copies of highly classified documents in 
order to give their companies a competitive edge 
the testimony also said the gte case was but the tip of the 
proverbial iceberg the investigation involves at least 25 
companies many of those companies are household words the 
primary focus of the case is the indiscriminate distribution of 
both proprietary and highly classified government documents by 
individuals within and without the government 
segals planned testimony was released at the time and prompted 
a harsh justice department response afterward 
the release by senator grassleys staff of erroneous 
misleading and inflammatory information about a criminal case that 
is currently pending trial is most unfortunate and regrettable 
justice must not be allowed to become a political football the 
department said 
grassley said he had not announced segals appearance in advance 
because he believed there would be pressure on him from within the 
government not to testify he said segal went to the judiciary 
subcommittee on administrative practices because he was frustrated 
when officials at the justice and defense departments refused to 
pursue his findings 
i feel confident that segals testimony plays a key 
role in lessons learned from current fbi probe grassley said 
prosecution only can be achieved when aggressive prosecutors 
capture the reins of control from the justice department 
bureaucracy

the cabinet has moved to turn the tide of 
declining soviet jewish immigration by forcing soviet jews to 
travel directly to israel but some recent arrivals said the new 
measures might backfire 
in a communique released after its weekly meeting sunday the 
cabinet said it decided to ensure in the framework of legal 
means available that jews who ask for an exit visa from the soviet 
union in order to come to israel would indeed reach israel 
directly 
israeli officials have been greatly angered by the number of 
dropouts soviet jews with israeli visas who choose to settle 
elsewhere in may more than 90 percent chose to do so 
sundays decision means jews would be required to pick up their 
israeli visas in bucharest romania once in bucharest the 
emigrants would be made to fly directly to israel 
under current arrangements soviet jews get israeli visas at the 
netherlands embassy in moscow most then leave through vienna 
enabling them to travel to western european countries or the united 
states where they are granted refugee status 
some prominent soviet jewish activists in israel oppose the 
measures saying they might backfire and lead some soviet jews to 
decide not to come 
im afraid that when we start to bring to israel jews who 
dont want to live in israel the damage will be greater said 
natan sharansky the human rights activist freed in 1986 after 
serving nine years in soviet labor camps 
a senior us embassy official said the decision appeared to 
contradict the united states position supporting freedom of travel 
for soviet jews 
our standing position is in favor of freedom of travel said 
the official who requested anonymity the secretary of state 
george shultz has stated that a number of times 
according to the governmentsponsored public council for soviet 
jewry only 18 percent of the 4695 soviet jews permitted to leave 
the soviet union in the first five months of 1988 have settled in 
israel of the 1169 jews who left the soviet union in may only 
99 percent came to israel 
in april jews in moscow said they began receiving official 
emigration papers from israel that permitted only travel to 
bucharest and tel aviv 
prime minister yitzhak shamir defended the cabinet decision 
sunday every other decision would be interpreted by soviet jews 
as treason and support for the dropouts he was quoted as saying 
on israel radio

city farm and industrial waste continues to 
pour into the nations rivers and streams even as the waterways 
shrivel from drought increasing the danger of contaminated water 
across the country 
drought has reduced the mississippi river to its lowest flow in 
years and dropped the st lawrence below normal for the first time 
in two decades according to the us geological survey 
low stream flows are reported in the northwest and southeast 
the great plains and in california threatening drinking water and 
aquatic life scientists warn 
ben jones assistant regional hydrologist for the geological 
survey in menlo park calif said common sense would tell you 
that if you have less flow in a stream there is less dilution of 
whatever components are being carried by that stream 
he cited recent complaints from northern california that large 
concentrations of sewage discharge have appeared in streams 
normally these streams have enough water to handle the treated 
sewage jones said but because of dry conditions the volume of 
sewage suddenly exceeded that of clean water 
in recent days the droughtinduced low water in the mississippi 
and ohio rivers has attracted attention by stranding barges but it 
also has concentrated pollutants in the two rivers which take the 
runoff from much of the nation 
bob meade of the geological surveys denver office recently 
returned from a waterquality survey of the mississippi he said 
one problem scientists found was a broken sewer in memphis that was 
spewing thousands of gallons of floatable solids into the river 
meades detailed pollution measurements wont be completed for 
months but he concurred with jones that reduced river flows 
increase the concentrations of chemicals such as nitrates and 
herbicides 
warm weather and low water levels lead to stress on much aquatic 
life added gary pederson a geological survey hydrologist in 
atlanta 
warmer water can hold less dissolved oxygen pederson said 
meaning there is less oxygen for fish and other aquatic life 
oxygen also helps clean the water he added so low water 
increases the chances of toxicity 
the geological surveys monthly analysis of the nations streams 
and rivers showed that flows were already below normal in may in 
the pacific northwest california the great plains and the 
southeast 
millions of americans also depend on ground water the great 
underground pools tapped by wells 
as a drought deepens and strengthens people tend to go more 
and more to ground water supplies as a source jones said in 
some cases they may start to pump water from underground aquifers 
which are not normally used 
ground water is already more concentrated with minerals because 
of its longer contact with them he said 
there are other effects also kind of peripheral to water 
quality itself said jones for example if the drought should 
go on for years there are areas which might have to worry about 
subsidence of land 
drawing water out of the underground aquifers can lead to sudden 
sinkholes jones cited examples in california and arizona 
land subsidence has also been a problem in other areas including 
houston and other cities near the gulf coast and in florida 
another potential problem said jones is that as water supplies 
shrink soil can become too salty that problem has been reported 
in parts of the southwest 
meade said that while low water increases much pollution it 
also can ease some types 
low water increases the concentration of pollutants dissolved in 
the water itself but may reduce those that attach themselves to 
sediment particles such as trace metals ddt and pcbs he said 
high water tends to stir up the sediment and carry it 
downstream he said

incomes have dropped in 44 african countries 
so far this decade while debt there is rising faster than anywhere 
else in the world the international monetary fund reports 
in the 1980s the average incomes of people in the 44 countries 
have dropped a little every year except 1985 and 1986 last year 
they dropped again by sixtenths of a percent 
the 44 subsaharan countries lie sandwiched between north 
africa which is somewhat better off and south africa which is 
much more prosperous the imf reports that the debt of the 44 rose 
from 21 billion in 1976 to nearly 138 billion last year 
noting the trends the worlds seven wealthiest nations agreed 
sunday at their summit in toronto to take steps to ease the african 
debt burden officials at the summit described the plan as a 
mixture of loan writeoffs debt rescheduling and concessionary 
interest rates 
west germany already had forgiven over 50 million dollars owed 
by the central african republic togo guinea sierra leone and 
sudan 
in the most prosperous of these five sudan the average citizen 
had an income in 1986 equal to 320 than a dollar a day 
although latin american nations have bigger debts the african 
debts weigh more heavily because those countries are poorer the 
imf report said they need more grants and easy loans from 
industrial countries 
it also said the african nations themselves need to use their 
resources more efficiently and increase savings 
while many debtor countries are already implementing rigorous 
adjustment programs others have yet to make the necessary 
commitment it said 
many governments refuse to ask for loans from the imf because 
the programs it has required in return cut the incomes of their 
poorer citizens even further president kenneth kaunda of zambia 
for example accepted such a program but then changed his mind when 
bloody riots followed food price increases 
five of the 44 subsaharan nations account for more than half 
the debt ivory coast nigeria sudan zaire and zambia nigeria 
sudan and zambia are also among those furthest behind in their 
payments 
only four can get any money from commercial banks nigeria 
ivory coast gabon and congo they will be expected to make 
payments of 94 billion a year this year and next but have 
actually only been paying an average 47 billion over the past 
four years 
the rest will owe governments 9 billion a year for the current 
twoyear period but have been paying only 38 billion 
all during the 1980s only 12 of the 44 have been able to keep 
up with what they owe 
the imf report blamed adverse historical and natural 
circumstances depressed commodity prices and poor economic 
policies

some aviation safety experts and the airlines 
say a new requirement aimed at easing the threat of collisions near 
airports still leaves commercial jets exposed to danger from small 
planes 
the federal aviation administration rule announced last week 
calls for sharply expanding the airspace in which small private 
planes must have equipment that tells controllers their altitude 
faa officials predict it will result in a significant increase in 
air safety 
but critics of the final regulation accuse the faa of scaling 
back their proposed requirements too far by requiring the new 
equipment only if planes fly within 10 miles of airports in most 
parts of the country only at the busiest facilities will the 
equipment be required for 30 miles around the airports 
we thought the faa rule was going to go much further jim 
burnett chairman of the national transportation safety board said 
in an interview he called the aspect of the regulation that 
applies to 116 airports with moderately busy air traffic clearly 
inadequate to protect jetliners from small planes 
the air line pilots association which represents 40000 pilots 
and the air transport association the trade group for the 
airlines joined in the criticism although faa officials called 
the rule a significant safety improvement 
it brought some improvement but didnt go as far as it should 
have said john mazor a spokesman for the pilots union 
the ata issued a statement saying the new requirement for small 
planes all of which does not go into effect until after 1990 
clearly does not go far enough the potential for conflicting 
incidents between aircraft remains 
the faa rule announced last thursday was an outgrowth of the 
1986 collision of a small cessna and an mexican airliner over 
cerritos calif in which 82 people were killed the small plane 
had no device which would show controllers its altitude on the 
radar screen 
after the accident aviation safety advocates and members of 
congress began calling for private planes flying in the same 
airspace with commercial jets to have socalled modec transponders 
that provide controllers with altitude information 
last february the faa suggested a sweeping rule that would have 
required the equipment on all planes flying within 40 miles of 254 
airports and above 6000 feet 
the suggestion unleashed a storm of protest including 80000 
complaint letters to congress and the faa from private pilots who 
argued their freedom to fly was being threatened the devices cost 
from 600 to 2000 per aircraft 
the faas final rule rolled back the number of airports covered 
to 143 and the airspace to a 30mile radius around the busiest 
airports and a 10mile radius around 116 midsized airports in 
other airspace it lowered the floor for such equipment from 12500 
feet to 10000 feet but not to the 6000 feet previously suggested 
the critics said they are not alarmed by the faa narrowing its 
new requirements to more than 100 fewer airports but they are 
critical of the faa limiting the airspace in which small planes 
must have the modec equipment to a 10mile radius around 116 
airports with moderately heavy air traffic 
there will be a significant part of every approach at these 
airports where the airplane and passengers will be exposed to 
airspace where other aircraft will be operating with no requirement 
for them to report their altitude to air traffic control said 
stephen hayes a spokesman for the air transport association 
the airlines and commercial pilots say it typically takes a 
jetliner about 25 miles to climb to 10000 feet and that 
controllers often begin routing a plane below 10000 feet about 30 
miles from an airport 
under the new regulations commercial jets will continue to mix 
with private planes without modec transponders for 15 to 20 miles 
in and out of these airports said hayes 
the airports with moderately heavy air traffic are those 
currently within socalled airport radar service areas or arsas 
for air traffic purposes plus two specially designated airports 
that also have no such restrictions but have a level of commercial 
traffic where the faa had some concerns 
burnett complained the same requirement should have been 
extended to the midsized airports as was imposed around 27 
airports within 23 socalled terminal radar control areas or tcas 
the restricted areas are shaped like upsidedown wedding cakes 
around the midsized airports small planes without transponders 
will be restricted from a fivemile radius between the ground and 
10000 feet between five and 10 miles outside the airports the 
restrictions will apply between 1200 and 10000 feet 
burnett and other critics expressed dismay at that saying 
airspace below 1200 feet should be restricted in all cases around 
these airports 
while it is unlikely that jetliners will fly that low beyond 5 
miles of an airport burnett said failure to apply the 
restrictions to those low levels will continue to confuse 
controllers 
when they see a plane flying in that area but without 
indicating altitude the controller will assume it is below 1200 
feet and legal when in fact it may be at a higher altitude in 
violation of the rule and potentially in conflict with commercial 
traffic he said

when leaders of the industrialized democracies 
hold summits foreign policy issues have a way of pushing 
exchangerate levels interestrate worries and other dry but vital 
financial concerns off to the side 
but for president reagans last hurrah this is his final 
summit the focus finally is on what these annual economic 
meetings were designed to be about economics 
in fact the joint statement of the leaders views on world 
affairs was being released later today leaving the rest of the 
summit clear for concentration on economic matters 
for the first time a session on economic issues launched the 
summit sunday after glittering arrival ceremonies at the outset 
reagan made an appeal for eliminating agricultural subsidies the 
hottest economic issue here and will return to the topic before 
tuesdays adjournment 
believe me its going to be discussed the president told a 
reporter as he posed for pictures with the other leaders before 
dinner he is determined to end the subsidies by the year 2000 and 
faces stiff european resistance 
at the opening session british prime minister maragaret 
thatcher supervised a review of economic trends since the first 
summit was held in 1975 
and while global politics including a report by reagan on his 
talks in moscow with soviet general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
were the theme at the leaders dinner sunday night no tough 
international issue loomed for the threeday meeting 
in fact in another agenda change the talks today were 
beginning with a roundtable on the global outlook without the 
distraction of noneconomic issues 
we wanted to put the focus back on economics said derek 
burney chief of staff for the summit host canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney 
that is not the way it has been in the past 
last year for instance the irancontra scandal shadowed 
reagans talks with the other leaders in venice italy and only at 
the last minute was a denunciation of south africas racial policy 
excluded from the windup communique the war in the persian gulf 
between iran and iraq attracted far more attention than interest 
rates and growth projections 
in 1986 in tokyo terrorism took precedence over economics as 
reagan and mrs thatcher persuaded their partners to issue a 
forceful antiterrorism statement 
in 1985 french president francois mitterrand kept the 
summiteers from endorsing reagans controversial program for a 
spacebased missile defense while in 1984 outgoing canadian prime 
minister pierre elliott trudeau sought futilely to persuade the 
leaders to support disarmament 
and in 1983 despite trudeaus drive for nuclear arms 
reductions reagan won endorsement of the us installation of new 
missiles in western europe 
world leaders can get worked up over economic issues as much as 
they do over terrorism and disarmament at this summit there could 
be a row over agricultural subsidies with reagan and mulroney 
lined up against mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl 
in trying to phase them out 
but the issue may be bucked to the general agreement on trade 
and tariff talks in montreal in december 
there will be some serious debate about how to ease the debt 
burden on third world countries 
mitterrand is pushing a plan to cancel onethird of the official 
debt of the poorer countries in the context of a 10year 
rescheduling agreement nigel lawson the british chancellor of the 
exchequer is urging a different approach converting some loans to 
grants and rescheduling and reducing interest rates 
but even in the economic sphere the theme of reagans finale 
is dont rock the boat the world outlook seems rosier than it has 
been in years and with elections looming in the united states and 
in canada the host country dry statistics and quiet discussion 
will be just fine with everyone

delegation had implied the ec worries especially concerning 
agricultural subsidies were given less weight because their 
leaders were not elected 
de clercq told a news conference that the remark was a a very 
very characteristic example of lack of understanding and

policy is the community as such

here is the text of a statement issued sunday by 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney on behalf of the summit 
leaders it was read by canadian finance minister michael wilson 
the leaders have had an excellent and freewheeling discussion 
led off by a farranging statement by prime minister margaret 
thatcher this was followed by a vigorous and comprehensive review 
of major concerns of president reagan chancellor kohl president 
mitterrand prime minister takeshita prime minister de mita and 
president delors 
the idea of holding an initial working session among leaders has 
clearly proved its worth there was a productive and spontaneous 
discussion which lasted about threequarters of an hour longer than 
had been anticipated the discussion has given a focus to the 
agenda and an opportunity for each leader to indicate their 
priority concerns 
the leaders are all conscious that this is the end of the second 
cycle of summits since the last summit in canada in 1981 great 
progress has been made in restoring and sustaining growth winding 
down inflation and facilitating structural reforms 
cooperation through summits has facilitated these results the 
response to the oct 19 stock market crisis and the 
betterthanexpected performance of the world economy since then 
show just how far this cooperation has developed and succeeded it 
has generated renewed confidence in financial markets 
the leaders agreed though that there is no room for 
complacency difficult challenges remain 
on macroeconomic policies our countries must develop further 
our economic coordination efforts sound policies must be continued 
on trade they all agreed to resist protectionism and insure the 
midterm review in montreal gives a strong signal of progress 
the canadausa free trade agreement was strongly welcomed as 
was the european community internal market initiative 
on agriculture concern was expressed at the market distortions 
and budget costs posed by agricultural subsidization both for 
ourselves and the ldcs lesser developed countries there is a 
need for impetus to the continuing efforts of reform on that the 
leaders recognized their joint responsibility with the ldcs to find 
solutions 
for the poorest countries they agreed to focus on new debt 
relief options 
theyve also touched on other issues such as the environment 
population growth and technology 
in sum this has been a most useful opening to the deliberations 
of the leaders 
although we as leading industrialized nations still face 
challenges we all feel weve made real progress in recent years 
our message is and should be one of confidence and optimism in 
dealing with the challenges confronting us 
all this has in large part stemmed from the cooperation among 
us as symbolized by this meeting in toronto

investigators in the pentagon bribery probe 
are seeking documents concerning pratt amp whitneys use of a pair of 
defense consultants to help win contracts for two major jet engine 
programs 
a search warrant seeking documents from pratt amp whitney says the 
company may have written its bids on the contracts with secret 
knowledge about what its chief competitor was proposing to the 
government 
the warrant obtained by the trade paper defense week and made 
available to the associated press was signed last week by us 
district judge john h pratt 
the fourpage warrant permitted the fbi to search the office of 
eugene tallia vice president of pratt amp whitney and head of the 
companys washington office pratt amp whitney is a subsidiary of 
united technologies the nations eighthlargest defense 
contractor the parent company has declined to comment other than 
to say it is cooperating with the investigation 
pampw hired melvyn paisley within a week after paisley resigned in 
april 1987 as assistant secretary of the navy for research 
engineering and systems 
the company also hired william galvin another consultant 
closely associated with paisley 
the search warrant seeks documents notes reports and other 
materials that paisley and galvin provided to tallia 
specifically the warrant targets pampws effort to develop 
engines for the jvx an experimental plane under development by the 
pentagon and the fa18 the twinengine jet that will be the 
navys top fighter for the rest of the century 
general electric and pratt amp whitney are the nations two major 
builders of aircraft jet engines and the air force and navy are two 
of their prime customers 
general electric originally had a monopoly contract to provide 
an engine known as the 404 for the fa18 but the navy seeking 
to drive down costs through competition asked pratt amp whitney to 
build a prototype so it could compete 
pratt amp whitney has since been picked as the second supplier of 
404 engines in the past two years pampw has won 316 million worth 
of 404 contracts from the navy 
the warrant asks pampw to provide copies of general electrics 
proposals to the government on the 404 and jvx projects or any 
other documents containing information which should not have been 
released from the government 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said sunday that competition is supposed to foster 
lower prices this is basically a threat to competition this is a 
corruption of competitive features that have been emphasized both 
from congress and the department of defense 
nunn speaking on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
said the investigation of possible corruption in pentagon 
procurement practices involves stifling competition most of the 
effort here was to keep the competitive processes from working 
properly by having specifications he did not mention the pampw 
case by name 
allegedly they the specifications were designed for one 
company nunn said well other companies cant really compete 
successfully by having inside information leaked to one company 
where they will know that they can ease up their bid and charge the 
government more and still win the low bid thats exactly the 
opposite of competitive practices 
the search warrant while seeking to discover what pratt amp 
whitney knew about ges bid on the two engine projects also seeks 
data about pampws offer on the same program 
it asked for notes memoranda correspondence and other 
documents relating to pratt amp whitneys proposal to the government 
on the 404 and jvx projects or contacts between pratt amp whitneys 
employees and united states government employees on those 
projects

boat owners and coastal lawmakers are not 
satisfied with the coast guards latest attempt to draft a policy 
on towing disabled vessels despite recent concessions by the 
agency 
under intense pressure from congress and boat owners the coast 
guard recently modified the nonemergency towing policy that had 
left recreational boaters with little choice but to use costly 
commercial towers when their vessels broke down 
but critics say the new policy still unduly favors commercial 
towers and can subject owners whose boats break down to needless 
expense and delay 
its very disappointing said michael sciulla vice 
president of boat owners association of the united states a group 
representing 250000 recreational boat owners theyve chosen to 
ignore the pleas of thousands of recreational boaters 
the towing policy was created in 1982 as a way to boost the 
fledgling commercial towing industry under that policy coast 
guard officials would call a commercial operator by telephone to 
tow a disabled boat back to harbor 
boat owners complained that the policy eliminated the chance for 
good samaritans friends and the coast guard auxiliary to tow them 
back for free and owners charged that they were sometimes forced 
to wait hours for busy towers 
the policy also sunk morale at the auxiliary as volunteers who 
were anxious to help fellow boaters were forced to sit at the dock 
while commercial towers handled the nonemergency situations how 
would you like it if you were a volunteer fireman and you couldnt 
go out and put out a fire sciulla asked 
the coast guard held a series of public hearings to modify the 
policy and earlier this month issued the longawaited guidelines 
under the new policy coast guard officials will send a marine 
radio broadcast about a disabled boat giving good samaritans the 
chance to respond as well as commercial operators and if no one 
responds to the call within 10 minutes or if the tow operator 
cannot be at the scene within one hour then the coast guard 
auxiliary would be dispatched according to coast guard capt ken 
hollemon 
the changes however are not enough for boating enthusiasts 
it keeps these volunteers chained to the dock for a minimum of 
an hour before they can respond sciulla said at the same 
time it requires a boat ower who can be out there with a kid 
whos screaming and a wife whos getting seasick to be out there 
longer 
gene hammel an aide to rep earl hutto dfla chairman of the 
house merchant marine coast guard subcommittee agreed that the new 
policy is not sufficient and predicted congress may consider 
legislation expanding the auxiliarys role 
even the coast guard is apparently not satisfied with the change 
adm paul a yost jr the guards commandant who publicly 
sympathized with the boaters plight backed a towing policy that 
would have allowed auxiliary volunteers to respond to a call 
immediately but that was scuttled by reagan administration 
officials at the transportation department according to one 
government source

democratic presidential contender jesse 
jackson took aim at the growing pentagon scandal saying it reads 
like a class c hollywood script 
in a speech here sunday jackson criticized the alleged 
corruption and fraud in defense department weaponsbuying while 
summing up the accomplishments of his campaign 
jackson is officially continuing his presidential bid even 
though michael dukakis has a numerical lock on the democratic 
nomination 
dukakis and republican george bush took a day off from 
campaigning sunday the massachusetts governor spent the day in 
boston and the vice president was at home in washington 
the defense investigation a nationwide probe involving private 
defense consultants pentagon officials and defense contractors 
was made public last tuesday as agents searched 38 office and homes 
to find evidence of bribes and gratuities paid for disclosure of 
confidential contracting information 
the information allegedly gave recipients a competitive edge in 
submitting bids for contracts 
this is beginning to read like a class c hollywood script 
jackson said in a speech to citizen action key consultant 
working for boeing receives a 100000plus bonus for going to the 
navy a golden handshake for future services scene 1 
jackson continued his description of the federal probe 
fortyfive of the top 100 defense contractors under criminal 
investigation the defense industry employs 6 million people 
holding them hostage a 150 billion business a year revolving 
door contractors and the pentagon 
the democratic candidate said the military budget can be trimmed 
without cutting our defense this corruption waste and cost 
overruns will not make us more secure 
jackson also criticized spending money to defend europe and 
japan four decades after world war ii let europe and japan share 
more of their defense he said 
citizen action describes itself as a national political 
organization dedicated to citizen participation in economic and 
political decisions the group which advocates primarily liberal 
causes counts suburbanites and bluecollar workers among its 15 
million members in 24 states 
the democratic candidate citing the frequently asked question 
what does jesse want said better queries would be what has 
jesse built what have we built what do we represent 
jackson pointed to his primary season successes in vermont 
alaska puerto rico and delaware his close to 7 million popular 
votes and his ability to build a nationwide coalition 
the issue my friends is not the trite issue of what does 
jesse want he said 
in atlanta take our positions to the floor we might 
challenge and inspire a nation to get a mandate said jackson 
unity in july victory in november 
earlier in the day jackson held a private meeting with about 30 
national convention delegates who are members of the association of 
community organizations for reform now also known as acorn 
the delegates who are pledged to jackson came from around the 
country to discuss plans for the july 1821 democratic convention 
in atlanta the group later joined hands with jackson and posed for 
photographers 
this is unity the candidate said

free elections were not feasible under either the cambodian 
government installed by vietnam after its 1978 invasion or under 
the khmer rouge the strongest rebel force 
even if vietnamese forces make a concrete withdrawal 
sihanouks forces will not be able to secure the freedom 
sovereignty and safety of cambodia unless strong international

it is high time for the international community to put an end 
to the situation of the invasion of cambodia and the violation of 
human rights sihanouk was quoted as saying 
to secure withdrawal the mst effective and peaceful means is 
to stop all forms of economic assistance to vietnam haraguchi

portauprince haiti ap lt gen henri namphy broke out of 
house arrest sunday night and his troops seized the presidential 
palace and unseated civilian president leslie manigat who had 
ousted him as military chief 
an uzi submachine gun in his right hand a helmeted namphy 
declared on staterun television early monday that the army was in 
control 
the army will lead the country this way the fatigueclad 
namphy shouted raising his weapon in the speech from the 
presidential palace which was taken in a gun and grenade battle 
he made no mention of manigat who had fired him on friday 
during a power struggle that split haitis military leadership 
government sources said manigat was taken by ambulance from his 
residence five miles north of the palace to a military hospital 
there was no word on his condition but a journalistic source close 
to the military said manigat would be expelled from the country 
early monday he did not name a destination 
the military ran the january balloting widely criticized as 
rigged that saw manigat elected 
namphy surrounded by helmeted soldiers refused to discuss the 
battle between his troops and those loyal to manigat 
in the sevenminute speech that ended about 130 am edt he 
said we will not speak of what happened we are looking ahead 
we love the army the regular army the army loves the people and 
the country 
he spoke in creole 
namphy 55 looked fatigued and said he was ailing when he 
finished an army band broke into the national anthem 
a western diplomat said soldiers of the presidential guard loyal 
to namphy had battled troops loyal to manigat who was seized at 
his residence there was no word on casualties 
earlier sunday manigat retired the portauprince police chief 
and transferred about two dozen officers including the head of the 
presidential guard 
at about 830 pm edt power went out for about 10 minutes and 
gunfire broke out around the presidential palace heard from a 
hotel two blocks away it died down then surged again shortly after 
midnight when explosions were also heard and ended about 1 hours 
later 
the streets of this caribbean capital of 1 million were deserted 
the presidential guard went to get namphy and brought him to 
the palace said the western diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the diplomat said the presidential guard had battled troops of 
the 700man dessalines battalion which is commanded by an lt col 
jeanclaude paul whom namphy tried to reassign last week to an 
administrative job 
the journalistic source close to the military said paul was with 
his troops inside dessalines barracks which is adjacent the 
presidential palace surrounded forces loyal to namphy and refused 
to surrender 
earlier sunday namphy was under house arrest at his walledin 
residence compound in bon repos 15 miles north of the capital 
manigat retired namphy as commander in chief of haitis 
7000man army on friday charging him with insubordination in 
ordering the transfer of lowerranking officers three days earlier 
the transfer and retirement orders launched a power struggle 
that aligned manigat with paul 
namphy was president of the threeman junta that ruled haiti for 
two years after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in 
france in february 1986 the junta was disbanded after manigats 
government was installed 
manigat was elected on jan 17 
an independently run election nov 29 was thwarted by widespread 
violence that left more than 30 people dead and the army made no 
effort to stop 
pauls soldiers were blamed for much of the violence and he was 
indicted in march by a us grand jury in miami and charged with 
drug trafficking 
manigat said last week the objectives of his government were 
democratization modernization and putting the armed forces at 
the service of the country skeptics said it was unclear if that 
would be possible 
the government announced sunday that col gregoire figaro the 
police chief of portauprince would be retired and col prosper 
avril head of the presidential guard would be reassigned to an 
administrative post 
figaro took over as police chief from col albert pierre who 
namphy allowed to flee to exile in brazil despite public 
accusations he killed and tortured pisoners figaro also was 
unpopular 
avril now chief of military attaches was an adviser to the 
militaryled junta until antigovernment demonstrations forced him 
to resign that post in early 1986 
the government announced the changes in a threepage communique 
broadcast on staterun television the communique said the moves 
were authorized by namphys replacement brig gen morton gousse 
but gave no further explanation 
these were among the other transfers ordered sunday 
capt isidore pognon commander of fort dimanche a military 
garrison where thousands of political opponents were sent during 
the 29year dictatorship begun by francois papa doc duvalier in 
1957 and continued by his son was transferred to military 
headquarters 
maj henry robert augustin namphys former aide was put in 
charge of the armys dry cleaning and laundry services 
capt ernest ravix military commander of the north coastal 
town of st marc through which much illegal contraband passes was

has moved to a quiet neighborhood here has triggered fear and 
outrage mirroring the reaction in six california towns he was 
forced to flee after his parole last year 
people are collecting petition signatures and have called a 
meeting for tonight in hopes of getting singleton to leave a radio 
station and a car dealership have offered the tampa native 10000 
and a oneway ticket to clear out 
a lot of people around here are angry hostile and afraid we 
want to avoid vigilante behavior and mistakes said art lawrence 
a parole officer and father of two teenagers in the forest hills 
neighborhood 
singleton 60 gave authorities a forest hills address last week 
in complying with state law requiring felons moving to florida to 
register a residence the address belongs to singletons brother 
walter 
walter singleton says his brother isnt living with him and 
wont reveal where he is however some residents are convinced 
lawrence singleton is living in their quiet middleclass 
neighborhood 
singleton was convicted of raping a 15yearold hitchhiker 
chopping her arms off with an ax and leaving her for dead near san 
francisco in 1978 the graybearded former merchant seaman spent 
eight years of a 14year sentence in a california prison 
we have somebody with a record of brutality and perversion who 
has not surfaced lawrence said saturday mothers are telling 
their kids to beware of men with beards how disruptive this is to 
a community 
hes going to have a hard time living anywhere added forest 
hills retiree robert hosack he might as well be in jail 
hillsborough county sheriffs col cal henderson said 
authorities cannot force singleton out 
california residents protested when their communities were 
mentioned as potential homes for singleton during his year on 
parole he was forced to flee six towns and eventually wound up in 
a mobile home on the grounds of san quentin prison 
when his parole ended in april he was a free man 
at tonights meeting residents plan to discuss what legal 
recourse if any they have in order to force singleton to leave 
they have invited police and elected officials 
hundreds of signatures seeking singletons ouster have been 
collected on petitions circulated by forest hills residents said 
lawrence the petitions will eventually be presented to officials 
he said 
legally he has a right to be where he wants to be said 
resident lester heitlinger and i want him to have his rights 
but i dont want him to have his rights in my neighborhood i dont 
want to have to worry about an ogre living near 
my wife and i saw him out walking at 810 the other morning 
said heitlinger who lives a half mile from walter singleton im 
absolutely positive it was the same face i saw in the newspaper 
however winston whittle who lives across the street from 
walter singleton said he hasnt seen lawrence singleton 
hes got no reason to lie whittle said of walter singleton 
he couldnt be hiding his brother inside forever 
whittle said hes had two mailboxes destroyed in recent days 
presumably by vandals who mistook his home for singletons 
singleton has been constant fodder on tampa bay area talk shows 
with listeners suggesting he be shipped far from florida 
in a fullpage newspaper ad thursday bradenton car dealer tom 
stimus said singleton was not fit to live among decent human 
beings he offered singleton 5000 a oneway ticket anywhere 
and rent and utilities for six months at singletons new address 
stimus previously offered rewards for the assassination of 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi and irans ayatollah khomeini 
st petersburg radio station wqykfm matched stimus 5000 
offer after hundreds of people responding to an onair poll said 
they wanted singleton to leave according to spokeswoman diana

for nearly two decades the only memorial to 
beat generation author jack kerouac in his hometown was his 
grave where fans left offerings like a bottle of burgundy wine 
two cigarettes and a wilted rose 
this week the first official kerouac memorial in lowell will be 
dedicated with a gathering of boyhood friends and writers like 
allen ginsberg who with kerouac expressed disillusionment with 
mainstream america in the 1950s 
kerouac is to lowell as thoreau is to concord or steinbeck is 
to salinas calif said paul marion cultural affairs directors 
for the lowell historic preservation commission which coordinated 
construction of the memorial it will be a focal point for the 
pilgrims 
in his early novels kerouac nostalgically portrayed this 
northeastern massachusetts city of mills and ethnic neighborhoods 
it became a brief sanctuary in his last years when he was bloated 
from booze and unable to write he died in st petersburg fla at 
age 47 of a hemorrhage 
the 100000 memorial is an arrangement of 3by8foot granite 
panels bearing 15 passages from some of kerouacs 20 books and 
essays including the socalled lowell novels doctor sax the 
town and the city and the classic on the road 
houston sculptor ben woitena said he arranged the panels in a 
cross and circle pattern to represent the strong roman catholic 
values of kerouacs youth and his later exploration of buddhism 
the polished reddishbrown stone reflects the redbrick mills and 
canals that symbolized workingclass lowell to kerouac 
the site is less than a mile from the frenchcanadian 
neighborhood where kerouac was raised and a block from the sun 
newspaper which fired him after a brief stint as a young 
sportswriter 
saturdays dedication will highlight a week of kerouacrelated 
events including poetry readings by kerouac friends ginsberg and 
lawrence ferlinghetti 
two of kerouacs three wives edith parker kerouac of detroit 
and lowellborn stella sampas kerouac are expected to meet for the 
first time since kerouacs funeral kerouacs 36yearold daughter 
janet also is to attend 
the memorials focus on literature rather than kerouacs 
lifestyle won over a contingent of residents who were opposed to a 
large tribute to kerouac whom they saw as a symbol or decadence 
and irreverence 
its good that they are finally remembering him for his 
works said the rev armand morrissette who was kerouacs 
boyhood confidant and eulogized him at his funeral he was a man 
of great compassion and sincerity he was much more than just a 
drunk 
kerouac saw all the world through lowell it was his reference 
point for all the people and places he wrote about in his life 
ginsberg said in a telephone interview to jack lowell was a 
sacred place its fitting that lowell in turn makes jack 
sacred 
kerouac born jeanlouis lebris de kerouac in 1922 spoke only 
the frenchcanadian patois until grade school 
although he often recalled his lowell boyhood kerouac rarely 
returned after leaving in 1939 for columbia university in new york 
city where he was adopted into a circle of friends that included 
ginsberg and william burroughs he did however make his home in 
lowell for about a year during the mid1960s before moving to 
florida

suspected militant sikh separatists 
hurled a homemade grenade into a crowded vegetablkwo morning 
killing four people and injuring about 
40 police said 
the attackers struck as about 2000 shoppers and vendors were 
gathered in the openair market in the mixed hindu and sikh suburb 
of tilak nagar pieces of flesh and bloodcovered vegetables lay in 
the mud left by overnight rains 
it was the second day in a row that sikh extremists had mounted 
bombing attacks outside punjab state the main killing ground in 
their 6yearold guerrilla and terror war for a separate homeland 
on sunday a bomb killed 15 people who were watching television 
at a market in kurukshetra in haryana state about 90 miles north 
of new delhi 
police said the bomb was planted by sikh extremists and 
apparently detonated by remote control afterward police were 
placed on alert in six states and new delhi 
three of those killed in todays bombing of the chowk chandi 
market were hindu men the identity of the fourth could not 
immediately be determined 
assistant police commissioner ajay aggarwal quoted witnesses as 
saying the grenade was thrown into the crowd from a creamcolored 
van containing four sikhs who are recognizable by their 
distinctive turbans and untrimmed beards 
shoppers panicked fleeing through the mud and the blood 
aggarwal said there were no reports of religious tension in the 
hindusikh neighborhood immediately after the attack sikh assaults 
on hindus in new delhi and elsewhere in india sometimes trigger 
violent backlashes 
people are aggravated but we are taking steps to control the 
situation aggarwal said 
he said police had banned the assembly of more than four people 
in the neighborhood immediately after the attack 
tilak nagar was predominantly hindu until 1984 when sikhs 
started moving in after their homes were destroyed in antisikh 
riots touched off when prime minister indira gandhi was 
assassinated by her sikh bodyguards 
over the years more sikhs have arrived from punjab the 
predominantly sikh northern state where the militants have killed 
at least 1333 people so far this year although the militants 
initially targeted hindus they have increasingly turned their guns 
on fellow sikhs they consider informers or too moderate 
sikh attacks outside punjab state have claimed at least 46 lives 
since the first of the year most of the victims died in bombings 
about half those deaths occurred during or after the 
governments siege last month of sikh militants holed up in the 
golden temple in the punjab city of amritsar the siege ended after 
more than 40 sikhs were killed and hundreds of others surrendered 
the golden temple sikhisms holiest shrine had contained 
headquarters and arms caches of several sikh separatist groups 
although the government succeeded in clearing the temple of 
armed militants the siege prompted fears the radicals would 
escalate attacks outside punjab where killings continued 
sikh gunmen killed five people there in four attacks sunday 
night according to the united news of india and press trust of 
india uni also said security forces shot to death a sikh extremist 
although sikhs are a majority in punjab they form just 2 
percent of indias predominantly hindu 800 million people their 
agitation for greater autonomy in punjab began in 1982 and grew 
into demands by several militant groups for an independent nation 
the sikh faith was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative 
to hinduism and islam

the royal familys unfriendliness to the duke and 
duchess of windsor after he abdicated the throne left the duke 
deeply embittered long after their scandalous marriage a series of 
letters published today show 
calling his family a smug stinking lot the duke lauded his 
decision to leave court life in one of the letters published by the 
daily mail newspaper as an excerpt from an upcoming book 
let us enjoy our lovely full life together far removed from 
the boredom the restrictions and the intrigues of the royal family 
and the court the duke wrote to his wife while in london for the 
funeral of his mother queen mary in 1953 
what a smug stinking lot my relations are and youve never 
seen such a seedy worn out bunch of old hags most of them have 
become wrote the duke who was the uncrowned edward viii for 11 
months before abdicating 
his mother was as hard as nails he wrote another time 
the duke and the duchess used a series of codenames to refer to 
their relatives in the letters such as cookie for the dukes 
sisterinlaw elizabeth now the queen mother and shirley temple 
junior for now queen elizabeth ii 
according to the daily mail the letters were given by the duke 
and duchess to their lawyers with the aim of eventual publication 
the newspaper published excerpts from 16 letters by the couple 
mostly to each other as the first in a series of installments from 
a book called the secret file of the duke of windsor edited by 
michael bloch to be published in july it did not say how many 
installments would appear 
the duke who abdicated in 1936 because he couldnt marry the 
american wallis simpson who had been twice divorced wrote one 
series of letters to the duchess during a trip to london for the 
funeral of his younger brother king george vi in february 1952 
at the time he was informed that the 10000pound annual 
pension granted by his brother would be halted the newspaper 
reported 
it said this violated the original agreement between the 
brothers that as long as the duke gave up everything he had 
inherited he could have a lifelong pension 
later when the duke made indirect inquiries about allowing the 
duchess to attend the coronation of his brothers daughter queen 
elizabeth ii the royals private secretary said that that was 
impossible because it would add a discordant note to the 
celebrations the report said 
earlier the duke had written to his brother asking for the 
family to meet his wife if only we could be invited just once 
for tea he wrote 
the duke died in 1972 at age 77 and the duchess in 1986 at the 
age of 89

a fourman diving team swam through an 
8440foot underwater cave system setting records and mapping 40 
millionyearold tunnels in an effort that claimed a companions 
life last month 
heres to bill mcfaden who im sure would love to be here 
today diver parker turner 36 of destin said after he and the 
others emerged sunday afternoon from their journey mcfaden 32 
ran out of air and drowned in a nearby cave may 15 as his 
companions tried to pull him to safety 
the divers swam through 16 miles of craggy limestone caverns 
from sullivan sink about 12 miles south of tallahasee to cheryl 
sink 
they spent just over an hour breathing specially blended gases 
to decompress from the dive at depths up to 240 feet 
my lungs are a little scratchy from breathing all that 
oxygen other than that im fine said turner director of 
safety for the gainesvillebased national association for cave 
diving it went real smooth but boy if you had a problem it 
would have been distressing 
the previous record for the longest cave traverse was set in a 
6400foot dive in kelds head england and the deepest cave 
traverse was set during a 230foot dive in the sullivan system 
said turner 
the team measured the sullivan tunnel system in january in 
separate dives by stringing lines from each end setting a record 
for connecting the longest underwater cave but had not traversed 
the entire system in one dive until sunday 
the group got a late start because bill main 36 of alachua 
needed time to cool down from an apparent case of heat stroke as he 
prepared for the dive while wearing his insulating wetsuit in the 
90plusdegree heat 
aimed primarily at mapping the tunnels collecting rock samples 
and studying geologic structures the expedition could produce 
evidence linking the caves to underwater rivers flowing into the 
gulf of mexico some 20 miles south 
geologists are more certain they will learn about water flow in 
the floridan aquifer which provides drinking water to wells in 
much of florida said frank rupert of the florida geological 
survey who attended the dive 
the caves were formed about the time a shallow inland sea 
covered florida and part of georgia rupert said 
they are part of what is believed to be a 40000foot system 
which would make it the longest documented underwater limestone 
cave system the secondlongest is the 36000foot lucayan tunnel 
beneath grand bahama island said team publicist lisa burkett 
the exploration had been postponed since february because heavy 
rains last winter washed silt into the caves and cut visibility 
but recent weeks of drought allowed the debris to settle 
what a wild ride turner said sunday noting an underground 
current of at least 1 knot carried the team through in about 55 
minutes im really glad we waited because the flow was real 
strong

prime minister margaret thatcher always more 
respected by britons than liked is antagonizing both her 
traditional critics and supporers as her rightwing revolution 
confronts the cherished welfare state 
but despite parliamentary rebellions public weariness with her 
combative style and polls showing widespread dislike of key aspects 
of her policies her dominance of her conservative party and the 
country appears unchallenged 
the polls show why most britons feel they are better off and 
most believe that like it or not mrs thatchers recipe for a 
freeenterprise society and ending the dependency culture will 
improve the economy in the long term 
however there are signs of unease within the conservative party 
about both the thatcher style and the radical program she is 
pursuing in the third fiveyear term she won last year 
theyre going too fast theyre too strident in their tone 
mrs thatchers personal profile is too high sir john nott who 
was mrs thatchers defense secretary from 1979 to 1983 said in a 
recent television interview 
you cannot conduct politics over a continued period and reform 
the country if everything is seen as the policies or not the 
policies of a single individual he said 
after two terms of assaulting inflation powerful labor unions 
and inefficient stateowned industries mrs thatcher the longest 
serving prime minister this century is treading into more 
sensitive territory 
her program now affects millions of britons personally through 
an overhaul of education a revision of welfare benefits a new 
property tax and tight funding of the staterun national health 
service 
only now have the philosophical aspirations of thatcherism 
taken concrete form the economist weekly commented 
thatcherism is now on trial 
what worries some tories is that the thatcher forcefulness that 
tamed the unions looks less admirable when used to push through 
measures directly touching peoples lives and pocketbooks 
conservatives to the left of mrs thatcher winced for example 
at slashing the top income tax rate this year by onethird to 40 
percent while removing state housing subsidies from several million 
families as part of the changes in welfare benefits 
mrs thatcher shows no such unease fueling charges she is 
becoming more abrasive and dogmatic and has reduced parliament 
where she has had big majorities since winning power in 1979 to a 
rubber stamp 
increasingly she rolls out the big guns to get her way in 
january she ordered a threeline whip the toughest voting 
stricture parliamentary managers can impose to defeat a bill 
introduced by a rankandfile tory lawmaker who sought to 
liberalize britains strict official secrecy laws 
the bill was lost but the normal tory majority of 101 in the 
650member commons slumped to 37 rebel legislator sir ian gilmour 
described the thatcher order as wholly misconceived 
authoritarian and a sorry display of executive arrogance 
in april the property tax bill which replaces the single house 
tax with a flatrate levy on every adult living under the same 
roof provoked the biggest revolt yet an attempt by a 
rankandfile tory member of parliament to relate the tax to income 
was lost by only 25 votes 
when the tax measure risked defeat in the unelected house of 
lords conservative parliamentary managers drafted in an array of 
landowning aristrocrats to vote for the government they included 
peers who almost never attend sessions of the largely hereditary 
chamber 
mrs thatcher maintains that making everyone pay the tax will 
bring home the cost of electing the higherspending labor party to 
local councils which impose property taxes 
the thatcher bossiness the fabled furies have become part of 
the national folklore a sort of joke in which she herself 
occasionally joins 
a fellow cabinet minister quipped that at a recent cabinet 
committee meeting which had to be cut short she quipped there is 
only time for me to lose my temper and get my own way 
what mrs thatcher a smalltown grocers daughter who has taken 
over the most traditionally maledominated party in britain does 
not find amusing are the continuing charges she lacks compassion 
recently she has taken to quoting the bible and religious 
thinkers in support of her freeenterprise wealthcreating 
philosophy 
political insiders say she both resents and is surprised by her 
personal unpopularity at gallups last sounding 45 percent of

with the election of francois duvalier a doctor who declared 
himself president for life in 1964 papa doc as he was called 
died in 1971 and was succeeded by his 19yearold son jeanclaude

vietnams ruling communist party in 
one of its biggest reported purges in 1 years of reform has 
expelled more than 500 members in one province alone for 
embezzlement and other violations 
the official party newspaper nhan dan or the people said they 
were purged in cao bang a strategic northern province on the tense 
border with vietnams archenemy china 
action was taken after people wrote letters complaining that the 
officials had violated party discipline and state law the paper 
said in a june 9 article a text of which was obtained today from a 
western embassy in bangkok 
the paper said that as of late may 506 party members were 
expelled in cao bang and disciplinary action was taken against 391 
others it didnt say when the purges began 
the party has mounted a purification campaign since a 
pragmatic leadership was chosen in december 1986 
the report said some of those expelled were directors or members 
of district standing committees and party committees who stole 
large amounts of state property 
one of those named was senior capt tran duc tuy deputy head of 
the cao bang city public security post who provided hideouts for 
criminals and illegally arrested people 
some diplomats say the party will chose do muoi 71 as the 
countrys new prime minister because he is known as a party 
disciplinarian who can halt the slide in morale and organization 
do muoi is the thirdranking member of the politburo the 
partys main policymaking body 
his apparent rise as the leading candidate has surprised foreign 
analysts who said the party favored vo van kiet 66 because of his 
reputation as a leading advocate of economic reform kiet the 
fourthranking politburo member has been acting premier since pham 
hung died in march 
a new premier is to be named during a regular national assembly 
session that opens wednesday in hanoi 
the party chief pragmatist nguyen van linh said in a tour of 
the provinces earlier this month that vietnams economy has 
collapsed because of irrational accounting methods by 
enterprises his remarks were carried by the domestic radio hanoi 
on june 14 
we have been too long calculating too low prices of equipment 
and materials and insufficient input compelling the state to make 
up for too big losses he said the situation of fake profits 
and true losses has prevailed the national economy has collapsed 
largely because of this situation

the bighorn county sheriffs department 
invented a new sport out of necessity bear roping 
sheriff ed whaley said his office received a report sunday 
afternoon that a young bear was prowling in some sugar beet fields 
about three miles north of hardin 
when whaley and deputies arrived the bear was about 25 feet up 
in a cottonwood tree beside state highway 47 drawing a crowd of 
onlookers who stopped traffic 
authorities estimated the male bear was 1 years old and weighed 
less than 100 pounds 
i think people were bothering the bear more than the bear was 
bothering people whaley said 
he said he thought the bear would go away if the people left 
but they kept coming 
whaley said he decided something had to be done 
deputy george roger shot the bear with a tranquilizer gun but 
the muscle relaxant wore off in five to 10 minutes and the bear 
stayed in the tree whaley said 
after four doses of the tranquilizer the bear finally crawled 
out of the tree and took off running toward a nearby wrecking yard 
whaley said deputy john shaw then used some cowboy skills 
roping the bear just like a cow 
we caught him on the first throw whaley said 
a deputy administered a sedative that put the bear to sleep 
officers loaded the animal into a horse trailer and drove into the 
pryor mountains with a state game warden when the warden let the 
bruin go the animal jumped out of the trailer

a patriarch of the crow indian tribe 
who once turned down the post of commissioner of the bureau of 
indian affairs has died at age 98 
robert summers yellowtail sr died saturday in his sleep at his 
cattle ranch near this southeastern montana reservation town 
for 75 years yellowtail was known as a modernday warrior who 
fought the tribes battles with words 
his rejection of the bia post came in the 1950s during the 
eisenhower administration 
i never did get along with the indian bureau even when i 
worked for it he said in explaining his decision to turn down 
the federal position 
born near lodge grass yellowtail graduated from riverside high 
school in california studied law and planned to become a lawyer 
but instead became involved in tribal affairs and politics 
the university of montana school of law eventually awarded him 
an honorary degree 
he served several times as tribal chairman and the bia 
appointed him superintendent of his reservation the first indian 
to hold the post he held the job 11 years 
yellowtail said his most memorable experience was a war of words 
in the us capitol on april 6 1917 
all the great chiefs of the crow tribe had gathered in 
washington to fight homesteading on their reservation site of 
custers last stand on the little bighorn montana sen thomas j 
walsh one of the most powerful men in congress wanted to open 
their reservation to white settlement 
the old chiefs did not speak english and the task of arguing 
their case before the senate indian affairs committee fell to 
yellowtail a 28yearold law student 
the gallery was jammed full of spectators yellowtail 
recalled years later they said i would have 18 minutes to answer 
senator walsh but i took 4 hours 
world war i interrupted his offthecuff speech a bell summoned 
the committee to join a special assembly in which president woodrow 
wilson asked congress to declare war on germany 
but the committee reconvened to hear yellowtails remarks and 
when he finished walsh eyed the comittee members and withdrew his 
proposal 
funeral services were tentatively scheduled for wednesday in 
lodge grass

californias consumer products 
liability law which was passed in a latenight deal and grants 
immunity to cigarette makers among others will soon get its first 
appellate court test 
the law negotiated at a posh eatery two blocks from the 
capitol was passed as part of a package of tort reform legislation 
approved last year 
supporters say it was designed to relieve court congestion by 
discouraging costly prolonged litigation like tobacco liability 
cases none of which has ever been won by a plaintiff in california 
critics call the law a consumer ripoff and say legislators have 
no business trying to discourage such suits 
one trial judge in sacramento county has dismissed a tobacco 
suit because of the law but trial judges in contra costa napa and 
alameda counties have disagreed and those cases will be heard in 
the next few months by a state appeals court in san francisco 
ultimately all sides agree the issue will have to be resolved 
by the state supreme court 
last weeks landmark decision in new jersey in which a jury for 
the first time found a cigarette manufacturer liable in the 
lungcancer death of a smoker renewed debate over the california 
law 
it grants immunity to manufacturers of common consumer products 
intended for personal consumption that are found to be inherently 
unsafe and are known to be unsafe by the ordinary consumer who 
consumes the product with the ordinary knowledge common to the 
community 
by specifically citing tobacco along with sugar castor oil 
alcohol and butter as an example of a common consumer product 
the law singles out tobacco companies 
californias legislation is unique in actually mentioning 
tobacco said richard daynard a product liability professor at 
northeastern universitys law school and chairman of the tobacco 
products liability project in boston a group that encourages 
product liability lawsuits a sellout i think it might be 
called 
almost as controversial as the law itself is the way in which it 
was developed in the hectic waning hours of the 1987 legislative 
session four of the states most powerful special interests 
insurance medicine business and law participated in the final 
negotiations and the deal was formalized on a napkin at frank 
fats a popular local restaurant 
consumer groups complain they were excluded from the final 
meeting 
ironically the tobacco industry maintained a relatively low 
profile in what was seen more as a battle between lawyers and 
insurance companies 
the legislature has made a decision that tobacco companies 
should be immune from the smoker and healthtype suits based on 
the statute said don miles a san francisco attorney 
representing the rj reynolds tobacco company in a number of 
liability lawsuits 
in any event the industry insists it is innocent no one has 
shown a causal relationship between smoking and any disease said 
jim fyock a spokesman for rj reynolds in winstonsalem nc 
representatives of the tobacco institute a washingtonbased 
trade association declined comment on the states tobacco 
liability law 
the tobacco institute has reported making campaign contributions 
of more than 103500 to california legislators and statewide 
officeholders by may 21 
the compromise containing the law dubbed the deal in the 
capitol was hastily considered during hearings in the final six 
hours of the legislative year 
supporters say subjecting the deliberately ambiguously worded 
document to the usual drawnout legislative hearing process would 
have destroyed the fragile agreement

poles ignored local and regional elections 
in the greatest numbers in the nations postwar communist history 
the government blamed low turnout on economic doldrums not an 
opposition boycott 
opposition politicians denounced sundays balloting as a farce 
and the banned solidarity free trade union movement urged poles not 
to vote antivote protests took place in the baltic port of gdansk 
and in nowa huta outside krakow scenes of two major strikes during 
last months labor unrest 
only about 56 percent of the 26 million eligible voters took 
part the staterun pap news agency reported early today the 
previous low turnout 673 percent occurred in last years 
referendum on economic and political reform 
the elections were the first under a new law that states voters 
in secret ballots should be able to choose from two or more 
officially sanctioned candidates for mosts seats 
solidarity leader lech walesa whose hometown is gdansk said 
the reforms were inconsequential and that the labor federation had 
urged supporters to boycott the polls 
in warsaws old city police permitted about 1000 young people 
to hold a rally that ridiculed the election 
everybody to the polls the youths chanted sarcastically 
laughing and holding up copies of the communist party newspaper 
trybuna ludu 
government spokesman jerzy urban dismissed the protests as minor 
and said most of the country was calm with people showing much 
interest in the new way of balloting 
urban told a news conference sunday afternoon that authorities 
were expecting a lower turnout than in the last council elections 
in 1984 when officials said about 75 percent of the voters 
participated 
the main reason for this low turnout are bad moods prompted 
by the economic situation the fact that there was a rent hike 
before the election and negative phenomena he said 
at stake in the elections were 109000 seats for councils of 
towns cities counties districts of larger cities and provinces 
there were an estimated 254000 candidates on the ballots 
urban said that in 4000 races members of different parties 
were competing against each other the first such interparty 
races in poland since 1947 he also said the 254000 candidates 
include 700 who could be considered independents or from the 
opposition 
however candidates must be approved by partydirected electoral 
colleges allowing the party to keep political control 
walesa said the socalled elections to peoples councils are 
being held with low interest of the society his comments were in 
a statement read over the telephone from gdansk by a spokesman 
it indicates clearly that the reforms proposed by the 
authorities are so insignificant that they do not solve the 
problems the country is facing and do not meet the aspirations of 
poles he said 
about 1500 people listened to alojzy szablewski leader at last 
months nineday occupation strike at the lenin shipyard denounce 
the elections after mass outside st brygidas church in gdansk 
police and demonstrators exchanged baton blows and rocks when 
about 300 protesters tried to approach a workers memorial near the 
shipyard after szablewskis speech according to an eyewitness who 
asked that his name not be used the witness said some people were 
injured and others detained but he had no exact figures a 
government spokesman said four people were detained 
in nowa huta police prevented about 2000 protesters from 
marching to the city center opposition spokesman jacek kuron said 
the marchers shouted if you want to starve go to vote and 
carried banners reading do not vote 
the demonstrators dispersed after about 20 minutes but at least 
a dozen people were detained kuron said 
the elections were the first since a nationwide referendum nov 
29 on political and economic reform in which the government failed 
to win the legally required majority of registered voters because 
of low turnout

iranian rebels today reported fierce 
fighting with ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis forces around the 
captured western border town of mehran 
hassan abdin a senior official of the iraqibased national 
liberation army said in a communique telexed to nicosia that the 
rebels plan to withdraw to new defensive positions 
he did not elaborate however the national liberation army 
force that stormed mehran on sunday was expected to follow the 
rebels usual pattern of withdrawing from iranian territory after 
inflicting as much damage as possible on khomeinis troops 
in previous operations the rebel force has rarely stayed inside 
iran for more than 48 hours before pulling back to bases inside 
iraq 
the national liberation army claimed a force of 22 brigades 
seized mehran and high ground to the north and south in an 
offensive launched saturday night along a 30mile front 
however iran denied mehran was seized and said the offensive 
was mounted by iraqi soldiers backed by chemical weapons iraq said 
none of its soldiers were involved in fighting at mehran 
the rebels said they had no exact figures on enemy casualties 
but estimated that hundreds were killed or wounded at least 1400 
were taken prisoner the rebels reported at least 48 dead among 
their own troops 
earlier today the national liberation army said it planned 
bigger offensives aimed at toppling the tehran regime 
mahmoud attai the rebel forces chief of staff said in a 
communique we are contemplating much larger offensives for which 
the capture of the city of mehran is considered only a prelude 
the communique was telexed to the associated press bureau in 
nicosia from the baghdad headquarters of the mujahedeen khalq or 
peoples holy warriors the main component in the national 
liberation army 
rebel officials refused to say how many of national liberation 
army troops were involved in the offensive but claimed it was 
their largest operation since the groups founding a year ago 
the rebels said their 30milewide offensive had punched as many 
as 12 miles into iran and engaged about 14000 government soldiers 
in a communique telexed today to nicosia from baghdad the 
rebels said they had blown up hundreds of bunkers and captured 
large amounts of heavy weapons and armored vehicles worth 1 
billion 
mehran largely destroyed in earlier battles between iranian and 
iraqi armies was filled sunday with cheering smiling flagwaving 
rebel troops including many women it has changed hands four times 
since the outbreak of the iraniraq war in september 1980 
an associated press reporter found no evidence in the town 
itself of a major battle no bodies no wounded no destroyed 
vehicles no fires the rebels said most of the fighting occurred 
in the foothills of mountains to the north and south where 
artillery had controlled the town the guerrillas said they 
captured this high ground too 
the rebels exulted over the victory calling the battle a major 
political and psychological blow to khomeinis fundamentalist 
regime 
the rebel group is built around activists who helped khomeini 
overthrow shah mohammad reza pahlevi it later was outlawed by 
khomeinis islamic fundamentalists and created a base in baghdad 
the group describes itself as islamic socialists seeking a secular 
regime in iran 
supported by iraq the national liberation army has been playing 
a small but growing role in the 8yearold iraniraq war western 
diplomats in baghdad put the number of the groups fighters at 
about 15000 
a report sunday by irans official islamic republic news agency 
monitored in nicosia said a large number of iranian moslem 
combatants were martyred and injured when iraqi warplanes 
chemically bombed the changuleh region east of mehran 
earlier sunday irna said iraqi warplanes bombed mehran with 
chemicals 
the agency said iranian units were dispatched to neutralize 
the chemical weapons and that hundreds of iraqis were killed in 
fighting near the town it also reported iranian warplanes bombed 
iraqi positions in the mehran area

a 33yearold israeli farmer was bludgeoned to 
death at a collective farm near the occupied west bank and 
authorities launched a search for palestinian suspects a police 
spokesman said today 
prime minister yitzhak shamir speaking on israel radio vowed 
his government would make an appropriate response in due 
course to the killing 
eighteen arab suspects were detained the radio said 
dozens of officers who rushed to the scene after the body was 
found today sealed off the entrances to several neighboring arab 
villages etti elinsky a spokeswoman at the collective farm said 
in a telephone interview 
also today the army closed three elementary and junior high 
schools in the occupied gaza strip bringing to eight the number of 
schools closed since saturday arab reports said 
the closures aim to end participation by palestinian youths in 
the 6month uprising in the territories israel seized in the 1967 
middle east war 
on sunday israeli troops shot and wounded a 20yearold 
palestinian during a clash in the west bank village of salim the 
incident followed a weekend of sporadic clashes in which two 
palestinians were killed and 20 wounded 
the farmers slaying would be the fourth death of an israeli 
since the uprising began dec 8 at least 210 palestinians have 
died in the rebellion most by israeli gunfire according to un 
figures 
mrs elinsky said the victim eli cohen was found at the 
collective farm lying near his grape vines with a hole in his head 
apparently caused by a beating with a heavy steel object 
the farm is about 25 miles south of jerusalem and borders three 
arab villages near the west bank city of hebron 
police spokesman rafi levy said police suspected an arab was 
responsible for the killing but declined to comment further 
mrs elinsky said cohen never returned home after leaving to 
spray his grape vines with insecticide sunday evening she said he 
was found this morning by another farmer 
she said arabs were also suspected of committing several acts of 
vandalism on the farm in the last four months in one incident 
farmers found a black green red and white palestinian flag in a 
field strewn with uprooted vegetables mrs elinsky said 
on saturday 160 grape vines were destroyed by fire apparently 
by arsonists she added 
israelis have accused palestinian arsonists of a rash of fires 
that have destroyed tens of thousands of acres in the past few 
weeks 
there was a systematic policy of educating youths to violent 
activities an army spokesman said adding that military 
officials found inflammatory and antisemitic material in two 
raids on the center 
also today israeli prison spokesman johnny tester said a 
palestinian prisoner from the gaza strip was freed on bail after 
giving birth to a boy friday the jerusalem post said it was the 
first time a security prisoner had ever been released on bail 
the woman aisheh said odeh al kurd 28 from the town of rafah 
was detained about two months ago on suspicion of taking part in an 
attempted bombing in a tel aviv suburb as well as in incidents in 
the gaza strip the post said 
in gaza israeli soldiers closed two of gaza citys largest 
outdoor marketplaces this morning and ordered merchants to reopen 
in the afternoon 
the measure which affected more than 100 fruit vegetable and 
meat stands appeared aimed at breaking the obedience of 
palestinian merchants to underground uprising leaders who have 
ordered stores shut in the afternoons 
also in gaza city today dozens of palestinians staged a sitin 
in the red cross building in solidarity with arab children involved 
in the uprising the twohour sitin was in keeping with the latest 
underground leaflet which called for a day to honor palestinian 
children martyrs

refused it

distress she countersued snyder and the homeowners association for 
200000 and her old parking place 
broward circuit judge daniel m futch ruled in march 1987 that 
snyder could keep no 8 no damages were granted 
mrs maciborka wanted a clarification and circuit judge richard

a strong earthquake shook the central 
philippine island of mindoro before dawn today injuring at least 
four people and damaging many buildings officials and witnesses 
said 
a local radio station said a 63yearold male resident of the 
mindoro town of san jose apparently the hardesthit area suffered 
a heart attack and died moments after the 421 am earthquake 
seismologists in manila 160 miles north of the affected area 
said the tremor measured 54 on the richter scale and was followed 
by repeated aftershocks 
initial radio reports said the earthquake caused some 
fatalities but san joses private radio station dzym and the 
philippine national red cross said later the only confirmed 
casualties were a woman and three children who were injured when a 
wall collapsed 
the wife of a dzym station technician and the couples three 
children were pinned by a bedroom wall that fell on them dzym 
announcer nathan cruz told the associated press in a 
radiotelephone interview all four were taken to a hospital 
cruz said the earthquake caused a fissure on the towns 
outskirts near the coast and that the sea level rose by at least 
five feet shortly after the temblor the water quickly receded he 
said 
remedios eraham head of the red cross chapter in san jose said 
she and other relief officers surveyed damage to the town before 
flying to manila on unrelated business 
this was the first time people there can remember ever feeling 
an earthquake and they are really scared mrs eraham said 
she said no building collapsed in san jose although many 
concrete walls were badly cracked 
mrs eraham said she had received no report of damage or 
casualties in other mindoro towns 
i would presume there are no other serious injuries otherwise 
my staff would have already reported it by radio she said there 
are no telephone connections from manila to the island 
raymundo punongbayan director of the philippine institute of 
volcanology and seismology said the center of the earthquake was 
about 12 miles beneath the sea at a point some 37 miles southwest 
of san jose he said the tremor registered 54 on the richter scale 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater a quake of magnitude 5 can cause 
considerable damage in populated areas

four british lawmakers arrived in tehran 
today on a private mission to improve britains relations with 
iran the official islamic republic news agency reported 
the iranian agency monitored in nicosia said officials of 
irans foreign ministry and parliament met the british 
parliamentarians at tehrans airport 
relations between tehran and london and issues of mutual 
interest will be among topics discussed irna said it said the 
british government has expressed interest in solving financial 
disputes between the two countries and later improving 
tehranlondon ties 
irna said the britons were scheduled to hold talks with senior 
iranian officials during their threeday visit it gave no details 
the british legislators said before leaving london that they 
hoped to meet with irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
he is the most powerful figure in the country after ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
irna indicated that britains release last month of abdullah 
nouripour an iranian who had been held on charges of trying to 
cause an explosion had spurred efforts to improve relations it 
said nouripour returned to tehran on may 19 
the british lawmakers are cyril townsend and robert hicks of 
britains governing conservative party thomas clarke of the 
opposition labor party and lord tordoff of the liberal social 
democrats their trip was arranged by archbishop of canterbury 
robert runcie 
townsend said before leaving london we think the climate has 
been improving in recent weeks and we like to think that four 
members of parliament going to tehran can nudge that progress 
along 
the lawmakers cautioned against raising hopes that their visit 
could lead to the release of british hostages held in lebanon by 
proiranian shiite moslems 
clarke said the group was not taking any messages from the 
hostages families we are fully aware of how strongly they feel 
and thats one of the reasons it would be quite improper for us to 
build up peoples hopes 
three britons are among the 18 foreigners including nine 
americans missing after being kidnapped in lebanon the hostage 
held longest is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
britains relations with tehran have been strained since 
khomeinis 1979 islamic revolution toppled shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi the iranians have long considered britain the secondmost 
hostile western nation next to the united states 
relations deteriorated last year when a british diplomat was 
kidnapped in tehran and an iranian diplomat was arrested in england 
for shoplifting both countries later expelled diplomats 
hopes that relations could improve increased june 10 when 
britain and iran agreed to compensate each other for damage 
inflicted on their embassies in violence several years ago in 
tehran and london 
the iranians alarmed at their growing isolation during their 
nearly 8yearold war with iraq have been making clear efforts to 
patch up ties with western european nations apparently hoping to 
draw them away from alignment with the united states 
france restored relations with iran last week after an 11month 
break and west germany has been discussing bolstering its 
relations with tehran 
the french move came after french hostages held in lebanon were 
freed

a black democrat is frequently mentioned as 
the leading candidate for governor next year now republicans have 
tried to steal some of the oppositions thunder by nominating a 
black as their candidate for the senate 
lt gov l douglas wilder is a moderate democrat favored 
despite his unannounced status to win the partys nomination for 
governor next year if elected he would become americas first 
black governor since reconstruction 
maurice a dawkins the republicans us senate nominee is a 
conservative supporter of pat robertson a former kennedyjohnson 
democrat who left the party during the liberal mcgovern period 
their fortunes are partly a product of circumstance said larry 
sabato a university of virginia political scientist 
the states voting age population is 16 percent black large 
enough to be courted but not large enough for there to be racial 
polarization sabato said 
the gop decided to try to woo blacks away from democrats by 
nominating dawkins the first black republican to run for congress 
in virginia since reconstruction dawkins is best known for his 
unsuccessful bid for the partys lieutenant gubenatorial nomination 
in 1985 in an election eventually won by wilder 
its a natural reaction to get to the massive black vote for 
democrats sabato said of dawkins senate nomination it makes 
it very difficult for the republicans to win when they have to get 
an overwhelming white vote they need to break down this barrier 
dawkins a 67yearold retired minister who works as a lobbyist 
in washington was nominated june 11 in a threeway contest 
his rousing nomination speech which mixed praise for god with 
criticism of democratic flagbearer charles s robb won the 
support of a large bloc of uncommitted delegates 
wilder a lawyer and former state senator from richmond said 
the nomination seemed to be orchestrated to arrive at a point and 
that point is other than winning 
wilder said the senate race probably will result in an 
exceedingly convincing victory for robb a former governor who 
was unopposed for the democratic nomination and is heavily favored 
to win in november 
political observers expect sen paul trible a republican who is 
retiring from the senate will run for governor although he has 
not declared his candidacy marshall coleman a former attorney 
general has said he will run although he has not formally declared 
sabato agreed with wilder that the dawkins campaign is unlikely 
to prevail or to pull any significant black support from robb he 
said the dawkins nominations chief effect was to steal some of the 
thunder from the expected nomination of wilder for governor 
blacks are not simply black he said theyre also 
democrats they have the strongest party identification of any 
group in the electorate 
however at least one prominent black democrat says she will 
vote for dawkins instead of robb 
mary b cox of richmond coordinator of jesse jacksons virginia 
campaign led a revolt against robb by about 60 jackson dissidents 
at the state democratic convention two weeks ago 
robb refused to endorse jackson after jackson won the states 
super tuesday primary and suggested jackson should play an 
inspirational role rather than make policy in a democratic 
administration 
the republicans gave us a nice receptacle to give our vote 
away ms cox said 
but over the weekend ms cox said she could not vote for 
dawkins because he supported south africanbacked rebels fighting 
angolas communist government she said jonas savimbis rebel group 
is sponsored by the illegal white racist regime of south africa 
she said she knew dawkins was conservative but had no idea he 
was this conservative 
steve haner director of the gop caucus in the state general 
assembly said ms coxs decision shows she understands what one 
of maurices messages is going to be that for years the democrats 
have taken advantage of the black vote

the supreme court in an important new test of 
affirmative action today agreed to study a dispute over a 
birmingham ala plan for promoting more black firefighters 
the justices said they will study efforts by city officials and 
others to kill a challenge by white firefighters who say the plan 
makes them victims of reverse discrimination 
the case is likely to provide one of the first indications of 
how the courts newest member justice anthony m kennedy will 
vote on affirmative action disputes he succeeded retired justice 
lewis f powell for years a pivotal figure in the courts 
consideration of programs giving preferential treatment to 
minorities and women 
a decision in the birmingham case is expected sometime in 1989 
at issue is whether and under what conditions a courtapproved 
agreement between public officials and minority groups may be 
challenged by employees who say the plan victimizes them 
the case began in 1974 when birmingham officials and the 
jefferson county personnel board were sued by the national 
association for the advancement of colored people and individuals 
who charged them with discriminating against blacks in hiring and 
promotion 
eventually both sides reached agreement on an extensive plan 
that includes longterm and interim annual goals for hiring blacks 
as firefighters and promoting blacks to higher ranks 
the birmingham firefighters association representing most of 
the citys firefighters objected that the agreement would hurt its 
members but the associations opposition to the plan was rejected 
by a federal judge who in 1981 issued consent drecrees approving 
the plan 
there were 453 city firefighters at the time including 42 
blacks none of the city fire departments 140 lieutenants 
captains or battalion chiefs were black but nearly half the 
workers in birminghams civilian labor force were black 
after the firefighters association challenge was rejected seven 
white male firefighters sued the city and the county personnel 
board charging reverse discrimination they said less qualified 
blacks would be given promotions over them 
a federal judge ruled that the white firefighters were bound by 
the court consent decrees authorizing the affirmative action plan 
the judge dismissed the white firefighters suit 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals last december 
reinstated it the policy of encouraging voluntary affirmative 
action plans must yield to the policy against requiring third 
parties to submit to bargains in which their interests were either 
ignored or sacrificed the appeals court said 
it noted that the plan did not place a great burden on the city 
since it was called upon only to reallocate promotions and not 
create new jobs 
in real terms the relief contemplated by the decrees was to 
come not from the hands of the city but from the hands of the 
employees who would have otherwise received the promotions the 
appeals court said 
it ordered a trial judge to decide whether the white 
firefighters were discriminated against unlawfully saying that the 
earlier consent decrees authorizing the affirmative action plan do 
not insulate it from their lawsuit 
the consent decrees give the plan no more legitimacy than any 
other voluntary program of racial preferences would have the 
appeals court said 
it added that the affirmative action plan must be analyzed with 
heightened scrutiny meaning city officials must have a 
compelling reason to impose a policy that disadvantages whites 
the appeals court said such analysis is required by a recent 
supreme court ruling that upheld the promotion of a woman over a 
marginally more qualified man generally the high court has 
required heightened scrutiny only when courts study government 
programs that allegedly disadvantage minorities 
the supreme court last january split 44 in upholding a new 
york city affirmative action plan for promoting more blacks and 
hispanics in the city police department that plan was challenged 
unsuccessfully by white officers 
because of the tie vote the justices were unable to decide 
issues similar to those raised in the birmingham case 
the reagan administration supports the 11th circuit court ruling 
that permits the white firefighters to challenge the birmingham 
plan nonetheless administration lawyers urged the supreme court 
to study the case to settle the issue of whether whites should be 
allowed to sue in such instances 
birmingham city officials led by mayor richard arrington who is 
black were joined by the jefferson county personnel board and 
black firefighters in urging the high court to overturn the 11th 
circuit court ruling 
city officials said the appeals court ruling threatens to reopen 
old wounds 
the reverse discrimination litigation has cost the city 
substantial time and expense and has reawakened racial division 
and animosity that the city has worked to put behind it the 
officials said 
the cases are martin vs wilks 871614 personnel board of 
jefferson county vs wilks 871639 and arrington vs wilks

the supreme court today refused to order 
tennessee to help pay for continuing efforts to racially 
desegregate nashville area public schools 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that sheilded the 
state from making such expenditures 
the controversy has its roots in a 1955 lawsuit over racial 
segregation in nashville schools 
until the supreme courts landmark 1954 decision outlawing 
racial segregation in public schools tennessee law barred black 
and white children from attending the same schools 
in 1960 the metropolitan county board of education of nashville 
and davidson county was substituted as a defendant in the case 
in 1981 the local school board asked a federal judge to require 
tennessee to pay the full cost of implementing courtordered 
desegregation remedies which include extensive busing 
us district judge thomas a wiseman jr ruled in 1985 that 
forcing tennessee to pay for costs already sustained before the 
school board filed its complaint in 1981 would violate the 
constitutions 11th amendment giving states broad protections 
against being sued 
but wiseman ruled that the 11th amendment does not shield the 
state from helping pay for continuing desegregation efforts 
he ordered tennessee officials to assume 60 percent of the 
costs directly attributable to metros desegregation program from 
and after march 16 1981 
tennessee appealed arguing that it should not have to pay 
anything the local school district also appealed contending that 
the state should have to pay all desegregation costs 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled for the state last 
dec 30 
the federal courts would not be justified in shifting any of 
the costs in question from metro the local school district to the 
state of tennessee the appeals court said 
the supreme court in 1977 ruled that michigan could be forced to 
help pay the costs of desegregating detroits public schools 
but the 6th circuit court said there is a difference between the 
detroit case and the nashville case 
the monetary relief granted in the detroit case was merely 
ancilliary to other affirmative relief the appeals court said 
and the monetary relief granted here is not 
it noted that michigan officials had been ordered to help put 
some desegregation programs into effect not merely pay for 
programs undertaken by the detroit school authorities 
the appeals court said tennessees duty to eliminate the 
vestiges of past segregation in education was discharged long 
before metro filed its complaint against the state 
the case is metropolitan county board vs tennessee 871774

the supreme court today refused to free some 
states from having to pay for a hypnosis expert when a penniless 
criminal defendant challenges a prosecution witnesss hypnotically 
enhanced testimony 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by missouri 
prosecutors seeking to reinstate the rape conviction of a man who 
was identified by the victim after she was hypnotized 
leatrice little was convicted of rape and sentenced to 25 years 
in prison for attacking a woman in her cape girardeau apartment 
aug 13 1980 he has since been freed on parole 
the victim said she saw the face of her assailant briefly when 
a blouse he had taken from her closet and used to cover his face 
slipped for at least a few seconds 
after police hynotized the victim she identified little from a 
group of photographs at a subsequent police lineup and again at 
the trial she identified little as her attacker 
little said he was too poor to pay an expert to challenge the 
reliability of the hypnotically enhanced testimony he said an 
expert might show that the victim had been given improper 
suggestions under hypnosis 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last december ruled that 
little was denied a fair trial and it overturned his conviction 
the denial of a stateprovided expert on hypnosis to assist 
this indigent defendant rendered the trial fundamentally unfair and 
requires that the conviction be set aside the appeals court said 
its ruling was binding on all courts in missouri arkansas 
iowa minnesota nebraska north dakota and south dakota 
but hypnotically enhanced testimony was ruled inadmissible in 
missouri courts some time after little was convicted 
the appeals court noted that the supreme court last year ruled 
that all hypnotically enhanced testimony offered by a criminal 
defendant may not be excluded automatically but that ruling did 
not deal with hypnotically enhanced testimony by prosecution 
witnesses 
the appeals court said if such methods for obtaining testimony 
are to be used poor defendants should not be placed at a 
disadvantage 
the appeals court noted that the supreme court in 1985 ruled 
that states must pay for psychiatric experts for a defendant in a 
capital trial when the defendants sanity is a significant issue 
there is no principled way to distinguish between psychiatric 
and nonpsychiatric experts the appeals court said the 
question in each case must be not what field of science or expert 
knowledge is involved but rather how important the scientific 
issue is in the case and how much help a defense expert could have 
given 
the appeals court said little demonstrated that an expert in 
hypnosis would have substantially aided his defense 
the case is armontrout vs little 871532

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether indian tribes may control through tribal zoning laws the 
use of land owned by nonindians within a reservations boundaries 
the justices in a case of significance to any state in which a 
reservation is located said they will resolve a dispute involving 
the yakima indian reservation in washington state 
a federal appeals court ruled last sept 21 that the 
confederated tribes and bands of the yakima indian nation has a 
legitimate interest in regulating and may zone socalled fee 
land located on its reservation but owned by individuals most of 
them not tribal members 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said the tribes interest 
in regulating that land must be balanced against the interests of 
yakima county and the federal government 
the yakima reservation encompasses 13 million acres of land 
most of it within yakima county about 5000 tribal members and 
about 20000 nonmembers live within the reservations boundaries 
about 800000 acres including some 740000 in yakima county 
fall within the reservations closed area in which the tribes 
zoning ordinance allows no permanent structures 
philip brendale who owns 160 acres of land within the 
reservations closed area was barred by the ordinance from selling 
his land for residential development 
and stanley wilkinson who owns about 100 acres just within the 
reservations northern boundary was barred by the ordinance from 
subdividing a portion of his land 
neither man is a member of the yakima tribe they along with 
yakima county officials contend that the tribe lacks the legal 
authority to control the use of their land 
brendale wilkinson and yakima county filed separate appeals 
from the 9th circuit courts ruling 
the countys lawyers argued that the appeals court ruling at 
least in its effect on the reservations open area conflicts 
with past supreme court rulings limiting tribal authority over 
nonindians 
the countys appeal cited a 1978 decision in which the justices 
ruled that indian tribes do not have the authority to prosecute 
nonindians for crimes committed on reservations 
the appeal also relied on a 1981 decision in which the high 
court ruled that montana and not an indian tribe had the 
authority to regulate the fishing and hunting of nonindians on the 
tribes reservation 
the appeals acted on today seeking to limit tribal control of 
land use were supported in friendofthecourt briefs 
submitted by the national association of counties and seven states 
the states are washington arizona nevada new mexico south 
dakota utah and wyoming 
the case cases are brendale vs confederated tribes 871622 
wilkinson vs confederated tribes 871697 and yakima county vs 
confederated tribes 871711

prison inmates may sue in federal courts the 
doctors who treated them behind bars the supreme court ruled 
unanimously today 
the court reinstating a north carolina inmates lawsuit said 
prison doctors both government employees and providers of medical 
services under contract may be sued under a muchused civil 
rights law 
the decision could make other professionals doing government 
work easier targets for civil rights lawsuits as well 
some states and municipalities have begun to experiment with 
privately run prisons and jails 
the privitization movement was sparked in part by a desire 
to shield governments from legal liability todays decision could 
become an obstacle to that movement 
at issue in the case decided today was whether such professional 
services are rendered under color of state law a necessary 
ingredient to sustain a civil rights lawsuit 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said they are 
blackmun added defendants are not removed from the purview of 
the civil rights law because they are professionals acting in 
accordance with professional discretion and judgment 
quincy west filed a 6 million federal lawsuit against dr 
samuel atkins after being treated for a basketball injury in 1983 
west tore the achilles tendon in his left leg while playing at 
the odom correctional center in jackson nc he was treated by 
atkins at the north carolina central prison hospital in raleigh 
atkins who maintains a private practice in raleigh provides 
medical services to inmates under a contract with the state 
he had decided against surgery in wests case and instead set 
the leg in a cast and prescribed medicine 
wests lawsuit contended that atkins through his negligence 
and deliberate indifference has denied west proper and 
reasonable medical treatment 
west sought 1 million in compensatory damages and 5 million in 
punitive damages 
wests suit was dismissed and the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals upheld the dismissal 
the appeals court ruled that a private doctor like atkins had 
not acted under color of state law in providing treatment for 
west and therefore could not be sued under the muchused civil 
rights law west had invoked 
the appeals court added a professional when acting within 
the bounds of traditional professional discretion and judgment 
does not act under color of state law even where the 
professional is a fulltime employee of the state 
that ruling appeared to apply to doctors lawyers engineers 
architects and other professionals holding government jobs 
the supreme court reversed the appeals court ruling saying 
atkins delivery of medical treatment to west was state action 
fairly attributable to the state and atkins therefore acted 
under color of state law 
the case is west vs atkins 875096

four women stand ready to break the sex 
barrier at the exclusive cosmos club in the nations capital which 
has scrapped its 110yearold maleonly policy 
the membership voted overwhelmingly over the weekend to begin 
allowing women to join the club which was founded by geologist 
john wesley powell in 1878 and has boasted supreme court justices 
nobel and pulitzer prizewinners and other notables as members 
tedson j meyers the clubs president told a news conference 
saturday that the vote was almost unanimous about 98 percent 
as best as the eye can tell to begin accepting women for 
nomination to membership 
he said that shortly after the vote the names of four women 
were submitted a microbiologist a public servant a consumer 
advocate and a journalist meyers declined to identify any of the 
nominees 
there will be the clubs regular 60day posting period and 
nomination review process he said adding on that basis we 
look forward with pleasure to having women members in the cosmos 
club this fall 
the vote came two days before the supreme court broadening the 
power of cities and states to ban discrimination against women and 
minorities said today that new york city could bar such 
discrimination in clubs with more than 400 members 
meyers said there were only 14 votes against changing the bylaws 
to admit women among the nearly 800 members attending the meeting 
at the clubs ornate mansion on washingtons embassy row 
we stopped counting yes votes when we got to 700 he said 
a twothirds majority of members present at the meeting was 
required 
we the officers are amazed surprised and delighted by the 
outcome said meyers a lawyer and former member of the city 
council of washington we knew there was a changing mood among 
the membership but did not know it would be so overwhelming 
in fact the cosmos club broke two traditions on saturday in 
addition to voting to accept women as members it was also the 
first time the club had held a news conference or issued a public 
statement 
proposals to admit women to the club twice were voted down in 
1973 and 1975 those defeated proposals had been presented in 
petitions by club members while the one that was approved saturday 
came from the clubs leadership 
last fall the washington human rights office ruled that there 
is probable cause to believe that the clubs menonly policy 
violated the citys antidiscrimination law the office was ready 
to order public hearings on the case which could have resulted in 
the loss of all city licenses and permits if the allmale policy 
had continued 
meyers said although the legal issues confronting the club may 
have been a catalyst the great majority of members do not believe 
that the membership policy of this club is a legal issue rather 
the issues are ethical and moral they related to social changes 
members individually could accept or ignore as they prefer 
the club has about 350 membership vacancies in its limits of 
2500 resident and nonresident categories the club has between 
3000 and 3100 members including those with senior and emeritus 
status 
meyers said the club has set no goal for the number of female 
members the club will admit we look forward anxiously to having 
many women he said 
until 1973 women guests were required to enter the club through 
a side door and remained in the ladies lounge until escorted 
into a firstfloor dining room but for more than a decade nearly 
all club facilities have been open to wives and widows of members 
as well as unescorted female guests 
women were not allowed in the secondfloor members dining room 
however except on thursday and friday evenings and weekends 
the club which was started principally by white protestants 
has included catholics and jews for many years it first admitted 
blacks in 1962 and now has about three to four dozen black 
members according to the washington post although no count by 
race is maintained

the communist party daily today 
charged that 32 western activists expelled from czechoslovakia 
abused their rights as tourists by pursuing political goals 
the foreign activists arrived in czechoslovakia on tourist 
visas but the aim of their trip was not the beauties of 
prague rude pravo said they were from 16 countries and were 
attending an unofficial eastwest seminar on human rights and peace 
seminar participants said the expulsions came after police 
disrupted meetings friday and saturday detained czechoslovak 
participants confiscated materials prepared for the seminar and 
warned westerners not to continue the seminar 
the seminar had been organized by the czechoslovak human rights 
group charter 77 and the newly established czechoslovak independent 
peace association 
we gladly open our home to all honest tourists coming to us 
with sincere tourist interests but we can show the door to 
provocateurs abusing international tourism for political aims 
rude pravo said 
as facts told by the uninvited tourists show both emigre 
centers in western europe and other international reactionary 
circles which aim mainly at slanders were interested in 
holding the gathering the article said it appeared under the 
headline visitors with codes 
a protest statement drafted by western participants and signed 
also by czechoslovak activists said the activities of the 
czechoslovak government fly in the face of recent east bloc 
promises for democratic reform 
at a news conference in vienna on sunday four americans who 
attended the seminar said police arrested 20 eastern european 
conference participants 
we are dismayed and deeply concerned at the arrest of 19 
czechoslovakians and one hungarian and the police state tactics of 
the czechoslovakian government the protest statement said 
judith hempfling from amherst mass told reporters in vienna 
after returning from prague that the statement was read to about 30 
people who had gathered at the czech dissident saturday morning 
she said the petition was circulated for signatures as police 
came upstairs 
rob leavitt of the massachusettsbased institute for defense and 
disarmament studies said police put the foreigners in police vans 
and drove them to pragues central police station 
he said the foreigners were kept for about five hours in a 
waiting room and were then told they had five hours to leave the 
country 
the other americans at the news conference were joanne landy of 
the new yorkbased campaign for peace and democracy eastwest

the supreme court today placed new limits on 
the power of states to impose residency requirements that restrict 
the number of lawyers licensed to practice within their borders 
the justices voting 72 barred virginia officials from 
reinstating a residency requirement successfully challenged by a 
lawyer living in neighboring maryland 
the issue is whether the state has burdened the right to 
practice law a privilege protected by the constitution by 
discriminating among otherwise equally qualified applicants solely 
on the basis of citizenship or residency said justice anthony m 
kennedy for the court we conclude it has 
the court struck down a virginia rule that allowed lawyers 
living in the state to practice there without passing the 
virginia licensing examination if they were licensed for at least 
five years in another state that gives virginialicensed lawyers 
the same privilege outofstate residents were denied the same 
treatment 
the virginia rule enforced by that states supreme court was 
challenged by myrna e friedman 
ms friedman licensed to practice law in illinois since 1977 
and in the district of columbia since 1980 was living in 
arlington va when she went to work as a lawyer with erc 
international inc in vienna va in 1986 
after getting married she moved to her husbands home in nearby 
cheverly md but continued to work in virginia 
ms friedman sought admission to the virginia bar without having 
to take that states bar exam 
the supreme court said today that virginias residency rule 
violates the constitutions privileges and immunities clause the 
provision says the citizens of each state shall be entitled to 
all privileges and immunities of citizens in the severl states 
the justices said the virginia rule violates the clause by 
favoring instate residents with the same general qualifications as 
lawyers living outside the state 
kennedy said the state failed to provide adequate reasons to 
justify such discrimination 
he said the question is whether lawyers who are admitted in 
other states and seek admission in virginia are less likely to 
respect the bar and further its interests solely because they are 
nonresidents we cannot say this is the case 
the court upheld a ruling by the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals which said virginias rule is a form of economic 
protectionism 
virginia officials said at least six other states have similar 
residency rules they are illinois indiana iowa ohio rhode 
island and wyoming 
todays ruling is in line with a 1985 high court decision that 
said states generally may not require lawyers to be residents to 
practice within their borders the 1985 ruling threw out a new 
hampshire residency rule challenged by a lawyer who lived in 
neighboring vermont and had passed the new hamshpire licensing exam 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice antontin scalia 
dissented today 
the case is virginia supreme court vs friedman 87399

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that unraveled years of litigation in a stillpending lawsuit to 
racially desegregate alabamas colleges and universities 
the court without comment refused to disturb a ruling that the 
federal judge who found vestiges of segregation in the states 
schools of higher education should not have presided over the case 
us district judge uw clemon the first black federal trial 
judge in alabama ruled in 1985 that authorities would have to take 
steps to racially integrate such staterun schools as auburn 
university the university of alabama and troy state 
the reagan administration had sued the states higher education 
system for racial discrimination in 1983 the first such claim by 
the administration against a state college system 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled last oct 6 that 
clemon should have disqualified himself from the case the appeals 
court said that clemon as a former state legislator actively 
participated in the very events and shaped the very facts that are 
at issue in this suit 
clemon once served as chairman of the state senate rules 
committee in that role the appeals court said he played a 
critical role in the confirmation of those individuals nominated 
for positions on the board of trustees of the defendant 
institutions 
the appeals court however rejected arguments that clemon 
should have disqualified himself because of his past civil rights 
activity and because his children may some day attend some of the 
schools involved 
to disqualify minority judges from major civil rights 
lititgation solely because of their minority status is 
intolerable the 11th circuit court said 
clemons 1985 ruling against the state school officials followed 
15 months of pretrial proceedings and a 22day trial over which he 
presided 
the 11th circuits ruling in october sent the case back for a 
new trial before another federal judge 
the appeal acted on today was filed by alabama state university 
and alabama aampm university two predominantly black schools whose 
officials say have had their integration attempts thwarted by 
official state policies and individuals 
justice department lawyers although contending that clemons 
disqualification by the 11th circuit court was wrong urged the 
high court to reject the appeal 
the question is inherently factbound and nonrecurring 
they said adding that the government will continue adequately to 
represent the students and faculty of the alabama schools the 
persons who would truly benefit from the desegregation of the 
alabama system of higher education 
the case is board of trustees vs auburn university 871200

lethal doses of potassium saying the prosecutors had done no more 
than prove she was present when the patients died 
after listening for five weeks to the prosecutions case prince

reach hopelessly exceeded its grasp 
prosecutors had alleged that jane bolding 30 an intensive care

defense attorneys engaged in extensive crossexamination of the 
states witnesses but did not call any witnesses 
when the prosecution rested its case last week boldings 
attorney asked casula to dismiss the charges 
casula who has been hearing the case without a jury recessed 
the trial wednesday to study defense arguments that the 
prosecutions key piece of evidence a study indicating a high 
incidence of cardiac arrest during boldings shift failed to 
prove the nurse was responsible for the deaths 
casula said today the prosecutors had shown no connection 
whatsoever between the defendant and any unlawful act and said 
defense attorneys had successfully argued that numerous other 
medical factors could have been responsible for the cardiac arrests 
as casula read his ruling bolding sat upright without 
expression on her face after the judge finished she broke into a 
wide grin and hugged each of her three attorneys blinking back 
tears 
the strongest aspect of assistant states attorney jay creechs 
case had been a study by the federal centers for disease control 
that showed bolding was the primary nurse on duty when 57 heart 
attacks occurred the next highest number for any nurse was five 
dr jeffery j sacks who wrote the study testified that 
intensive care patients at prince georges hospital center had 88 
cardiac arrests on shifts bolding from between january 1984 to 
march 1985 the period that was examined 
health statistics indicated that only 31 seizures should have 
occurred and sacks testified that the chances of bolding not being 
responsible for the unusually high number were about one in 100 
trillion 
however sacks also stressed under cross examination that his 
study could not be used to address intent to commit a crime and 
casula ultimately ruled that using the study to convict bolding 
would set a dangerous legal precedent 
it would create a mathematical quagmire if circumstantial 
evidence from the statistical study had been used to reach a guilty 
verdict casula said 
simply put the evidence failed to supply the missing link 
that would connect the defendant with the alleged criminal act 
no one testified to seeing bolding inject any patients with the 
potassium chloride and no cause of death for any of the three 
murder victims was ever established although postmortem 
examinations showed that each had higher than normal potassium 
levels

the supreme court today reinforced the power 
of federal judges to decide where the trials of lawsuits will be 
held when the opposing sides are from different states 
by a vote of 81 the justices said a suit by the stewart 
organization of birmingham ala against the ricoh corp a 
leading copy machine maker with headquarters in west caldwell 
nj may be tried in federal court in new york city 
the stewart company had a contract with ricoh to sell its copy 
machines in central alabama it accused ricoh in a 1984 federal 
lawsuit of breaching the contract and other violations 
the contract between the two companies contained a clause that 
said any such dispute between them must be tried in federal court 
in new york city where ricoh conducts much of its corporate 
activities 
the stewart firm sued in federal court in alabama and a judge 
relying on state law ruled that the case should be tried in 
alabama 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals based in atlanta 
ga overturned the judges ruling and transferred the case to 
federal court in new york city the appeals court said federal law 
rather than alabama law takes precedence 
the supreme court agreed that federal judges may disregard state 
laws in such instances and may assign cases to whatever locations 
are best suited to the convenience of the opposing sides and 
witnesses in the interest of justice 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said the 
federal law properly leaves it up to judges to decide where cases 
will be tried 
but the ruling leaves open the possibility that the case still 
could be tried in alabama if lower courts decide that would be the 
most convenient forum 
justice antonin scalia dissented 
the case is stewart organization vs ricoh corp 861908

the chlorine that bleaches clothes and 
cleans swimming pools also can be deadly and was used as a weapon 
in world war i 
up to 30000 people were evacuated from their homes over the 
weekend because of dangerous fumes from three fires at a plant that 
makes chloride pellets for disinfecting swimming pools 
the first fire started friday morning and the last was 
extinguished sunday morning at the advanced laboratories plant 
unlike household bleach which is only 8 percent to 10 percent 
chlorine the powder used at the plant to make pellets was 75 
percent to 85 percent chlorine said john j higgins regional 
director of the state department of environmental quality 
engineering 
pellets of chlorine compounds contain 750000 parts per million 
but in a swimming pool they dilute to 1 to 3 parts per million 
parts of water 
undiluted however such high concentration of chlorine along 
with binders and fillers form nitrogen gas and hydrochloric acid 
when mixed with water higgins said hydrochloric acid is 
corrosive burning skin and eyes and at worst causing respiratory 
failure nitrogen gas is harmless but officials were concerned 
that pockets of the gases would build up under pressure 
if you put a teaspoon of chlorine in a swimming pool theres 
no reaction but put a teaspoon of water in a barrel of chlorine 
and youre going to get an explosion said fire commissioner 
darnell williams 
although chlorine reacts violently with water the cloud that 
hovered over the city stretching two miles long and four blocks 
wide had to be sprayed constantly with water to dissipate it 
higgins said 
we had to try to get it up into the atmosphere where it could 
turn to steam as it rose he said whenever we cut back on the 
water it would take a nose dive 
if the cloud hadnt been sprayed fire chief raymond sullivan 
said it would have hung over springfield for weeks 
the gas had apparently withered trees and grasses in the 
neighborhood sullivan said 
besides the main cloud that moved off to the northeast there 
was a small cloud that moved down the mill river valley into a 
parking lot behind the firefighters he said it got so bad 
they had to eventually turn the hoses on that too and you can see 
today that its really devastated the vegetation 
the chlorine he said burns leaves just as it does skin 
firefighters also found when they reached into their pockets 
that their pennies had turned green from the oxydizing effects of 
the chlorine on brass

firefighters stopped pumping water 
today and began using chemicals on the smoldering shell of a 
swimming pool chlorine plant that burned for three days emitting 
deadly fumes and keeping 4600 people out of their homes officials 
said 
tests showed no dangerous levels of chlorine fumes around the 
fourstory advanced laboratories plant fire spokesman giorgio 
placanico said today tablets of chloride a chlorine compound had 
been bursting in small explosions overnight giving off 
yellowgreen chlorine gas 
a state environmental official said firefighters began dumping 
neutralizing chemicals this morning on small hot spots in the 
remains of the factory 
the danger is eased said john j higgins of the state 
department of environmental quality engineering 
mayor richard neal said today nearly all the 4600 people still 
homeless probably can return to their homes during the afternoon 
only a few homes and businesses near the fire site will remain off 
limits he said 
higgins estimated there are 25 to 50 large containers of 
chloride and hundreds of smaller ones still in the building 
firefighters will try to remove the containers he said 
police said they suspect there were a few breakins on the 
perimeter of the evacuated area but no largescale looting 
at its peak the blaze caused a gas cloud two miles long and 
four city blocks wide sending 275 people including 22 
firefighters to hospitals with complaints of skin burns and 
respiratory problems only two people were hospitalized and they 
were in stable condition today 
the last of three fires was brought under control sunday 
morning allowing more than 20000 people to return to homes near 
the precivil war building but the threat from fumes kept away 
4600 people living closest to the plant 
they are resigned to the fact that they will be here through 
monday said therese theroux administrator at springfield 
municipal hospital where 170 people including 120 nursinghome 
residents slept on cots its obvious they are very distraught 
and anxious over this entire thing 
an elementary school a high school two housing projects for 
the elderly and the nursing home remained off limits and anyone 
entering the neighborhood was subject to arrest authorities said 
the fires in this city of 170000 began friday morning when rain 
blew in a factory window and ignited tablets of a highly 
concentrated form of the chloride in a hopper authorities said 
chloride in diluted form is used to bleach clothes and release 
chlorine to kill germs in swimming pools 
firefighters put out the blaze after 1800 residents were 
evacuated only to have a second fire start that burned through the 
night ousting 6000 more residents 
residents began returning saturday but watersoaked barrels of 
chloride exploded in midafternoon throwing two firefighters 
against a wall and triggering the evacuation of an estimated 20000 
to 25000 people within a mile of the plant and several thousand in 
chicopee to the north 
at one point flames soared 100 feet in the air barrels of 
pellets exploded at a rate of six a minute and toxic gas drifted 
down city streets fumes could be smelled in palmer 15 miles away 
the core of the fire was a room containing 600 to 800 barrels 
each filled with 300 pounds of pellets 
firefighters risking reigniting the pellets pumped 14000 
pounds of water per minute on the plant in an attempt to turn it 
into a big swimming pool placanico said 
if allowed to go on the cloud would have stayed for weeks 
said fire chief raymond sullivan 
kevin kennedy an aide to the mayor said the disaster would 
cost springfield millions of dollars

contra rebels today rejected a 
sandinista government proposal to reopen peace talks and said the 
offer was linked to washingtons consideration of military aid for 
the rebels 
every time the americans talk of military aid they the 
sandinistas talk of negotiation contra leader roberto ferrey 
said in a telephone interview from costa rica 
the reagan administration which has supported the rebels since 
1981 is considering whether to ask congress for renewed military 
aid 
president daniel ortega called on the rebels sunday to hold a 
fifth round of talks before a temporary ceasefire expires at the 
end of june he proposed that the meeting begin june 26 
the two sides have made little headway since signing an 
agreement march 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the almost 
sevenyear war 
the contra rejection of talks next week did not rule out further 
negotiations all of the meetings have been marked by haggling over 
dates and places 
during the last meeting the sandinistas presented their most 
liberal proposal 
under the plan the rebels would send up to eight delegates to 
take part in internal talks with other political opposition party 
members to define such issues as freedom of expression electoral 
laws and the separation of party and state 
the contras said the government plan did not assure that the 
democratic measures would be enacted 
they also called for a constituent assembly a new supreme court 
and permission for soldiers to leave military service should they 
so desire 
the rebels also demanded immediate political amnesty for more 
than 3000 prisoners

gary michael heidnik raped and tortured six 
women killing two of them but the jury should look beyond those 
acts his attorney said today in opening arguments at heidniks 
murder trial 
my client is not innocent we are not relying on that 
presumption he is very very guilty this is not a case of 
whodunit this is a case of why it was done a charles peruto 
jr said he is relying on a defense of mental infirmity his 
criminal acts will show him to be insane 
heidnik 44 is charged with keeping the women chained in a 
basement torture chamber in his philadelphia home which officials 
say he used as a church where he installed himself as bishop 
assistant district attorney charles gallagher told the jury 
chosen last week in pittsburgh that heidnik methodically and 
systematically committed repeated sadistic and malicious acts 
against his victims in the basement 
he kept them there chained and repeatedly assaulted them 
repeatedly raped them and eventually killed two of them 
gallagher said the evidence will come from the four survivors 
you will see how heidnik took advantage of underprivileged people 
heidnik is charged with murdering two women one by 
strangulation while she was hanging chained to a pipe and the other 
by electrocution while she was standing in a waterfilled pit 
peruto has insisted that heidnik was treated with the chemical 
lsd while a hospital patient during army service in west germany in 
1962 but has been unable to get any records 
common pleas judge lynne abraham warned that without documents 
the alleged evidence on the lsd incident would be excluded from 
testimony 
peruto said that shortly after the alleged experiments heidnik 
was discharged from the army and eventually given 100 percent 
disability benefits for servicerelated mental problems 
heidnik used some of his disability funds to found a church in 
which he proclaimed himself bishop and then allegedly used 
contributions to play the stock market eventually amassing more 
than 500000 before he was arrested in march 1987 
jury selection was moved out of philadelphia because the defense 
claimed excessive publicity prevented a fair trial

drug agents in a memorial ceremony on monday and said it burns me 
up that federal drug enforcement officers are given so little 
credit by politicians of either party

administration service paying tribute to three officers killed in 
the line of duty during the past year paul s seema and george m 
montoya of los angeles and arthur l cash of tucson ariz 
the vice president presented the families of the three officers 
framed certificates signed by president reagan and told an audience 
of about 150 agency employees we remember their unselfish 
behavior and mourn them as heroes

political but in this political season i hear comments from people 
of both parties giving no credit at all to the job the men and 
women in this room and across the country are doing bush said 
it burns me up its not fair its not accurate 
by design you dont get your pictures in the paper or sit at 
the head table at testimonial dinners but everywhere ive gone in 
this country i take time talking about the contribution you 
make bush said 
at the same time bush said as we honor your fallen 
colleagues i want to challenge you to do even better 
the vice president has called for the death penalty for major 
drug dealers and for those convicted of drugrelated murders 
i really do believe the death penalty is the answer bush 
told the audience which gave him a standing ovation 
he repeated his call for increasing the certainty and the 
severity of punishment 
the nearly certain republican nominee shared the stage with 
attorney general edwin l meese iii who told the dea employees 
that the quality of the work you do is virtually unmatched 
meese whose legal difficulties have at times been a political 
embarrassment to the vice president praised bush as the leader 
in the administrationin speaking out on behalf of the 
antidrug law enforcement effort 
during the brief ceremony the names of 40 drug enforcement 
employees killed since the 1920s were read 
montoya and seema were killed last february while conducting an 
undercover investigation in los angeles cash was killed while

a british businessman in new york has given 65 
million to buy american paintings and sculpture for the tate 
gallery the state art museum announced monday 
the anonymous donation is the secondlargest to the tate after 
the 136 million given by britains clore foundation in 1980 to 
house the works of jmw turner 
the tate said the gift will be invested to establish an american 
fund for the tate gallery and the income from it used for 
purchasing 
its a marvelous gift and we shall be buying modern works 
said sir alan bowness director of the tate which houses the 
national collection of british art and modern foreign art 
the tate owns the most important collection of american 20th 
century art of any museum outside the united states it includes 
six paintings by jackson pollock 13 by mark rothko and major works 
by willem de kooning barnett newman andy warhol and roy 
lichtenstein 
we have a good collection of american abstract expressionism 
but we have nothing by edward hopper or georgia okeefe for 
instance said bowness 
the relatively high cost of american art has made it difficult 
to continue to add to the collection and with the american fund we 
hope to make at least one major acquisition each year the 
director said 
he said the donor was an art collector who has lived for many 
years in new york and wanted to remain anonymous

social scientists say the 6monthold 
palestinian rebellion in the occupied lands is creating a worrisome 
atmosphere of violence and insensitivity in israel 
repeated scenes on television of palestinians throwing stones 
and being beaten by soldiers are contributing to more violence in 
labor disputes and demonstrations according to the scholars and 
researchers 
early this month hundreds of protesters stormed past police 
guarding the finance ministry in jerusalem broke open the massive 
front door and made frightened office workers sit quietly while 
they smashed windows and furniture 
police summoned reinforcements and drove the protesters out with 
wooden clubs and tear gas the 500 attackers jewish employees of 
the beit shemesh engine factory wanted the government to bail out 
the financially troubled company 
violence is increasingly becoming the norm said simcha 
landau a criminologist at hebrew university the sensitivity 
threshold has been lowered and violence has become a legitimate way 
to solve problems 
several days after the finance ministry assault members of the 
extreme antiarab kach party attacked leftwing demonstrators in 
downtown jerusalem and police were called in to break up the fight 
the partys leader is americanborn rabbi meir kahane 
in tel aviv bystanders spat on people who marched june 4 to 
dramatize support for trading the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
for peace with the arabs several scuffles broke out and police 
beat up three news photographers 
landau said israelis become habituated and desensitized to the 
violence they see daily on television and hear about from 
thousands of reserve soldiers who have served in the territories 
since the violence began dec 8 the more they see it the more 
they tend to imitate it he said 
he cited international studies indicating violent crime 
increases after wars because people put less value on human life 
landau said his research in israel has shown increases in murder 
and robbery in times of war or economic hardship 
there is an erosion of the value which negates violence 
collectively and individually he said at times like this 
many people who live on the edge of violence cross the line 
more than 200 palestinians have been killed most shot or 
beaten to death by soldiers in what has come to be called the 
intefadeh the arabic word for uprising four israelis have been 
slain 
avi diskin a hebrew university political scientist says the 
uprising is focusing the nov 1 parliamentary election on how to 
treat the 15 million palestinians in the territories and whether 
to trade land for peace 
this year for the first time the campaign may be fought over 
the genuine national question israels future and permanent 
borders he said 
many israelis feel the west bank and gaza captured in the 1967 
middle east war are part of israel by biblical tradition other 
jewish settlers whose reasons for moving to the occupied lands were 
practical rather than political also would be reluctant to give up 
their homes 
on the other side are liberals who fear israel will lose its 
democratic ideals if it continues ruling palestinians without 
giving them equal rights they also say however that giving them 
equal rights would threaten israels jewish character 
the two major political parties the rightwing likud bloc and 
the centerleft labor party have opposite views on giving up the 
territories 
labor led by foreign minister shimon peres supports a partial 
withdrawal and has said israel will have increasing difficulty 
controlling the palestininians if it keeps the territories 
likud led by prime minister yitzhak shamir opposes giving up 
any territory shamir says land released by israel would become a 
staging area for attacks by terrorists or even arab armies 
shamir and peres have been partners and rivals in a tenuous 
national unity coalitions since indecisive elections in 1984 
diskin said the palestinian uprising had polarized the views of 
israelis and the violence could prove a potent mixture with 
politics 
there may be a lot of incidents in this campaign he said 
in elections emotions are much more powerful than reason and the 
intefadeh works powerfully on emotions

about 1000 american businessmen monday attended 
the opening session of chinas largest trade conference seeking to 
exchange economic knowhow with their chinese counterparts 
the fourday uschina joint session on industry trade and 
economic development in beijings great hall of the people includes 
1000 chinese from 22 provinces who are looking for us capital 
and technology to fuel their drive for economic modernization 
the americans are mostly businessmen from small or mediumsized 
companies on their first trip to china to meet representatives of 
chinese industries 
the opening session began with a noisy welcome from a chinese 
childrens drum and cymbal band as well as greetings from 
president reagan vice president george bush and chinese premier li 
peng 
between our two countries there is enormous potential for 
development li said 
reagan in his message read by us ambassador winston lord 
noted that bilateral trade reached 104 billion last year and was 
up 19 percent in the first quarter of this year while us 
businessmen had invested 3 billion in china more than in any 
other country except hong kong 
speakers offered frank criticisms of american and chinese trade 
and economic policies but agreed that us restrictions on high 
technology sales to china are counterproductive 
the state department last fall temporarily froze liberalization 
of high tech sales to china to protest alleged sales of chinese 
silkworm missiles to iran but lifted the freeze in march 
vice minister li lanqing of the foreign economic relations and 
trade ministry criticized the united states for failing to grant 
china the favorednation trade status which would curb the 
restrictions on high tech sales and ease other trade barriers 
these he said damage us businessmens interests and 
competitiveness in china 
under current procedures the state department uses trade 
restrictions to advance diplomatic interests or to express its 
frustrations with the behavior of other nations said roger 
sullivan chairman of the national council for uschina trade 
former us chamber of commerce chairman edwin d dodd said 
china needs to emulate asian countries like singapore and south 
korea by promoting private enterprise 
but sullivan advised china to develop its domestic economy 
rather than copying the singapore or hong kong model of 
exportoriented growth which is dependent on cheap labor and 
protectionism 
liu hongru deputy governor of the central peoples bank of 
china admitted that chinas financial system remains plagued by 
inefficient use of funds badly trained staff and rigid currency 
exchange controls 
chinese law expert jerome cohen said there are still frequent 
overlaps and even contradictions between national and local 
legislation and that china still lacks copyright mortgage 
insurance banking and other laws

although the leaders of the worlds most powerful 
democracies meet in a summit cocoon of strict privacy their 
statements and the gist of negotiations are relayed in a 
neartorrent of briefings by official spokesmen and senior advisers 
but the picture that emerges can be as hard to fit together as a 
pile of jumbled jigsaw pieces sometimes its hard to believe that 
all the briefers were even describing the same puzzle 
part of the problem is that the officials with the job of 
carrying the news to some 3000 anxious journalists are working 
with secondhand information themselves with rare exceptions they 
were not present at the discussions the briefers had to be briefed 
themselves 
then theres the impulse by each country to emphasize its own 
role interpret developments from its point of view impart what 
is known as its spin on the news 
this suits the reporters as well who naturally want to focus 
on the performance of their own countrys leaders in the world 
arena 
the official declarations of the leaders of the seven 
industrialized democracies are issued as carefully prepared 
communiques after every word has been weighed 
but there also are more than 20 briefings each day from early 
in the morning until past midnight 
with the exception of japan which conducts separate briefings 
in japanese and english each delegation reports exclusively in its 
own language or in the case of bilingual canada two languages 
without simultanous translation 
to be sure of getting every point of view a reporter would have 
to be fluent in five languages and capable of being in several 
places at once 
instead news organizations cover as many briefings as they can 
and struggle to resolve the apparent contradictions that come up 
one key issue at the toronto summit is what to do about the debt 
load on the worlds poorest nations each participating country has 
its own ideas and several are eager to be seen as the one which 
showed the way 
after mondays opening summit session the british delegation 
announced that agreement had been reached on how to deal with the 
third world debt in an accord based on britains proposals 
french officials have been pushing president francois 
mitterrands proposal on the debt crisis similar in many ways to 
britains and they said sunday and again monday that the 
agreement was not yet final 
nothing is settled before the final communique a mitterrand 
aide told a briefing 
president reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater left the 
impression at his briefing sunday that the debt question had 
scarcely been raised 
the canadians meanwhile who like to think they have a genius 
for bringing about compromise said monday that they were working 
actively to bring the different positions together 
one delegation official speaking on condition of anonymity 
about the apparent conflicts said there was rarely any intention 
to distort the issues 
we will see consensus on debt but each country will perceive 
the discussions in a selective way not negatively in a humanly 
selective way the official said 
paul frazer spokesman for canadian foreign minister joe clark 
said an accurate briefing is a difficult art in part because 
reporters would like an impression theyd like an assessment 
rather than a dry recitation of events 
one of the toughest things to do in giving a briefing is to 
stick to the facts he said

jack clemmer has begun dreaming that his 
droughtstricken fields are being drenched by a soft gentle rain 
but this happy reverie turns to dust each morning when the sun 
comes streaming over the nearby smoky mountains 
what i see when i look out my window in the morning makes me 
sick to my stomach says the 50yearold clemmer who has been 
raising cattle and crops in blount county for the past quarter 
century 
what he sees is a rolling expanse of wilted yellowish grass 
that has been cropped to the nub by hungry cattle 
and lately clemmer has been seeing something else happening in 
those seared fields something he can hardly believe 
just look out there he said sunday afternoon while he and 
some neighbors sat in the shade it looks like a winter sight 
dont it here it is june and im feeding hay to my cattle 
out in the field about 30 cows and calves were gathered around a 
roll of hay that clemmer had put out that morning 
ive been putting out hay for two weeks now because theres 
simply no grass left in my fields he said if this was a 
normal year i wouldnt have to put out any hay until thanksgiving 
and maybe even a little later than that 
but this is hardly a normal year in eastern tennessee one of 
the hardesthit drought areas in the southeast 
our rainfall level for the year already is 10 inches below 
average said ralph lovely the university of tennessee 
agricultural extension service agent in blount county just east of 
knoxville 
lovely added this drought cycle is killing us were down 40 
inches over the past four years thats a years rainfall weve 
lost 
as a result he said trees are dying and hay and row crops 
such as corn and soybeans are withering he predicted many 
cattlemen in the county one of the states biggest 
cattleproducing areas will be forced to dump their herds this 
fall for lack of feed 
clemmer said he probably will be among them 
at the rate im going i wont have any hay left for winter 
he said by fall the price of hay will be out of sight besides 
nobody can afford hay and feed on a yearround basis 
adding to his problems he said is the fact that the yield of 
his first hay crop which he cut two weeks ago was more than 50 
percent below normal 
and on top of that ive got 75 acres in corn that isnt 
going to make it either unless we get a lot of rain the next two 
weeks he said ive already decided not to plant soy beans 
this year it would just be a waste of time and money 
clemmer said money has become a major concern while he has 
watched his crops dry up along with his dreams 
this is the fourth straight year of bad drought for us here in 
eastern tennessee he said we didnt get any snow to speak of 
last winter and we havent had any rain to speak of this spring 
each year ive said one more bad year would be all i could 
take and it looks like this will be the one that does me in 
about that time a neighbor stopped by to tell him about a 
thunderstorm that left water standing in the fields and ditches 
several miles down the road he invited clemmer to come and take a 
look 
no clemmer said shaking his head i couldnt stand to 
look it would just make me sick

droughtshrunken mississippi and ohio rivers and a sioux medicine

while a corps dredge dug out a 15footdeep 300footwide channel 
at one point 80 tows with 20 to 30 barges each were stalled in the 
channel which had fallen to nine feet deep 
showers and thunderstorms sunday dampened many parts of 
americas parched midsection including michigan wisconsin iowa

weather service said 
hot weather aggravated the drought with temperatures of 100 
degrees and up recorded as far north as minnesota todays forecast

plains 
two counties of dry eastern north dakota got up to an inch of 
rain during the weekend but it came with hail as big as baseballs 
and 70 mph wind that flattened crops 
sections of the mississippi and ohio had been closed for days so 
dredges could deepen channels made shallow by the drought backing 
up nearly 700 barges on the ohio 
river traffic flowed most of sunday but was shut down for the 
night at one dangerous point on the mississippi nine miles north of

weather service said 
we got a halfinch doris fruend said sunday from the farm 
she and her husband lester operate east of merrill wis well 
the corn it still curled but it kept it alive

because the ground is too dry said weather service meteorologist 
rainer dombrowsky farmers need 24 to 36 hours of light rain he 
said 
six us senators and two congressmen toured acre after acre of 
bonedry farms during the weekend in menoken nd sen patrick 
leahy dvt told farmers he would work on legislation to 
guarantee crop deficiency payments to droughtstricken farmers

is grasshoppers weve got a problem leahy chairman of the 
senates agriculture committee said saturday 
north dakota is suffering the most and is expected to lose 40 
percent of its farm income according to the us agriculture 
department 
federal officials warned that the drought poses another danger 
increased pollution in the nations rivers lakes and wells 
the millions of streams and rivers that carry off sewage

a nicaraguan human rights group charged monday 
that the sandinista government has used limited improvements in 
civil liberties to gain favorable international publicity then has 
quickly reimposed past repression 
the result is that more than 10 months after a regional peace 
accord was reached at esquipulas guatemala there has been little 
or no progress toward realizing promised democratic reforms said 
the nicaraguan permanent commission on human rights an opposition 
group 
commission director lino hernandez said the sandinista 
government has made some concessions that seemed positive at the 
time but which have been undone by subsequent actions and 
ultimately appear to have been used only to project a benign image 
to the world 
the spaces that had opened under esquipulas are being closed 
once again in nicaragua hernandez said at a news conference 
the freeing of political prisoners and lifting of a state of 
emergency by the leftist managua government have been 
counterbalanced by laws that violate human rights the harassment 
of labor unions and the use of governmentinspired mobs to 
intimidate opposition politicians the group said 
the positive steps taken early in the peace process in the 
long run have turned out to be completely insufficient even to 
create the proper climate for beginning a national reconciliation 
called for in the accords the commission said in a report 
the report specifically cited instances in which opposition 
radio stations had been censored and newsprint rationed to the 
opposition newspaper la prensa a 1981 decree is being newly 
enforced to prevent publication of information about military 
actions or about the prices of food and other consumer goods it 
said 
a broadcaster who frequently lampoons the sandinista government 
and is also a member of the commission jose castillo was 
physically assaulted by interior minister tomas borge in april 
after being summoned to borges house the report stated 
the sandinista military continues to forcibly conscript young 
men and the regime continues to hold some 8200 political 
prisoners the group charged political arrests continue at a rate 
of about 50 per month hernandez said

theatergoers watching david mamets hit broadway play speed 
the plow on saturday night all had one question during 
intermission was the rock stars strange outburst of laughter part

the latter it turns out 
it certainly isnt in the script confirmed speed the 
plow spokesman bruce campbell on monday the play opened to rave 
notices on may 3 though the critics were not all kind to madonna 
who was making her broadway debut

madonna who plays a secretary to a hollywood wheelerdealer tries 
to persuade her boss that a book about radiation and the end of the 
world would make a good film her boss played by joe mantegna 
wants mainly to get her in bed 
as madonna started reading excerpts from the book she began to 
giggle she laughed for several minutes as the audience at the 
royale theatre buzzed uncomfortably mantegna seated next to her 
on a couch never took his eyes off her cradling his chin in his 
hands with a bemused expression 
regaining control at last she said i was saying and

if he had it to do over actoractivist 
martin sheen says he would have trained for his career 
i wanted to study when he arrived in new york but i 
couldnt afford it he said during a recent trip to los angeles 
to promote his latest movie da 
when i began to make my living as an actor i didnt feel 
any great need for it i figured that the only thing i would play 
would be a human and i felt my classroom was in the streets im 
instinctual but i dont think you can teach anyone to be a good 
actor 
the area of study i think is critical is on the body you 
should study dance and you have to be healthy also you have to 
know classical literature if i had to do it again thats what id 
study he said 
sheen 48 is ardent in his work for the roman catholic church 
and his quest for world peace has made him a willing protester 
i generally dont have a preconceived notion of a character 
until im playing it sheen said it means youre open to 
changes in the character i do surrender to the moment go with 
instinct but it also means i might be shooting for several weeks 
before i finally figure out the part 
da based on the 1977 tony award winning play deals with the

to none 
kemp himself says he doesnt believe george bush will give him a 
crack at the job although he also says he believes hed be a good 
vice president 
and if he were offered the slot the timing would be perfect 
since kemp isnt running for the buffalo nyarea seat he has 
held for nine terms 
theres no way you can campaign for it theres no way you can 
expect something like that said kemp in an interview about the 
vice presidency 
but if it were offered he said i would be flattered 
an early entrant into the 1988 gop presidential contest kemp 
dropped out in march after failing to win better than 13 percent in 
any of the initial gop primaries despite his perceived role as a 
leader of the new right and his claim to be heir to the reagan 
revolution kemp never moved out of the single digits in 
presidential polls 
within weeks of quitting the race he endorsed bush as a 
rising star in the republican party and promised to campaign 
vigorously for him 
asked why he seems so convinced bush has ruled him out as a 
running mate kemp said im not the governor of the state i 
like to think im a pretty good campaigner but i cannot command any 
vast constituency 
he also said he may be perceived as having his own political 
agenda 
i think ive proven i could be a good team player but it may 
be that some think that i am too much of an activist he said 
kemp 52 a former pro football quarterback made his first mark 
in national politics when he sold president reagan on the idea of 
supplyside economics his belief that government should tax its 
citizens less spurring them to work save and invest more has 
been credited both with the economic recovery of 198287 and the 
countrys huge federal deficit his call for cutting taxes 10 
percent a year for three years was adopted in modified form by 
congress in 1981 and he was one of the politicians who introduced 
the tax reform act of 1986 
asked what assets kemp could bring to the bush ticket several 
veteran political observers mentioned youth energy and the 
conservative vote at the same time however they spoke of kemps 
failure to ignite his own presidential campaign and the 
probability that the new york congressman would not be able to 
deliver the vote in his adopted home state where the native 
californian has traditionally been viewed as something of a 
carpetbagger 
ive got to believe jack kemp will be on any reasonably short 
list george bush puts together said gop consultant eddie mahe 
the only thing clearly missing with jack kemp that keeps him 
in my opinion from being almost the automatic choice is you 
cannot make the assumption that he would bring new york state 
mahe said if you could make that assumption then i dont think 
thered be any doubt 
kemp said he doesnt believe any potential vice presidential 
candidate can promise to deliver any state but in the next breath 
he named two exceptions democratic sen sam nunn could carry his 
home state of georgia and republican gov tom kean could deliver 
his new jersey constituents 
i think i could certainly compete very favorably for that 
bluecollar vote that i consider to be necessary to the republican 
party and i also consider minority votes to be important to the 
republican party kemp said 
so what i dont bring in terms of maybe the state of new york 
or the whole northeast i think i could bring something else 
thomas mann a scholar at the brookings institution a 
liberaloriented washington think tank said he thinks kemp has a 
chance 
if the feeling was that bush really needed help giving energy 
to the movement conservatives then kemp is a reasonable choice 
mann said but i have a feeling that if at the time he has to 
make this appointment hes 15 points behind which is a 
reasonable supposition that hes going to be thinking more about 
going after democrats than he is about firming up his conservative 
base 
ben j wattenberg a fellow at the more conservative american 
enterprise institute said he thinks kemp would be a good choice 
because he has a sense of energy and youth and to use a 
muchoverworked term charisma

a judge on monday acquitted a nurse 
accused of killing three of her patients with lethal doses of 
potassium chloride saying prosecutors failed to tie her to the 
deaths 
the states reach hopelessly exceeded its grasp prince 
georges county circuit court judge joseph s casula said in 
dismissing the case simply put the evidence failed to supply 
the missing link that would connect the defendant with alleged 
criminal acts 
jane bolding 30 who claimed she had been forced into 
confessing to killing two of the patients during a marathon 
interrogation faced three counts of firstdegree murder in 
connection with the deaths of three patients at the prince georges 
hospital center located about 30 miles from washington dc she 
also was charged with trying to kill two others the same way 
i said three and a half years ago that i was innocent 
bolding said after casula issued his decision in the nonjury 
trial its been proven now 
bolding who now works filing medical records did not say when 
or if she would resume her nursing career 
she cant go to a nurses station and say please restore my 
reputation defense attorney fred joseph said thats going to 
take a long time 
im very disappointed in the outcome assistant states 
attorney jay creech said i feel that the evidence i presented 
was strong and compelling 
during the monthlong proceedings no witness testified to 
seeing bolding give the patients unauthorized injections and no 
causes of death ever were established although postmortem 
examinations revealed all three had high levels of potassium 
creech based his case on a study by the federal centers for 
disease control that revealed that patients in the hospitals 
intensive care unit suffered an unusually high number of heart 
attacks while bolding was working 
according to the study bolding was the primary care nurse when 
57 heart attacks occurred the nexthighest number for any nurse 
was five 
dr jeffrey j sacks the author of the study testified that 88 
heart attacks occurred while bolding was on duty from january 1984 
to march 1985 the period covered by the study 
health statistics projected that just 31 heart attacks should 
have taken place during that time and sacks estimated that the 
odds of bolding not being in some way connected with the rash of 
heart attacks were about one in 100 trillion 
however under crossexamination sacks also testified that his 
statistical findings could not be used to address the matter of 
intent to commit a crime 
in the absence of a witness to the alleged crimes casula ruled 
that he could not give undue weight to the cdc study 
a conviction cannot rest soley on a statistical study said 
casula who added that a guilty verdict under such circumstances 
would turn courtrooms across the country into mathematical 
quagmires 
bolding became the subject of an investigation in 1985 after 
hospital officials became suspicious of the high number of heart 
attacks on her shift she signed a letter of confession to two of 
the killings later that year 
however the statement was ruled inadmissible as evidence after 
revelations that it came in the midst of 33 straight hours of 
interrogation in which she was denied access to an attorney 
murder charges then were dismissed but reinstated after a grand 
jury heard testimony on the cdc study 
two medical experts testified they were certain outside 
injections of the electrolyte had caused heart attacks in several 
victims but other experts said numerous medical occurrences can 
cause high potassium levels

america is the most powerful participant and 
canada is the host but it is british prime minister margaret 
thatcher who has subtly taken over a key role at the sevennation 
economic summit 
often resented and sometimes ostracized at other international 
gatherings mrs thatcher appears to have moved to center stage 
this time with scant sign of demurral from her fellow leaders of 
the worlds major industrialized countries 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney invited the 62yearold 
british prime minister now the longest serving leader in the 
western world to make the opening address and set the tone on 
economic issues for the threeday gathering 
canadian officials said the invitation reflected mrs thatchers 
seniority at the gathering of the united states canada britain 
west germany italy france and japan 
in office for nine years she has held power longer than 
president reagan nearing the end of his second and final fouryear 
term 
reagan to whom mrs thatcher has been the closest and most 
loyal foreign ally has always sought to bolster her international 
prestige last december soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev also 
increased her standing by conferring with her en route to a 
superpower summit meeting in washington 
but at meetings of the 12nation european economic community 
france britains longtime rival has openly resented and sought 
to block mrs thatchers moves to dominate or get her way 
in contrast britain and france are allied at the toronto 
meetings in pressing a less enthusiastic us delegation to agree 
to substantive debt relief measures for the poorest african nations 
some analysts believe mulroneys deference toward mrs thatcher 
a fellow conservative has been spurred by canadas elections next 
year the british leaders high profile at the summit provides a 
ringing endorsement for mulroneys conservative cause 
mrs thatcher lauds freeenterprise policies that she says have 
wrought an economic transformation in britain and account for 
steady growth among the summit seven 
that sort of talk fits mr mulroneys agenda perfectly 
commented torontos globe and mail newspaper 
clearly the hope was that she would set the agenda for the 
summit a british government spokesman who insisted on 
anonymity said of mulroneys invitation to mrs thatcher 
canadian delegation spokesman derek burney said he thought that 
was overplaying things a bit 
but thatchers spokesman saw no conflict saying canada invited 
thatcher to set the economic tone while reagan set the agenda for 
talks on eastwest relations this is the greatest nonissue of 
the summit forget it said the british spokesman 
the robust response reflected the exuberance and confidence that 
the thatcher government displays at international conferences 
often to the irritation of its allies 
yet the briefings by mrs thatchers bluntspeaking press 
secretary bernard ingham attract the largest numbers of reporters 
and in the fleeting glimpses that cameramen and reporters get of 
the leaders mrs thatcher rivals reagan as a favorite target for 
cameramen 
other differences were sidelined in toronto including over 
south africa 
in the commonwealth the 48nation association of britain and 
its former colonies mrs thatcher has been isolated because of her 
refusal to impose tough embargoes against the whiteminority 
government

an old man stands in the park dropping crumbs 
on the ground and appreciative pigeons swoop down to eat suddenly 
the man claps his hands loudly and pulls out a huge net trapping a 
halfdozen of the birds as they try to fly away 
he throws them into a box in the back of his tan station wagon 
and heads off to new jersey where the pirated pigeons will be sold 
for a few bucks each 
that is the modus operandi of a 74yearold brooklyn man who 
authorities say has been trapping and reselling pigeons for the 
past decade 
agents of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
repeatedly have issued him summonses but judges have thrown out 
the charges there is no law against trapping wildlife on city 
streets as long as its done humanely 
recently however the man has been spotted trapping pigeons in 
and around parks including riverside park on manhattans upper 
west side he lures them with bread crumbs then claps his hands to 
scare them and captures them as they fly into the air 
a neighborhood resident has posted a sign on a park fence 
urging bystanders to call police if you see a man abducting 
squirrels and pigeons 
park department regulations make it a crime to molest chase 
wound trap hunt shoot throw missiles at kill remove or 
possess any bird from a city park 
william kapps director of enforcement for the spca said that 
several years ago two society agents trailed the pigeon pirate and 
his captives to a poultry market in newark 
but the agents who carry guns were spotted by newark police 
and asked to leave the jurisdiction 
kapps said his agents would work with the parks department to 
make sure the man was not poaching on public lands 
how appetizing are these urban birds not very experts say 
michael lane whose family has run a manhattan poultry market 
for three generations says pigeons served in good restaurants are 
raised on farms where they live in cages and eat nothing but 
grain they never fly and develop relatively little muscle tissue 
they are young tender and cost about 5 each 
but a bird thats been living in the park tends to get 
tough lane said and you dont know what theyve been eating 
i wouldnt eat one of em a park pigeon has been around 
he said that although people have been trying to sell captured 
city pigeons since his grandfathers time no one had approached 
his poultry business with such an offer for two or three years 
oscar hartman who runs a poultry distributor in the bronx said 
that occasionally teenagers will trap pigeons on rooftops and try 
to sell them when they need a few bucks but he said he knew of 
no one who systematically traffics in the birds since there is no 
legitimate market for them

rebel leaders rejected a government 
offer to reopen peace talks contending monday that the sandinistas 
made it only because new military aid to the insurgents was being 
considered in washington 
every time the americans talk of military aid they the 
sandinistas talk of negotiation roberto ferrey a leader of the 
ussupported rebels said in a telephone interview from costa 
rica 
president daniel ortega said sunday there should be a fifth 
round of talks with the contra rebels before a ceasefire expires 
at the end of june he suggested the meeting begin next sunday 
sandinista and contra negotiators have made little headway since 
they signed an agreement march 23 to seek a negotiated settlement 
to the war which began nearly seven years ago 
they just want to give the image that negotiations are moving 
forward ferrey said if we continue to arrive in managua it 
would be playing the sandinista game 
although the contras rejected the leftist governments latest 
proposal they did not rule out further negotiations previous 
meetings have been marked by haggling over dates and places 
both sides claim violations of the truce declared march 21 two 
days before the agreement to negotiate 
ferrey said we arent looking to renew the war but we will 
defend ourselves 
the reagan administration which has supported the rebels since 
they began fighting in 1981 is considering whether to request new 
military aid congress voted down such a request earlier this year 
and the march 23 agreement permits only humanitarian aid to the 
contras 
talks between the leftist sandinistas and the rebels are at an 
impasse over democratic reforms and a timetable 
at the last threeday meeting the sandinistas presented their 
most liberal proposal and accepted a rebel demand for democratic 
reforms and a schedule for implementing them 
under the government plan rebels would send up to eight 
delegates to in internal talks between the government and 
opposition political parties intended to define such issues as 
freedom of expression election laws and separation the sandinista 
party and the government 
amnesty would be carried out in stages and full disarmament 
would be completed by oct 10 
according to the contras the government plan did not guarantee 
the democratic measures would be enacted they demanded immediate 
amnesty for more than 3000 prisoners a constituent assembly to 
write a new constitution a new supreme court and permission for 
soldiers to leave military service if they wished 
more than 26000 nicaraguans have been killed in the war which 
began two years after the sandinistas ousted the proamerican 
government of president anastasio somoza the war has shattered the 
economy and the government says it has cost about 3 billion

world leaders tentatively agreed to help ease the 
staggering foreign debt burdens of africas poorest nations by 
fashioning measures that would forgive some of those countries 
loans british officials said 
the united states backed off from its previous refusal to go 
along with debt concessions helping pave the way for the agreement 
at sundays opening session of the 14th annual economic summit of 
seven key industrial nations 
the americans have agreed along with everyone else that action 
will be taken which is a position they were very far from even a 
few months ago said a british official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
president reagan joined leaders from britain france west 
germany italy japan and canada at the summit an annual gathering 
for discussing primarily international economic issues 
we do have agreement to address it and the broad ways of doing 
so for all the summit countries and although of course thre are a 
lot of important details which will still have to be sorted out 
afterward i think this is the real breakthrough nigel lawson 
britains top finance official said in an interview today on the 
british broadcasting corp 
during the opening round of talks french president francois 
mitterrand made a pitch for debt relief 
spokesman hubert vedrine quoted him as saying the poverty of 
the third world destroys their societies and threatens ours we 
must do more and coordinate our efforts toronto is the occasion to 
do it 
the plan is aimed at the poorest nations in subsaharan africa 
a vast region of 44 countries sandwiched between north africa 
which is somewhat better off and south africa which is much more 
prosperous 
the total foreign debt of the developing world is estimated at 
roughly 1 trillion 
officials said the fresh debt plan would apply primarily to 
about 20 african nations which have a per capita annual income of 
280 
under the proposal western creditor governments would have a 
menu of options for aiding these countries the options discussed 
include writing off some of the loans slashing interest rates on 
the credits or stretching out payments over a longer period of time 
the british official said aides were working on the language of 
the agreement expected to be released at the end of the summit on 
tuesday 
french officials said nothing was final nothing is settled 
before the final communique is issued said jacques attali a 
senior aide to mitterrand 
canadas finance minister michael wilson told reporters the 
leaders recognize their joint responsibility with the ldcs less 
developed countries to find solutions 
for the poorest countries he said they agreed to focus 
on new debt relief options 
the push for debt relief would not apply to the developing 
worlds biggest debtors brazil and mexico which have rung up 
loans totaling 220 billion 
officials argue the big debtors who owe money mainly to 
commercial banks can be helped with additional bank credits and 
other international financial aid 
these countries can help themselves especially if there are 
more credits given by commercial banks and if export markets 
are open for them said willy de clercq commissioner for 
external affairs of the european community 
while the poorest even with all the possible schemes we have 
invented up to now it doesnt seem possible they can help 
themselves de clercq said for them certain specific 
solutions should be found 
the drive to seek debt relief at the summit came primarily in 
separate initiatives from mitterrand and nigel lawson britains 
top financial official 
us treasury secretary james a baker iii said earlier this 
month in the ivory coast that the united states would support 
concessions on official debt owed by the poorest of the poor 
third world countries 
the united states has said it cannot legally write off loans or 
grant concessionary interest rates but can grant extended interest 
repayment periods 
the international monetary fund an international financial 
organization said in a recent publication that during 198087 
only a dozen of the subsaharan african countries were able to 
service their debt promptly without obtaining debt relief or 
incurring payments arrears 
it also said more than half of the subsaharan debt is held by 
five countries the ivory coast nigeria sudan zaire and zambia

to el salvador next month to resume his presidency his son said 
monday 
alejandro duarte told a news conference his 62yearold father 
will have to organize his work differently but that 
chemotherapy for liver cancer will not keep him from carrying out 
his duties

fact it is admirable said the younger duarte 
he said his father one of the united states closest allies in 
latin america would return between july 5 and july 8 and that he

duarte whose fiveyear term ends june 1 1989 has spent the 
past three weeks in walter reed army medical center most of his 
stomach also affected by cancer was removed in an operation 
earlier this month

into next year he said that according to statistics the 
president could reasonably expect to live between six and 18 months 
he said duarte would return to walter reed in august but his 
later treatment would be in el salvador 
my father is a fighter he said emphasizing that doctors 
say a cancer patients will and morale are a big factor in the 
prognosis 
duarte will be returning to a difficult political landscape his 
country is mired in an 8yearold civil war and his christian 
democratic party is deeply divided over who will be its 
presidential candidate in march elections 
the rightist opposition party republican nationalist alliance 
won legislative elections in march and is considered likely to win 
the presidency vice president rodolfo castillo claramount is the

owners presenting the onceaweek event in a former warehouse that 
for years was a dance hall 
patrons at saturday nights opening gala absorbed the cultural 
experience even getting into the spirit by wearing tshirts with

artists and expose young people to new bands and new types of 
music and with this ive taken it a step farther by attempting to 
expose them to a whole new culture raffi said while they may 
not come for an education they cant really avoid it 
keller who described his ethnic heritage as threequarters 
russian said the nightclub has received enthusiastic support from 
san franciscos russianamerican community one of the largest in

the supreme court gave cities and states a 
major victory monday in their escalating legal assault on exclusive 
membership policies in private clubs unanimously upholding a new 
york city law that bans such discrimination 
the court said the citys law aimed at large clubs that exclude 
women and minorities as members is constitutional 
the law merely prevents an association from using race sex or 
other specified characteristics as shorthand measures in place of 
what the city considers to be more legitimate criteria for 
determining membership justice byron r white wrote for the 
court 
at least six other major cities buffalo chicago detroit los 
angeles san francisco and washington have enacted similar 
ordinances recently 
the court on monday also 
overturned at least for now a contempt citation that could 
have cost the roman catholic church 100000 a day in fines for 
withholding documents in a lawsuit by a proabortion rights group 
challenging the churchs taxexempt status 
ruled uanimously in a north carolina case that prison inmates 
may sue in federal courts the doctors who treated them behind bars 
agreed in an important new test of affirmative action to 
study a dispute over a birmingham ala plan for promoting more 
black firefighters 
in the private club case the court ruled on a new york city law 
that bans discrimination by public accommodation but exempts 
distinctly private organizations 
if a group is not classified as a religious corporation or as a 
benevolent order it generally is deprived of the distinctly 
private exemption if it has more than 400 members provides 
regular meal service and regularly gets members dues paid by 
nonmembers such as members employers 
the new york state clubs association comprising 125 private 
clubs and associations challenged the new york city law soon after 
it was enacted in 1984 
the city had invoked the law in initiating proceedings against 
four menonly clubs the 10003member new york athletic club the 
4329member university club the 1900member century association 
and the 1600member union league club 
the laws challengers said it does not give individual clubs an 
opportunity to prove they should not be treated as a public 
accommodation 
while stating that the laws effect on any individual club may 
be challenged the high court said the law may be applied to some 
clubs without violating the constitutionally protected right of 
association 
whites opinion for the court noted that a considerable amount 
of private or intimate association might occur in a large 
private club with dining facilities 
but he said the same is true in many restaurants and other 
places of public accommodation but that fact alone does not afford 
the entity as a whole any constitutional immunity to practice 
discrimination when the government has barred it from doing so 
american bar association president rober mccrate whose 
organization had supported the city law praised the courts 
decision 
if women and minorities are to have equal access to the 
marketplace socalled private clubs that are common place for 
business discussions and other activities related to the 
marketplace must be subject to antidiscrimination laws mccrate 
said the court has taken an important step to eliminate this 
subtle form of discrimination and guarantee these rights 
beate bloch a lawyer who helped represent the us conference 
of mayors and other governmental organizations in backing the city 
law called the ruling a broad victory allowing cities to 
formulate general criteria to prohibit invidious discrimination 
practices by these clubs 
in previous decisions the supreme court has ruled that states 
may force the us jaycees and rotary international to admit women 
as members 
in ruling unanimously in the rotary case two years ago the 
justices suggested that numerous other maleonly or femaleonly 
private organizations may have to comply with state laws requiring 
equal access to public accommodations 
in mondays ruling white said some clubs may be able to prove 
they were organized for specific expressive purposes that would 
be thwarted if they cannot confine membership to those who 
share the same sex for example or the same religion 
but he added it seems sensible enough to believe that many of 
the large clubs covered by the new york city law are not of this 
kind 
in a separate opinion justice antonin scalia noted that new 
york citys law does not affect benevolent orders that could be 
characterized as lodges or fraternal organizations 
he said such groups include the american legion the jewish war 
veterans amvets the veterans of foreign wars various orders of 
masons the independent order of odd fellows the loyal order of 
moose the knights of columbus the improved benevolent and 
protective order of elks of the world the nobles of the mystic 
shrine the ancient order of hibernians and the knights of malta 
scalia and two other justices who joined in the opinion anthony 
m kennedy and harry a blackmun once belonged to maleonly clubs 
scalia and blackmun had belonged to the cosmos club in 
washington which just last saturday voted to admit women kennedy 
quit san franciscos allmale whiteonly olympic club after he was 
mentioned as a supreme court nominee 
in other matters the court 
said it will decide in a case from washington state whether 
indian tribes may control through tribal zoning laws the use of 
land owned by nonindians within a reservations boundaries

impose residency requirements restricting the number of lawyers

the supreme court agreed monday to decide 
whether people accused of driving under the influence of alcohol 
are entitled to jury trials 
the court said it will hear an appeal by two nevada men who 
claim the penalties for drivingundertheinfluence dui 
convictions are serious enough to warrant jury trials 
lawyers for the two men said nevada is one of only five states 
that do not permit jury trials for such convictions they listed 
the other states as louisiana mississippi new jersey and new 
mexico 
the two men are melvin r blanton arrested in north las vegas 
on july 18 1986 and mark d fraley arrested in the same town on 
june 29 1986 blanton has not been tried fraley was convicted and 
was sentenced to two days in jail and fined 310 
both men were charged with a misdemeanor that carries a minimum 
penalty of two days in jail or 48 hours of community service the 
maximum sentence is six months in jail fines range from 200 to 
1000 and there is also a mandatory 90 days suspension of driving 
privileges for those convicted 
the nevada supreme court ruled last dec 31 that denying those 
accused of driving under the influence a jury trial does not 
violate their constitutional rights 
the state court said its decision was dictated in part by the 
burden that would be created for municipal courts if cities are 
forced to hold jury trials for dui cases 
it would mean tremendous expense to the municipalities of this 
state and could force some cities not to press charges against 
drivers who drink the state court said 
the state court also rejected arguments that increased public 
concern over drunken driving has made driving under the influence a 
serious crime that requires a jury trial for anyone accused of 
the offense 
the court will hear arguments in the case during its term 
beginning in october with a ruling likely in 1989 
the case is blanton vs north las vegas 871437

suspected sikh extremists hurled a 
homemade grenade into a vegetable market on monday killing four 
hindus and injuring 40 others police said 
the powerful blast occurred at 8 am when more than 2000 
people were shopping at an outdoor vegetable market in tilak nagar 
a mixed hindu and sikh suburb of new delhi 
for the second day in a row suspected sikh extremists have 
mounted bombing attacks outside punjab state the main killing 
ground in their 6yearold guerrilla war for a separate homeland 
on sunday a bomb killed 15 people who were watching television 
at a market in kurukshetra in haryana state about 90 miles north 
of new delhi 
uttam chand a vegetable vendor said the grenade in mondays 
attack struck the branch of a tree and then exploded among the 
people 
windows of nearby houses shattered from the impact of the blast 
and debris from damaged shops was flung over 160 feet away 
police are searching for a creamcolored van in which witnesses 
saw four sikh men leaving soon after the blast according to ajay 
chadha deputy commissioner of police for the area 
police suspect members of babbar khalsa or lion sikhs an 
underground terrorist group based in the northern punjab state 
chadha said police will conduct housetohouse searches 
another police official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said 1200 policemen were deployed in the area to prevent 
retaliation by the hindus but the area was peaceful 
tilak nagar was predominantly hindu until 1984 when sikhs 
started moving in after their homes were destroyed in antisikh 
riots touched off when prime minister indira gandhi was 
assassinated by her sikh bodyguards 
over the years more sikhs have arrived from punjab the 
predominantly sikh northern state where the militants have killed 
at least 1333 people so far this year although the militants 
initially targeted hindus they have increasingly turned their guns 
on fellow sikhs they consider to be informers or too moderate 
sikh attacks outside punjab state have claimed 46 lives so far 
this year most of the victims died in bombings 
about half those deaths occurred during or after the 
governments siege last month of sikh militants who took over the 
golden temple in the punjab city of amritsar the siege ended after 
more than 40 sikhs were killed 
although the government succeeded in clearing the golden temple 
sikhisms holiest shrine of armed militants the siege prompted 
fears the radicals would escalate attacks outside punjab where 
killings continued 
sikh gunmen killed five people in punjab in four attacks sunday 
night according to the united news of india and press trust of 
india uni also said security forces shot to death a sikh extremist 
although sikhs are a majority in punjab they form just 2 
percent of indias predominantly hindu 800 million people their 
agitation for greater autonomy in punjab began in 1982 and grew 
into demands by several militant groups for an independent nation

the benefit of the increased imports and lower 
tariffs on us beef and oranges that japan agreed to monday will 
be available to other countries worldwide said an official of the 
japanese delegation to the sevennation economic summit said 
the official who spoke on condition that he not be identified 
said australia had expressed a particular interest in the issue 
because of its beef production he said japanese prime minister 
noboru takeshita may send his agriculture minister takashi sato 
to australia soon 
he said he did not know whether it would be necessary to 
negotiate a separate agreement in such cases 
i dont know the technicalities but in principle the 
benefits of the agreement have global application he said 
the agreement reached in tokyo calls for japan to increase 
imports and lower some of its tariffs on us beef and oranges over 
the next six years us trade representative clayton yeutter said 
in the japanese capital 
japan would nearly double its imports of beef by 1991 and would 
phase out its livestock industry promotion corporation which 
controls most beef imports 
the japanese would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 
1991 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to give their 
farmers time to adjust to the new rules 
yeutter said he expects the value of us beef exports to japan 
to at least double as a result of the pact reaching more than 1 
billion a year 
the tokyo government agreed to expand market access for fresh 
oranges by 22000 tons per year bringing them to 192000 tons in 
1990 
from then on fresh oranges from the united states could be 
imported in unlimited quantities at current tariff rates of 40 
percent in season and 20 percent off season quotas on orange juice 
will be phased out 
the agreement was signed by yeutter and sato

settlement of the regions most volatile political issue the 
occupation of cambodia by vietnamese troops 
vietnam has promised to withdraw its forces by the early 1990s

bring about aseans conditions for a settlement namely that the 
khmer rouge which ran cambodia in the late 1970s be left out of

a michigan exhibition of two rare giant pandas 
from china might harm the species the us fish and wildlife 
service said monday in refusing permission to import the animals 
the pandarama exhibit sponsored by michigan united conservation 
clubs and the state department of natural resources would have 
displayed the animals for 100 days this summer at the michigan 
state fairgrounds in detroit 
under an agreement with chinas sichuan province the exhibitors 
would pay at least 300000 for the loan of the pandas and the 
money would be used to build a panda captivebreeding facility and 
to improve wild pandas natural habitat 
there are some risks to the species from the loan which are 
not adequately outweighed by the potential benefits the fish and 
wildlife decision said a reduction in the threat of extinction 
from this import cannot be demonstrated from the information in the 
record 
the decision said expansion of facilities for breeding pandas in 
captivity could lead to the removal of additional animals from 
the wild to stock it 
the two pandas proposed for the michigan exhibit are already 
living in captivity in the chendu zoo 
under an international treaty pandas born in 1984 and after 
cannot be imported without a permit fewer than 1000 giant pandas 
are thought to exist 
a spokesman for michigan united conservation clubs don stypula 
said the agencys ruling was preposterous and the exhibits 
organizers would appeal through administrative channels 
were wondering now how the chinese are going to react to 
this stypula said this is a slap in the face to them more so 
than to us 
the fish and wildlife decision came amid efforts by the world 
wildlife fund and the american association of zoological parks and 
aquariums to close an exhibition of two chinese pandas in toledo 
ohio 
after the fish and wildlife service granted permission for the 
toledo exhibition the animal preservation groups sued in federal 
court in washington they argued that the fish and wildlife service 
failed to determine that the pandas werent imported for commercial 
purposes and that their display would promote survival of the 
species both are criteria for issuing an import permit 
the toledo zoo argued that closing the exhibit would deny the 
public a chance to see the endangered species and to learn 
something about china zoo attorneys also said closing the 
exhibition could harm international relations between the united 
states and china 
david klinger a spokesman for the fish and wildlife service 
said the agency found a more conclusive demonstration of benefit 
to the species in the toledo case 
the decision also said having an exhibition in detroit at the 
same time one was under way in nearby toledo would reduce the 
educational benefits 
backers of the toledo exhibit reached agreement for the loan 
with the china wildlife conservation association which is 
affiliated with chinas national government 
the michigan organizers dealt with official bodies in sichuan 
province where most wild pandas live the provincial authorities 
in turn handled contacts with chinas national government stypula 
said 
william reilly president of the world wildlife fund praised 
the denial of the michigan permit shortterm loans of giant 
pandas to the united states were out of control he said 
economic incentives simply cannot be allowed to drive american 
zoos and amusement parks to import pandas

leaders of the seven summit nations today 
endorsed a us proposal to curb the laundering of drug profits and 
strongly condemned terrorism in all forms including the taking of 
hostages 
the leaders pledged their full contribution to international 
efforts to resettle afghan refugees and while welcoming 
ussoviet reductions in nuclear arms they said the soviet 
military buildup in the far east is a major source of instability 
in asia 
in a statement read by canadian foreign minister joe clark the 
leaders took positive note of east european countries growing 
interest in ending their economic isolation but said commerce with 
those countries should be on a commercial basis under the rules of 
international trade 
the statement said terrorists must not go unpunished and 
endorsed the principle that hijacked aircraft should not be allowed 
to take off once they have landed 
on drugs the leaders supported the recent us initiative for a 
special task force to coordinate the global fight against narcotics 
and said greater efforts are especially needed to trace freeze 
and confiscate the proceeds of drug traffickers and to curb money 
laundering 
left out of the joint statement were several contentious 
regional issues where the leaders took an unofficial stand 
on the middle east they said the violence on the israeliheld 
west bank showed the need for a negotiated settlement between 
israel and its arab neighbors and on south africa they called for 
clemency for the sharpeville six five black men and one woman 
sentenced to hang for a lynchmob attack on a black policeman on 
southeat asia they called for the withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
from cambodia and reestablishment of the countrys independence

president pw botha said monday 
he would appoint a black cabinet minister but his government would 
not give blacks a oneman onevote system despite increasing 
pressure from antiapartheid campaigners 
such systems have failed in africa botha said in a speech 
to parliament africa is a graveyard of failed experiments with 
western models and systems rammed down its throat 
he reiterated his intention to name a black cabinet minister as 
a means of giving the 26 million black majority a voice in the 
central government but said his government would press ahead with 
social reforms based on group rights not individual rights 
the south african president described as absolute nonsense a 
proposal by democratic party policymakers in the united states to 
designate south africa a terrorist state 
to declare south africas actions against terrorists to be 
terrorism is to call a fireman an arsonist botha told a joint 
sitting of parliament which includes white asian and mixedrace 
chambers 
he said security forces have recently seized several african 
national congress guerrillas responsible for explosions in pretoria 
and nearby black townships as well as the murder of three black 
policemen 
the law and order ministry later said 23 suspected guerrillas 
had been arrested in the past three months in connection with 16 
attacks including a bombing june 3 near johannesburg that killed 
four people 
the anc banned in south africa is the largest guerrilla group 
fighting the south african government and its policy of apartheid 
which gives the countrys 5 million whites control of the 
government and the economy 
botha said revolutionaries have suffered severe setbacks but 
that they were planning an intensified onslaught in the next 
few months including a campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal 
elections in october 
botha appealed to exiled militants including anc members to 
renounce violence 
information minister stoffel van der merwe at a news briefing 
to elaborate on bothas speech said legislation would be 
introduced in august to eliminate a requirement that cabinet 
ministers be parliament members 
this requirement prevents cabinet membership for blacks who are 
excluded from parliament 
he complained of increasing attempts to interfere in our 
domestic affairs to isolate south africa and to increase pressure 
on us 
van der merwe cited as an example of this pressure the 
international campaign seeking clemency for the sharpeville six a 
group of blacks sentenced to hang for complicity in the 1984 mob 
killing of a black local official 
it becomes very difficult to judge the case purely on its 
merits because of the tremendous political pressure put on the 
state president and the south african government van der merwe 
said 
bothas speech came on the eve of a joint debate by parliaments 
three chambers on legislation to create a negotiating forum with 
the disenfranchised black majority 
it will be the first time since the multiracial parliament was 
created in 1984 that members of all three houses will participate 
in a full debate on a bill 
the bill seeks to include moderate blacks in decisionmaking 
but falls short of the oneman onevote system and maintains white 
domination of the government 
many black leaders say they wont participate in the forum zulu 
leader mangosuthu buthelezi a prominent moderate has said he 
wont participate unless imprisoned anc leader nelson mandela is 
freed

while farmers in some parts of the united 
states are suffering through a drought in far west texas along 
the upper rio grande rain is still considered an annoyance 
this years runoff from mountain snow into the rio grande is 40 
percent below average but the regions reservoirs and irrigation 
systems keep on watering the fields without need of a cloud ever 
crossing the desert sky 
thanks to a streak of wet years from 1981 through 1987 the 
flow from the rio grande into elephant butte reservoir totaled 78 
percent above average farmers in southern new mexico and far west 
texas are wellprepared for a run of dry years 
ive been here a decade and i havent seen a shortwater year 
yet edd fifer manager of the el paso county water improvement 
district told the el paso times 
both the el paso and elephant butte irrigation districts rely on 
water stored at southern new mexico reservoirs and farmers in the 
district are guaranteed three acrefeet of water a year if its 
available an acrefoot of water is enough to cover one acre to a 
depth of one foot 
it really does spoil people fifer said with plenty of 
water on hand its tempting to relax water conservation practices 
a dry year reminds people that every drop saved today may be needed 
later he said 
the last year that farmers had to make do with less was 1978 
when they were allotted only nine inches per acre 
but as long as water is left in elephant butte and caballo 
reservoirs farmers downstream dont have to pray for rain in 
fact rain is often an inconvenience 
fields are watered at staggered times based on irrigation 
schedules but a rainstorm means all the fields are wet at the same 
time and then dry out at the same time meaning farmers will be 
demanding water at the same time a few days after the rain 
and a severe rain such as one that hit the mesilla valley in 
september 1987 can damage crops 
at capacity elephant butte and caballo reservoirs can hold 24 
million acrefeet of water about four times the annual amount sent 
downstream for irrigation 
in recent years extra water has been released downstream 
because the reservoirs were full this year that release of extra 
water ended on may 13 
farmers on the us side of the river dont benefit from the 
extra releases because agriculture has adapted to the 
threeacrefeet guarantee but some mexican farmers have pumped the 
extra water left in the rio grande for their fields and are upset 
that the water isnt there this year 
about two weeks ago 40 to 50 farmers from juarez demonstrated 
at the riverside dam protesting the reduced amount of water 
available below the dam said david overvold chief of the water 
and land division of the us bureau of reclamations rio grande 
project

even rembrandt picasso and da vinci might be 
envious of four local artists whose works will soon be seen by tens 
of thousands of onlookers every hour 
the work of the four selected from 77 entrants in the 2nd 
annual billboard competition sponsored by patrick media group of 
dallas inc will be displayed next month on billboards throughout 
dallas 
most of the artwork you have to go to a gallery or museum to 
look at contest winner chong keun chu told the dallas morning 
news but this way everyone can look at it its another way to 
communicate 
marilyn jolly fellow artist and contest winner agreed 
the more that people can look at your work and respond to it 
the more that communication goes on ms jolly said 
i think when you take something thats really commercial and 
then take the commerce out of it thats real interesting said 
pamela nelson whose original artwork measured about the size of a 
bumper sticker soon it will compete with skyscrapers to capture 
the attention of freeway drivers 
contest winner arthello beck jr said the billboard artist must 
keep it simple to get across his or her message 
if someones going to drive by you just get a glimpse of a 
billboard beck said you should say something real quickly and 
get to the point and not have a lot of detail 
ms nelson whose artwork features a distinctively dallas 
clothesline with fashions ranging from neimanmarcus to hypermart 
said some of the entries did not follow becks philosophy 
there were some paintings i thought might need to be by a 
red light she said 
the winning billboards will change locations every 60 days for 
the next 12 months but chu said no matter where his work winds up 
he will find it 
wherever they put it im going to go look at it a lot

manigat and his family arrived today in santo domingo the 
capital of neighboring dominican republic manigat was staying at 
the dominican concorde hotel a hotel spokesman said haiti and the 
dominican republic share the caribbean island of hispaniola 
the president betrayed your confidence and violated the 
constitution he swore to observe namphy said he took a path 
that led irrevocably to the most brutal form of dictatorship to 
this end he attacked the army and shook its high command to make 
it a docile instrument of personal power he thus imperiled the 
conquest of feb 7 
a few hours later the military announced a new cabinet of 
ministers the announcement said the senate and house of deputies 
had been dissolved and that the new government would rule by decree 
the new cabinet announced on staterun television by col gary 
leon general secretary of the armed forces was made up of 11 
members of the military and one civilian 
manigat was inaugurated as president feb 7 the junta stepped 
down after he took office 
manigat retired namphy as commander in chief of haitis 
7000man army on friday charging him with insubordination in 
ordering the transfer of paul and other highranking officers three 
days earlier 
namphy first appeared on staterun television at about 130 am

director of the regional information ministry and a former miami 
teacher he said manigat was upstairs with government ministers 
discussing how to respond to namphys statement when soldiers 
arrived at about 308 am 
i am hearing some noise coming like a machine gun he said 
lowering his voice they are entering the yard now it seems 
like they are smashing the cars in the yard 
at 320 am lescouflair told the miami news he could hear a 
security guard shouting in french dont shoot were coming 
out 
a few minutes later someone was heard yelling hands up in 
french the newspaper said the last words from lescouflair were 
call my wife goodbye 
haitian journalists said troops loyal to manigat were killed 
when soldiers backed by three tanks freed namphy from house arrest 
and stormed the palace namphy had been held at his residence in 
bon repos 15 miles outside the capital 
the front of the palace did not appear damaged and showed no 
sign of battle 
the airport was closed today by midday the streets of the 
capital were busy with cars trucks and pedestrians 
early today radio stations were not broadcasting news only 
music and international operators refused to accept calls one 
operator said namphy ordered operators not to place calls but it 
was possible to dial directly 
people on the streets were aware of what had happened despite 
the lack of radio reports 
its not good for democracy what happened but it may be good 
for haiti said one 22yearold unemployed laborer maybe we 
cannot talk but maybe we can work 
the fighting began after a 10minute blackout at about 730 pm 
sunday the streets of this caribbean capital became deserted 
automatic and heavy caliber gunfire broke out around the palace 
heard from a hotel two blocks away it died down then surged 
for 1 hours again just after midnight when explosions also were 
heard 
government sources said manigat 57 was taken by ambulance from 
his home to a military hospital a haitian journalist said manigat 
would be expelled from the country 
an agence francepress reporter spoke by telephone with manigat 
early today and reported the president said he was uninjured 
earlier sunday manigat retired the portauprince police chef 
and transferred about two dozen officers including the head of the 
presidential guard 
the presidential guard went to get namphy and brought him to 
the palace said the western diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the army has controlled this impoverished nation during most of 
its 184year history a junta ruled haiti for two years after 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in france in february 
1986 
the military ran the jan 17 balloting in which manigat was 
elected the most popular candidates and most voters boycotted the 
election and it was widely criticized as rigged 
an independently run election nov 29 was thwarted by violence 
that left more than 30 people dead 
pauls soldiers were blamed for much of the violence after 
which the united states withheld 60 million in aid paul was 
indicted in march by a us grand jury on drug trafficking charges

peoples of source and transit countries there is an urgent need 
for improved international cooperation in all appropriate fora on 
programs to counter all facets of the illicit drug problem in 
particular production trafficking and financing of the drug

the reagan justice department was asleep at 
the switch three years ago when a pentagon investigator 
discovered that defense contractors and private consultants were 
illegally obtaining pentagon weapons secrets sen charles e 
grassley said today 
attorney general edwin meese iii denied the accusation saying 
at a news conference that the prosecution of defense procurement 
cases has been one of the departments top priorities and that at 
no time has this department had to be dragged into any indictment 
where the evidence is there 
grassley riowa said in a floor speech that a top justice 
department official grabbed the microphone from the investigator in 
october 1985 as the investigator was about to testify about his 
findings 
grassley who chaired the house judiciary subcommittee at the 
time said i stopped the hearing at that point i wish now i 
hadnt there wasnt anything in that testimony that could have 
jeopardized that case 
the public must be made aware of the fact that the justice 
department was asleep at switch grassley said because it was 
investigating a single company and ignoring reports of widespread 
abuse in procurement including bribery 
the october 1985 testimony alleged that private consultants were 
regularly receiving classified details about us weapons systems 
the justice department could have pursued this aggressively 
more than three years ago but they didnt he said in an earlier 
interview with the associated press 
the 2yearold probe has focused chiefly on navy weaponsbuying 
it became public last week when fbi and naval investigative service 
agents conducted coasttocoast raids on the offices of past and 
present pentagon officials private consultants and contractors 
us attorney henry hudson has said privately that perhaps as 
many as 200 indictments could be expected out of the investigation 
a government source said sunday 
in october 1985 grassley was chairman of the senate judiciary 
administrative practices subcommittee a panel which he used to 
examine defense procurement practices grassley is a frequent 
critic of what he calls widespread waste and abuse in pentagon 
spending 
grassley said justice department officials blocked the testimony 
of robert segal a defense department investigator who was the 
pentagons liaison with the justice departments defense 
procurement fraud unit the dpfu was a special justice department 
office set up to investigate waste in the military budget 
it was well known in the justice department that some elements 
of the pentagon and the justice department held dpfu in low esteem 
and there is speculation that when the current allegations first 
came to light the matter was steered away from the agency and into 
hudsons office 
segal who worked for the pentagons defense criminal 
investigative service was prepared to testify that private 
consultants regularly received classified pentagon documents that 
should not have been available outside the government grassley 
said 
segal also reported at the time that many of these defense 
companies appear to have espionage units whose main function is to 
obtain copies of highly classified documents in order to give their 
companies a competitive edge grassley said 
grassley said the allegations predated the current 
investigation this goes back much before what were seeing 
now he said 
segals testimony which he never got to deliver but which was 
released publicly at the time said that a defense procurement 
criminal case against gte corp is but the tip of the proverbial 
iceberg the investigation involves at least 25 companies 
many of those companies are household words the primary focus 
of the case is the indiscriminate distribution of both 
proprietary and highly classified government documents by 
individuals within and without the government 
justice department official victoria toensing interrupted the 
key part of segals testimony before he could give it and demanded 
that it be halted saying that he was touching on areas that 
concerned criminal matters pending against gte 
after the contents of segals testimony came out in the news 
media the justice department issued a statement saying that the 
release by sen grassleys staff of erroneous misleading and 
inflammatory information about a criminal case that is currently 
pending trial is most unfortunate and regrettable justice must 
not be allowed to become a political football 
responding to grassley meese told a news conference that 
investigating and prosecuting defense procurement fraud has been 
one of the departments top priorities for several years the 
attorney general said that since 1985 the defense procurement 
fraud unit has obtained about 43 indictments and criminal 
informations in significant cases has obtained 35 convictions and 
has recovered some 32 million 
when asked about segals testimony that the department had not 
vigorously pursued the passing along of confidential information 
meese said that i can assure you that at no time has this 
department had to be dragged into any indictment where the evidence 
is there meese also said there were a number of spinoff cases 
that grew out of the gte probe which are being prosecuted he did 
not identify them 
president reagan attending a summit meeting of the leaders of 
western democracies in toronto refused to comment sunday on 
reports that former navy secretary john lehman jr may have warned 
his longtime ally military consultant melvyn paisley that paisley 
was under investigation 
i am not going to comment until we have all the information 
reagan said 
lehman has not returned numerous phone calls from the associated 
press seeking comment 
paisley a former top navy official and close friend of lehman 
has emerged as a principal target of the investigation the fbi is 
looking at paisleys dealings with a number of major defense 
contractors that hired him as a consultant shortly after he left 
his navy job in april 1987 
grassley said the scandal results from an atmosphere caused by 
a businessasusual goodoldboy network where people move from 
the pentagon to cushy jobs in private industry and everybody looks 
out for their friends 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn interviewed 
on abctvs this week with david brinkley said the reagan 
administration concentrated too much on obtaining more money for 
the pentagon without paying enough attention to how it was being 
spent 
we had people being selected for their ideological beliefs 
for their salesmanship but not for good sound management i think 
the emphasis has been on salesmanship and getting the money and the 
management end of it has been the last of the list of priorities 
said nunn dga 
his view was echoed by rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee who also appeared on the abc show 
the decisions in the lehman navy were really highly 
centralized in a few people right around the secretary john 
lehman and he had a very strong view about people who were with 
him and people who were against him and some of the people who 
were with him may be a little shady characters aspin said

outside the formidable brick fortress that is 
home to the new york athletic club members reacted angrily monday 
to a us supreme court decision that could force them to accept 
women in their midst 
thats a bad and sad piece of news said one middleaged 
man who like all of the nearly two dozen members approached for 
comment refused to give his name 
said another welldressed man heading into the club if men 
want to get together and have a club whats wrong with that 
the supreme court unanimously ruled that new york citys local 
law 63 is constitutional the 1984 law bans discrimination in clubs 
that have more than 400 members provide regular meal service and 
rent their facilities to nonmembers for private functions 
in boston the last bastions of singlesex socializing have a 
month to decide to fight or switch in light of the ruling said 
licensing board chairwoman andrea gargiulo 
she said the somerset club and tavern club for men and the 
chilton club for women must decide to comply with the citys 
policy or a public hearing will be held to determine whether any 
club should be exempted 
new york had targeted four clubs for refusing to comply the 
century association the new york athletic club the union league 
club ed a 
covert intelligence operation in england using a palestinian double 
agent british prosecutors said the agent ismail hassan sowan 28 
spied on a palestine liberation organization member wanted in 
connection with terrorist acts including the killing in london of 
arab cartoonist ali naji awad aladhami 
the mossad carried out the operation without informing british 
authorities of its activities or that the wanted man abder rahmane 
mustapha was living in britain 
a british court thursday sentenced sowan to 11 years in prison 
for possessing explosives and firearms which he kept for mustapha 
at his home in the central english city of hull 
prosecutors also accused the double agent of spying for israel 
and the plo the british indicated they had not been fully briefed 
about sowans connection to the mossad 
the discovery of an israeli double agent in a plo hit squad 
was apparently the straw that broke the camels back 
editorialized the daily haaretz referring to mounting british 
displeasure over other mossad activities in britain 
but foreign minister shimon peres stressed that the mossad did 
not carry out operations on british soil that were harmful to 
british interests 
we are not seeking any british targets in britain in all the 
world we are trying to prevent attacks on israelis peres told 
israel radio 
i think both governments are interested in not shaking 
relations he said 
a foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said israel has ruled out the expulsion of a british 
diplomat from israel in retaliation for the british action 
londons response was excessive in light of israels friendly 
relations with britain and the knowledge that the double agents 
activity had been directed not against britain but against the 
terror squad that commited an act of murder in britain haaretz 
said 
in london a television program said monday that prime minister 
margaret thatcher had secretly warned the israeli government in 
october to restrain its secret agents in britain or risk their 
expulsion 
we made our profound concern known to the israeli government 
last autumn at a fairly high level said a spokesmen for mrs 
thatchers office

they were city kids on their first cub scout 
camping trip and when they came across a lake on a hot summer day 
they did what kids will do they jumped in 
first one boy drowned and then another and no one seems to 
know exactly how or why 
did joel nieves dive into lake ohrbach in grief after the body 
of his friend luis ruiz was pulled from the bottom or did the 
two 9yearold brooklyn boys drown together 
were in the process now of ascertaining that specific 
information said deputy inspector william wallace the detective 
in charge of the case as an investigation into the weekend deaths 
continued monday 
joel and luis were both members of cub scout pack 74 which is 
affiliated with st pauls lutheran church in the williamsburg 
section of brooklyn with 16 other boys they had gone to camp 
pouch a 130acre oasis of woodland on staten island on friday 
night for their first weekend camp out 
they were less than 10 miles from home just over the 
verrazanonarrows bridge from brooklyn but a world apart 
they were going to make a nice weekend of it and they had the 
best of intentions bob williams a spokesman for the boy scouts 
of america said of the cub packs adult leaders they were doing 
what we want them to do take the kids to camp let them sleep 
outside see the stars the whole thing 
the leaders were warned by the camp director both verbally and 
in writing that the lake was offlimits for swimming williams 
said the lake is open only later in the summer when there is 
fulltime supervision 
but saturday grew hot it was 85 degrees that afternoon and 
the cub leaders apparently decided to let the boys wade into the 
water what could go wrong when youre wading right said 
williams 
but things went very wrong 
first luis was seen slipping beneath the surface there were 
frantic efforts to rescue him culminating when a nearby boy scout 
troop formed a human chain and methodically combed through the 
water 
about 15 minutes after luis had vanished he was found about 20 
feet offshore and eight feet underwater lying in the mud on the 
bottom of the lake he was taken to staten island hospital where 
he died sunday evening 
about an hour after luis was found the cub leaders discovered 
joel was missing one boy scout 17yearold raymond goffin who 
had pulled luis from the water said he had observed joel sitting 
on the shore looking distressed and saying i was supposed to go 
down to the bottom with him 
another person a woman who was with the cub pack said she 
saw the boy running up a trail away from the lake according to 
williams a search of the campground ensued but it was not until 
sunday morning that anyone looked in the lake 
at 940 am police department scuba divers found joels body 
there not far from where his friend had been found 
joel nieves the son of a leader in brooklyns hispanic 
community was to have received an award for excellence at public 
school 19 on monday instead it was to be accepted posthumously by 
friends 
he could have been a future leader of our community a 
lawyer a teacher a public official said david santiago who 
works with joels father saul nieves at a community group casa 
del barrio he was a very disciplined kid a very astute kid 
i was very impressed by the level of sensitivity that joel had 
santiago said he doubted the boy scouts version of events 
that joel had jumped into the lake after luis was pulled out he 
criticized the police department for not sending scuba divers into 
the lake immediately 
wallace the police detective said he still didnt know what 
happened but that four witnesses so far had told authorities that 
they saw joel out of the water after luis was found 
he wouldnt rule out the possibility of criminal charges against 
one of the adults who allowed the youths into the water but that 
didnt appear likely were going further with the investigation 
only to ascertain exactly what occurred wallace said 
williams the boy scout spokesman placed the blame squarely on 
the cub scout leaders while we understand that kids are kids 
thats why we have adult leadership he said the adults are 
supposed to follow the rules and regulations i think thats where 
this one went wrong 
but he said the scouts wouldnt take any action against the pack 
leaders 
were very sorry that it happened our hearts go out to the 
parents our hearts go out to everybody involved williams said 
the individual whos responsible hes got to live with this for 
the rest of his life 
none of the scout leaders could be reached for comment there 
was no answer at st pauls lutheran church where the pack has its 
headquarters and neither the boy scouts nor the police would give 
out the leaders names 
however in an interview with the new york times felix gomez 
who was identified as an assistant cubmaster said that another 
unnamed assistant had allowed the boys to go into the water gomez 
said he had forbidden the scouts from swimming or fishing

the navys rescue swimmer school reopened 
monday but its curriculum no longer includes the sharks and 
daisies rescue drill that was in progress when a panicking 
recruit died officials said 
the school at the pensacola naval air station was closed shortly 
after the march 2 death of airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of 
appleton wis 
five instructors have been charged with involuntary manslaughter 
and conspiracy to commit battery for allegedly forcing mirecki back 
into a swimming pool after he asked to quit in the midst of the 
sharks and daisies drill the officer in charge of the school 
is accused of dereliction of duty 
all six face possible courtmartial and they have been relieved 
of duty pending action on their cases and replaced at the school 
officials said 
i can tell you the sharks and daisies exercise is not in the 
new curriculum said lt cmdr dennis hessler public affairs 
officer for the naval education and training command headquartered 
in pensacola 
in that drill instructors randomly grabbed students in 
headholds to simulate people panicking in the water a student was 
supposed to pull his instructor underwater to break the hold and 
then make the rescue 
instructors will not personally participate in practical 
application drills under the revised procedures said lt lee 
saunders a spokesman for the naval air training command in corpus 
christi texas 
instead students will practice the drills on each other 
the navy charged that after mirecki failed once in the exercise 
petty officer 2nd class michael combe held his head underwater when 
the drill was resumed 
during an investigative hearing two weeks ago there was 
conflicting testimony on whether mirecki collapsed while in combes 
grip 
some instructors and a student testified mirecki had 
successfully broken combes grip and had the instructor in tow 
instructors had testified that pulling tired scared or 
malingering students into the pool or off of its walls was a common 
procedure at the school 
a navy pathologist testified that mirecki had a phobia about 
being dragged under water which triggered heart failure followed 
by drowning he died when allegedly shoved back into the pool after 
he had climbed out and declared his intent to dor or drop 
on request from the school 
new procedures explicitly require that a student be pulled out 
of an exercise immediately if he asks to quit is fatiqued or shows 
signs of fear panic or lack of confidence navy spokesmen said 
they made it quite clear what the safety and drop on request 
procedures are hessler said students may voluntarily drop on 
request at any time 
hearing testimony indicated safety procedures were at best 
unclear the revised curriculum requires that four staffers be 
posted on the pool deck as safety observers at all times and that 
one of them must be the officer in charge or a chief petty officer 
the school has one officer and two chief petty officers 
the school was allowed to reopen only after the procedural 
changes were approved by adm carlisle trost chief of naval 
operations 
the first days training was limited to dry land activity with 
initial classes in the pool beginning tuesday hessler said 
rear adm david r morris chief of naval air training 
headquartered in corpus christi texas is expected to make a 
decision on whether the accused should be courtmartialed given 
nonjudicial punishment or cleared of the charges by july 1

a campaign is being launched this week against a 
florida constitutional amendment which would make english the 
states official language 
english plus will air radio spots and sponsor speakers around 
the state to deliver the message than an englishonly law is 
discriminatory and could cripple business and tourism in a state 
with strong ties to latin america 
the immediate impact even if nothing else happens is to make 
us look like a redneck state said ambler moss a committee 
member and former ambassador to panama who now works at the 
university of miami 
advocates of the constitutional amendment appear to have 
sufficient signatures to put the issue on the ballot the law 
aimed largely at floridas growing spanishspeaking community 
would prohibit state and local governments from using languages 
other than english in conducting public business 
english plus composed of community and bussiness leaders 
counters that the law would make it impossible for state and local 
government to promote florida in latin america besides sending a 
message to foreign businessmen and tourists that they are not 
welcome 
the issue goes to the very heart of what florida is all 
about said english plus chairman osvald soto 
other english plus supporters include the greater miami chamber 
of commerce which has made defeat of the amendment a top priority 
harvardeducated lawyer jon weber and the hispanic coalition 
unidos 
supporters say the amendment is necessary and claim it would 
even help foreigners by forcing them to learn english 
opponents largely agree that immigrants who come to this country 
need to learn english but dont think the amendment would 
accomplish that mark gallegos presidentelect of the hispanic 
national bar association and a spokesman for several national latin 
interest groups said supporters are masking their true purpose 
if it passes not one single person will learn english because 
of it he said its merely a statement of false nationalism 
its a reflection of underlying bigotry and xenophobia

a hay hotline has been set up for 
farmers seeking fodder from as far west as kansas to feed their 
cattle in the face of the grasswilting drought ohio officials 
said monday 
weve been sending word out across the state and anywhere else 
that would listen that we need hay said marion e freeman 
cooperative extension agent in mercer county in west central ohio 
mercer county usually is ohios topincome agricultural county 
and is one of the centers of the states dairy industry 
freeman said he asked the agriculture department last week to 
handle calls from both farmers who badly need hay and those who may 
have some to sell 
i told him wed be willing to do it said alice walters 
spokeswoman for the agriculture department 
we did this two years ago with the haylift to the south so 
were not new at this she said 
two years ago mercer county sent 12 boxcars of hay to parched 
southern farms but theyre in the same situation we are and 
farmers realize they cant expect much help from their southern 
brethren freeman said 
farmers have been lining up hay in michigan pennsylvania and 
kansas but those supplies are drying up too he said 
michael broering who has a 70head dairy herd near maria stein 
was on the phone most of the morning lining up hay he said a 
friend in pennsylvania had contacts who could provide 3000 bales 
about a fivemonth supply for a reasonable 85 a ton some of the 
western hay is as high as 150 a ton broering said 
i guess now is the time you call in all your friends he 
said 
broering said his first cutting of hay produced only 20 percent 
of normal and the second cutting this month probably will produce 
less two more weeks of little rain and farmers will be forced to 
buy feed to cover their needs through next april he said 
he is beginning to sell some of his registered holstein cows

youll never be lonely if you read 
mrs reagan joined the wives of four other world leaders 
attending the annual economic summit of industrialized nations in

about a mischievous cat named josephine who disrupted school one 
day 
five children who accompanied mrs reagan and the other wives 
took turns reading from can you catch josephine the book was 
written by stephane poulin a 24yearold author from montreal 
canada 
after finishing the tale the children shyly asked the wives in 
their native language a question 
gina lin 8 a thirdgrader at lord lansdowne school asked mrs 
reagan what type of books she preferred 
i read every kind of book the first lady told the child 
i read a lot she said my husband reads a lot our 
children read a lot ever since they were very young 
if you learn to read when youre young mrs reagan 
counseled as you get older you know that youll never be lonely 
if you read youll always have a friend there theres always 
something to do

the supreme court on monday saved the roman 
catholic church at least temporarily from having to pay 100000 
a day in court fines for withholding documents in a lawsuit by a 
group supporting abortion rights 
the justices voting 81 overturned a contempt citation against 
the church stemming from a lawsuit challenging the churchs 
taxexempt status 
the justices sent the case back to the lower courts to determine 
whether abortion rights mobilization inc has legal standing to sue 
the federal government to revoke the churchs tax exemption because 
of its antiabortion lobbying 
the suit by the prochoice group is against the government not 
the church and the underlying issue is whether private citizens 
have the legal power to challenge a tax exemption granted by the 
government 
writing for the court monday justice anthony m kennedy said 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals must determine whether the 
federal courts even have the authority to decide the underlying 
issue 
kennedy said if the 2nd circuit court decides the federal judge 
who issued the contempt holding lacks proper jurisdiction the 
church is under no obligation to provide its records and may not be 
held in contempt 
a ruling that the abortion rights group does not have the power 
to sue could kill the suit effectively 
lawrence lader president of the prochoice group said we 
feel this is simply delaying going to trial the gods are not 
favoring going to trial 
but lader said he expected the lower courts would permit the 
suit to proceed 
monsignor daniel f hoye general secretary of the national 
conference of catholic bishops and the us catholic conference 
hailed the high court ruling 
the action of the court gives the bishops some measure of 
justice and vindicates their action in appealing to the supreme 
court he said 
he said he hoped a federal appeals court will now reconsider 
its earlier ruling and uphold the right of churches and other 
taxexempt organizations to participate in public debate and other 
controversial issues free of retaliatory litigation brought by 
their political opponents 
beverly lahaye head of the conservative concerned women for 
america said the high court ruling is truly a victory for all 
americans and for the first amendment in general 
she said the decision allows taxexempt organizations to 
challenge the legal basis of frivolous lawsuits against them 
without facing stiff fines 
abortion rights mobilization says in its eightyearold suit 
that the churchs taxexempt status gives it an unfair advantage in 
the political battle over abortion rights 
it said tax breaks for the church violate a provision of the 
federal tax code barring any taxexempt organization from spending 
money on political activities 
the supreme court was asked to decide whether the suit against 
the government can go forward not whether the churchs tax 
exemption should be revoked 
the 2nd circuit last year upheld a 1986 ruling by a federal 
judge in new york city who found the church in civil contempt for 
refusing to supply its records to the prochoice coalition 
the judge ordered the church to pay 100000 a day until it 
supplied the documents the contempt ruling had been put on hold 
pending a high court decision 
the justices ruled monday that the church although a witness 
rather than one of the opposing sides in the lawsuit still had the 
right to appeal the contempt citation prior to the outcome of the 
suit 
justice thurgood marshall was the lone dissenter

the leaders of the sevennation economic summit 
on monday said all legal options available should be used to 
secure clemency for six black south africans who have been 
condemned to death 
in a statement read to reporters by canadian foreign minister 
joe clark the seven leaders also said that recent moves by the 
whiteled government to stop antiapartheid groups from receiving 
funds from foreign sources would place severe strain on the 
relations each of us has with south africa 
the statement on south africa issued separately from a 
political communique also urged an end to the civil war in angola 
and called on south africa to implement longstanding united 
nations resolutions designed to grant independendce to nabmibia or 
southwest africa 
the south african blacks known as the sharpville six were 
convicted of complicity in the 1984 mob killing in sharpeville 
township of a black town councillor during riots provoked by a rent 
increase 
there has been an international campaign seeking clemency for 
the six five men and a woman who have been sentenced to hang 
president pw botha has rejected a clemency petition 
the six were not convicted of directly killing the councillor 
but found guilty under the doctrine of common purpose which held 
them responsible because they actively participated in the mob 
which killed him 
the statement omitted any reference to the most contentious 
issue the impositon of sanctions against south africa by the 
wealthy western nations 
british prime minisiter margaret thatcher whose country is a 
major trading partner with south africa and other european nations 
have refused to implement such tough measures 
canada the summit host which has scant links with south 
africa has for years beens sharply critical of the british 
attitude 
a british spokesman said we have no problems with this 
statement at all 
we declare our our abhorrence of apartheid which must be 
replaced through a process of genuine national negotiations by a 
nonracial democracy said the summit statement 
the leaders said they also express our urgent opinion on the 
other issues including the sharpeville six 
all legal options available in south africa should be used to 
secure clemency for the sharpeville six they said

east german leader erich honecker told a nuclear 
disarmament conference monday that eastern and western europe 
should establish ways to keep in constant touch to avert possible 
military crises and suggested a hotline 
honecker called for mechanisms for the peaceful discussion of 
crises and for the prevention of military incidents 
for example perhaps there could be a hotline between prague 
berlin and bonn honecker said 
delegates from 110 countries are attending the threeday 
conference in east berlin that began monday 
among the delegates are us peace activists west german 
politicians officials from the warsaw pact palestine liberation 
organization leader yassir arafat and chedli klibi 
generalsecretary of the arab league 
honecker has been a strong proponent of a european nuclear 
weaponsfree zone and arranged the conference he said in his 
opening address that such a zone would lessen the military 
confrontation in europe 
but many nato leaders including west german chancellor helmut 
kohl reject the idea saying western europe would still be 
endangered by warsaw pact troops outside such a corridor and by 
soviet nuclear forces 
west germanys conservative christian democratic union and 
christian social union parties coalition partners in the federal 
government turned down invitations to the conference 
but invitations were accepted by the free democrats junior 
partners in the coalition and by west germanys opposition social 
democrats and greens parties 
piotr demichev soviet communist party politburo candidate and 
the kremlins representative at the east berlin meeting read a 
letter from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev addressed to the 
conference 
quoting gorbachev demichev said the soviet union fully supports 
setting up a nuclearfree zone in central europe 
the soviet union is ready to give up its status as a 
nuclear power as soon as possible demichev said 
but as long as we have this status we are ready for radical 
reductions and its practical forms this includes support for 
establishing nuclearfree zones demichev said reading from

superfund toxic dump cleanups by the 
environmental protection agency are permitting widely divergent 
concentrations of contaminants to remain in the ground a trade 
group and six environmental organizations told congress monday 
there is no justification for creating these discrepancies 
they said 
epa however argued in testimony before the investigations 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee that 
differing residual contamination did not mean that some cleanups 
failed to protect public health and the environment 
j winston porter assistant administrator in charge of 
superfund said youve got to look at the facts on the ground 
though regional offices make most decisions porter himself is 
in charge of three dioxin cleanups and ill be using different 
action levels at all three he said 
for example at love canal in new york contamination could 
reach fish in the niagara river something not an issue at the 
other sites and the cleanup there will try to guard against that 
he said 
rep dennis eckart dohio chairing the hearing told porter 
folks dont understand that you are leaving them a cleanup that 
is equally protective when contamination differs maybe science 
will tell us that they are equally protective but our 
constituents arent 
the report examining all superfund cleanup decisions of the 1987 
fiscal year was compiled by the hazardous waste treatment council 
a group of firms offering waste treatment and the environmental 
defense fund the national audubon society the national wildlife 
federation the natural resources defense council the sierra club 
and the us public interest research group 
much of it paralleled findings last week by the congressional 
office of technology assessment that epa is largely ignoring the 
mandate of 1986 amendments requiring it to prefer permanent 
cleanups that treat the waste destroying it reducing its volume 
or stabilizing it rather than simply confining it in the ground 
we learn from the schmaltz dump at harrison wis record of 
decision that soil lead concentrations greater than 14 parts per 
million pose an unacceptable lifetime risk from direct contact the 
rose township mich site set a level for lead in soil that is 
five times higher than at schmaltz and two new jersey cleanups 
permit 100 ppm the cooper road site in voorhees township and the 
williams property at swainton the report said in one example 
the difference results from inconsistent exposure assumptions 
the report said for example at schmaltz dump epa assumed 
children would consume an average of one gram of dirt per day at 
rose township epa assumed children would have no access to the 
soil 
why should citizens not believe that with these widely varying 
cleanup goals that epa is using the practical equivalent of a dart 
board said blake early sierra club representative 
walter kovalik deputy director of the superfund office said 
epa expects to promulgate by the end of the year uniform standards 
for regional offices to use in calculating exposures to 
contaminants 
asked by eckart whether capping waste in the ground could be a 
permanent remedy porter replied i think it can be 
even though the agencys use of treatment and destruction 
cleanups is increasing he said we simply have some sites where 
like it or not there isnt enough money in the world to dig up all 
that material and burn it 
the real question is are we going to spread that money over a 
lot of sites which is what we thought congress intended or are we 
going to spend it all on a few sites porter said 
epa appeared to be supported against the major criticisms of the 
office of technology assessment and the environmental groups by 
clean sites inc the industrybacked private group that arranges 
private cleanups 
thomas grumbly president of clean sites said it would be a 
mistake to jump immediately to the conclusion that the epa is 
not doing its job 
grumbly said the most important superfund problems stem from the 
facts that costrecovery actions and suits against recalcitrant 
nonsettlers at sites have been minimal and the agency has 
rarely used combined funding where both it and polluters 
contribute to cleanups

the city forged ahead in its longdelayed quest 
to build a new 140 million central library when a design for the 
building was chosen monday from among five proposed plans 
were one step closer to the librarys completion mayor 
eugene sawyer said as officials announced the selection of a design 
for the proposed harold washington library center theres a 
light at the end of the tunnel and its the light of learning 
the sebus group submitted the design selected from the five 
teams of architects developers and builders whose proposals were 
considered for the project that city officials have debated since 
1976 
our main concern was building a firstclass building within 
the historic context said thomas beeby the head architect for 
the sebus group 
the librarys interior will feature international television 
programs picked up by satellite a 400seat theater and a 23 
million volume book collection 
the citys library board still must vote on whether to build the 
new library 
the new 700000squarefoot library would cost 140 million to 
build and is scheduled to be completed in 1991 
the bulk of the central librarys collection has been kept in a 
warehouse since 1974 when it was moved from a central library 
building built in 1897 the building built in 1897 replaced a 
library destroyed in the great chicago fire of 1871 but the 
replacement was deemed inadequate within two decades 
the library will be named for the citys first black mayor 
washington died late last year of a heart attack

into the annex this month between 1400 and 1600 federal 
employees will be located there when the moves are completed

most haitians refugees support neither their 
homelands newly deposed president nor his military replacement 
and worry that violence and confusion will only further impoverish 
the country exile leaders said monday 
lt gen henri namphy declared himself president monday only 
hours after his troops invaded the haitian presidential palace in 
portauprince and took civilian president leslie manigat into 
custody 
they imposed manigat on us they imposed namphy said the 
rev gerard jeanjuste head of the haitian refugee center this 
is just one more intrigue between hardcore duvalier supporters 
namphy was president of the threeman junta that ruled haiti for 
two years after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in 
france in february 1986 the junta was disbanded after manigat was 
elected president in january 
manigat won his post in a january election that many haitians 
here felt was rigged and which excluded all major opposition 
figures in the latest crisis manigat formed an unsuccessful 
alliance with col jeanclaude paul who is under indictment in 
miami for drug trafficking and also was blamed for the violence 
that aborted haitis first postduvalier presidential election in 
november 
few in miamis haitian community which may number up to 
100000 feel there is much difference between manigat and namphy 
the people are sick and tired of the same names every day 
said fred st armand on a street in little haiti there has to be 
somebody new something has to be done 
some however saw manigat as the lesser of two evils and 
regret the coup 
the military is messing up everything in haiti they have the 
money but they they had no patriotism said viter juste a 
haitian exile who lives in miami it is still better to keep 
manigat 
the coup means more than ever the duvalier regime is getting 
back in power juste said 
jeanjuste said he and several other vocal miamiarea opponents 
of the haitian regime are on a death list drawn up by the remnants 
of the dreaded tonton macoute the duvaliers secret police the 
list was published in haiti at the same time the group promised to 
overthrow manigat he said 
i take it seriously said jeanjuste but we have many 
people supporting us here in miami 
jeanjuste and many haitian leaders blame the united states for 
supporting the military despite its poor human rights record and 
lack of respect for democracy 
the fact is that the united states has armed the haitian 
military for so long and it was the same military that shot 
civilians who were trying to exercise their right to vote said 
roger biamby of the haitianamerican community association of dade 
the thing to do is to remove those military macoutes from 
power so that the haitian people can go about their business of 
building democracy and the economy of the country biamby said

the drought withering crops in parts of the 
nation wont mean hunger if it continues but could mean disaster 
for farmers and spiraling costs for consumers agriculture 
secretary richard e lyng said monday 
lyng said the worst threat to the agricultural economy is in the 
corn belt the midwestern region where corn and cornfed livestock 
are raised but problems also are looming for southern soybean 
growers 
corn is the most important crop in the united states soybeans 
is second lyng said after a speech to the institute of food 
technologists convention if those are lost who can say what it 
will mean its never happened before 
it wont mean hunger not hunger but the threat is severe 
loss of corn and soybeans would lead farmers to start 
liquidating their livestock lyng said resulting in an immediate 
decline in beef prices followed by a sharp rise 
the effect on beef prices could last for years he said 
the drought could be devastating for farmers who made it through 
a series of economic setbacks in recent years 
theres no question things had been improving but there were 
still some difficulties he said yes it could be the telling 
blow for some farmers 
weve done all we can at this time to help farmers with the 
situation our next step will have to be to help those who have no 
crops because of the drought lyng said there will have to be 
disaster declarations in some areas so we can get things like low 
cost loans to people who need them 
on another matter lyng praised a trade agreement signed today 
in tokyo that will ease some japanese restrictive quotas on 
agricultural imports 
japans beef imports will expand by 1 billion citrus imports 
will double lyng said the potential for the united states to 
increase its exports to japan is tremendous

president reagan and prime minister noboru 
takeshita of japan signed an agreement monday to open up japanese 
laboratories to american researchers and limit publication of joint 
research on technology with possible military uses 
at a ceremony in the royal york hotel where he is staying 
during the sevennation economic summit reagan reviewed the 
relationship between the united states and japan in science and 
technology and said our hope is to strengthen the relationship 
for peaceful purposes 
takeshita said the agreement lifts our sights to the 1990s and 
beyond 
the agreement is not exclusive takeshita said it is open 
to be shared by all the world 
the agreement was approved by the japanese cabinet on june 17 
following 10 months of negotiations since it is an agreement not 
a treaty it is not subject to ratification by the senate 
the fiveyear agreement replaces a pact that was temporarily 
renewed five times since it expired in 1985 
because private industry accounts for 80 percent of the funds 
japan invests in research and development compared with 50 percent 
in the united states the us government has been pressing for 
more access to the private laboratories where the bulk of japanese 
research takes place 
japans agreement to restrict publication of sensitive material 
on jointly developed technology was the outcome of criticism that 
the japanese government has been too lax in controlling exports of 
sensitive technology to communist nations 
in one case last year us officials disclosed that toshiba 
machine co a subsdiary of the japanese electronics maker toshiba 
corp had exported submarinesilencing equipment to the soviet 
union 
the pact is scheduled to take effect at the end of this month 
when the current threemonth extension expires 
both countries also agree to protect intellectual rights and 
determine rights to patents arising from joint research before the 
start of laboratory work the agreement also calls for the tokyo 
government to increase finding for scientists and engineers coming 
to japan

ears of us television

technician have been in the gulf since late last year operating 
through the pentagons news media pool 
cocklin 37 and his 34yearold wife both from buffalo ny 
came to the region after the united states offered flag protection 
to kuwaiti oil tankers in july last year 
iran at war with iraq since september 1980 attacks merchant 
vessels in the gulf in retaliation for iraqi raids on 
iranianchartered shipping 
the cocklins who have a 19monthold daughter kate soon 
became a common sight on the navy frigates destroyers and 
helicopters that crisscross the gulf with pool members on board 
asked if they have ever felt their lives were on the line both 
answered without hesitation april 18 that was the day us 
forces destroyed two iranian oil rigs and damaged two frigates in 
daylong fighting that was the most intense since the united states 
began its tanker patrols 
in any other situation weve ever been in any combat you can 
go in get the bangbang and get out but this time we had to stay 
put we were the target mrs cocklin said you just have to 
hope that all those young kids youre seeing there have been 
trained and trained well 
the cocklins were filming from a firing deck of the uss jack 
williams a guided missle frigate when it came under attack off 
the coast of iran north of the strait of hormuz at the southern

it only lasted for about an hour an hour and a half but it 
seemed like a lot longer cocklin said anne said to me i 
wonder if its going to end they kept calling missile inbound 
and theyd go through a lot of maneuvers flank speed throwing 
chaff out it was scary 
at one point a navy helicopter crewman picked up a gun rambo 
style and started firing at what appeared to be an incoming 
missile which passed by the stern of the ship cocklin said

little rock ark the state supreme court on monday postponed 
the execution of murderer r gene simmons who had pleaded after 
his sentencing last month that there be no such delays 
the action came one week before simmons 47 was scheduled to 
receive a lethal injection for killing two people in russellville 
during a 40minute shooting rampage that left four others wounded 
on dec 28 it would have been the states first execution since 
1964 
when he was sentenced on may 12 simmons told judge john s 
patterson he was ready to die saying let the torture and 
suffering in me end 
he apparently hoped to avoid a july 18 trial for the deaths of 
14 relatives whose bodies were found on his isolated property in 
the ozark mountains north of dover 
the 61 ruling monday improves the possibility that simmons will 
be tried in july because even if the state supreme court lets his 
sentence stand gov bill clinton would set the next execution date 
and that process usually takes about 40 days 
in the ruling the states highest court said it would look into 
issues raised by wouldbe intervenor louis j franz of star city 
franz a minister heads arkansas churches for life which 
opposes the death penalty 
i am naturally pleased because i think it gives us an 
opportunity to look further into the matter which has been our 
hope franz said in star city 
marvin evans assistant warden at the maxium security unit of 
the state prison said simmons had no particular reaction when 
informed of the courts decision when asked if he wanted to make a 
statement for the media simmons declined evans said 
the court said it wants to explore these questions 
whether franz has a right to get into the case as a 
representative of simmons interests as franz has filed to do 
whether the state supreme court should have mandatory review of 
death cases or if there is no mandatory review whether the court 
should review a death case waiver of appeal and whether the waiver 
was made knowingly and intelligently 
the supreme court order said simmons the state and franz may 
appear june 28 for oral arguments 
in a dissenting opinion associate justice john purtle said 
there is no requirement or procedure for mandatory review of all 
death sentences simmons had the right to waive the appeal 
provided he did so knowingly and intelligently purtle wrote 
the franklin county circuit court in ozark where simmons was 
convicted held two hearings in which simmons competency to waive 
his appeal was considered 
simmons was convicted may 12 of killing kathy kendrick 24 and 
james chaffin 33 at separate russellville businesses simmons 
surrendered after telling a bystander he had gotten everyone who 
had hurt him

the united states condemned the military 
takeover in haiti on monday and called it a serious blow to hopes 
for democracy 
after reviewing the situation for several hours the state 
department issued a statement through spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
saying it is now clear that a military coup detat has taken 
place in haiti 
the united states government strongly condemns this serious 
blow to hopes for democracy in that troubled land 
mrs oakley also noted that col jeanclaude paul a haitian 
army officer under indictment on drug charges in miami appeared on 
the platform with lt gen henri namphy when namphy announced the 
civilian government led by president leslie manigat had been 
deposed and declared himself president 
manigat who had taken office feb 7 arrived with his family in 
the dominican republic on monday according to military sources 
there 
mrs oakley said the united states had no advance knowledge of 
the coup would continue to press for democracy in haiti and would 
consult with governments in the region on future steps 
were simply looking at the situation and will decide what to 
do she said 
since the removal of haitian dictator jean claude duvalier in 
february 1986 the united states has sought the creation of free 
government institutions and as mrs oakley put it devoted 
considerable resources to the hopedfor transition to democracy 
progress toward democracy has been a condition for restoration 
of 60 million in direct us aid which was suspended last autumn 
during an election campaign marred by massive violence the aid 
remained withheld after the united states said manigats election 
in january was engineered by military authorities 
mrs oakley said the united states still sought strict 
observance of human rights in haiti economic progress to 
alleviate the suffering of the haitian people cooperation on the 
problem of narcotics trafficking and most important the 
establishment of credible transition to a democratic government led 
by civilians in haiti 
meanwhile the united states issued an advisory to wouldbe 
travelers to haiti to defer nonessential trips to the country 
due to the changing political situation and resulting security 
uncertainties 
mrs oakley said there were no reports of american in haiti 
being harmed during the coup 
in toronto canada where president reagan was attending the 
economic summit of major industrialized democracies white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said we do not know exactly what is 
happening or who was behind this coup attempt 
he said our information is sketchy and we are still trying to 
make sure we know all the facts and details he said the coup did 
not come up in the discussions between reagan and the other leaders 
reagan asked by a reporter what was going on in haiti said 
we are assessing that right now 
ernest preeg us ambassador to haiti from 1981 to 1983 said 
the events in haiti reminded him of the situation in panama where 
military leader manuel antonio noriega has resisted us pressure 
to give way to civilian rule 
i think one lesson that we should have learned is that even 
with relatively small weak poor countries such as haiti the 
united states is not able just to flex its financial or whatever 
muscle and make things happen in a certain way preeg said on 
cable news network 
the local power structure in haiti is willing to buck us 
pressure he said 
i think thats a factor that has some relationship some 
bearing with recent experience with panama and its something that 
will be a factor in the months ahead in haiti preeg said

with streams running near record low levels 
and reservoirs beginning to dry up an emergency task force of 
montana water users complained monday that state officials 
squandered preparation time for a drought they should have seen 
coming 
once again we end up waiting until our backs are up against a 
wall drought task force chairman george ochenski said 
the state advisory board of water users including farmers 
ranchers fishing guides and outfitters called on the government 
monday to begin a series of town meetings across montana to inform 
the public and to encourage water conservation 
ochenski and other task force members said they felt state 
officials have been reluctant to plan for drought and promote 
conservation efforts ignoring earlier recommendations for an 
aggressive approach 
it seems to me that its time to tell them hey we told you 
so said richard parks of the fishing and floating outfitters 
association 
meanwhile the drought is burning up some of montanas prime 
cropland the bureau of reclamation says three of its irrigation 
reservoirs in montana could go dry this summer two of them by 
early august 
crop moisture levels are so low in some areas of the state that 
aboveaverage precipitation would be needed simply to salvage 
crops gov ted schwinden has asked that 22 of the states 56 
counties be declared drought disaster areas 
but state agriculture director keith kelly who is not a member 
of the task force later disputed the urgency of the call for 
conservation he said most farmers in montana rely on snow and 
rain not irrigation for crops he questioned how effective water 
conservation efforts would be for those farmers 
we get our water from mother nature he said if she 
treats us right we do well this year she didnt treat us so 
well 
low snowpack last year also lowered stream flows substantially 
and put montana on the verge of a devastating drought but heavy 
summer rains made 1987 a bumper year 
we always hope for rain and weve been saved by rain many 
times said lt gov gordon mcomber but he added even rains 
this month wont save crops in many areas just stop the 
blowing 
in the golden triangle wheatproducing region in north 
central montana kelly added six inches of rain will do you no 
good now 
crops also have been damaged in northeastern montana which has 
baked under record 100degree temperatures while precipitation has 
been about 15 to 30 percent of normal june usually is the rainiest 
month of the year 
kelly noted that many parts of the state are in the fifth or 
sixth year of drought 
montana farmers and ranchers are used to living through these 
cycles mcomber said we havent thrown in the towel yet 
montanas nextyear country

an israeli farmer was found stabbed and 
bludgeoned to death in his vineyard monday police blamed 
palestinian activists and rounded up 20 arab suspects 
this is very serious prime minister yitzhak shamir head of 
the rightwing likud bloc said on israel television if it is 
determined that the murder was motivated by the arab struggle 
against israel we will respond appropriately 
farmer eli cohen was the fourth israeli to be killed in the arab 
uprising that began dec 8 at least 210 palestinians have died 
recent palestinianisraeli violence has occurred primarily in 
jerusalem or in the occupied west bank and gaza strip where 15 
million arabs live under israeli military rule it has rarely 
spilled over into israeli towns 
two soldiers were injured when assailants threw a firebomb at an 
army jeep patrolling gaza city an army official said several 
arabs were detained he said 
in the west bank city of nablus soldiers shot an 18yearold 
arab in the leg during a clash with stonethrowing protesters al 
ittihad hospital officials said 
a dozen soldiers then raided the hospital looking for 
protesters dragged three arab youths outside then released them 
after an interrogation said the hospital officials speaking on 
condition their names not be used the military said it had no 
report of the demonstration or the raid 
the slaying of cohen was particularily shocking to many israelis 
because it occurred in a small isolated farming community inside 
israel 
angry residents of the farming community where cohen lived on 
monday night blocked several roads leading from the neighboring 
arab villages to the socalled green line dividing israel and the 
west bank israel radio said the report did not elaborate 
cohen a 33yearold father of two whose wife was pregnant was 
stabbed in the back and beaten apparently with an iron rod and 
his head was crushed police said 
his body was found near the shekef moshav or collective farm 
where 33 families live the community is near the west bank and 
about 25 miles south of jerusalem it borders three arab villages 
we find ourselves among a hostile population of 40000 arabs 
40000 potential murderers said david ulinsky the security 
officer at the farm speaking on israel radio 
cohen left home sunday evening on a tractor to spray insecticide 
on his vineyard 10 miles away said etti elinsky a farm 
spokeswoman he never returned 
his body was found monday morning by another farmer police 
quickly sealed off the neighboring arab villages and placed two of 
them under curfew 
also monday israeli soldiers welded shut the doors of a 
palestinian charitable organization the el birehbased family 
welfare center and claimed it was being used to brainwash 
children 
the centers director samiha khalil told reporters her 
organization only helped girls and women in distress 
the army also closed four arab schools bringing to nine the 
number of schools shut in the last three days 
dozens of palestinians staged a sitin at the red cross building 
in the gaza strip in solidarity with arab children involved in the 
uprising the twohour protest was in keeping with the latest 
underground leaflet which called for monday to be a day to honor 
palestinian children martyrs 
the association for civil rights in israel said the army has 
resorted to jailing thousands of palestinians without trial simply 
to alleviate the overload of cases in military courts 
the organization also said military police were lethargic in 
investigating allegations of violence by soldiers against arabs 
an army spokesman said jailing without trial was only used in 
cases where a public trial would endanger israeli intelligence he 
denied military police were slow to probe brutality allegations and 
said 350 such cases had been investigated to date 
an explosion caused by a gas leak at a pizzeria in the seaside 
resort of herzliya near tel aviv injured at least 24 israelis tel 
aviv police chief yigal marcus said police were investigating 
whether someone had intentionally caused the leak

the government announced a recall monday of 
scuba diving dry suits using air control valves made by diving 
unlimited international because malfunctioning valves may cause 
serious injury or death 
the consumer product safety commission said owners of dry suits 
with ac air control valves made by the san diegobased diving 
unlimited international inc should immediately stop using the 
dry suits 
the commission said there have been 16 diving incidents 
associated with malfunctioning of the valve which deflates or 
inflates the dry suits to allow divers to equalize air presssure 
while ascending or descending in water 
the commission said that unlike most air control systems which 
have two valves that allow air intake and outflow through two 
separate valves duis onevalve system may freeflow causing 
air to fill the dry suit resulting in the diver rising rapidly to 
the surface or failing to provide sufficient air to maintain 
buoyancy 
dui says owners of suits with the companys valve should return 
their suits to the company and the valve will be replaced at no 
charge

the cias former station chief in costa rica 
was indicted monday on charges he participated in an illegal 
conspiracy to arm the nicaraguan rebels and lied to his superiors 
to keep the operation secret 
joseph f fernandez 51 also known as tomas castillo was 
charged with helping former national security council aide oliver 
l north and arms dealer richard v secord ship arms to the contras 
in 1986 when congress had banned us military assistance to the 
rebels 
the fivecount indictment also charges that fernandez obstructed 
the irancontra investigation conducted last year by the 
presidential commission headed by former sen john tower rtexas 
by stating falsely that he did not know that north was involved in 
covert aid to the contras or that supplies fernandez helped deliver 
included weapons and ammunition 
the indictment alleges that fernandez oversaw construction of an 
airstrip in northern costa rica to help delivery of arms to the 
contras and encouraged rebel leaders to reopen the socalled 
southern front of nicaraguas civil war with promises of military 
assistance 
he also is charged with lying to an official of the cias 
central america task force and later the cias office of inspector 
general about the true nature of the airstrip 
the indictment by the special federal grand jury investigating 
the irancontra affair signalled that independent counsel lawrence 
e walsh is continuing his probe while preparing to try north 
secord former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
arms dealer albert hakim on a separate conspiracy charge 
the judge in those cases gerhard a gesell strongly indicated 
last week that he was ready to set a date for north to go to trial 
in us district court 
gesell has ruled that north and his codefendants should be 
tried separately on charges they conspired illegally to divert 
usiran arms sale profits to the contras 
the case against fernandez was assigned to aubrey e robinson 
jr chief judge of us district court here 
thomas wilson an attorney representing fernandez declined to 
comment on the charges saying he had not had an opportunity to 
review the indictment 
laurence shtasel an associate independent counsel said the 
grand jury was continuing to meet and suggested that its 18month 
term would be extended when it expires next month 
the grand jurys investigation is ongoing i have no further 
comment as to what you should or shouldnt expect shtasel told 
reporters outside the us courthouse after the indictment was 
returned by the grand jury 
fernandez who was named as an unindicted coconspirator in the 
charges returned march 16 against north poindexter hakim and 
secord is accused of conspiring to defraud the us government by 
participating in a clandestine armssupply network for the contras 
the indictment charges that in 1985 fernandez worked in 
coordination with his coconspirators in establishing a clandestine 
supply network to support military and paramilitary operations in 
nicaragua by the contras at a time when direct us military aid 
was banned by congress 
fernandez and his coconspirators acted deceitfully and 
without legal authorization in running the secret supply network 
the indictment said 
the indictment does not specifically name fernandezs alleged 
coconspirators but it notes that he met with robert owen and 
rafael quintero associates of north to discuss the operation 
it notes that north gave him a secure communications device 
obtained from an unidentified government agency fernandez used the 
device to exchange messages with north and quintero a cuban exile 
who had fought in the aborted bay of pigs invasion of cuba and was 
a veteran of other covert cia operations the indictment said 
the indictment charges that fernandez helped north and secord 
coordinate air drops of arms to the southern front in april 1986 
and directed eight other shipments between june and september of 
that year 
he also is accused of opening the socalled southern front of 
the civil war by encouraging contra forces in costa rica to 
reenter the conflict against sandinista troops with promises of 
military aid 
fernandez also is accused of using a panamanian company udall 
research corp to buy land for the airstrip in northwest costa 
rica and supervising its construction in the fall of 1985 
the indictment alleges that fernandez met in the costa rican 
capital city of san jose with william haskell also known as robert 
olmsted at the direction of north and secord haskell was 
identified by the congressional irancontra investigating 
committees as being involved in the negotiations for the airstrip 
land 
as part of the conspiracy count fernandez is charged with 
making a false statement to an official of the cias central 
american task force in late september 1986 during a meeting at the 
agencys headquarters about the true nature of the airstrip 
fernandez who retired from the cia earlier this year also is 
accused of trying to cover up the supply network by sending 
incomplete or unresponsive cable messages in response to the 
central american task forces inquiry 
the task force probe was launched after a c123k cargo plane 
carrying arms to the rebels was shot down over southern nicaragua 
fernandez is separately charged with making a false statement to 
an official of the cias office of inspector general on jan 11 
1987 when he said the airstrip was a project of the costa rican 
government to train its forces for a possible invasion by nicaragua 
fernandez told a private session of the congressional 
irancontra committees that his cia superiors were aware of his 
efforts to help deliver arms to the contras 
according to transcripts later released by the committees 
fernandez said that he misled the tower commission and the cias 
inspector general about his involvement in the supply operation 
but fernandez said that in so doing he thought he was acting 
within the guidelines that had been arranged by clair george the 
cias deputy director for operations who retired last year 
fernandez was one of several cia employees disciplined last 
december by cia director william webster for their roles in the 
irancontra affair asked if he disputed press reports that webster 
had fired his client wilson said maybe yes maybe no it depends 
on the perspective you take he resigned from the agency 
wilson said fernandez left the cia last december

leaders of the seven largest industrial 
democracies pledged monday to step up a worldwide fight against the 
illegal drug trade saying narcotics abuse poses grave risks to 
society 
the complexity of the problem requires international 
cooperation in particular to trace freeze and confiscate the 
proceeds of drug traffickers and to curb money laundering they 
said in a statement issued at the midpoint of the threeday summit 
but a us proposal to set up a task force of the seven nations 
to oversee the coordination effort was blocked by france which 
said it did not want to see the annual sevennation summit develop 
into a yearround effort to run world affairs 
the seven countries dont have the right to direct the rest of 
the world said french spokesman hubert vedrine 
he said france would support a task force involving all 
affected countries 
france ultimately abstained on a watereddown sentence 
supporting the us idea for a task force vedrine said but backed 
the rest of the summit statement on cooperation to fight drugs 
later at a group photo with his summit colleagues president 
reagan said he believed the task force can help us win the war 
against drugs and were going to win 
the statement said that the illegal use of drugs and illicit 
trafficking in them poses grave risks to the peoples of summit 
countries as well as the peoples of source and transit countries 
president reagan fought hard to include the drug issue in the 
statement dealing with political issues said rozanne ridgway the 
assistant us secretary of state 
this is the first time that we have an initiative that tries 
to address as a complex this set of concerns about production 
financing and trafficking of the drug trade she said 
no date has been set for the task force to start its work and 
which countries will be members has not been determined she said 
she said its activities might include improving 
intelligencesharing increasing funds for antidrug organizations 
and working for better cooperation between central banks of the

the northwest woodworkers strike spread 
to 12 boise cascade corp plants monday bringing the total of 
striking workers to about 6600 in four states 
woodworkers also set up pickets at a willamette industries inc 
paper mill in albany ore where 300 paperworkers refused to cross 
the lines 
two woodworkers unions the international woodworkers of 
americaus and the western council of industrial workers are 
attempting to regain wages and benefits cut in the last round of 
contract negotiations two years ago when the industry was in a 
recession 
the unions have reached a twoyear contract agreement with 
bohemia inc of eugene ore for a 5 percent wage hike the first 
year and a 4 percent increase the second union leaders want the 
agreement to serve as a standard for other companies but the other 
companies have balked 
boise cascade spokesman doug bartels said his company would not 
be competitive if it agreed to the bohemia terms 
the boise cascade walkout affected 2078 workers at 13 plants in 
oregon washington and idaho bartels said the walkout against the 
company began at a mill in independence ore sunday and moved to 
the other facilities monday 
the woodworkers strike began june 6 against willamette 
industries daw forest products co and champion international 
corp operations in oregon washington and montana the smaller 
lakeview lumber co also was struck last week after its owners 
imposed wage cuts 
bill hubbell president of the international woodworkers of 
americaus said chances are good the walkout will continue to 
grow 
undoubtedly as bargaining falls apart with the various 
companies theres a good possibility that it will go beyond what 
it is now he said 
the bargaining council representing both unions has negotiations 
scheduled this week with representatives of simpson timber co and 
next week with the biggest of the regions wood products companies 
weyerhaeuser co 
simpson has about 2000 workers and weyerhaeuser about 6000 
hubbell said the unions realized that concessions were necessary 
during the last talks but in light of record profit years the 
last two years he added we felt certain there would be some 
social justice at the table with these employers but so far we 
havent seen any 
contracts have expired at only two boise cascade plants in 
independence and st helens ore but pickets were set up at all 
13 of the companys plants that have union representation in the 
northwest the workers were not crossing the lines bartels said 
i guess by the legal definition of it they are recognizing 
sympathy pickets he said but the reality is the plants are 
shut down 
the pickets shut down plants in la grande elgin and joseph in 
oregon yakima goldendale and kettle falls in washington and 
emmett cascade and council in idaho some of the sites have more 
than one manufacturing plant bartels said 
the company has eight nonunion plants in the northwest 
unaffected by the walkout bartels said

an afghan rebel field commander said 
monday he met with a senior un official to ask that aid be 
withheld from the communist government in afghanistan 
abdul haq a moslem rebel commander in the kabul region told 
the associated press that he met sunday and monday in new york with 
giandomenico picco a un undersecretarygeneral who was involved 
in mediating accords for a soviet troop withdrawal and afghan 
reconstruction 
un officials on monday refused to confirm or deny the meeting 
the united states has demanded that no un aid be distributed 
through the communist government of afghan president najib 
speaking in english at his midtown manhattan hotel haq said he 
would meet agaion with picco on tuesday 
un officials have met with afghan rebel political leaders 
based in pakistan but this was believed to be the first official 
un contact with a military field commander 
the moslem rebels supported by the united states continue to 
fight to topple the afghan government and establish an islamic 
republic the rebels were not part of the accord signed in geneva 
on april 14 calling for soviet withdrawal and afghan reconstruction 
haq is a member of the hezbiislamickhalis party one of the 
more moderate islamic groups fighting the afghan government 
he said he has discussed with picco two issues financial 
support for afghan reconstruction and political solutions to the 
civil war which began in 1979 
i told him that while the soviets were in the country and the 
najib regime in power it is possible that they would get some of 
that money haq said if they use that to build a road or 
bridges for military purposes in killing some of my people the 
united nations is responsible 
also this money is coming for the return of refugees who are 
the refugees they are my people not najibs said haq 
about 5 million afghan refugees are now living in pakistan and 
iran 
on the subject of political solutions haq said he told picco 
that the soviets must go 
the najib government has said soviet military advisers will 
remain in afghanistan after the 103000 red army soldiers return 
home 
soviet troops which intervened in 1979 at the invitation of the 
government began their withdrawal from afghanistan on may 15 in 
accordance with the geneva pact they are scheduled to complete the 
pullout by feb 15 1989 
the un is in favor of a broadbased government so to have a 
broadbased government najib must step down he added 
haq said he believed that picco was inclined to agree with his 
views that najib had no place in a representative afghan government 
pakistan and afghanistan signed the geneva accord with the 
soviet union and united states serving as guarantors the accord 
calls for the united nations to supervise the soviet pullout and to 
coordinate relief and reconstruction efforts and refugee 
resettlement 
the coordinator for the un humanitarian and economic 
assistance effort in afghanistan sadruddin aga khan has said the 
united nations will ask the world community for 117 billion for 
an 18month campaign to resettle afghan refugees and see them 
through two harvests 
he said 25 million already had been pledged 
a threeyear recovery program would follow sadruddin said 
which was estimated to cost 8396 million 
sadruddin has said relief aid will be distributed through 
whatever authority controls a region in afghanistan but has not 
specified the central government in kabul the capital suggesting 
the united nations may work with local and regional governments and 
religious authorities 
richard williams a united states delegate to the un said 
during a pledge review meeting on june 14 the aid should not 
come under the control of the illegitimate kabul regime which 
lacks credibility with the refugees and controls little territory

the marriage of orangutans josephine and 
denny is on the rocks after 19 years and zoo officials are citing 
irreconcilable genes 
the couple hadnt been getting along anyway but that wasnt the 
reason for the breakup a national species survival policy and 
international zoo rules call for two genetic strains to be kept 
separate san francisco zoo director saul kitchener said monday 
so the zoo is planning to move josephine a bornean orangutan 
to the philadelphia zoo where she can hook up with one of her own 
kind while denny a sumatran orangutan remains here it was only 
recently that experts became adept at determining the differences 
between the two subspecies 
but the decision by zoo officials to dissolve the 19year 
relationship has sparked a sentimental reaction that zoo officials 
say could stand in the way of the survival of the endangered 
species 
longtime zoo benefactors violet and carroll soohoo who donated 
josephine said the two orangutans are more than just another 
couple staying together for the children 
these are extremely sensitive animals among our closest 
relatives in nature josephine has been here for 22 years and a 
change of this magnitude can only be seen as extremely cruel 
said the soohoos in a letter to mayor art agnos 
agnos referred the matter to the city department of parks and 
recreation which runs the zoo for consideration at its next 
meeting hes not going to get involved himself in an orangutan 
question said agnos aide scott schafer 
the impending breakup should not be traumatic for the orangutan 
couple since organutans chase away their young after three or four 
years and do not live in families like chimps and gorillas 
kitchener said 
josephine and denny were childhood playmates and bred two 
children but denny now spends his days hunkered down in a corner 
of the couples grotto at the san francisco zoo his back to 
josephine and his 10yearold daughter violet said orangutan 
keeper laurie nikitas 
josephine and denny bred twice and josephine is given birth 
control to prevent her from breeding again with denny the couples 
second child a boy died very young 
she wont even let denny breed her anymore said nikitas 
he tried but she struggles and bites and tries to get away 
they used to be a nice solid little couple but they dont play now 
they tolerate each other 
the orangutan in the wild is much more a loner than the other 
great apes kitchener said while it is true they have been 
together a while if you come and watch them you do not see them 
hugging and grooming each other they will do fine without each 
other 
and a mailorder bride herself couldnt have done better than 
josephine according to nikitas description 
shell have a mate in philadelphia at 26 she should be able 
to have a few more babies and in addition shell have a big yard 
with trees and a water moat its one of the best zoos in the 
world she said 
but the soohoos said we know what happens when humans are 
uprooted from their families it is not much different for these 
animals since they are so intelligent 
the soohoos under previous zoo management were allowed inside 
the cage to help with the young josephine and denny and the 
organutans daughter violet was named after mrs soohoo 
violet a hybrid conceived before zoo rules banned the mating of 
subspecies would not exist in the wild because borneo and sumatra 
are separate islands kitchener said 
the soohoos disagree 
when the types of orangutans mate the hybrid is probably 
closer to the original orangutan since borneo and sumatra were 
once attached mrs soohoo said and were not against sending 
animals to other zoos 
it is just that after 22 years it makes no sense whatsoever 
to uproot this orangutan subspecies or no subspecies

iranian rebel fighters based in iraq battled 
iranian government forces monday and gathered up millions of 
dollars in military booty after their capture of a border town in 
iran 
the rebels said their fighters shot down a cobra helicopter of 
the iranian air force that tried to attack their positions near the 
town of mehran which they captured sunday 
mehran is about six miles east of this iraqi town and 90 miles 
from the iraqi capital baghdad 
leaders of the national liberation army as the rebel force is 
called said they have no intention of holding mehran which has no 
civilian population and is largely a pile of rubble and bent palm 
trees 
mehran itself was lightly held and resistance was minimal but 
fighting for the positions in the foothills of the kani sakht 
mountains to the north was reported fierce 
occasional shellfire could still be heard monday from badrah 
the rebels worked feverishly monday hauling massive amounts of 
captured military gear back across the border to a rear staging 
point in badrah 
the national liberation army claims to have killed or wounded as 
many as 6000 iranian government troops in sundays operation they 
acknowledged 57 dead of their own and 120 seriously wounded 
those figures were impossible to verify independently but more 
than 1500 iranian prisoners were brought to badrah on monday they 
sat in rank after rank in a large courtyard 
not far away scores of tanks artillery pieces antiaircraft 
and antitank weapons tons of small arms machine guns and other 
equipment were being dumped in a huge holding area 
the road to the holding area was filled with a steady stream of 
trucks dragging the equipment back 
an iranian colonel squatting in the dust with the other 
prisoners and identifying himself as the deputy chief of staff of 
the 16th armored division said he was astonished at the rapidity of 
the rebel action 
we were in a state of alert said col ali akbar golamrezai 
43 until the night of the operation there had been no sign of 
movement in front of us we expected a patrol to try a skirmish 
not an attack of such a size 
among the captured equipment were 30 tanks 25 155mm 
selfpropelled howitzers two 130mm cannons six katyusha rockets 
cases of sam 7 antiaircraft missiles 81mm mortars 19 
fourbarreled antiaircraft guns five armored personnel carriers 
six 106mm recoilless rifles 25 jeeps and 19 trucks 
there were heaps of small arms radios gas masks helmets 
binoculars and other equipment the hardware was seized along the 
30mile front 
iran acknowledged sunday that the town had been lost but said it 
was taken by iraqi forces using chemical weapons iranian news 
reports monitored in cyprus monday made little reference to mehran 
except to say that its air force fighters attacked iraqi positions 
around the town five times 
the war communique carried by the islamic republic news agency 
said irans muslim combatants continued their battles with iraqi 
troops with artillery mortar and heavy weaponry 
the national liberation army mostly members or sympathizers of 
the iranian mujahedeen khalq organization burst across the border 
early sunday its fighters estimated in the thousands routed two 
iranian government divisions and a brigade about 14000 men in 
all according to rebel officials 
the iraqi government reiterated its claim that the force that 
crossed the border and captured mehran was made up entirely of 
disaffected iranians and called the battle an internal iranian 
affair 
mehran had changed hands five times in fighting between iranian 
and iraqi troops during the nearly 8yearold war

government figures saying 56 percent of 
the electorate voted sunday for local and provincial peoples 
councils were dramatically inflated supporters of the solidarity 
trade union said monday 
the turnout figure appeared lower based on spot checks of 
polling places said solidarity national spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz 
in the southwestern city of wroclaw a solidarityorganized 
monitoring operation that watched nearly 300 polling stations 
concluded that less than 23 percent of voters took part according 
to opposition spokeswoman maria pinior 
even according to the official figure of 56 percent turnout 
nationwide it was the lowest turnout for any election in poland 
since the communists took power after world war ii 
the previously lowestattended election a nationwide 
referendum on political and economic reforms drew 673 percent of 
the 26 million eligible voters last year 
the last council elections in 1984 attracted 75 percent of the 
electorate according to official estimates and 56 percent 
according to the outlawed union 
government spokesman jerzy urban said before the voting that the 
government would be satisfied if a majority of eligible voters 
participated voting would not be interpreted as an indicator of 
support for the government 
urban said poor economic conditions discouraged some people from 
attending but that the elections were a breakthrough for poland 
the first time candidates actively campaigned for votes and the 
first time since 1947 that some races were contested between people 
of different parties in about 4 percent of districts 
mikolaj kozakiewicz a deputy in the sejm or parliament told 
polish tv the turnout was not a victory for the government or the 
oppositon but a sign of social apathy which is our most serious 
disease 
onyszkiewicz said that although the government attempt to 
portray the election as a turning point this obviously failed 
no one thinks these elections have any significance 
solidarity had called for a national boycott of the vote but it 
did not attempt to monitor voting nationwide said onyszkiewicz 
however some local leaderships of solidarity did undertake vote 
counts he said 
solidarity activists estimated turnout in the baltic port city 
of gdansk at 28 percent to 30 percent and in some warsaw districts 
the numbers were around 30 percent said jacek kuron a senior 
solidarity adviser in warsaw 
lech walesa chairman of the outlawed union planned no comment 
on the turnout according to aide bogdan olszewski 
if he announced his figures he would be a sadist said 
olszewski it would look like he was torturing the government 
onyszkiewicz said officials inflation of turnout figures was 
not the result of central planning but the fact that every local 
functionary is responsible for good turnout in his area so it is 
in his interest to correct the figures in a certain way 
he said the unions call for a boycott may have kept some people 
from voting but also that obviously the mechanical ritual of 
voting is gradually being reduced the barrier of fear is crumbling 
down 
until the 1970s poland reported voting turnouts of around 99 
percent and people who did not vote feared official sanctions

a jury on monday cleared former attorney 
general griffin b bell in a civil suit that charged him with 
libeling a former ef hutton brokerage manager in a 1985 report 
about the companys checkkiting practices 
the us district court panel found that bell who had been 
hired by hutton to investigate the scheme after the company pleaded 
guilty to mail and wire fraud charges had not defamed john pearce 
pearce who managed hutton branches in bethesda md and in st 
louis was among six hutton officials blamed in bells report for 
the elaborate overdrafting scheme 
i never thought the thing was a case to begin with bell 
said monday night from the beginning to the end there was 
nothing to the case and the jury can find that 
the plaintiffs said there were 11 false statements eight in 
the report and three in my press conference bell said the jury 
found none were false 
bell a partner in an atlanta law firm who headed the justice 
department during the carter administration conducted a 
threemonth investigation and exonerated top hutton executives of 
any wrongdoing the trial on the suit began may 31 
pearce now a businessman in sarasota fla claimed in the 
lawsuit that bell had ignored evidence that he and other branch 
managers named in the report were only acting under instructions 
from top management 
the jury of two women and four men determined however that 
none of the statements bell had made about pearce was false or 
defamatory 
hutton hired bell after the firm pleaded guilty may 2 1985 to 
2000 counts of mail and wire fraud stemming from the checkkiting 
scheme 
the company now part of shearson lehman hutton inc agreed to 
pay a 2 million fine and reimburse banks for millions of dollars 
in interest lost when branch offices wrote checks against money 
that had not yet been deposited in their accounts 
testifying at the trial bell strongly defended his 
investigation saying he didnt cite any top officials because all 
he could prove was that senior executives didnt monitor the 
activities of branch and regional offices 
i thought i could catch a high person but i never could he

george bush and michael dukakis disagreed long distance over the 
death penalty on monday with the vice president renewing his call 
for capital punishment to deal with drug kingpins and the likely 
democratic presidential nominee saying he doubted it would have 
much effect 
dukakis also took a slap at the reagan administrations 
antidrug efforts saying there is nobody accountable the 
chairman of the committee is attorney general ed meese nuff 
said 
bush who wrapped up the republican presidential nomination 
several weeks ago was the featured speaker at a drug enforcement 
administration service in washington honoring three officers killed 
in the line of duty 
by design you dont get your pictures in the paper or sit at 
the head table at testimonial dinners he told his audience 
but everywhere ive gone in this country i take time talking 
about the contribution you make 
with the families of slain agents paul s seema george m 
montoya and arthur l cash in attendance bush renewed his call for 
increasing the certainty and the severity of punishment 
i really do believe the death penalty is the answer he said 
to a standing ovation 
but dukakis persisted in his opposition to the death penalty in 
fielding questions at a meeting of broadcasting executives in 
boston 
have you seen any significant reduction in drug trafficking in 
the states that have it i dont he said 
earlier dukakis met briefly at the statehouse with natan 
sharansky a soviet emigre and a leading activist in efforts to win 
permission for jews to leave the soviet union 
monday was his 25th wedding anniversary and dukakis said his 
wife kitty was taking him out to dinner thats my announcement 
for today dukakis told the luncheon of broadcast executives 
dukakis opposes the death penalty as a matter of principle and 
bush is expected to attempt to make their difference over the issue 
into an important part of his campaign the vice president also has 
spoken critically of dukakis reluctance to change a massachusetts 
prison furlough program that permitted first degree murderers time 
away from their cells even after one convict raped a woman while 
on furlough 
i think the governor of massachusetts owes the american people 
an explanation for why he supported this outrageous programwhat 
did he think about when he let firstdegree murderers out on 
weekends the vice president said recently 
the governor moved to counter some of bushs criticism during 
the day saying i know of no responsible corrections program in 
the country with very few exceptions that does not include 
furloughs 
he added that ronald reagan supported a furlough program while 
governor of california 
dukakis did not say so but only a few states allow convicted 
murderers out on furlough 
dukakis criticized the reagan administration saying the 
president has a committee representing federal agencies as his drug 
task force he said he would appoint a czar with direct access to 
the president 
the object of a dukakis jab meese shared the stage with bush 
at the dea ceremony in washington he praised bush as the leader 
in the administration in speaking out on behalf of the 
antidrug law enforcement effort 
bush and dukakis made their public appearances while democrat 
jesse jackson campaigned in minnesota even though the primary 
season ended two weeks ago 
jackson visited the droughtstricken southeastern minnesota farm 
of dale and nancy snesrud and called for a moratorium on farm 
foreclosures he said farmers hurt by reagan administration 
economic and agricultural policies now have no economic cushion to 
help them through the drought 
aides to dukakis said the massachusetts governor would meet with 
jackson on tuesday in california 
dukakis wound up the primary season with more than enough 
delegates to the democratic national convention to claim the 
partys nomination with public opinion polls indicating he holds a 
lead over bush he told broadcast executives that the democrats 
have an extraordinary opportunity to win and to win with vision 
and with strength 
he said he hoped to bring some of his statehouse programs with 
him to washington if elected but added i also know that being 
president is not being governor

israel will strike syrian missile sites if 
damascus deploys new surfacetosurface missiles it reportedly is 
buying from china israels chief of staff said monday 
but lt gen dan shomron also downplayed the immediate threat of 
the missiles saying syria mainly sought the new weapons as a 
deterrent against an israeli attack 
the news magazine newsweek this week quoted an unidentified 
senior reagan administration official as saying china planned to 
sell syria its newest m9 missiles which have a range of 370 miles 
if they havent signed already its only days away the 
official was quoted as saying 
syria can already hit most israeli cities with its sovietmade 
frog7 ss1 and ss21 surfacetosurface missiles which have a 
range of 35 160 and 60 miles respectively 
israel television said the new m9 missiles could be placed 
deeper inside syrian territory making retaliation more difficult 
the role of this weapon in the arsenal of the arab states 
especially of syria is to deter us in case of war from 
continuing our attack that would lead to the collapse of the syrian 
army shomron said in a speech at haifa university 
shomron said the m9 missiles could not decide the outcome of a 
war but that especially if equipped with chemical warheads could 
cause extensive damage 
shomron said israel would respond to the deployment of such 
missiles in various ways including an attack on the syrian missile 
sites 
in addition we also have the ability to develop means of 
intercepting surfacetosurface missiles he was quoted as saying 
by israel television 
israel is working with the united states on an antitactical 
ballistic missile as part of the strategic defense initiative 
program known as star wars 
foreign minister shimon peres told parliaments defense and 
foreign affairs committee that israel is doing everything possible 
to prevent the missiles from reaching syria israeli radio said 
the report did not elaborate 
israel reportedly has developed its own surfacetosurface 
missile the jericho which has a range of 930 miles israeli 
officials refuse to confirm these reports

rupert murdoch said monday he is confident he 
will successfully establish fox broadcasting co as a fourth tv 
network and has every intention of continuing this investment for 
an indefinite period 
murdoch chief executive of foxs parent news corp said the 
fledgling network is making pleasant progress particularly on 
sunday nights where its share of audience is growing every week 
he responded to a report in investors daily last week in which 
richard sarazen finance director of news corp was quoted as 
saying the network would be shut down if results didnt improve 
dramatically in the next six months 
fox chairman barry diller said sarazen was quoted out of context 
after responding to a question about the worstcase scenario for 
fox 
if somebody asks you what if it rains thats one thing 
diller said but if they ask you what if it rains every day for 
the next 10 years you have a different scenario 
steve fox president and editor of investors daily said i 
think this is much ado about nothing theyre not saying that we 
quoted mr sarazen incorrectly only that its out of context i 
dont think it comes as a surprise that any company losing 80 
million a year cannot go on indefinitely 
because no one from fox had called to say the story is wrong 
we have no reason to change our story he said 
sarazen said at a meeting of security analysts in new york 
thursday that fox broadcasting had lost 80 million last year 
which is 30 milllion more than it had anticipated losing 
investors daily quoted him as saying if it doesnt improve 
dramatically in the next six months well close it down 
murdoch acknowledged monday that ratings for the fox networks 
saturday shows were disappointing but he said new programs are 
being produced for that night 
furthermore we are aggressively developing programming for 
additional nights he said we have every intention of 
continuing this investment for an indefinite period and remain 
confident of its ultimate success both for itself our own 
stations and our affiliates 
fox which began its primetime programming on sunday and 
saturday nights more than a year ago has 125 affiliated stations

human rights abuses are being reported 
in sri lanka nearly a year after the signing of a peace accord 
designed to end ethnic strife amnesty international said in a 
report released tuesday 
hundreds of sinhalese and tamils have been detained without 
charge or trial or are missing said the londonbased human rights 
organization it quoted former tamil prisoners as saying they were 
tortured 
the report did not give precise numbers of sinhalese but said 
they included men and women and that most were suspected of 
belonging to an ultranationalist group the peoples liberation 
front 
no substantive attempt appeared to have been made by the 
government to determine the fate of 685 tamils arrested between 
1983 and august 1987 the organization added 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
population and dominate the government tamil rebels have been 
waging a guerrilla war since 1983 against the government and 
sinhalese civilians claiming discrimination and demanding autonomy 
amnesty international urged the sri lankan government to 
establish an independent body to investigate all complaints of 
human rights abuses by sri lankan security forces and indian troops 
there was no immediate response from president junius r 
jayewardenes government on the report foreign ministry officials 
said they had not yet seen the report and refused to comment 
interior minister lalith athulathmudali who is in charge of 
internal security could not be immediately located for comment 
on july 30 1987 sri lanka and neighboring india signed a peace 
accord aimed at ending the tamil insurgency and india dispatched 
peacekeeping troops to enforce the accord 
the pact spurred a backlash by sinhalese nationalists who said 
too many concessions were being offered to tamils who make up 18 
percent of the population 
amnesty said it also had received reports that indian soldiers 
committed rapes and other acts of brutality and killed unarmed 
civilians in several reprisal attacks 
such accusations have been made repeatedly by the tamil rebels 
an indian foreign ministry spokesman in new delhi speaking on 
condition of anonymity said monday that charges contained in 
amnesty internationals report were fabricated and unfair 
amnestys report included graphic descriptions and photographs 
submitted by tamil men who said sri lankan security forces beat 
them with clubs and crowbars burned them with cigarettes and 
molten plastic and hung them by their thumbs or toes 
some freed prisoners reported seeing fellow detainees killed and 
their bodies buried in unmarked graves amnesty said 
amnesty international said the sri lankan government had refused 
to receive a delegation from the human rights organization in 
april it said this was especially disturbing because jayewardene 
said in an interview with the british broadcasting corp in 
february that such a visit would be permitted 
in the past sri lankan officials have said people should 
complain to local courts instead of to amnesty international

firefighters poured neutralizing 
chemicals on barrels of chloride and cheering residents returned 
home monday after a fourday fire that spewed poisonous gas and 
forced evacuation of 25000 people 
id like to thank the people for the patience they have 
demonstrated mayor richard e neal said throughout our 
primary concern has been the public safety 
about 275 people were injured and thousands camped out in 
shelters as explosions rocked the centuryold mill housing the 
advanced laboratories plant which made chloride pellets for 
swimming pools 
officials said the fire was among the worst in memory in this 
city of 170000 people no damage estimate was available but neal 
said city lawyers were agressively pursuing plans to recoup 
expenses 
residents waved to police and cheered as the first school bus 
with returning evacuees moved through a barricade about 1 pm the 
last of the evacuees returned home at 630 pm and only the street 
in front of the plant remained closed fire commissioner darnell l 
williams said 
two fire trucks and police patrols were to remain on the scene 
overnight as crews worked to remove the containers of chlorine 
compounds weighing up to 300 pounds authorities said 
my roses are black and my tomatoes are dead antoinette 
harris 37 said after returning home monday but the dog is all 
right 
after more than 36 hours of flooding the factory with more than 
6000 gallons of water a minute barrels of chloride stopped 
exploding monday 
cleanup crews then poured a solution of neutralizing chemicals 
on hot spots where the chloride compounds were decomposing and 
producing toxic chlorine gas 
john higgins regional director of the state department of 
environmental quality engineering said firefighters shut off their 
hoses briefly sunday afternoon so officials could quickly tour the 
plant but barrels of chloride started exploding again soon 
afterward 
hoses from all city pumpers flooded the building until 615 am 
monday by 8 am no barrels had exploded and the neutralizing 
mixture of boric acid and sodium sulfate was poured onto the 
remaining chloride barrels some of which were bubbling 
statecontracted cleanup crews gingerly removed more than 8000 
pounds of chlorinecontaining compounds left in the building as 
firefighters stood by monday afternoon 
the material was taken to the citys sewage treatment plant and 
used in lieu of the chlorine the city normally buys for the 
facility higgins said at least that way the city can get back 
some of the money its spent he said 
at the fires peak saturday night flames shot 100 feet in the 
air and a cloud of poisonous gas 100 feet high four blocks wide 
and three miles long streamed over springfield and into neighboring 
chicopee the fumes could be smelled 15 miles away 
in the clouds path trees and lawns were withered by the 
corrosive gas 
whats going to happen to my garden said wavel watson who 
lives a few blocks from the plant the annuals the shrubs the

applications for licenses to hunt 
alligators are available in florida for the first time since 1962 
when the practice was outlawed an official said monday 
dennis david alligator program coordinator for the florida game 
and fresh water commission said 15000 applications were 
distributed to the agencys regional offices last wednesday and 
will be available through july 15 the maximum number of licenses 
to be awarded probably about 230 will be determined at the 
commissions july 15 meeting in ocala he said 
david said the alligatorhunting season would be restricted to 
specific areas and hunters will have a limit of 15 alligators 
measuring at least four feet long 
weve been conducting research on hunting since 1981 
evaluating the impact on the alligator population said david 
gator hunting was banned because alligators numbers were 
dwindling but david said the alligator population in florida has 
doubled since 1973 to its present total of about 1 million 
its kind of a first step for the commission to allow public 
harvest of alligators in the state added david we hope to see 
the economic value of alligators provide an economic incentive to 
preserve floridas wetlands 
youre not going to stop condominiums from going in because of 
alligator hunts but it adds another reason to preserve wetland 
habitats in the state 
alligator hides brought a record 4272 a linear foot in 
february said david those hides were sold by trappers who are 
licensed under another program to catch and kill nuisance 
gators that get too close to homes or people the trappers also 
sell alligator meat mostly from the tail to restaurants 
public interest in the hunt increased after a 4yearold girl 
was killed by an alligator in a neighborhood lake in southwest 
florida earlier this month it was the sixth fatal attack by an 
alligator on a human since the state began keeping such records in 
1946 
the number of attacks has remained relatively constant in 
spite of the fact that weve had a dramatic increase in the number 
of alligators and number of people in florida said david our 
nuisance alligator program removes about 3000 alligators a year in 
the state

paranoia produces profits in the dark dangerous 
world created by eric overmyers in perpetuity throughout the 
universe a strange sinister comedy that arrived over the 
weekend at offbroadways hudson guild theater 
much of it is set in a lunaticfringe publishing house whose 
owner collects what she calls conspiracy theorists of the left and 
right the kind of authors who believe jimmy hoffa is alive and 
well and living in brazil or who whisper that the catholic church 
killed abraham lincoln or who write books about washington dc and 
refer to it as the zionist occupation government 
the title of the play comes from bookcontract lingo having to 
do with the publishing rights being wrapped up in perpetuity 
throughout the universe 
overmyer is a dazzling verbal acrobat as well as a serious 
student of pop culture both linguist and cultural anthropologist 
get a workout here the plays language is sly and sharp and the 
comedy a mixture and appreciation of high and low brow sort of 
like tom stoppard meets tv guide 
the heroes of in perpetuity throughout the universe are the 
ghostwriters employed to turn the crazy conspiratorial ideas into 
best sellers the play focuses on three of these editors 
particularly a young woman named christine who has been hired to 
incorporate antiasian propaganda into a fictional potboiler called 
yellow emperor the new fu manchu 
christines chinese boyfriend dennis wu also works for this 
publishing house they spend their offhours playing list games 
people they would kill after the revolution such as landlords 
mimes and andrew lloyd webber famous b movies like faster 
pussycat kill kill or the names of people who have disappeared 
but may not be gone like hoffa or db cooper 
dennis also becomes christines fantasy as she dreams about the 
novel she is ghostwriting and conjures up the fu manchu of movie 
fame the familiar villain with long red nails and sneering smile 
another editor an intense man named lyle vial is obsessed by 
chain letters that threaten doom for anyone who breaks the chain 
it is the ultimate paranoia vial at last discovers the first chain 
letter written during the norman invasion of england and what 
happened to such medieval doubters as thomas the confessor when 
they interrupted its good luck 
there is a serious underpinning to all of overmyers high and 
lowflying wit its expressed by dennis in several speeches about 
his past and his chinese heritage which has either been ignored or 
disparaged by the white man 
most of the cast has been able to negotiate overmyers difficult 
script particularly successful are carolyn mccormick as the 
ghostwriter who develops a conscience and arthur hanket as the 
chainletter freak 
director stan wojewodski jr of baltimores center stage has 
given the play a fluid cinematic feeling as the short scenes blend 
quickly into each other the cold hardedged setting by 
christopher barreca mirrors the plays strange chilly world an 
environment harshly but appropriately lighted by stephen 
strawbridge 
in on the verge overmyers most successful play three 
victorian ladies begin an exhilarating journey through time and 
space that eventually brings them to the brave new world of 1955 
the three editors in this play travel too but they are on a 
darker expedition probing the fears and prejudices of society 
overmyer makes it a wild unnerving ride

the housing market is one of the major question 
marks for the economy as the midpoint of 1988 approaches 
the number of homes on which construction was started fell 122 
percent in may after posting only modest increases in the two 
previous months according to the commerce department 
and while members of the national association of realtors are 
generally upbeat about the outlook for existinghome sales only 40 
percent of those responding to the associations annual survey in 
april predicted increases in singlefamily home construction in the 
months ahead 
the housing sector is the only area of real weakness in the 
current economic climate say analysts at merrill lynch the big 
investment firm but the plunge in may housing starts overstates 
the case 
they note that starts fell in may to an annual rate of 138 
million from an excessively strong 158 million pace in april 
averaging the two months gives a better sense of the current 
climate for housing the firm maintained housing starts could 
bounce up to about a 148 millionunit rate in june 
in 1987 the government tallied 162 million housing starts 
the prime variable for the housing outlook of course is 
interest rates for mortgages and construction loans 
rates climbed for most of the spring in recent weeks they have 
dropped back a bit stirring hopes for a pickup in activity 
the typical mortgage interest rate recently stood at 1035 
percent down from 1058 percent at the end of may said smith 
barney harris upham amp co in its appraisal of the housingstarts 
statistics 
this decline should trigger an increase in housing activity 
as potential buyers rush to lock in fixed rates close to 10 
percent the firm asserted 
the realtors poll of more than 700 brokers and sales associates 
found sales of existing homes running at about the same pace as 
last year 
slightly more than half of the respondents 53 percent said 
they expected an increase in existinghome sales between april and 
october while only 16 percent forecast a decline 
the realtors report provides new evidence that home prices 
except in perhaps a few areas of the country have not been dragged 
down significantly by the steep drop in stockmarket prices last 
fall 
indeed the realtors say high prices remain a formidable 
obstacle for firsttime home buyers more than a quarter of the 
survey participants said the typical starter resale home in their 
markets costs 100000plus 
and twothirds said a typical new starter home carries a 
sixfigure price tag 
all this leaves housing perched on the edge of a paradoxical 
problem if overall economic activity sets a strong pace interest 
rates could be pushed higher putting a damper on the housing 
market 
conversely should the economy weaken rates could fall and thus 
stimulate home sales 
yet another irony housing is one of the favorite investments in 
this country as a hedge against inflation but it is precisely 
fears of a pickup in inflation that drove longterm interest rates 
including mortgage rates higher in recent months

archaeologists have dug up a wall in the heart of 
the roman forum that could help them discover the secrets of the 
founding of rome the city could be older than it thinks it is 
the archaeologists say the dicovery also could find some truth 
in the legend of romulus and remus 
according to the legend romulus established rome by building a 
defensive wall around the palatine hill the site where he and his 
twin brother remus were suckled in their infancy by a shewolf 
and reared by a shepherd romulus then founded rome in 753 bc as 
the legend goes 
while the archaeologists dont believe theyll find any proof of 
romulus remus the shewolf and the shepherd they do think they 
might find some truth in the legend about the way rome was founded 
and when 
andrea carandini a university of pisa professor who is leading 
the dig said archaeologists in may uncovered a stone wall on a 
slope of the hill just at the spot described by the ancient roman 
historian tacitus as the site of the wall that first defined and 
protected rome 
experts have dated the find to the 7th century bc but 
carandini said in an interview he suspects underneath it is an 
earlier version of a defensive wall that could have been built a 
century earlier 
archaeologists say reaching the wall could be the first tangible 
piece of evidence to back up the story of romes legendary founding 
in 753 bc 
but secrets of the earliest days of roman civilization may stay 
locked in the ground if the government fund that has financed the 
dig for the last three years is not replenished carandini says the 
team needs the equivalent of about 400000 to continue 
for now carandini keeps digging 
we will never discover the wall of romulus because romulus is 
a legend of course he said but i think the nucleus of the 
legend is right and in a way we already proved this because 
nobody believed that there really was a fortification of the 
palatine hill 
the base of the hill eventually developed into the forum 
ancient romes market and meeting place now a major tourist 
attraction 
experts who have observed the excavations say the discoveries 
if fully documented will provide significant insight into the 
littleknown period between the 8th and 6th centuries bc 
it is interesting that the physical objects that carandini 
is discovering not only seem to be dated very early in the history 
of the city but are related to the historical texts that talk about 
the foundation of the city said richard brilliant a professor 
of art history and archaeology at columbia university in new york 
who visited the site in may 
whether or not conclusions can be drawn about the wall in the 
development of the city is something much more research is needed 
to demonstrate 
alessandro guidi an official with the regional archaeology 
office said the find indicates that rome may have evolved much 
earlier than was once believed from a primitive village inhabited 
mainly by shepherds into a more advanced society 
this could be very important because it may be proof that 
before the etruscans conquered rome rome already was a very big 
center guidi said 
the defensive wall discovered about 10 feet below a grassy 
surface probably surrounded a pomoerium or holy place in the 
city that had been founded with the gods blessings carandini said 
above the excavated wall archaeologist found remnants of houses 
they believe date back to the end of the 6th century bc and 
belonged to aristocrats of etruscan origins 
the houses probably were built after the defensive wall was 
expanded to surround the seven hills of rome carandini said 
but it is what lies below the wall that may give real insight 
into the founding of one of the worlds most ancient civilizations 
we go with clues like sherlock holmes carandini said it 
is the only way we have of checking the history of rome which at 
this point is a legend but i think a legend is another way of 
writing history

chicanos a 30week series of government 
television programs is showing mexicanamericans in a new light in 
mexico 
the intent is to ease resentments in mexico toward chicanos as 
mexicanamericans are called and demonstrate their growing power 
in the united states according to program directors 
this ethnic minority in the united states is irreversibly 
destined to play a very important cultural and political role 
inside the great world power during our lifetimes narrator 
virgilio caballero says in the first episode 
chicanos often are criticized here for having left mexico and 
often for not being able to speak spanish or speaking the 
language with an american accent 
ricardo ocampo the chicanos producer said its time to 
say on this side of the rio grande that chicanos arent what people 
have said of them its time to give them their just due 
they love their country the united states but they dont 
forget their roots and we have to respect that he added in an 
interview 
the mexican government has tried intermittently for at least two 
decades to develop stronger ties with chicanos and some leaders on 
both sides of the border have favored promoting a promexico voting 
bloc 
but sensitive usmexican relations the us government 
usually balks at what its sees as mexican meddling in its internal 
affairs and the failure by the many hispanic organizations to 
resolve differences has impeded movement in that direction 
many chicanos struggling to be accepted in the united states 
want little to do with the land of their ancestors although 
mexican cultural values do remain strong among them 
in many ways the mexican culture is reproduced in the chicano 
experience in the heart of the united states caballero said 
in the most recent acknowledgment of chicanos by the mexican 
government carlos salinas de gortari the frontrunning candidate 
in this years presidential election in mexico met with chicano 
leaders in tijuana over the border from california 
as mexicans we observe with pride the dynamism and vitality 
of your community within the united states he told the leaders 
armando navarro director of impacto 88 an umbrella 
organization of chicano groups from several us states said 
chicanos should turn their numbers into political power 
we think mexico should study how to design its own politics in 
this area according to its own principles navarro said at the 
tijuana meeting 
he said chicanos could play an important role in the job of 
explaining the mexican reality to other north americans 
hispanics will represent 10 percent of the us population by 
the year 2000 and 65 percent will be of mexican descent the 
majority of them chicanos according to caballero 
he said the growing number of latins represents a strong 
political economic and cultural force 
yet latins dont make up a homogenous block he added 
noting that puerto ricans and cubans have their own interests in 
the united states 
jorge bustamante director of the northern border college and 
columnist for the mexico city newspaper excelsior said chicanos 
have not taken advantage of their political power 
although still very far from achieving the political maturity 
to bloc vote as black and other ethnic minorities in that 
country do the electoral importance of chicanos is growing 
above all in california and texas he wrote in a recent column 
bustamante however expressed a widely held opinion in mexico 
that many chicanos think like gringos 
he criticized a chicano group in california for proposing that 
the us government intervene to assure upcoming presidential 
elections in mexico are clean 
being of mexican descent or having the last name sanchez 
chavez or garcia in the united states isnt sufficient to 
understand what goes on in mexico and much less to feel solidarity 
with the majority of mexicans 
according to bustamante many chicanos love mexico but in 
wanting to help resolve the problems of our country they think 
like any other gringo which shouldnt surprise us 
however producer ocampo said chicanos a halfhour program 
produced by the federal borders cultural program has strictly 
cultural objectives 
among its major goals he said is to destroy the absurd 
stereotypes some mexicans have of chicanos

experts have begun painstakingly 
piecing together the crumbling remains of a newly discovered 
ancient dugout boat beached near a stone age settlement more than 
7000 years ago 
the dugout thought to be one of the oldest vessels ever 
recovered was spotted last summer by skindiving scientists and 
historians on an expedition to an area where paleolithic flint 
tools had been found earlier 
stone age shipwrights made the boat by hollowing out a lime log 
with flint axes a carbon 14 test of the vessels lime wood dated 
it to 5250 bc 
by chance the divers caught sight of the boats gunwales 
sticking up from the sandy seabed at a depth of about 6 feet 
they named it the korshavn dugout after the bay in the 
northeast of the island of funen where it was found 
following a troubled salvage operation that shattered the hull 
the dugout was brought in pieces to roskilde ship museum on the 
main island of zealand which houses a major collection of restored 
vikingage ships from nearby excavations 
it could take up to two years to assemble the thousands of 
boat pieces onto a frame said tinna damsgaardsoerensen the 
historian in charge of reconstructing the dugout 
its like a big jigsaw puzzle but solvable 
the delicate pieces each wrapped in a spongy cloth are laid 
out in waterfilled trays to conserve the wood none is larger than 
a paperback book 
the painstaking task of drawing photographing conserving and 
cataloging each piece is being carried out in full public view as a 
working exhibition which includes a video tape of the salvage 
it proved impossible to measure the boats length because the 
ends were missing but 12 feet of the dugout survived and 
restoration workers estimate it was at least 13 to 16 feet long 
with a 24inch beam 
the dugout had a surprisingly thin hull less than two inches 
thick at the bottom and 12 inches along the gunwales said curator 
flemming rieck 
its a superb example of handicrafting he said 
to gain a better understanding of stone age methods riecks 
group hauled a fresh lime log into the museum hall and carved a 
replica of the korshavn boat with flint tools 
rieck an expert on ancient vessels of northern europe said 
dugouts were used mainly for hunting and fishing close to home and 
for transporting people and goods between settlements 
dugouts like the korshavn which could carry four or five 
people often had a clay fireplace in the stern because ancient man 
carried fire with him on his travels rieck said 
the dugout apparently was abandoned on the shore near a 
settlement but the rising waters from melting glaciers north of 
denmark flooded the area and the boat was discovered underwater 
rieck said 
the boat rested in an eightinchthick culture layer containing 
bits of flint and food scraps that can reveal glimpses of 
settlement life 
the excavation of the korshavn dugout presented a special 
problem requiring a method that had never been tried before said 
rieck 
due to the advanced decomposition of the wood salvagers decided 
to bring up the boat together with the layer of sand in which it 
was embedded 
a strong salvaging frame was dug into position around the boat 
thin copper pipes were inserted through the frames lower edge 
beneath the boat through which liquid nitrogen was pumped at a 
temperature of minus 392 degrees fahrenheit 
it was hoped rieck said the intense cold would freeze the 
water around the pipes forming a firm base of ice within the 
salvaging frame that could be raised out of the sea with the dugout 
intact 
but a severe storm broke as the salvage was under way large 
amounts of sand shifted as waves beat against the seabed the next 
morning the divers found the dugout lying in fragments within the 
frame which were sent to the museum on wooden planks 
we still have faith in the freeze technique and probably will 
try it again in some future excavation said rieck

on a summer evening in one of the 
crimeridden slums on sao paulos outskirts five men sat in a 
rundown bar the drinks would be their last 
seven men burst in with handguns lined the five against a wall 
and fired more than 30 bullets into them 
the killers vanished into the night 
police say the vigilantestyle slayings last february 
summertime in brazil were the work of justiceiros portuguese 
for justice makers 
the gangs are on the rise here in south americas biggest city 
where outnumbered and poorly equipped police cant keep up with 
violent crime 
since 1986 police say justiceiros have killed an estimated 400 
people in the slums of this city of 10 million 
several victims were bandits others like those gunned down 
last february were killed because they had witnessed justiceiro 
killings many were killed for no apparent reason said waldemar 
dos santos batista a chief investigator on the newly created 
antijusticeiro squad of the sao paulo state security bureau 
since it began operations march 11 the 250man squad has 
arrested 30 suspected justiceiros who batista said have confessed 
to 120 murders over the past two years about 100 justiceiros are 
still thought to be at large he said 
the vigilante gangs are similar to the death squads in rio 
de janeiro in the 1960s policemen reacting to the shooting death 
of a popular detective began to summarily execute suspected 
criminals leaving skullandcrossbones emblems next to the bodies 
in sao paulo justiceiros first surfaced about six years ago 
eliminating bandits who preyed on slum merchants and dwellers 
according to state security chief luiz antonio fleury filho 
they were welcomed in the slums because police lack 
credibility among the poor and because of the impunity criminals 
enjoy as a result of the excessively bureaucratic inefficient and 
slowmoving legal system fleury said in an interview 
he added that about two years ago justiceiros expanded their 
activities and began dealing in drugs forcing shopowners to buy 
protection often killing those who didnt charging fees to 
allow people to circulate unmolested in the slums 
people who at first felt protected by these criminals started 
being victimized by them and gradually the slums started wanting 
to get rid of the justiceiros he added 
like the rio death squads justiceiro gangs are believed to be 
made up largely of offduty policemen frustrated at what they 
believe are legal obstacles keeping them from more forceful action 
against criminals 
some policemen may be showing a certain tolerance towards the

a group of lawyers working out of a tworoom 
office behind gray brick walls in central beijing has come to the 
defense of the rising number of chinese women who seek legal means 
to redress wrongs 
according to the law women in china have equal status with men 
but in reality women traditionally are often looked down upon 
they increasingly face discrimination at work particularly in 
hiring and promotions supervisors frequently reject women 
applicants on the grounds they are not as efficient or skillful as 
men 
accounts of wife beatings appear regularly in the chinese press 
and cases of arranged marriages and girls being sold into marriage 
have resurfaced in the countryside 
the 18 lawyers at the beijing 8th lawyer office 17 of whom are 
women exclusively help women facing such problems in the past 
three years they have counseled more than 3000 women and handled 
nearly 400 cases in court 
on the walls of their small office near tiananmen square are 
reminders of some of their victories 
a set of calligraphy scrolls commissioned by a grateful client 
who won her case against a bigamist husband hangs just inside the 
door 
upright for life your spirit lives as long as heaven and 
earth it says in praise of the lawyers 
established in 1985 by the allchina womens federation the 
legal center is the first and largest of its kind in china 
similar legal aid offices for women have opened in the southern 
city of canton guangzhou and in sichuan province but none has as 
big a staff or case load as the beijing office 
everyone has the same goal the deputy chief lawyer zhang 
xiaoqing said of her colleagues we want to use our legal 
knowledge for the benefit of women and children 
in the cramped and badly lit office yu lin in her 60s 
conducted an interview one recent day with a 47yearold divorced 
woman who was fighting for custody of her 6yearold son 
nearby tian hui a 24yearold lawyer sat at a narrow wooden 
desk carefully taking notes as a 39yearold factory worker from 
the countryside talked about her dissatisfaction with a recent 
divorce settlement 
the client fought back tears as she related how her second 
husband asked for a divorce because his two children by a previous 
marraige were grown and he no longer needed her 
the district court had already granted the divorce but she was 
unhappy with the financial settlement which awarded her husband 
their six joint bank accounts their apartment and furnishings and 
bicycle 
women like these have a hard time getting legal aid because 
china has a shortage of lawyers only 20000 to 30000 for a 
country of more than 1 billion people zhang said 
the 8th lawyers office is open mornings for walkin 
consultations in the afternoons the lawyers work on cases 
fees start at 50 fen 13 cents for consultations and are never 
more than 2 yuan 54 cents the basic fee is 1 yuan 27 cents 
but about onethird of the women are too poor to pay even that 
to represent a client in a divorce case the lawyers charge 30 
to 50 yuan 8 to 13 based on rates set by the state but again 
about 30 percent of the women pay less or nothing 
some women learn of the office from a notice in the beijing 
intermediate peoples court while others are referred by the 
womens federation 
we only take on those cases that are reasonable zhang said 
if they have no legal reason for bringing up a case we try to 
explain the law to them thats part of our work too 
one of their more interesting cases involved a 60yearold 
deafmute woman whose husband was branded a counterrevolutionary 
during the ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution 
out of concern for his wife and two children the man divorced 
the wife and told her they would remarry if his perilous situation 
improved 
after the cultural revolution he was rehabilitated received 
back pay and given compensation for his home and household goods 
that were confiscated 
the man however married someone else moved to another 
province and never paid child support or gave any kind of financial 
assistance to his first wife for the years she reared their 
children on her own 
the 8th lawyers office took her case to court which ruled that 
the man had to pay the woman 1500 yuan 405

wlodzimierz rucewicz 28 university 
graduate husband and father of one has a decision to make 
should he leave poland for good and seek a better life in the 
west living among strangers and perhaps never being accepted as 
anything but an alien 
or should he remain in the land of his birth and face a future 
of paralyzing bureaucracy consumer shortages and struggle for a 
decent living 
hes not alone in his pondering 
the same questions loom to a greater or lesser degree for 
virtually all of the 12 million poles under 30 who must decide 
after 43 years of communism and nearly a decade of economic crisis 
whether there is any real reason to stay in poland 
polishborn pope john paul ii has advised them that their place 
is in poland 
the government angrily has accused western countries of 
deliberately trying to draw away polands best and brightest 
but public opinion polls and sociologists indicate that young 
people are less and less hopeful for their future at home and that 
more and more of them want to live abroad for at least two years 
rucewicz who earns his living as a freelance english 
translator says he looks in his address book and sees most of his 
friends already are in the united states britain or australia 
not too many people are starving here like in ethiopia or are 
homeless in the sense that they have nowhere to go he said 
but it doesnt have to be that drastic to make your life a living 
hell right 
he cites low wages and the lack of housing as two of the main 
problems 
youve got something like 30 years to wait before you get an 
apartment in a housing cooperative 
if you want to work honestly that is come to work in your 
office do your job and go back home there is no way that you 
could ever in your life earn enough money to buy your own place 
there are no jobs in poland that could give you that much money 
buying a modest house in the warsaw outskirts costs at least 10 
million zlotys 23000 while a couple working at decent jobs may 
earn 12 million zlotys 2800 a year with no mortgage system 
for buying houses a couple has save the entire sum before making 
the purchase 
sociologist jerzy wertensteinzulawski mentions a welter of 
other factors contributing to a sense of hopelessness among polish 
youth including feelings of alienation and lack of control a 
hostile school environment oppressive laws and poor 
environmental and health conditions in poland 
citing an officially published study last year of polish youth 
he said only 10 percent feel they have a degree of control in their 
workplace and the number of youths who believe the world will turn 
to communism is falling 
young people also see their career prospects blocked by 
politics wertensteinzulawski said in a country where 75 percent 
of managerial jobs belong to members of the polish united workers 
party as the communist party is called only 1 percent of people 
under 35 have party membership cards 
emigration is one option for the young especially since 
polands liberalized passport policy allows large numbers to go 
abroad 
in the period 198087 about 365000 poles emigrated or legally 
extended their stays abroad while 370000 illegally failed to 
return from foreign trips according to a recently published 
article in the polish weekly odrodzenia the number includes an 
estimated 22000 engineers 3000 economists 3000 doctors and 
4000 scientists 
wertensteinzulawski who works for the ministry of culture 
said some young people have turned to drugs alcohol hardrock 
music or cult groups practicing parapsychology or buddhism 
he added that poles now are seeing in their midst growing 
numbers of leatherjacketed polish punks a movement brought 
back to poland by young intelligentsia who traveled abroad and 
which now is rooted in the working class 
polands growing private sector has provided another outlet for 
many disenchanted youth 
rucewicz said his once politically active friends have given up 
hope of changing the system and now are devoting themselves 
singlemindedly to making money for instance in boutiques 
restaurants shoesole manufacturing or tailoring services 
the problem is that running a business in poland is almost 
impossible within the law because of strangling taxes regulations 
and inability to obtain materials through legal channels rucewicz 
said 
if you dont cheat here and there youre ruined immediately 
that makes you practically a criminal 
as part of its economic reform program the government is 
starting to address the issue promising to remove obstacles to 
entering businesses and do away with many regulations 
if i were the government i would do everything possible to 
increase the private sector because this is the only thing for 
these energetic people the people with initiative said 
wertensteinzulawski 
a statement in february by government spokesman jerzy urban 
assailing those who emigrate for better salaries has brought an 
angry and anguished response from many young people 
piotr stepniak a junior faculty member at poznan university who 
says he and his wife hold down six jobs wrote in the weekly 
newspaper prawo i zycie law and life recently that the complaints 
about greedy young people show the authorities do not want to 
notice the real reasons for emigration 
the polish crisis already has a chronic character he said 
everything is provisional relative and subject to reform the 
highest ideals in this perspective lose their sense for the young 
generation today white is black tomorrow red the next day blue

conservatism was in its heyday elsewhere when sanders scored his 
first victory in vermont squeaking into office with a 10vote 
margin over a democratic incumbent 
voters politicians and media werent the only ones caught by 
surprise 
i woke up one day and was mayor of burlington sanders 
recalls in a voice right out of flatbush that still carries 
traces of disbelief seven years later before that the largest 
business id ever run employed two people and not at the same 
time 
the upset made him not only the highest elected official in 
vermonts biggest city but also the only independent mayor of the 
only threeparty city in america 
built on the steep hills that rise from the shores of lake 
champlain burlington looks out at new yorks scenic adirondack 
mountains its a casual stylish little city that owes its 
affluence to a nearby ibm plant its academic flavor to the 
university of vermont 
burlington is a very nice city right next to vermont jokes 
the mayor its a popular view of the commercial cultural and 
academic center of a determinedly rural state 
while vermonters may consider burlington the big city its 
problems are closer to smalltown scale sanders acknowledges for 
example the city runs two emergency shelters with a total of 80 
beds on the worst night he says we might fill them both 
whether sanders political success is strictly a burlington 
phenomenon is a notion the mayor will test in november as an 
independent candidate in a threeway race for the states lone us 
house seat 
while hes been reelected as mayor three times sanders has 
suffered his share of defeats while in office 
last march the administration sought but failed to get voter 
approval of a special assessment against all nonresidential 
property to launch a 600000 daycare program 
a proposal that some affordable housing be incorporated in all 
new residential development never got past the board of aldermen 
despite burlingtons threeparty status sanders independent 
progressive party has never held a majority on the 13member board 
of aldermen currently it comprises four democrats three 
republicans and six progressives the most favorable balance since 
sanders took office 
regardless of the gains this is still one small city in a 
capitalist country my political dream is to develop a strong third 
party the reality is that the majority of people are democrats and 
republicans 
sanders views military spending and nuclear weaponry as local 
issues to the degree that the federal government spends more on 
bombs and nerve gas it also spends less on fire departments he 
says 
nancy chioffi democratic president of the board of aldermen and 
a possible candidate for mayor in next years election says not 
everyone considers a global agenda appropriate for a smallcity 
mayor theres a strong sense that the city should spend its time 
on city business she says 
she praises sanders for his tax reform hiring and economic 
development efforts as well as opening the doors of city hall to 
a broader spectrum of people hes stirred the pot and in so 
doing hes created a very exciting climate 
the other side is that hes shut out more traditional people 
his belief in the need for three parties has created a large rift 
between traditional democrats and independents who tend to be 
yesterdays liberal democrats 
the level of animosity became clear at a democratic caucus in 
april at which sanders appearing on behalf of jesse jackson 
literally got his face slapped by a democrat who thought he had no 
business being there 
chioffi also accuses the mayor of economic oversimplification 
if youre rich youre bad if youre poor youre good she 
says he needs to recognize that there are some good rich and 
some bad poor 
the uneven distribution of wealth is a recurring campaign theme 
as sanders rattles around the state in a rusting gray honda 
littered with empty yogurt containers old sweat shirts and ratty 
news clippings to climb in is to enter a time warp right down to 
the 60s folk songs jammed into the tape deck 
no matter what his fate in november this will be his last term 
as mayor among the most memorable events of his tenure was his may 
28 wedding to jane driscoll 37 director of the citys youth 
office 
the wedding held at a city park and open to the public 
prompted sanders to don a suit for the occasion equally startling 
he arrived early a full eight minutes before the ceremony began

for the first time guests will have the opportunity to see 
actual television movie and disney animation production 
firsthand nunis told an audience of business executives 
recently 
the studio complex will have a formidable rival in a new 
mcauniversal studios tour going up just a few miles away 
besides the sprawling and luxurious grand floridian beach resort 
an internationalclass hotel with rooms priced at 165 to 255 a 
night land is being cleared for what disney officials call the 
largest conventionhotel complex in the southeast 
it will feature a 1520room hotel floridas biggest and a 
smaller one with 200000 square feet of convention space on a 
150acre site 
nearing completion nearby virtually across the street from 
epcot center are the first 850 rooms of the more moderately 
priced 6585 caribbean beach resort the tropical village 
complex surrounding a 42acre lake complete with beach and palm 
trees is composed of clusters of pastelcolored twostory 
buildings 
caribbean beach will contain more than 2100 familypriced 
rooms when it is finished a year from now 
when this phase of hotel construction is completed disney will 
boast a total of about 12000 hotel rooms 
also in the works is the crossroads a retail shopping mall just 
outside the disney village it will have an upscale supermarket and 
the first mcdonalds on disney property when it opens this fall 
why all the construction seemingly all at once 
some of the projects had been part of longrange plans for the 
florida property company excutives say others such as the 
studio complex convention hotels more retail outlets are part 
of disneys new look fostered by eisner and president frank wells 
the ebullient eisner 46 is given much of the credit for an 
allaround revitalization of the company since it averted an 
outside takeover in 1984 
disneys touchstone pictures has become the hottest movietv 
studio in hollywood its consumer products division increased 
profits by 34 percent last year and disneys theme parks in 
florida california and japan boasted record attendance and profits 
in 1987 
the walt disney cos revenue was 28 billion and its theme 
parks and resorts brought in 18 billion of that a 20 percent 
increase over the previous year profits were 445 million 
the company does not announce attendance figures but analysts 
figured visits to the florida parks at about 24 million in fiscal 
1987 
the massive complex is exempt from most state or local 
government control because of a special 1967 legislative act that 
helped create walt disney world historically government officials 
have considered the coming of disney and its continued expansion 
a great economic boon to the sunshine state 
but explosive growth around it has prompted some impatience with 
the status quo and some area officials want to change or repeal 
the act to make disney more responsive to local conditions 
orange county commissioner lou treadway an outspoken proponent 
of making disney pay its way contends that the company has 
gone far and beyond the legislative intent which he says was 
merely to smooth the way for a theme park 
when you get into building shopping centers for instance 
thats a different story thats not a tourist attraction 
treadway said 
president jerry chicone jr of the greater orlando chamber of 
commerce agrees with that to a certain extent 
disney is a wonderful institution that has been a good 
neighbor for 15 years chicone says but he says he has cautioned 
company officials about building so many hotels and trying to 
duplicate some of the things that are already here downtown or at 
other tourist areas 
businessmen have a healthy respect for disneys clout 
bob snow developer of the church street station nightclub 
complex in downtown orlando sees disneys pleasure island as 
strong competition because he says they dont do things halfway 
over there 
economists and others however point to the tremendous growth 
of tourism and its benefits brought on first by the magic kingdom 
and then by epcot center 
along with visits to the disney complex tourists have boosted 
attendance at sea world busch gardens in tampa snows church 
street station and even the kennedy space center 
the disney boom has turned orlando into a popular convention 
city now ranked among the top dozen in the country 
hotels restaurants and smaller attractions have mushroomed as a 
result of disneys growth and massive advertising and many of them 
have gotten rich on the disney fallout 
most of us are beneficiaries of the walt disney world 
phenomenon said winter park economist martin kessler

editors note mexicos institutional revolutionary party or 
pri has never lost a presidential election or gubernatorial race 
since coming to power in 1929 and is not likely to in the elections 
coming up on july 6 nonetheless with the country in an economic 
crisis critics of the pri say it has outlived its usefulness and 
now is addicted to power and bloated by corruption there is a cry 
for change growing among the countrys 80 million citizens 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
shocked by the political and economic 
tensions of the 1980s mexicans are talking more frequently about 
the need for change as they grope for a new sense of national 
purpose 
the process may stop short of national soulsearching but there 
has been widespread recognition of mexicos difficulties and the 
loss of credibility in a system of government that has lasted most 
of this century 
even carlos salinas de gortari a certain winner in july 6 
elections as the presidential candidate of the ruling institutional 
revolutionary party talks consistently of the need for reforms 
salinas de gortaris term will last until 1994 and the next 
president will govern to the year 2000 
the 21st century suddenly seems to be approaching very quickly 
and is a handy reference point for the time when change inevitably 
must occur 
i think that the opposition is carrying out its struggle and 
with time in the next century it will obtain political 
positions former president luis echeverria said recently in a 
rare published interview 
until the next century the reporter asked 
thats not much time echeverria replied 
the ruling party known here as the pri has held power since 
1929 it never has lost a presidential election or gubernatorial 
race in any of mexicos 31 states since its inception 
so entrenched is it that a book that might be described as 
political science fiction was published called the day the pri 
lost 
it wont be july 6 1988 
salinas de gortari budget secretary for president miguel de la 
madrid until his nomination last fall is certain to win over 
divided opposition 
yet the opposition most notably dissident cuauhtemoc cardenas 
of the coalition democratic national front and manuel j clouthier 
of the conservative national action party have generated an 
unusual amount of attention through the long campaign 
mexico simply is no longer the largely rural nation in which the 
pri was formed to resolve the chaos lingering from the mexican 
revolution of 191021 
now with more than 80 million inhabitants and the worlds 13th 
largest economy mexico is characterized more by offshore oil 
platforms and teeming cities than the old stereotypes of charro 
hats and guitars still snapped up by foreign tourists 
there is little doubt that a certain amount of repression and 
vote fraud played some part in pri control over the decades but 
the party also became a master at the art of consensus it held out 
that the social peace was being conserved and an expanding 
economy always was able to provide hope for the growing population 
an old saying has it that the government first tried to make 
friends with everyone if that didnt work it tried to buy you 
off and in the few cases where neither approach worked it killed 
you 
the stress on that longstanding pragmatic system increased in 
1982 when international prices started falling for the petroleum 
exports that had brought in unmatched prosperity for the previous 
five years 
la crisis the crisis has lasted throughout de la 
madrids sixyear term causing a drop by some estimates of as much 
as 50 percent in consumers purchasing power and fraying the 
patience of millions of mexicans forced to make corresponding 
cutbacks 
a onepeso coin worth about 4 cents just seven years ago now 
is negligible new coins have been issued for 1000 pesos now 
worth some 40 cents 
the crisis reveals the incredible banality of the bourgeoisie 
in power wrote carlos monsivais a leading essayist 
among the results he observed is the omnipresent idea of the 
failure of the official nation 
mexico city these days except in its most luxurious 
neighborhoods has taken on a tattered rundown look only part of 
the cause is lingering damage from the devastating earthquake of 
sept 19 1985 repairs and appearances generally are pushed back 
for more pressing needs 
cars taxis and trucks purchased during the oil boom years are 
still on the streets some of them just barely the number of 
street vendors entertainers and beggars has proliferated 
the debate about the causes of the crisis and the ways to 
resolve it has spilled most noticeably into mexican cultural life 
in this period marked by survival popular nationalism is 
expressed as antigovernmental malice lack of confidence 
cynicism and skepticism about the national future monsivais 
wrote 
salinas de gortari focused one of his campaign forums on 
culture and national identity where he said mexican culture 
is so strong that it is what is going to allow us to remain as an 
independent nation 
the pri has made national identity its own poet novelist 
and ecological activist homero aridjis said theyve created a 
symbiosis of the country with the governing system 
as a result he said in an interview those who criticize the 
government often have been accused of attacking mexico 
recent campaigns to whip up enthusiasm especially on the 
private televisa broadcast network that pervades mexico have 
focused on such national symbols as the red white and green colors 
that are shared by the country and the pri

people are tired of being manipulated aridjis said 
people are less stupid than the government believes 
even those who criticize the government most sharply refer to 
the tremendous reservoir of mexican culture that provides a base 
for the nation 
it has a solidity comparable to that of the old oriental 
cultures enrique krauze managing editor of the magazine vuelta 
said at salinas de gortaris campaign forum the profound mexican 
culture doesnt need to be defended from anyone other than its 
defenders 
vuelta was founded by octavio paz the poet and essayist whose 
the labyrinth of solitude remains a key work in the search for 
mexican identity 
the raw material for mexican nationalism and culture runs deep 
far beyond the red white and green 
each sept 15 1 million mexicans crowd the zocalo plaza in 
downtown mexico city to commemorate the grito or shout of 
independence in 1810 
just off the plaza the ruins of the aztec indians great temple 
have been uncovered the artifacts found there are on display in a 
newly opened magnificent museum 
on dec 12 each year hundreds of thousands of faithful visit 
the basilica of our lady of guadalupe the revered roman catholic 
patron saint of mexico whose image is found everywhere from 
construction sites to the bedrooms of the wealthy 
the pri televisa and the catholic church are the great 
manipulators roberto marquez a 27yearold artist who moved to 
phoenix ariz three years ago said in an interview 
he said however that living abroad has given him a new 
appreciation of the complexity of mexico 
i think that this is a moment of change because the mexican 
revolution already happened 60 years ago marquez said now 
the mexican reality is something else we cant keep on in the same 
way 
in mexico right now theres great skepticism very strong 
pessimism said luis mandoki the young director of the academy 
awardnominated movie gaby a true story 
he said that frustration among many mexicans has not been able 
to find an outlet because of the lack of organization among the 
opposition 
others are milder in their evaluations 
philosopher leopoldo zea said resentment of the governments 
inability to confront the economic crisis has not become 
generalized antigovernment feeling 
he attributed that in part to the stoic nature often attributed 
to the mexican people referring to a saying the indian gets 
angry every 100 years but when he gets angry he gets really 
angry 
the myths of modern mexico blend the indian and colonial spanish 
heritages into the mestizo demonstrated in the plaza of three 
cultures that showcases indian ruins a colonial church and a 
modern office tower 
reality also can include substantial racial and class 
differences 
guadalupe loaeza a witty chronicler of the upper class has 
published her collected columns as rich girls 
she wrote that a wealthy woman who once traveled six times to 
san diego or europe each year now goes just four times and 
believes how good that the peso was devalued because now the 
lines of nacos wont be as long for skiing 
naco is the epithet for low class 
the pri traditionally has had its base in the working and 
peasant classes increasingly more open to modern ideas through the 
spread of television and hit especially hard by the crisis 
its up in the air rafael segovia former director of the 
prestigious colegio de mexico research institution said in an 
interview being mexican has no other condition than being 
mexican you dont have to paint like diego rivera 
rivera and other artists earlier in this century turned to 
mexicanness a search for identity in the supposedly pure 
indian roots of the nation 
most contemporary artists look elsewhere for images however 
its certainly not the reality of the cities not mexico 
city said marquez the young artist 
there may be too many different regions classes and other 
factors at work for modern mexico to be summed up simply 
theres a new search in light of whats happening said 
arturo azuela a novelist and director of the school of philosophy 
and letters at the national university of mexico i think that a 
crucial work is going to come out very soon 
his father mariano azuela wrote the underdogs one of the 
most famous novels about the mexican revolution 
the opponents of the pri say it has outlived its usefulness and 
now is a creation addicted to power and bloated by corruption 
guadalupe robles romero a 36yearold administrator in the 
governments social security institute walked into cardenas 
offices last fall and now is a candidate for city assemblywoman in 
her first experience in politics 
i think that theres going to be change she said and not 
in the long run in the short run 
the pri has surprised in the past by displaying an astonishing 
ability to adapt to the needs of the times salinas de gortari and 
his supporters say they can muster the necessary changes this time

editors note its a school for doityourself sheep shearers 
in eastern pennsylvania where sheep farmers are largely 
parttimers who have small flocks of 50 or less but somebody still 
hs to shear them and therein lies the problem commercial shearers 
dont want to fool with small flocks 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
shearing a sheep is nothing like cutting hair 
theres no delicacy no style and no one seems to mind if the 
customer suffers a few nicks scrapes or even gouges as long as 
theyre not near a vital organ 
the idea is to cut off the fleece as quickly as possible 
because like little boys sheep get fidgety around barbers 
its harder than it looks says shirley mounts of 
claysville wiping the sweat off her brow with the back of a hand 
after tackling a halfshorn ewe seeking freedom im always 
afraid im going to cut the daylights out of them 
one sad ewe ambled off with about four sizable cuts but nobody 
seemed concerned 
theyre a long way from the heart remarked one student as 
mrs mounts 32 fretted over her blunders 
mrs mounts was one of 18 sheep fanciers who recently took a 
class on how to cut fleece without cutting the animal the twoday 
program sponsored by the washington county agricultural extension 
office is held once a year during the spring shearing season in 
this hilly farmstudded corner of southwestern pennsylvania 
sheep farmer david horn opens up his large wooden barn perched 
on a slope overlooking neatly grazed pastures and provides 
students with as many customers as they need to hone their 
skills in return horn gets about half of his flock of 180 shorn 
for free although the results are a little ragged 
i was going to experiment with mine but im sort of glad i 
didnt i think i would have killed them said dave krupski 30 
who raises 15 sheep on a relatives farm in independence township 
its hard work believe it or not a lot of them arent lambs 
theyre lions some will sit and lay in your lap but the ones with 
the horns are real feisty ive done five sheep in eight hours and 
they say the australians can do a sheep every 1 minutes 
agricultural extension agents say that after two days of 
classes students are able to shear a sheep in about five minutes 
speed means money to commercial shearers who charge about 2 a 
head but for the students who just want to learn enough to shear 
their own flocks speed means the difference between doing it right 
and not doing it at all 
sheep get fussy if theyre fussed over for too long 
after years of hard times sheep farming in this country is on 
the rebound in the west its a fulltime job because flocks 
number in the hundreds and thousands but in eastern states like 
pennsylvania sheep farmers are largely parttimers who have small 
flocks of 50 or fewer says the appropriately named joanna shepherd 
of the washington county extension service 
in washington county and neighboring greene county the states 
two leading sheepraising counties commercial shearers are a 
premium she says sheep farmers particularly those with small 
flocks have been turning to the classes mainly because they cant 
find anyone to do the job 
last year nine people signed up for beginning sheep shearing 
this year 22 wanted to attend but four had to be turned away 
because there werent enough instructors 
we have only 35 sheep people dont want to be bothered with 
them says bill smith 39 of lagonda then when you do find 
someone they dont show up till the end of june and your sheep 
are about dying from the heat 
at one end of the barn extension agent ed wood coached a 
teenage boy on the importance of keeping his free hand away from 
the clippers sharp teeth 
get your hands out of the wool or youll cut yourself wood 
barked over the incessant buzzing of a dozen clippers 
but as the teen moved his hand away he failed to pull the skin 
taut causing the clippers to leave about a inch layer of fuzz 
youre leaving too much wool on her wood complained if 
you sold wool you wouldnt have enough money to go out on saturday 
nights 
to get the maximum value for a fleece it has to be cut closely 
with long strokes so it comes off all in one piece shearers start 
from the back left side work up to the belly head and back and 
then repeat the procedure on the right side ending up at the back 
right leg 
proper clipping technique means nothing though if the shearer 
cant pin down a struggling 130pound sheep 
you need to know where to put your legs how to hold the 
animal how to stretch their skin ms shepherd says you 
concentrate on how to get the wool off later 
for horn and most of the countrys sheep farmers who mainly 
raise sheep for meat wool is a secondary commodity a fleece from 
most meat breeds weighs about five pounds with the price per pound 
averaging just under 1 ms shepherd says after paying for the 
price of shearing the farmer makes about 3 per animal from the 
wool 
if the fleece is cut improperly or is too dirty or coarse he 
gets even less 
sheep are shorn late in the spring after cold weather has passed 
but before the onset of summers high temperatures domestic sheep 
have to be shorn once a year to maintain a highquality fleece and 
to rid the animal of accumulated dirt and parasites and it simply 
helps them feel more comfortable 
sometimes though their drastic change in appearance is 
unsettling especially to their own lambs 
a lot of them dont recognize their mothers at first horn 
says theyll bawl for a while 
an increasing number of people in pennsylvania are turning to 
sheep as a hobby or to supplement their incomes ms shepherd says 
people like sheep she says its an animal most of us can 
physically handle without a lot of fuss they dont take a whole 
lot they just eat grass and a little bit of grain and theyre 
nice they must be just look at what these students are doing to 
them

don yesso whod never acted before was 
offered a role on the tv series franks place when he met the 
producer of the show while flying from new orleans to los angeles 
to look for a coaching job 
yesso plays shorty an assistant cook at the chez louisianne run 
by tim reid in the critically acclaimed series the show is not on 
the cbs fall schedule but the network says it definitely will 
return when an advantageous time slot can be found 
hugh wilson the createrproducer of franks place was 
struck by yessos wit gift of gab and a new orleans accent as 
thick as gumbo he figured it would be easier to teach yesso how to 
act than to teach a professional actor how to talk like a resident 
of new orleans ninth ward the accent which is not quite cajun or 
southern is more akin to brooklynese 
i live here now yesso says i like this stuff i like 
being a thespian 
yesso a mixture of italian french and american indian grew up 
near the irish channel about two or three miles from downtown new 
orleans he graduated from louisiana state university where he 
played football at lsu and was an ncaa weightlifting champion 
he also worked as a bartender manager of various nightclubs a 
sales representative and owner of a downhome delicatessen his 
only previous brush with the movie business came during college 
when he had a nonspeaking role as a bodyguard in a movie about 
huey p long 
he tells how he met wilson on a flight to the west coast 
hugh came walking down the aisle of the plane and saw my 
cigarette hed quit smoking 43 days earlier and asked for a 
cigarette he sat down and we had a drink and started talking about 
new orleans then he said he didnt know if he could work it out 
but how would i like to work on tv i thought he was joking 
i had to send in a photo and a resume i sent them a polaroid 
snapshot i stood on the sidewalk and waved i looked like tommy 
tourist hugh kept telling cbs it was easier to teach me how to act 
than to teach an actor how to talk like i do when he told me i had 
the job i went out and bought three books on acting two of them i 
couldnt read 
yesso says he found his role as shorty somewhat easy because he 
had grown up in a neighborhood similar to that in franks place 
its supposed to be hard to look natural in front of a 
camera he says i hate to sound cocky but it came easy to me 
i guess i was lucky i think shorty and i are pretty 
interchangeable hes a little slow but theres something about 
him the way i try to portray him is that hes a sensitive lovable 
guy a mans man that the women find appealing 
besides acting yesso wrote the christmas show last year he has 
ideas for several more shows and is working on story ideas for 
other series he is also under consideration for roles in several 
feature films 
apparently johnny carson is also taken with yesso who was 
recently on the tonight show for his fourth appearance 
the last time i was on i had all my friends in the 
audience he says johnny found out about it later and said 
why didnt you tell me id have brought them on stage 
even carson finds it hard to resist friends named stormin 
norman bucket the dude dr vinny boombah and his girlfriend 
booboo ii and angigolo which is a cross between angelo and gigolo 
angelo thinks hes real smooth with the ladies yesso 
explains and vinny used to have a girlfriend named booboo he 
liked the name so much he called his new girlfriend booboo ii 
yessos friend bucket recently had a son the name what else 
but pail 
yesso contends he perfected blackened food before chef paul 
prudhomme made blackened redfish a national favorite ive cooked 
for years he says and being a bachelor i blackened 
everything i didnt know it was fashionable

it was the thorniest dilemma of the 1988 tony 
awards 
three littleknown but accomplished actresses with names that 
sound confusingly similar kimberleigh aarn kimberly scott and l 
scott caldwell 
all three were from the same broadway play and all three were 
nominated for a tony in the same category their competition was 
the talented and much better known performer kate nelligan but 
when the winner was announced last month it was l scott caldwell 
taking the prize for best featured actress in a play 
this is going to sound funny but a part of me expected to 
win says caldwell pointing to her heart in my head i didnt 
think about it much because when i intellectualized it i thought 
well the tony voters might get mixed up about whos who and kate 
nelligan is an established actress 
in her tony acceptance speech the actress first thanked her 
mother brothers and sister back in chicago 
because i was interested in the theater they were she 
says i converted them in a way but they have always pushed me 
saying you can do it 
the interest was born in chicago when caldwell was 8 years old 
and spent every afternoon in a south side movie theater where a 
friend of her mothers worked as a cleaning lady for almost a 
year her baby sitters were stars like joan crawford bette davis 
and loretta young up on that big screen 
i think thats how it kind of got to me caldwell recalls 
i didnt say to myself i want to be an actress or anything like 
that but i loved film and i loved what they did 
what they did was what she wanted to do but it took a while for 
her to realize that ambition to act her persistence paid off last 
month when caldwell picked up that tony for her performance in 
joe turners come and gone by august wilson 
the play now on view at broadways ethel barrymore theater is 
one in a series of works by wilson chronicling the black experience 
in america during the 20th century wilson plans one play for each 
decade so far ma raineys black bottom fences and joe 
turner have made it to broadway and a fourth the piano 
lesson is a possibility for next spring 
joe turner is set in a pittsburgh boarding house in 1911 and 
concerns the children of slaves coming to terms with their past and 
present each character searches for what wilson refers to in the 
play as their song 
in joe turner caldwell plays bertha holly the patient 
practical wife of the boarding house owner its a role she says 
that has softened her own less optimistic view of life 
i think it was a happy accident that i got this role because 
im a cynical person the actress says i dont have a real 
rosy view of the world its kind of cautiously optimistic bertha 
is just positive throughandthrough it balances me out to play a 
woman who doesnt have any question about who she is and about 
life 
for caldwell the idea of becoming an actress didnt crystalize 
until she was in high school and saw a production of douglas turner 
wards day of absence at the hyde park theater 
it was the first time i saw black people on stage she 
recalls and i thought i could be up there 
her family didnt have the money to send her to drama school so 
caldwell went to work as a telephone operator she got married had 
a son and decided to go to college majoring in communications and 
theater at loyola in chicago 
her obsession with the theater grew when she saw uta hagen 
discuss her acting school on a television talk show caldwell sent 
for an application to hb studios the school hagen runs with her 
husband and was told she would have to come to new york for an 
audition 
with her husbands approval caldwell came to new york in 1979 
for what she thought would be a twomonth visit she ended up 
staying getting into hagens acting class as well as the negro 
ensemble company run by douglas turner ward 
caldwell made the difficult commitment to remain in new york 
her marriage ended and she sent her son ominara back to chicago 
to live with his father the boy now 15 also was singled out for 
special praise in caldwells tony acceptance speech 
but her professional career kept going forward the job with the 
negro ensemble company blossomed into a role on broadway when the 
companys production of home moved to the big time since then 
she has worked steadily in regional theater soap operas and 
commercials now joe turner has finally given her recognition 
in the new york theater community 
im very proud of the work ive done in joe turner 
caldwell says im extremely proud of it because i feel the role 
wasnt all there on paper i felt i was able to give the character 
three dimensions and im very very happy about that

what lies ahead for aghanistan as the soviets 
leave for home a marxist government is determined to retain power 
but moslem guerrillas are just as determined to oust it is a 
sharpened battle shaping up between an atheistic political ideology 
and a leading world religion what happens when that battle is 
over here is a report from a correspondent who has covered 
afghanistan from his base in neighboring pakistan 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with the soviet military withdrawal 
from afghanistan a new chapter begins for the warravaged country 
like the previous one it too may be written in blood 
for with the soviets gone the division between afghan marxism 
and islam the predominant religion becomes even sharper and the 
prospect of even bloodier fighting is heightened 
on the sidelines in pakistan and iran are more than 5 million 
afghan war refugees waiting to go back home in what will be the 
largest mass movement of people since world war ii 
afghans of all persuasions agree that 10 years of civil war the 
past eight with soviet involvement have changed their country 
forever 
leaders of the moslem insurgent groups based at peshawar in 
pakistan have vowed to continue fighting until they topple the 
marxist government in kabul the capital and proclaim afghanistan 
an islamic republic 
the afghan communists appear confident they can hold their own 
even with the soviet military departed while soviet armed might is 
leaving moscows influence remains strong in the capital of the 
nation that sits strategically at the soviet unions southern 
underbelly 
in a curious accord signed this spring in geneva the united 
states and the soviet union agreed to continue arming their 
respective clients until either side stops 
the april 14 agreement set the guidelines for some 103000 
soviet troops to withdraw from afghanistan by feb 15 1989 the 
pullout began this past may 15 
pakistan which has served as conduit for mainly us arms to 
the guerrillas pledged with kabul not to interfere in each others 
affairs but to work for the safe return of the afghan refugees now 
in pakistan and iran 
the geneva accord is not a peace accord in the real sense but 
it gives the soviet union a facesaving pretext to end its 
involvement in the war said a pakistani foreign ministry 
spokesman following the custom here that spokesmen remain 
anonymous the rest is up to the afghans themselves 
the afghan people are a tapestry of tribes and clans accustomed 
to running their own affairs before the marxist peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan pdpa seized power in a bloody coup in april 
1978 
it sparked a broad rebellion by devout moslems tribal warlords 
and merchants 
soviet troops aircraft and armor came in december 1979 with the 
replacement of one promoscow regime with another the soviets 
eventually learned at a price what the united states also learned 
in vietnam that even a superpower army is ill suited to fight a 
determined guerrilla war 
eight years of experience and growing arms supplies from the 
united states china and saudi arabia have whipped the socalled 
islamic rebels into an effective fighting force they have learned 
to operate us stinger antiaircraft missiles and other 
sophisticated weapons 
the guerrillas known as the mujahedeen holy warriors already 
have scored a series of successes since the soviet red army started 
its march home the victories came mainly in the border regions of 
eastern afghanistan where kabuls security forces were left behind 
however for a full victory the guerrillas would need to capture 
kabul and the afghan capital is a fortress of sovietbuilt 
defenses it would be a difficult task for the guerrillas to seize 
it and overthrow the government leaving them only with the 
recourse of seeking a political rather than military victory 
najib who uses one name as president of afghanistan and head of 
the ruling party refuses to discuss the possibility of his defeat 
asked recently whether he would seek refugee abroad if the 
guerrillas take over the burly former chief of secret police said 
we shall not allow such a thing 
western diplomatic sources in islamabad say however their 
missions in kabul have received reports of major construction under 
way at mazarisharif the capital of northern balkh province just 
36 miles from the soviet border 
new intensive construction activity sponsored by the ruling 
party has lent some credence to claims the pdpa might attempt to 
establish a fallback position in the north should it be unable to 
hold kabul said one western embassy in a background report 
issued on condition that its country remain anonymous 
at the same time most foreign analysts who keep watch on 
afghanistan predict the absence of the soviets will unleash an 
armed power struggle within the ranks of each of the opposing sides 
najibs own party for example is bitterly split between his 
parcham banner wing and the khalq masses faction which 
dominates the police and military even the parchamites are divided 
between najib supporters and those of former leader babrak karmal 
whom najib replaced in may 1986 ostensibly for health reasons 
in peshawar the seven major mujahedeen parties are themselves 
split between moslem revolutionaries and moderate traditionalists

exile and guerrilla leaders are known to have argued to the 
point of drawing guns on each other although publicly they put up 
a united front 
a third factor lies in the rival guerrilla groups inside 
afghanistan who have a reputation for occasional internecine 
clashes 
some analysts believe the coming months will show how much 
loyalty guerrillas in the field have toward their pakistanbased 
political leaders some of whom have never been in combat the 
combat guerrillas have made it clear they are willing fight to oust 
the marxists from kabul but not to install someone in their place 
who seeks only political power of his own 
despite differences the mujahedeen alliance has formed its own 
afghan government based on the tenets of islam 
gulbaddin hekmatyar the alliance chairman and head of the 
radical hezbiislami group said the new government is 
preparing to set up in the mountains west of kabul 
he and other mujahedeen leaders stress that because they are 
sunni moslems their government would not be comparable to the 
shiiterun government of iran 
sunnis who form the majority of all moslems worldwide tend to 
follow a more tolerant theology they also lack the rigidity of 
shiite clergical structure that provides a natural chain of command 
and communication for propagating islamicfundamentalist revolution 
but whoever finally emerges the victor may rule a largely 
apathetic people 
in addition to the afghans tradition of local control they 
will be preoccupied with a massive reconstruction of homes farms 
and public works 
some afghans in sunbaked refugee camps of pakistan have begun 
trickling home to areas controlled by the guerrillas but 
mujahedeen and foreign observers agree that the exodus probably 
will begin a year from now 
alliance chairman hekmatyar in a recent meeting with western 
private aid groups listed four conditions for the safe return of 
refugees the withdrawal of all russian forces fall of najibs 
government removal of all possibilities of war and defusing of all 
antipersonnel mines 
the bearded turbaned hekmatyar estimated that 55 million land 
mines planted by soviet and afghan government troops litter the 
countryside from fertile valley to craggy mountain western 
diplomats believe the figure is closer to 3 million 
international red cross hospitals along pakistans border with 
afghanistan report an alarming increase in minerelated injuries 
the united nations high commissioner for refugees predicts that 
when the shooting finally stops it will be followed by the 
greatest migration of people since moslem pakistan was carved off 
of hindu india at the end of british rule in 1947 
there will need to be a massive rehabilitation effort said 
anthony land director of the high commissioners suboffice in 
peshawar describing it as the largest such project in un history 
hekmatyar recently said the whole country is in ruins canals 
and irrigation systems are badly damaged or destroyed 
neither afghans nor foreign experts agree to what extent the 
afghans will go back to their old feudal ways once the war is over 
isayal ghairad a 34yearold former schoolteacher from 
northeastern kunar province said the war ultimately may have a 
positive effect 
it has changed the political awareness of the people he 
said at his refugee camp munda no 6 near peshawar now they 
know about socialism they know hekmatyar and other leaders 
masood khalili a spokesman for the jamiatiislami guerrilla 
group said the war also has been an education for his men 
some of these people when they left afghanistan had never 
seen a postage stamp now they can operate complicated weapons 
their families have now seen what a city peshawar looks like 
in afghanistan the war goes on but for the first time in a 
decade of brutal fighting the antimarxists have sniffed victory 
our morale is very high and the enemys is weak said a 
guerrilla commander mahmood we know we can win and so do 
they

although they put up a united front 
the leaders of afghanistans moslem insurgents the mujahedeen 
holy warriors are a diverse group 
what unites them is a common belief in islam and a determination 
to crush the marxists who run afghanistans government in kabul 
the sevenparty mujahedeen alliance is mainly an arms conduit to 
guerrillas fighting the soviet and afghan armies inside 
afghanistan it also is an identifiable organization with which the 
international community can deal 
here is a rundown of the leaders and groups 
sibghatullah mojadeddi head of the afghan national liberation 
front recently claimed his group would be among the strongest if 
he received his fair slice of the supply pie 
the most visible and contentious of leaders is gulbaddin 
hekmatyar chief of the hezbiislami fighters and current chairman 
of the alliance the radical wing accuses him of of murder theft 
and fanning party rivalry still hezbiislami has been a major 
recipient of us chinese and saudi arabian arms 
a target of hekmatyars antagonism has been the 
jamiatiislami another fervent moslem group but considered to be 
one of the best military organizations its leader is the venerable 
professor burhanuddin rabbani a tajik but the majority of afghans 
are pathans like hekmatyar 
maulvi yunis khalis the redbeareded barrelchested leader of 
a faction that split off from hekmatyar is often called the 
fighting mullah he abruptly resigned as alliance chairman in 
march a month later he was back fighting in afghanistan 
the lightweight party on the radical wing is abdul rasul 
sayyafs ittehadiislami however it spawned ahmad shah newly 
appointed president of an allmujahedeen government 
moderates also claim to be devout moslems but are known for 
their western manners and tastes they are syed ahmed gailanis 
national islamic front of afghanistan maulvi nabi mohammadis 
harakat party and mojadeddis nifa all three are considered small 
although mojadeddi reportedly got an increase in arms supplies 
recently when he resigned from the alliance then rejoined 
despite the differences and diversities the insurgent military 
strategies are increasingly more coordinated and the mujahedeen 
have moved into several abandoned bases in afghanistan without 
infighting 
the alliance maintains there will be no armed power play in 
postwar afghanistan 
perhaps a more reliable barometer is the man in the field many 
guerrillas say they are prepared to die fighting the marxist 
government but they will not fight for a political leader who 
seeks only power

the inscription chiseled in 1948 on the 
turretlike gates separating pakistan and afghanistan reads we 
are brothers no power on earth can separate us 
not even the coils of barbed wire slumped along the border fence 
like tumbleweed 
najib has made that i have not says one of three afghan 
soldiers peering through steel bars into pakistan 
najib is the current leader of afghanistans marxist government 
which has been fighting a guerrilla war with pakistanbased islamic 
insurgents 
the border bisects this village of 1000 people in a valley of 
the famed khyber pass through which the armies of alexander the 
great genghis khan and great britain marched in search of riches 
in the east 
people on each side live under different flags but consider 
themselves pathans the ethnic majority of afghanistan and 
northwest pakistan 
they believe in the inscription on the gate not the barricade 
most of the afghanpakistani border is tribal territory and a 
political nomans land 
the law is laid down by tribal chiefs like nader khan leader of 
the afridi pathan tribe 
we may seem two different people but we are actually the 
same he said at his home on the pakistan side 
khan says his people support the afghan guerrillas most of whom 
also are pathans he says tribal members who have been found to be 
aiding the kabul government have been punished under tribal law 
we have burned their homes down he said 
najib is a pathan and former acquaintance of khans but now 
they are enemies to a point 
as khan says if najib must flee kabul he could come home to his 
tribal area and feel safe 
the pathan code of ethics demands that 
he can come said the chief

on the surface west germany is 
booming 
flashy mercedesbenz sedans whip along the autobahns and 
shoppers pack highpriced boutiques 
travel agencies beckon west germans to exotic vacation spots 
and a new yuppie generation packs trendy bars after work 
yet private economists looking below the surface and into the 
fhing might be awry 
they see weak spots in uture fear sometthe wirtschaftswunder 
the economic 
miracle that won west germans acclaim not long after it got under 
way 39 years ago with the proclamation of west germany as a 
separate nation 
specifically these nongovernment economist see complacency and 
sluggishness setting in between the lines of statistics that 
continue to show economic strength 
they believe the government must fire up the economy in some key 
sectors promote more investment by west german business and take 
other measures to ensure that good times last 
the united states thinks so too but for one slightly different 
reason west germans should buy more us and other foreign goods 
to reduce its trade surplus of around 70 billion 
eost important problem 
stemming from slow economic growth is the countrys high 
unemployment rate 
the rate last year averaged 89 percent or about 223 million 
people compared with 61 percent in the united states 
about 3 million of west germanys 613 million people now live 
on welfare up from slightly more than 2 million in 1981 an 
increasing number of recipients are the longterm unemployed who 
switch to welfare when their unemployment insurance runs out 
fears also run high that unemployment may be fueling hatred of 
the 45 million foreigners living in west germany many of whom 
were invited as workers during the countrys economic booms of the 
1960s and 1970s 
this past october in bremerhaven an unemploymentplagued port 
voters elected a rightwing radical to the bremen state legislature 
but interior ministry officials strongly reject any suggestion 
that high unemployment could lead to a widespread rise of extreme 
rightwing sentiment as in the years before adolf hitlers third 
reich 
in the 1960s when the economy was booming there was much 
more right extremist activity here than there is today said 
interior ministry spokesman michaelandreas butz 
government officials also point out that the estimated 25200 
known rightwing extremists are a very small percentage of the 
countrys population 
meanwhile economic experts are predicting the countrys economy 
will actually slow down from an expected 2 percent growth rate this 
year to 125 percent in 1989 despite a 42 percent growth 
performance in the first quarter of this year 
west germanys economy grew by about 16 percent a year between 
1982 and 1987 compared to 35 percent in japan over the same 
period and 26 percent in the united states 
among the more frequently mentioned as obstacles to improved 
economic growth are laws curtailing store business hours quotas on 
licenses for new businesses and labor laws that severely restrict 
layoffs 
these laws are great for people already set up with jobs or 
businesses but they make entry for newcomers very difficult

for world economic research in kiel

proposals to change such regulations face intense opposition 
from privateinterest groups and labor unions 
for example about 7000 protesters hit the streets in bonn on 
may 29 to protest government proposals that would extend the hours 
stores could stay open 
stores must close by 630 pm on weekdays and by 2 pm on 
saturdays however they can remain open all afternoon on one 
saturday a month 
at the same time workers and labor unons are pressuring to have 
their work weeks shortened without pay cuts 
the countrys biggest trade unions have declared a 35hour work 
week as their goal the metalworking automobile and printing 
industries are already down to 385 hours with contracts to reduce 
it to 37 hours in the 1990s 
the critics say fewer working hours mean less production 
government officials however insist that measures will be 
taken to ensure healthy economic growth 
they also reject the stinging claims made in the us congress 
report 
government spokesman friedhelm ost said west germany is 
fulfilling its responsibility toward the world economy 
he pointed to the governments plans to reform its tax and 
postal systems as means of stimulating greater west german 
consumption 
grosser the hwwa economist doesnt agree with the united 
states on the trade surplus and the suggestion that it could 
seriously damage the world economy 
i wouldnt consider this one of the problems hampering the 
world economy in a very important sense said grosser i think 
this issue is often exaggerated 
he maintained that the us budget and trade deficits have a far 
greater impact on the world economy 
the nations wealth is further reflected by its 1987 gross 
national product of 11 trillion the thirdhighest in the 
industrialized world 
west germanys automotive and chemical sectors remain especially 
strong 
in japan sales of west german cars last year were up 125 
percent over the 1979 level while us makers sales were off 76 
percent for the same period 
hoechst the leading west german chemicals group last year 
posted a 104 percent aftertax profit and expects strong sales 
this year as well with much of its business overseas 
grosser says he isnt worried about the automotive and chemical 
sectors 
our trade surplus may be a source of trouble with our friends 
but it still shows something very important about west germany the 
quality of our work is highly respected said grosser 
but some experts still insist that west germans will have to be 
more daring if they want to preserve the legacy of the 
wirtschaftswunder 
there will have to be some new concepts in economic policies 
but in the end it will be better said ute geipel a west german 
economist for the americanowned citibank in frankfurt

in the heart of south america a sprawling 
wetlands that stretches 154000 square miles into four countries is 
imperiled by poachers mercury poisoning and cocaine traffic 
called the pantanal it is a wildlife haven a littleknown 
utopia for hundreds of bird species waterfowl wild marsh deer 
crocodiles blackspotted jaguars aquatic flowers and freshwater 
fish 
the floodplain is slightly smaller than california extending 
for 54000 square miles in brazil and 100000 square miles into 
bolivia paraguay and northern argentina 
it is known in parts of those other countries as the gran chaco 
in brazils pantanal in the sparsely populated western states 
of mato grosso and mato grosso do sul illegal but profitable 
activities encroach on this paradise 
just last year 2 million crocodiles were killed for their 
hides countless other animal skins and live exotic birds were 
smuggled out cocaine traffickers invaded the region in increasing 
numbers prospectors separating gold from river silt left behind 
some 40 tons of toxic mercury poisoning fish animals and people 
including themselves 
its a monumental problem guilherme augusto borges a 
biologist with mato grossos environmentalprotection agency said 
in an interview he added that the full extent of damage to the 
pantanal is not known and that research into the problem is in its 
infant stages 
but if it takes five years of study to find out whats 
happening here thats too long borges said it may be too 
late by then 
every year from october to march the waters of the 840mile 
paraguay river the pantanals main water source and its 
tributaries flood twothirds of the region 
the high water strands cows shoulderdeep and sometimes brings 
river snakes right to the doors of farmhouses without the floods 
there would be no pantanal the floods keep the swamps delicate 
ecosystem in balance high water allows wildlife to breed and 
discourages the pantanals main predator man 
cyclical chaotic flooding expected every decade or so and 
occurring this year threatening the lives of about 800000 cattle 
also is part of the natural aquatic balance uncontrolled flooding 
tends to be most serious around corumba on the paraguay river in 
mato grosso do sul just across the border from bolivia 
mayor hugo silva da costa of corumba a cancer surgeon turned 
politician said the flooding has been getting worse this year the 
waters in the region rose 22 feet seven feet above the level at 
which swamp isles are inundated and trees die depriving animals of 
their habitat 
the water gets higher and higher every year the mayor said 
the temperature is changing and in the dry season there is less 
water and less grass for grazing 
he added that he believed the changes were directly linked to 
increased human activity in the pantanal 
the pantanal is suffering and something has to be done 
fast said da costa who in april declared a state of emergency 
in corumba 
osvaldo da cunha a physician and the owner of a 29000acre 
ranch 75 miles from cuiaba mato grossos capital says a new 
environmental abuse in the pantanal comes from farms where dikes 
are built to hold off flooding and chemical pesticides are used to 
grow rice corn and soybeans 
with dikes the land can be used year round he said but 
the water barriers upset the natural cycle 
da cunha said also that crocodile hunting in the pantanal now 
illegal but almost impossible to control may become legal because 
of the violent economic pressure because of brazils chronic 
unemployment and runaway inflation 
to discourage poachers from invading his santa inez ranch da 
cunha has begun a laborious process of fingerprinting his 
caiman crocodiles cousins of the alligators found in the southern 
united states much in the style of the branding of cattle 
biologist anacleto garcia de arruda 26 who is in charge of the 
project midnight rounds in a canoe grabbing crocodiles by the 
neck 
he starts with baby caimans weighing them counting their teeth 
and pinning colored sequins on their scales to identify them 
through maturity he says he has no idea of the number of 
crocodiles on the ranch and that the branding process will take 
four years 
the caimans are easy prey for poachers who at night paralyze 
them with strong flashlights beamed into their crimson 
reflectorlike eyes then they shoot them

caiman hides are considered third rate in the international 
fashion market and sell for the equivalent of just 10 apiece 
still they are good enough for making popularly priced womens 
shoes belts and handbags and so clandestine hunters find them 
profitable 
the police say a flourishing crocodile hideforcocaine trade 
exists in the pantanal but they have yet to catch anyone 
in corumba alone 660 pounds of cocaine were seized last year 
on the other side of the river in puerto suarez bolivia which 
has 1200 people and 490 taxis stuffed caimans are displayed in 
souvenir shops corumba is believed to be a main gateway for 
bolivian cocaine 
in pocone a tiny pantanal town 75 miles from cuiaba the 
environmental threat stems from an uncontrolled gold rush taxi 
drivers quote prices in gold instead of in brazils weak cruzado 
currency practically every other store buys and sells gold 
but in the environs the mercury used in the primitive 
extraction of gold has left its mark hollow trees decaying like 
skeletons 
people want gold and they dont care how they take it out 
said catia nunes da cunha coordinator of mato grossos 
environmental agency 
in 1987 tens of thousands of rough freelance prospectors used 
mercury to extract an estimated 50 tons of brazilian gold much of 
it from the northern pantanal much of that reportedly was smuggled 
out of brazil and never appeared on official registers according 
to the environmental agency 
about 60 percent of the mercury in the gold processing remains 
as an environmentpolluting residue ms da cunha said mercury 
poisons wildlife and people gold prospectors themselves are 
affected by it when they eat pantanal fish and game often winding 
up with nervous disorders and transmitting birth defects to their 
offspring 
brazils environmental laws severely restrict the use of 
mercury but in the remote pantanal the laws are widely ignored 
the evironmental situation in the wetlands would be worse were 
it not for the pantaneiros as the wetlands natives are called 
in brazils portuguese language they mostly are swamp cowboys 
working for local ranches who take it upon themselves to try to 
counter the poachers and gold miners 
these unofficial law enforcers and conservationists often 
piloting river canoes try to care for endangered crocodiles 
jaguars river otters wild swamp deer giant anteaters and 
capybaras the worlds largest rodents which look like pigsized 
rabbits but without ears 
the pantaneiros also help protect macaws sapphirecolored 
tropical parrots with yellowringed eyes which often fetch 10000 
apiece overseas and which by law cant be killed or exported from 
brazil the pantaneiros say poachers trap macaws and other members 
of the parrot family by brushing glue on trees where the birds 
perch 
douglas trent an american tourist agent now living in brazil 
says rational sustainable tourism can help save the pantanal 
by increasing international awareness of the region 
but it must be done with caution he said tourism also 
can destroy caimans eat plastic film cannisters but dont digest 
them birds choke on candy wrappers and get their feet caught in 
fishing lines 
arne sucksdorf an awardwinning filmmaker who left his native 
sweden two decades ago to live in and document the pantanal said 
the pantanal is a legend but it is being killed

katherine helmonds juicy role as the hip 
mother with the swinging lifestyle was an afterthought when the hit 
abc comedy whos the boss was being created the actress said 
the show was originally written for two sisters one a working 
woman and one with lots of children said helmond one was a 
gogetter the other was very domestic 
but they found that combination never clicked they read a lot 
of young ladies but they felt it turned out to be kind of sour 
grapes each sister seemed a little envious of the other no matter 
how many times they rehearsed it they couldnt make it funny 
it finally occurred to the producers to give judith light a 
mother as a sparring partner tony danza stars as an exboxer who 
becomes a housekeeper 
when my name came up at a casting session i was doing a play

middle of everything a big strapping irish woman with red hair 
one of those texas women who says whatever she thinks

totally different people 
but somehow that triangle works she said this man who 
takes care of the house a highly successful woman who cant do a 
thing at home and her mother i think a lot of families today are 
made up of different elements two divorced women living together 
two fathers i think the cost of living today has contributed to 
these kind of madeup families 
helmond grew up in galveston texas and got her early dramatic 
training in houston and dallas she moved on to new york where she

imagine donald duck and daffy duck playing a madcap piano duet 
together mickey mouse and bugs bunny falling airily from the sky 
and betty boop in a nightclub lamenting she is a blackandwhite 
hasbeen while her rivals appear in color 
imagine just about every movie cartoon star youve ever seen 
and youve got the supporting cast of touchstone pictures who 
framed roger rabbit it is one of the cleverest feats of 
legerdemain ever to appear on a movie screen 
all hands and the credits run longer than those of star 
wars are to be congratulated for their talent and no doubt 
patience it is staggering to contemplate the amount of hours 
required to pull off such a stunt 
suspension of belief is necessary at the outset the moviemakers 
would have us believe that in 1947 hollywood there was a place 
called toon town where all the cartoon characters worked not only 
worked but lived breathed and intermingled with humans and 
filmmakers who put their cartoons together 
we see this at the very beginning when a comic named roger 
rabbit is blowing a scene with costar baby herman the human 
director bawls out roger and calls lunch studio boss rk maroon 
alan tilvern hires the seedy boozeslugging private eye eddie 
valiant bob hoskins to discover what is troubling roger 
it seems that roger worries that he is being twotimed by his 
wife a slinky siren with a battleship chest hoskins reluctantly 
takes the job and soon finds there is more trouble in toon town 
than anyone suspected a cadaverous blackcloaked judge 
christopher lloyd is trying to gain control of the studios so he 
can sell them for a freeway he is aided by a gang of bloodthirsty 
weasels 
the guiding force behind who framed roger rabbit was 
undoubtedly robert zemeckis who directed the last big success for 
steven spielberg back to the future aided by a witty script 
by jeffrey price and peter seaman zemeckis retains control 
throughout what must have been an agonizingly complicated 
production 
never have animation and live action combined so seamlessly 
director of animation richard johnson and his artists deserve high 
praise for their achievement meanwhile maintaining the integrity 
of the many cartoon stars 
bob hoskins is perfect as the hapless gumshoe eloquently 
expressing fear outrage and occasional compassion joanna cassidy 
is equally effective as his longsuffering moll christopher lloyd 
scarcely recognizable as the evil mastermind is an ideal villain 
ok so who framed roger rabbit is masterfully produced but 
is it hilarious not very often there are some funny gags as when 
hoskins enters a toon town night club with the password walt 
sent me the cartoon gags are the standard ones of gravity 
defiance and sock bam pow 
the most fun is the appearance of longloved characters in new 
settings a hippo ballerina from fantasia sits down on a studio 
bench and a man on the other end zooms into space dumbo flies 
outside a secondfloor window and the studio boss throws peanuts to 
him 
who framed roger rabbit was produced by robert watts and 
frank kennedy with steven spielberg and kathleen kennedy as

twenty years ago george romero probably didnt 
envision that his modest little horror movie night of the living 
dead would mutate into decades of celluloid zombies 
but the dead rose again and again until ken wiederhorns recent 
return of the living dead part ii which lorimar home video 
has released but unlike romeros heroic scare effort in which 
radiation turns corpses into killers the latest work is a 
mindless boring tale about a green vapor that turns the living 
into zombies who love to eat brains 
since the living dead movies have a cult following lorimar 
is spicing up its release with a tollfree telephone number which 
will enable viewers to order wearables including tank tops

suspect rcacolumbia home video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
suspect begins with seemingly unconnected events a supreme 
court justice blows his brains out a womans body is found lying 
in the potomac river the victim apparently of vagrants 
these are the raw in every sense of the word ingredients of 
this surprisingly droll diverting whodunit based in washington 
that takes a few choice pokes at politics along the way 
it may even remind you of the reallife watergate breakin that 
was no ordinary burglary this is no ordinary murder 
some advice to viewers without giving away the ending suspect 
everyone everyone 
cher plays kathleen riley a somewhat worldweary public 
defender with an interesting touch of diffidence she is assigned 
to defend a violenceprone deaf vagrant who is accused of the 
murder 
along comes eddie sanger a washington milk lobbyist played with 
convincing sleaze by dennis quaid sanger gets named to the jury on 
thismurder case sanger apparently wiser in the ways and wiles of 
official washington senses that the deaf defendant may be the fall 
guy for some very powerful villains 
he starts playing detective and feeds cher the clues that nearly 
get them both killed but which ultimately solve the crime 
all right all right its jury tampering but lets not be 
picky 
the end of suspect written by eric roth and directed by 
peter yates is somewhat disappointing wed have respected cher 
much more if she didnt melt with a girlish giggle into the arms of 
quaid 
and the body of the dead woman is so obviously a dummy that you 
want to ask the studio why they were too cheap to arrange for a 
halfway convincing corpus delicti

citizens band paramount home video vhs 5995 rated pg 
 
citizens band released in 1977 when the cb radio craze was 
at its height is one of few american films of recent years that 
may rank with the screwball comedies of the 1930s or frank capras 
whimsical slices of americana 
set in a small town this gently funny movie brings to life a 
rich and diverse assortment of characters including a 
downonherluck prostitute an embittered high school basketball 
coach and a bigamous longhaul truck driver all of whom rely 
heavily on their citizens band radios to relate to the outside 
world 
the hero known by his cb handle of spider is a radio 
repairman trying to cope with his brother his exgirl friend and 
his aging father a retired trucker who keeps threatening to eat 
the family dog spider played by paul le mat becomes a sort of 
airwaves vigilante tracking down the many eccentrics in the 
community who use their cbs for illicit purposes or rudely cross 
into other peoples channels 
screenwriter paul brickman who later wrote and directed risky 
business and director jonathan demme melvin and howard and 
something wild brilliantly weave this zany assortment of 
characters into a cohesive plot 
but they do even more the citizens band radio becomes a 
metaphor for the alienation and selfdeception that are part of the 
modern human condition and when the characters overcome their 
confusions and misunderstandings and break through their isolation 
the result is an ending thats not just happy but joyous 
in a truly ensemble cast all the performers are firstrate 
perhaps deserving special mention are roberts blossom as spiders 
crotchety father and marcia rodd and ann wedgeworth as the 
truckers wives who discover they are married to the same man and 
resolve their predicament with amazing good humor and aplomb

the mona lisas sister rca graham parker 
 
its only the second verse of the first song on the mona 
lisas sister when graham parker lets fly against one of his pet 
peeves 
some people are in charge of pens he spits that 
shouldnt be in charge of brooms they have the nerve to rip up a 
mans life in a paragraph or two 
lighten up graham we like you and we like your album 
parker a soulful british rocker burns with an intensity you 
can see through sunglasses he bitterly left two record companies 
when they didnt make him the star he and others thought he 
should be 
the mona lisas sister is his 10th album and one of his 
best parker has stripped down his music with an acoustic guitar 
the anchor instead of his rollicking former backup band the 
rumour its a smart move since the songs lose nothing in power 
and parkers strong melodies are accented 
all this would mean little of course if the songs werent 
there and this is parkers strongest collection since 1979s 
squeezing out sparks 
parker has a keen eye for injustices of any sort and along with 
critics he takes apart polluters big defense spenders 
hypocritical yuppies girls who grow up too fast and shallow 
successes 
somebodys pouring salt on a wound he sings in ok 
hieronymus scooping out monkeys brains with a spoon working 
up warfare on the moon thats just the latest phase we just want 
to curl up and die 
fortunately parkers world view is not entirely negative on 
the fine ballad blue highways he recognizes theres a better 
america beyond what he doesnt like on the surface 
and the album closes with a gorgeous version of sam cookes 
cupid the idea isnt new but rarely has the sense of love as 
a salvation been carried out so well on a record

aliens ate my buick emimanhattan thomas dolby 
 
thomas dolbys new album secures him a place next to howard 
jones as the best of the synthmeisters 
dolby might cringe at that label because synthesizers are often 
associated with droning shallow music and aliens ate my buick 
is anything but that instead its hip witty intelligent and 
highly musical 
it doesnt take long for dolby to hit high gear on the opening 
cut the key to her ferrari after an introductory voiceover by 
robin leach dolby sings i dont want your love i dont want 
your money i just want the key to your ferrari the records 
tone is set 
other highlights include my brain is like a sieve which 
along with a great title features a beguiling melody hot 
sauce a george clinton composition that will steam up any dance 
floor with its groove and lyrics and airhead in which dolby 
sings about a woman friend 
shes an airhead stun gun and mace kharmann ghia plates say 
lost in space 
dolby sings in french and latin impersonates a jamaican and 
calls on actor ed asner for a cameo searing guitar breaks snappy 
bass lines and even a trombone help keep the synthesizers in their 
place the artists name notwithstanding theres no need for noise

not content with being a hired hand as 
well as head of an acting dynasty martin sheen has taken the leap 
into the treacherous world of film production 
the chairman of the board of symphony pictures is proud of two 
current films he fostered judgment in berlin a cold war 
adventure and courtroom drama and da based on the hit play by 
hugh leonard sheen stars in both movies and also served as 
executive producer for the projects 
i had wanted for a very long time to be more than a hired 
hand he said i wanted to have more say in the choice of 
material from start to finish and to realize a personal vision i 
think most actors who want a long career feel that way 
this presented an opportunity to pursue that intention 
basically not to be at the whim of a producer or a project because 
of financial or professional need i cant think of a television or 
theatrical movie or a play that i didnt want to project some 
personal change into it becomes very frustrating because youre 
always at the mercy of the director the editor or whoever 
both new films were hard sells judgment in berlin based on 
the book by judge herbert j stern combined a plane hijacking and 
a court case sheen and his partner william greeblatt could find 
no company for the project until they uttered the magic words sean 
penn the hot young actor agreed to play a small but vital role in 
the movie because his father leo penn was directing new line 
cinema agreed to finance the film 
when sean came into the picture in large measure to support 
his father he had a supporting not a starring role sheen said 
for him to have shown so much respect for his father and to risk 
a measure of his own career we owed him a huge debt of gratitude 
sheen who is half irish fell in love with da when he first 
saw the play 10 years ago it tells of a new york playwright who 
returns to his native ireland to bury his father but the old man 
returns to life in the sons memory to relive their troubled lives 
together the play won a tony award for the veteran american actor 
barnard hughes who also stars in the movie version 
bill greenblatt and i were flabbergasted when we tried to 
acquire the rights for da and found them available sheen said 
we were told by bill leonard that there had been an arduous 
journey for many people who had tried to get the screen version 
made 
we couldnt get anyone interested not even a network we 
would have settled for getting a television presentation done we 
were told nothing really happens no car chases no violence no 
sex nothing to attract a modern audience we believed there was 
an audience for a show that came from the heart a show about human 
relationships 
filmdallas agreed to sponsor da and matt clark directed it 
on locations in ireland 
production companies can sometimes seem like ego trips for 
actors that doesnt appear to be the case with sheen while he has 
been praised for his solid competence reviewers have lavished 
praise on penn in judgment at berlin and on hughes in da 
that doesnt bother sheen 
i always want to work with the very best talents available 
he said i couldnt be happier than to have had the opportunity 
to work with these two extraordinary actors i say that as a fellow 
actor but also as a producer 
martin sheen was born ramon estevez 47 years ago in dayton 
ohio one of 10 children of a spanish father and irish mother he 
left dayton after high school to study acting in new york and he 
changed his name to martin sheen the play and movie of the 
subject was roses brought him to prominence and he has been 
working ever since always at others bidding until now 
symphony pictures has a heavy schedule ahead including out of 
control with al pacino illusions based on the richard and 
leslie bach book plus a number of tv projects several have social 
implications expectably from political activist sheen 
what about hiring his own clan which includes actors charlie 
sheen and emilio estevez 
in fact charlie was supposed to play a younger version of me 
in da said sheen but our production was delayed and 
charlie had to take another project then we tried emilio 10 days 
before shooting in dublin but it was too short a time and he 
couldnt make it so we went with a young irish actor and made a 
discovery with karl hayden 
im getting ready to direct my first film and charlie is the 
star and i know very well that the major reason im allowed to 
direct it is because of charlie the three of us as well as my 
son ramon and daughter renee have worked together on a lot of 
projects and im sure well do more down the road

in 1983 in handels rinaldo it was a decade after she had made 
her met debut 
most of the things ive been involved in ive had a really 
good time she said in an interview i like to work with good 
people i like to be creative and work off other people doing 
opera is my favorite thing because i have a lot of company 
i love the recital repertory its the most lonely of the work 
i do on last falls recital tour i took my son peter with me he 
took a semester off from marlboro college in vermont we had such a 
ball 
miss valente who a native of delano calif was shy as a child 
i can remember dressing up the cats in dolls clothes she 
said i much preferred to play with animals i decided to be a 
singer when i was about 3 we had a huge radio id switch the 
dials i figured out saturday afternoon was the met broadcast i 
was fascinated by that kind of sound and i could imitate it my 
father had caruso records i knew the tenor arias when i got to the 
curtis institute of music then i had to learn my own repertory 
music drew me out of myself she said i couldnt sing in 
front of my family i could sing in the next room i found my 
outlet was being expressive on the stage 
her high school music teacher chester hayden taught her stage 
deportment and how to dress and groom herself he sent her to 
audition for coaching by lotte lehmann and for curtis 
curtis had seven openings and i got in the only advice he 
gave me i didnt take was to marry for money she said ive 
got a bassoonist husband who thinks hes a manager 
miss valente met her husband anthony checchia at curtis 
theyve been married for 28 years 
tony was contracting for orchestras all my instrumentalist 
friends knew him a cellist had been saying for months we should 
meet i was always very shy about matchmaking i would have nothing 
to do with it we met by chance it crossed my mind wouldnt it 
be strange if i marry this man i never thought that about another 
person 
hes first generation italian im first generation italian 
father and swiss mother so many of my family look spanish i 
always have the feeling somebody wandered over from spain 
rinaldo at the metropolitan opera was a gift from the 
canadian government for the bicentennial the production was put 
together and performed first in ottawa 
marilyn horne went to bat for bass sam ramey and me 
although i had been singing at the met already miss valente said 
we sold out every night and people were clamoring to get in 
the met never repeated it we always had the feeling they felt like 
rinaldo was pushed down their throats they acted like we didnt 
exist marilyn included 
the best of the ecstatic reviews were for ramey and miss 
valente did it make a difference in her career it wasnt a 
steppingstone to getting any further at the met it could have 
been a detriment ive been back to do idomeneo 
im virtually unknown in italy i spent 25 years becoming an 
american singer she said the met rinaldo did lead to 
singing in rinaldo in a tour of northern houses in italy i sang 
in handels samson in florence and conductor riccardo mutis 
wife heard me and told him how good i was i work with him now and 
he always says his wife heard me first 
i always do a lot of solo recitals orchestra dates and 
chamber music i sang at a tribute to lotte lehmann at the y in new 
york in february i usually sing with the handel society in 
washington i sang in handels ariodante with tatiana troyanos 
last summer at the santa fe opera this summer tatiana and i are 
going to start doing some duo concerts 
as for recordings she says if youre getting singing jobs 
you think theyll come but you have to set the time aside for 
them deliberately 
i never took the time before now i feel that i should be 
documented

the soviet armys defenses crumbled in the face of 
an onslaught of heavy metal music by the west german band scorpions 
not only did security forces relax restrictions so fans could 
stand in front of the stage but the red army joined in the 
applause at the leningrad concerts billed as the first by a major 
hard rock band in the soviet union 
every face was saying oh its so great lead singer 
klaus meine said even the soldiers they threw their caps onto 
the stage 
meine who was recently in miami with the rest of the scorpions 
for a concert to launch their us tour smiled as he recalled the 
bands 10 shows in leningrad in late april he said soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs new policies of glasnost that permit a more 
open society made the shows possible 
musicians there told us this wouldnt have happened one year 
ago meine said but now you have the feeling that you can talk 
to everybody about everything 
the concerts at the lenin sports concert complex confirmed the 
worldwide popularity of the scorpions who have played in such 
distant locales as brazil and thailand every show drew a sellout 
crowd of 15000 
we thought they were crazy to hold 10 shows in one place 
bassist francis buchholz said i thought by the last show we 
would have three people but people flew in from everywhere from 
siberia to moscow 
pop music artists such as billy joel have performed in the 
soviet union but until recently heavy metal was an underground 
genre 
we went into a record store and tried to get some rock music 
and they didnt know what it was buchholz said 
he said the scorpions whose five members grew up within 100 
miles of the berlin wall initially had soviet authorities nervous 
but the wellmannered band which relies on catchy melodies rather 
than bluster to sell records wasnt interested in inciting a 
rebellion 
our music is not that aggressive buchholz said our 
audience doesnt carry chains and knives and stab each other the 
audience is like the music we have its positive 
drugs are out anyway now sex is questionable so we try to 
put some messages into our music 
for the leningrad concerts meine and guitarist rudolf schenker 
composed a new song called living for tomorrow which is about 
taking a chance to improve things meine who sings in english 
introduced the tune at each show by reading the lyrics in russian 
evil power wont kill the human race 
if we give life a human face 
buchholz said the audience loved it 
the scorpions whose new album savage amusement is in the 
top 10 in the united states are now part of the fiveband 25city 
monsters of rock tour headlined by van halen the bands performed 
at the orange bowl on june 4 
we have no problem playing under van halen we respect each 
other its a great band meine said at the end of the day we 
blow each other off the stage with a smile its a great way to 
come back to america 
the groups last studio lp love at first sting sold more 
than 4 million copies worldwide the 1985 double lp worldwide 
live was also a big seller the scorpions have had one 
doubleplatinum two platinum and two gold albums in the united 
states and no other continental european band has approached that 
level of sales albums are deemed gold when theyve sold 500000 
copies including cassettes and compact discs platinum means 1 
million copies have been sold 
composers meine and schenker met in hanover germany while 
practicing with separate bands and formed the scorpions in 1972 
when they first appeared in a hanover band contest they were 
disqualified for being too loud 
buchholz joined in 1973 drummer herman rarebell in 1977 and 
guitarist matthias jabs in 1979 
the theme of physical sexuality has dominated the scorpions 
album titles and cover art their dense sound is built around 
meines soaring voice and schenkers piercing guitar lines

their names were michael schwerner andrew 
goodman and james chaney 
they died at the hands of the ku klux klan in a rural section of 
mississippi 24 years ago their bodies bulldozed beneath a dam 
the names may no longer bring instant recognition or raise angry 
hackles but the deaths of schwerner goodman and chaney two 
whites from new york and a black from meridian miss affect 
american policies today the authors of a new book on the civil 
rights movement say 
this was a slaying with profound political implications this 
wasnt a psychopath running amok although several psychopaths were 
involved said seth cagin coauthor of we are not afraid 
the macmillan co 2250 a history of the civil rights movement 
which hinges on the neshoba county slayings 
we were interested in this because it changed america cagin 
continued you could draw a line and i dont think you would be 
too far off from the early civil rights movement through the 
killings of schwerner goodman and chaney through voting rights for 
blacks through martin luther king to the campaign of jesse jackson 
today 
the book is the result of 3 years of interviews freedom of 
information requests and vast research into the mississippi summer 
project which sent more than 1000 northern whites into the south 
to fight for civil rights 
we wanted to do a story about young people and the last time 
young americans were willing to risk their lives for something they 
believed in was the civil rights movement said cagin its 
difficult to think of any cause today that people would risk their 
lives for 
or give their lives for 
the three men were shot to death on june 21 1964 their bodies 
were found 44 days later following an intense federal probe which 
drew national attention to the civil rights battle 
when schwerner and goodman left new york for mississippi they 
were well aware of such risks another factor which made the story 
intriguing to cagin and coauthor philip dray who were barely in 
their teens at the time 
that idea what made them do it is really the germ of our 
book said cagin it was incredible to us what would make 
people travel down there knowing what was going to happen i mean 
if we had the opportunity would we get on a greyhound bus and go 
down to get our heads busted 
in the course of their research cagin and dray encountered many 
veterans of the civil rights battles as well as the families of 
all three victims 
a lot of the movement veterans are like war veterans theres 
a certain patina about them some are chain smokers some are 
heavy drinkers that makes them stand out dray said 
some of them suffer like war veterans agreed cagin like 
vietnam veterans no one remembers what they did their sacrifices 
are unrecognized and they feel unfulfilled their work unfinished 
but the people who think they failed really succeeded 
the families carried the scars as well they said 
in all three families it was like this had occurred last 
week the pain was very fresh cagin said 
when he met with john chaneys mother dray learned firsthand 
how fresh the pain remains 
i was interviewing mrs chaney and she started saying she 
didnt know if that was her son she wasnt sure because she had 
never seen him after the bodies were found dray recalled 
she broke down crying i had always accepted his death as 
historical fact and here she was saying maybe he isnt dead 
while the book which was edited by edward t chase father of 
comedian chevy chase details the civil rights movement from its 
earliest days through 1964 it does not pretend to be a balanced 
account of the time the authors say 
none of those involved in the slayings were interviewed none of 
them was ever tried or convicted of murder in the case though 
seven were convicted on federal civil rights charges 
we dont mind being onesided in this case whats the other 
side asked cagin that its all right to go around killing 
blacks its ok to murder civil rights workers

al dean who made cottoneyed joe 
one of the most popular country tunes ever looks like a character 
out of the cowpokes comic strip and is happiest mending ences 
and corralling cattle 
but though dean would rather be out on the range his music 
always brings him to the bandstand one more time 
the 57yearold musician has gained regional popularity but has 
not fared as well financially as some of the other country 
entertainers including superstar george strait who once requested 
to sing with deans band but was rejected 
deans band still plays the song that continues to bring in the 
bucks but not much publicity 
to this day we play the cottoneyed joe twice a night and 
sometimes three times a night he said if youre a 
countrywestern band and if you come to texas youd better know 
how to play the cottoneyed joe 
there are several versions of the cottoneyed joe but ours 
is a magic mix and i dont think it can be duplicated 
cottoneyed joe a mixture of fiddle guitar and drum 
rhythm has been around as long as people can remember 
it has been played in jukeboxes at roadside cafes and in 
honkytonks from texas to montana it gained even more popularity 
after it was featured in the movie urban cowboy 
the song is closely associated with a dance in which several 
twosteppers with their arms around each others waists and 
shoulders move counter clockwise taking several steps forward and 
a few backward as they kick up their heels 
the rhythm intensifies and the pros are quickly separated from 
the amateurs 
the song is known throughout the country and is synonymous with 
texas but dean admits few people know the artists name 
there were times when people would try to impersonate me to 
make some money he said people didnt know my face so it was 
hard to convince them that i was the real al dean 
the song dean says gained popularity in mexico because it was 
released as a single with one of his other recordings jalisco 
last year the texas juke box dealers presented dean with its 
first classic music award for the mostplayed jukebox record in 
texas 
bud daily secretarytreasurer of the daily inc record 
distributing company has distributed deans cottoneyed joe 
recording for almost a decade and is surprised by its continued 
success 
there must be several hundred versions of cottoneyed joe 
that have been recorded down through the years but al deans has 
just outlasted them daily said 
i dont know what it is but there is a certain chemistry that 
comes together the beat the sincerity with which the music is 
played the sincerity with which a singer projects and the 
sincerity that comes together that makes the record 
als got the perfect beat for the dance the dancers like it 
and it just works 
deans road to success started in rattlesnakeinfested freer 
texas a community midway between corpus christi and laredo 
in 1952 at age 22 he became the lead singer of the texas 
teenagers a group of mostly high school kids who played in south 
texas when they split up about two years later dean recorded a 
few songs on his own in san antonio but with little success 
then in 1967 he scraped up several thousand dollars traveled 
to nashville and recorded his first album texas to nashville 
which had cottoneyed joe on it 
the album was on deans independent kikr label and he had 
to work to get disc jockeys to play it 
he was rejected but later released cottoneyed joe and 
jalisco as a single soon after a san antonio radio station 
began playing the country tune and requests came in for more 
records 
dean recalls a certain day on the road with his band 
i remember we were at the dilley rodeo one day and some kid 
comes up to the bandstand and says that he would like to sing a 
song with us dean recalled i told him flat out no we dont 
let people from the floor sing with the group it turned out to be 
a young george strait 
dean said he still doesnt regret that decision even though 
strait has gone on to garner numerous country music awards 
dean likes his music but admits he would be fine without it 
im just a cowboy at heart he says give me a pair of 
posthole diggers some barb wire a poor old horse and an old cow 
to look after and im happy

weeks with appetite or sleep disturbance feelings of worthlessness 
or guilt or thoughts of death is hitting earlier in baby boomers 
than the preceding generation 
female baby boomers for example have a 65 percent greater 
chance than normal of being depressed some time in their lives and 
the suicide rate among 15 to 24yearolds in 1980 was nearly three 
times that of the group in 1950 
depression has changed from a disease of people in their 40s 
50s and older to a disease of people in their 20s and 30s said 
robert hirschfeld of the national institute of mental health 
nobody really knows why but hirschfeld and psychiatry professor 
gerald klerman of new york hospitalcornell medical center 
suspect major changes in the social environment that occurred since 
world war ii and the stress of high expectations clashing with 
economic reality 
baby boomers are not formally defined but klerman applies the 
term to the 762 million babies born from 1947 to 1965 now ranging 
from about 23 to 41 years old they make up about a third of the 
united states population 
births during the 16year boom were 50 percent higher than the 
previous 16 years and 16 percent above the following 16 years 
klerman believes the size of the generation contributed to 
higher depression rates citing a theory by economist richard 
easterlin of the university of southern california who says that 
because of supply and demand a large age group will face lower 
wages higher unemployment and less upward mobility on the job than 
smaller age groups 
babyboomers entered that situation with high material 
expectations because they grew up in relatively prosperous times 
despite the economic burden of the big generation easterlin said 
they still aspire to material wealth by staying single or forming 
families with working mothers and few if any children 
and the result is a lot of psychological stress easterlin 
said 
but sociologist allan horwitz of rutgers university said 
babyboomers grew up in a very psychological climate where they 
are more attuned to looking within themselves and may be more 
prone to react to difficulties by become depressed those born 
earlier may have just gotten physically sick

tigard ore the mysterious ailment has been dubbed 
hollywood blahs and yuppie disease but to the thousands of 
people debilitated by its long list of symptoms chronic fatigue 
syndrome is no joking matter 
would you make fun of ms lupus or other disorders with 
similar hardships for patients wrote gidget faubionjones 
president of the chronic fatigue syndrome society in a letter 
complaining about a newspaper cartoon that poked fun at sufferers 
and implied the ailment is psychosomatic 
many of these people are wheelchair bound have lost jobs 
savings relationships houses and a normal lifestyle she wrote 
until recently many doctors believed the ailment was fictional 
in a march report in the annals of internal medicine 16 
researchers gave it credibility by naming and defining it the 
definition largely involves ruling out other illnesses though and 
little is known about the syndrome 
its symptoms can include exhaustion disorientation sore 
throat depression fever swollen lymph nodes headaches and 
insomnia 
the society which now has 12000 members was founded in this 
portland suburb three years ago as a support group for local 
sufferers of the illness then called chronic epsteinbarr virus 
syndrome it now is an international clearinghouse of information 
sends out a newsletter maintains what it says is the largest 
library of information about the illness organizes conferences and 
distributes information to the public 
were recognizing it chronic fatigue syndrome as a clinical 
entity to be investigated and looked at says dr john stewart of 
the cdc the epsteinbarr virus initially was thought to cause it 
but investigation dispelled that theory the cdcs next step is a 
30person study in the atlanta area

simple hydrogen could replace ozonebusting 
refrigerants in vehicle air conditioners one of the leading 
sources of chlorofluorocarbons chemicals damaging earths 
protective radiation shield a researcher says 
but the refrigerant industry believes it will find an antidote 
to the ozone problem without forcing society to adopt radically 
different technology like that being developed by edward wallace of 
carnegie mellon university 
were hearing a lot about new inventions coming down the 
pike says kevin fay of the alliance for responsible cfc policy 
were not saying there arent technological solutions out there 
to be found but the extent to which theyre commercially viable 
and can be manufactured in millions of units is another question 
the estimated 146000 metric tons of usproduced r12 the 
type of refrigerant used in vehicle air conditioners accounted for 
45 percent of the nations output of cfcs fay says its the 
single largest source of emission of r12 in the country today 
wallaces air conditioner cools as hydrogen passes between two 
beds of material that absorb it at different rates one beds 
attraction to hydrogen is strong enough to pull it from the other 
bed duplicating the chilling effect of a liquid evaporating the 
stronger bed when heated gives up the hydrogen to the weaker bed 
and the cycle is repeated as needed 
hydrogens flammability is no problem wallace says because 
only 2 percent of the hydrogen in his design is ever in its gaseous 
state the rest is locked in chemical compounds in the beds which 
are alloys of iron nickel and rare earth elements including 
lanthanum 
similar devices are under development in israel scandanavia and 
europe where the most rudimentary designs are about as efficient 
as conventional air conditioners wallace says he wont know how 
efficient his is until the components are assembled and tested

when two soviet spacecraft take off for mars and 
one of its moons in a couple weeks soil analyzers designed by two 
chicago scientists will be aboard even though the united states 
isnt taking part in the project 
the devices in 6inch goldplated boxes are similar to those 
anthony l turkevich and thanasis economou developed in the 1960s 
for three us surveyor missions that did the first chemical 
analysis of the lunar surface 
the soviet probes will take off july 7 and july 12 for the 
sevenmonth 110millionmile trip to mars and phobos one will 
orbit the planet the other will drop a lander to analyze for the 
first time the small asteroidlike moon 
astronomers speculate phobos may have been an asteroid captured 
by mars gravity the analyzer beams subatomic alpha particles 
into the soil and the rate and speed at which they bounce off 
nuclei of atoms in the soil identifies its elements high carbon 
levels would indicate phobos probably is a captured asteroid 
containing traces of material left largely undisturbed since the 
beginning of the solar system turkevich said 
soviet scientists asked turkevich two years ago to build an 
analyzer but he couldnt get us funding because of strained 
superpower relations instead he and economou a physicist worked 
with west germans 
the craft will include instruments from eight countries and the 
european space agency the phobos probe will carry a plaque 
commemorating the martian moons discovery in 1877 by american 
astronomer asaph hall

high cholesterol often goes undetected in 
children because doctors dont check family histories for early 
heart attacks and some pediatric cardiologists recommend 
cholesterol tests for all 5yearolds 
were really beginning to appreciate now this an inheritable 
thing that gets passed on through the family according to 
geisinger medical center head of pediatric cardiology dr john g 
spangler he said that doctors previoulsy believed diet and 
lifestyle were the most important factors 
between 1 percent and 2 percent of all children have inherited 
high cholesterol said dr jean a cortner director of the 
lipidheart research center at childrens hospital of philadelphia 
normal cholesterol for children measures about 150 miligrams per 
100 cubic centimeters of blood children with inherited cholesterol 
problems can have levels as high as 1000 spangler said 
cholesterol sticks to the lining of arteries making it more 
difficult for blood to flow to the heart high cholesterol can 
cause heart attacks in men as young as their 20s and women as young 
as their 30s 
cholesterol levels often are associated with weight because one 
source is fatty foods but children with inherited high cholesterol 
can be thin and appear healthy spangler said in most cases high 
cholesterol can be controlled with diet exercise and medication 
he said

syrup of ipecac can be used to induce vomiting in 
small children who swallow some poisons but two physicians found 
that only a quarter of parents surveyed keep it and less than 10 
percent of doctors dispense it 
those findings were reported in the june edition of the american 
journal of diseases of children by dr michael h malloy and dr 
george c rhoads of the national institute of child health and 
human development in bethesda md 
pediatricians could increase home supplies by regularly

doctors they interviewed in the washington dc area did so 
dr h juhling mcclung of childrens hospital in columbus ohio

a us company that lofted a satellite into 
space last week on the ariane rocket is promising superior prices 
and services in its attempt to unlock the 25year international 
satellite telecommunications monopoly held by the global consortium 
intelsat 
pan american satellite based in greenwich conn is aiming its 
services at businesses government agencies and tv broadcasters in 
the united states canada the caribbean latin america and europe 
now dominated by intelsat 
pan american believes it not only can lure customers from 
intelsat but also can expand the telecommunications market and 
bring in new customers by driving prices lower industrywide 
intelsat has already responded prices for international 
services have come down not only on big routes but also on 
services into developing countries said doug goldschmidt 
director of data services for pan american satellite 
youre also going to start seeing prices for 
telecommunications services come down within these countries 
because the national telephone companies are going to be under 
pressure to bring prices down and a lot of new data services are 
going to be brought in a lot faster he said in a recent 
interview 
the effects will be greater in latin america than anywhere else 
goldschmidt said because the area now has few data services and 
little competition for domestic telecommunications but the company 
also is actively pursuing the highdensity traffic in the north 
atlantic intelsats biggest market 
since the international telecommunications satellite 
organization was founded in 1963 it has been the only satellite 
system carrying international telephone and video traffic and the 
only network providing domestic communications in some countries 
it now has 115 member countries 
a 1984 determination by the reagan administration extended its 
marketplace philosophy to international communications and paved 
the way for limited competition for intelsat from private 
international satellite systems 
some intelsat member countries resisted the move to a 
competitive system fearful it would weaken intelsat irreparably 
unlike intelsat which serves all countries regardless of how poor 
new private systems would be able to enter only the most profitable 
markets this could hurt intelsat financially and jeopardize its 
services to developing countries many of which depend on the 
consortium for domestic communications some feared 
but the view of the us government intelsats largest member 
prevailed and the consortium agreed to allow privatelyowned 
satellite systems to compete on a limited basis such systems are 
not allowed to connect to public telephone networks interfere with 
intelsats transmissions or hurt the consortium financially 
pan american satellite is the first to emerge to take on the 
global intelsat monopoly on these terms but the company says the 
consortium is trying to block its efforts to compete 
we see the markets opening up slowly but they have made life 
harder for us than was necessary goldschmidt said 
he said intelsat recently cut some prices drastically in an 
apparent effort to undercut services pan american satellite was 
marketing in latin america and he said the consortium vigorously 
is lobbying foreign governments not to deal with the company 
they are using business practices that under most conventional 
terms are unethical he said 
intelsat denies it is trying to block pan american satellite and 
says its price decreases are not extraordinary 
our prices have continued to go down and thats unrelated to 
pan american satellite that has been part of a continuous trend 
for regular rate decreases said walda roseman senior adviser 
for strategic planning at intelsat 
she said the consortium had lowered its percircuit rates 14 
times in its quartercentury history rates are now 1 percent of t 
they were when the consortium began operating she said 
that has resulted through a deliberate effort to take full 
advantage of global economies and technological advances and both 
of those factors were involved in the last rate decrease she 
said 
goldschmidt said pan american satellite has been received well 
by the private sector and by government agencies but not by 
telephone companies that are owned by most governments that are 
intelsat members 
despite us government pressure on foreign governments to allow 
pan american satellite to provide service many countries are 
resisting 
pan american satellite has signed agreements for television 
services in argentina and chile and data services with the 
scandinavian countries chile ecuador and venezuela in western 
europe only great britain and west germany have agreed to let the 
company set up communications links for customers there

americans preached the virtues of private 
enterprise while chinese businessmen hawked their wares in the 
corridors of the great hall of the people on monday opening day of 
the largest uschina trade conference ever held 
nearly 1000 americans many from small businesses and an equal 
number of chinese gathered in the main hall of chinas political 
center for the first session of the fourday uschina joint 
session on industry trade and economic development 
president reagan in a message delivered by ambassador winston 
lord praised chinas challenging and exciting program of 
economic reform and modernization and said the size of the 
conference attests to our shared interest in and commitment to 
the uschinese commercial relationship 
reagan noted that bilateral trade reached 104 billion last 
year and was up 19 percent in the first quarter of this year while 
us businessmen had invested 3 billion in china more than any 
other country except hong kong 
the conference is being held as china aggressively seeks more 
foreign capital to establish exportoriented industries 
particularly in its coastal areas 
the americans representing some 600 companies were welcomed to 
the great hall by a chinese childrens drumandcymbal corps 
on the first and second floors of the main foyer about 100 
chinese corporations set up booths to provide information about 
their businesses and make contacts with potential partners 
vice premier tian jiyun in a keynote address stressed that 
chinas nineyear policy of marketoriented reforms is permanent 
it will never change he noted that china has become active in 
encouraging foreign participation and joint venture cooperation 
speakers also aired trade disputes between the two countries 
and edwin dodd former chairman of the us chamber of commerce

southland corp has agreed to pay 
nearly 10 million to settle charges that a former division 
conspired with other producers to fix prices of milk sold to 
florida public schools attorney general bob butterworth said today 
butterworth said past and present officials of velda farms dairy 
of miami formerly owned by the dallasbased southland have 
acknowledged that the firm participated in price fixing 
tom hillstrom a spokesman for butterworth said the settlement 
did not address the possibility of criminal charges against velda 
officials that issue he said will be dealt with on an 
individual basis depending on the amount of cooperation extended to 
the state 
southland which must continue to help butterworth litigate 
cases against six other milk producers as part of the settlement 
sold velda dairy in april to morning star inc of dallas morning 
star is not mentioned in the civil action 
butterworth said southlands top management was unaware of the 
bid rigging and he said it was the action of a few velda farms 
officials 
southlands executives have expressed their regret that this 
activity occurred said butterworth they have acted very 
responsibly since the charges were brought to their attention and 
have taken steps to make amends to the victimized school boards 
butterworth filed a federal antitrust lawsuit in february in 
miami against the milk companies charging them with unlawfully 
allocating contracts among themselves over 10 years for supplying 
milk to at least 32 of the states 67 school districts

the supreme court today let new york city bar 
discrimination against women and minorities by private clubs with 
more than 400 members giving cities and states new ammunition in a 
growing legal assault on such practices 
by a unanimous vote the justices ruled that the new york city 
law is constitutional at least as it is written 
the law banning discrimination by public accommodations exempts 
distinctly private organizations but it deprives nonreligious 
groups of that exempt designation if they have more than 400 
members provide regular meal service and regularly get their 
members dues paid by nonmembers such as the members employers 
at least six other major cities buffalo chicago detroit los 
angeles san francisco and washington have enacted similar 
ordinances recently 
the new york state clubs association comprised of 125 private 
clubs and associations challenged the new york city law soon after 
it was enacted in 1984 
the city had initiated proceedings against four menonly clubs 
the 10003member new york athletic club the 4329member 
university club the 1900member century association and the 
1600member union league club 
lawyers for the clubs association argued that the law wrongly 
creates an irrebutable presumption that such organizations are not 
truly private if they have more than 400 members and meet the other 
criteria 
the laws attackers said it does not give individual clubs an 
opportunity to prove they should not be treated as a public 
accommodation 
writing for the court today justice byron r white noted that 
any individual club wanting to challenge the new york city law as 
applied to it is free to do so 
but white said the law can be applied in a way that does not 
violate the constitutionally protected freedom of association 
in previous decisions the supreme court has ruled that states 
may force the us jaycees and rotary international to admit women 
as members 
in ruling unanimously in the rotary case two years ago the 
justices suggested that numerous other maleonly or femaleonly 
private organizations may have to comply with state laws requiring 
equal access to public accommodations 
the challenge of new york citys law was supported in a 
friendofthecourt brief submitted in behalf of among others 
the benevolent and protective order of elks the loyal order of 
moose the improved order of red men and kiwanis international 
kiwanis international last july voted to end its menony 
tradition and allow its 8200 clubs worldwide to admit women 
the law was defended by among others the us conference of 
mayors the council of state governments the national association 
of counties the national league of cities the american civil 
liberties union and the american bar association 
in todays decision white acknowledged that a considerable 
amount of private or intimate association might occur in new york 
citys private clubs 
however he said the same is true in many restauarants and 
other places of public accommodation but that fact alone does not 
afford the entity as a whole any constitutional immunity to 
practice discrimination when the government has barred it from 
doing so 
white said some clubs may be able to prove they were organized 
for specific expressive purposes they will not be able to 
pursue if they cannot confine membership to those who share 
the same sex for example or the same religion 
but he added it seems sensible enough to believe that many of 
the large clubs covered by the new york city law are not of this 
kind 
two justices who joined in the opinion anthony m kennedy and 
harry a blackmun once belonged to maleonly clubs 
kennedy the courts newest justice was criticized during his 
senate confirmation hearings last year for his past membership in 
exclusive private clubs 
kennedy quit san franciscos menonly allwhite olympic club 
after he was mentioned as a possible supreme court nominee he had 
been a member since 1962 he quite the menonly sutter club in his 
hometown of sacramento calif eight years ago 
blackmun recently quit the cosmos club in washington dc 
where he had held a longtime membership the club for 110 years has 
barred women from becoming members a policy it voted saturday to 
abandon 
the clubs case is new york state club association vs new york

seiko epson corp said monday it plans to assemble 
personal computers in britain in an attempt to phase out its 
exports to europe from japan 
the company is expected to use its existing facilities in 
telford england for production of an ibmcompatible personal 
computer that it began exporting to europe in 1985 the company has 
been manufacturing printers at the plant since last year 
a seiko epson official said the companys latest move is part of 
its recent corporate strategy to make its operations less 
vulnerable to wide currency fluctuations and other sudden changes 
in international economic conditions 
he said the possibility of an antidumping suit by the european 
community against japanmade personal computers also was considered 
when making the decision but the official said it was only one 
of the many factors 
seiko epson said it plans to produce the personal computer the 
pcax2 series at a pace of 2000 units a month for the time being 
but a further expansion will be considered depending on market 
conditions the official said

the manager of moscows first cooperative 
restaurant said monday a new law governing the businesses could 
cause many to fold rather than promote their growth 
andrei fyodorov said the law which goes into effect july 1 
contains unreasonable measures and could make the cooperative 
movement null and void 
fyodorov who opened his cafe kropotkinskya no 36 in march 
1987 was one of several panelists at a briefing for journalists on 
the new law 
the soviet parliament approved the law last month after soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev made clear he is depending on 
development of cooperatives to provide consumer goods and services 
the inefficient staterun economy cannot 
but fyodorov and another spokesman for cooperatives appeared 
skeptical that the law will stimulate the businesses the provision 
most often attacked by cooperative managers sets a personal income 
tax of 27 percent on a monthly income of 1000 rubles about 
1600 and 535 percent on an income of 2000 rubles about 
3200 the tax rate eventually reaches 90 percent 
we view this as a blow against the cooperative movement 
said vladimir sorokin a cooperative spokesman who works for the 
newspaper literaturnaya gazeta it is very good theoretically 
but in practice it is bad 
sorokin said the purpose of the cooperative is to increase 
production but taxation at the rate proposed will thwart ingenuity 
now we see they want to tax industrial attitude or the 
ability to organize our efforts and work more than eight hours a 
day if we develop our production in two or three years but have 
taxes why should we do so he asked 
soviet officials have made it clear the tax structure probably 
will be reworked sparking debate on how it should be changed 
the disagreement is over whether to limit taxes at the central 
government whether to apply a uniform tax on cooperatives or 
whether to permit local authorities to set tax rates according to 
local conditions 
the soviet union has an estimated 20000 cooperatives employing 
300000 people they offer a range of services and products from 
restaurants to agricultural goods 
yuri m lujkov of the moscow city soviet of peoples deputies 
said the draft law would expand rather than limit the cooperative 
movement 
at the end of last year we had 800 cooperatives in moscow 
less than six months have passed and we have more than 2000 the 
process is gaining momentum especially with the adoption of the 
draft law on cooperatives 
lujkov said the main problems facing cooperatives are finding 
staff and buildings 
the law guarantees that cooperatives cannot be run out of 
business by the state it allows them to conduct business with 
foreign companies and receive hard currency as payment gives them 
the right to own buildings and other property and allows them to 
appeal decisions by authorities not to license a cooperative

the us navy could be forced to provide 
worldwide protection for merchant ships flying the worlds newest 
flagofconvenience which is being established by the marshall 
islands with us tax dollars 
the pacific republic is challenging the lucrative ship 
registeries operated by countries such as panama and liberia with a 
fledgling registry that is a direct outgrowth of the 1986 compact 
under which the marshalls attained independence with close ties to 
the united states 
the marshalls registry like those of other third world 
countries offers shipowners the advantages of less stringent 
inspection and operating rules and lower costs than nations 
like the united states and japan 
chief negotiator of the marshall islands compact was fred monroe 
zeder ii a close friend of vice president george bush a bush 
campaign fundraiser and frequently reported to be in line for a top 
job in a bush administration 
zeders son howard blood zeder is wearing two hats in the 
marshalls registry heading it as the republics maritime 
commissioner and serving as an officer and partowner of the 
private company that is operating the registry 
neither howard zeder nor peter watson a washington lawyer who 
speaks for the marshalls about the registry will disclose the 
arrangements financial details or even how much zeder is being 
paid as maritime commissioner 
the arrangement would have been an illegal conflict of interest 
had former rep john seiberling dohio rep don young ralaska 
and former interior department official rick montoya had their way 
they tried unsuccessfully to include a provision barring such 
arrangements but the reagan administration with fred zeder as 
its point man managed to scuttle the proposal in the house 
interior committee 
for a small nation a ship registry is big business akin to a 
motor vehicle registry keeping computerized records shuffling 
papers and having relatively low operating costs 
there are about 360 million tons of registered commercial 
shipping in the world much of it flying the flags of third world 
nations 
the going rate to register a ship initially is about 1 a ton 
with an annual reregistration for about 40 cents a ton capturing 
10 percent of the business means about 36 million in initial fees 
and 144 million in renewal fees 
the marshall islands a former us trust territory with an 
annual budget of 76 million is stressing its political stability 
and the compact with the united states in efforts to break into the 
ship registry business 
the 15year compact requires the united states to defend the 
marshall islands and their peoples from attack or threats 
thereof as the united states and its citizens are defended 
watson says that in trying to get ship owners to switch to a 
marshalls flag the republic is making no representations to 
anyone it would be entitled to us defense rights 
however he said it is providing copies of the compact to 
shipowners allowing them to make their own interpretation 
howard hills a state department lawyer who helped fred zeder 
steer the compact through congress says that marshall islands 
vessels fall within the class of vessels which like us vessels 
are entitled to us protection we seek to protect us 
vessels everywhere in the world 
hills said however that an attack on a marshalls ship would 
not automatically bring a us response this is a strategic 
military policy decision he said 
the marshalls registry is being set up under a 12 million line 
of credit from the marshall island development authority the money 
is part of 6 million the united states has provided for economic 
development 
watson declined to reveal the terms of the development 
authoritys lending to the maritime authority which is operating 
out of honolulu the home base of the zeders because the 
marshall islands lack 24hour communications facilities 
watson and howard zeder also declined to reveal the exact 
financial arrangements between the maritime authority headed by 
howard zeder and maritime registry management inc mrm the 
private company that is operating the registry 
coca cola doesnt give its formula away said watson when 
asked whether mrm is being paid a consultant fee or would share in 
profits made by the registry he said that substantially all the 
profits go to the marshall islands government 
howard zeder said he is president and board chairman of mrm and 
has an ownership interest which he declined to disclose im 
sort of speaking with two hats he said of his dual role he said 
his father has no stock or operational role 
when the compact was pending before congress the house interior 
subcommittee on public lands approved tough conflictofinterest 
rules for the implementing legislation 
the rules would have prohibited any us official who 
participated in compact negotiations and implementation and their 
immediate families from benefiting even indirectly from us 
dollars flowing to the marshalls under the compact 
the prohibition was opposed by the administration and was 
dropped before the legislation went before the full interior 
committee the administrations point man was fred zeder who was 
president reagans personal representative to the pacific trust 
territories like the marshalls 
seiberling who headed the subcommittee before his retirement in 
1987 said the language was aimed squarely at fred zeder 
fred zeder was a wheeler and dealer and had interests in the 
pacific seiberling said we wanted to make sure he and the 
people around him didnt profit from us monies 
montoya a republican who formerly headed the interior 
department office supervising the trust territories said he too 
favored the prohibition 
i was specifically concerned with fred zeder he said 
the conflictofinterest language was offered in subcommittee by 
young the ranking republican on the interior committee he said 
a lot of those who were working on the compact could have had a 
conflict 
fred zeder however said seiberling went out of his way and 
misused his position as a congressman seiberling has never had 
any idea about business i have never trusted him 
he said seiberling was angry because he once went to ohio to 
raise money for a republican challenger to the former 
representative and id do it again 
he said that although the subject of the ship registry was 
never mentioned when i was the presidents representative ive 
encouraged the idea its a wonderful thing it will give them 
stature around the world and a good income 
fred zeder said that while hes introduced his son howard to a 
lot of people out there in the pacific over the years he had 
nothing to do with establishing the registry 
he said the marshalls government will get the lions share 
of revenue from the registry with mrm getting a minor piece of 
the action

the united states and japan reached a trade 
agreement monday that could double us exports of beef and oranges 
to more than 1 billion a year us trade representative clayton 
yeutter said 
my judgment is that this will turn out to be a landmark 
agreement in usjapan economic relations yeutter said 
following marathon talks with japanese leaders 
the agreement calls on japan to nearly double its imports of 
beef by 1991 and phase out involvement by livestock industry 
promotion corp which currently controls most beef imports japan 
would be allowed to set tariffs of 70 percent in 1991 60 percent 
in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 to allow japanese farmers time to 
adjust 
japan agreed to expand market access for fresh oranges by 22000 
tons annually to 192000 tons in 1990 after that fresh oranges 
from the united states would be permitted in unlimited quantities 
at the current tariff rates of 40 percent in season and 20 percent 
off season quotas on orange juice will also be phased out 
the united states also demanded and got compensation on tariffs 
for other farm products in return for concessions on allowing japan 
to slowly phase out its tariffs included were liberalized 
restrictions on imports of grapefruit lemons frozen peaches and 
pears pistachios macadamias pecans walnuts pet food beef 
jerky sausage and pork and beans 
as part of the agreement the united states agreed to withdraw a 
complaint filed with the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the world body that oversees international trade the two sides 
agreed to further discuss japans emergency import curbs during the 
current round of talks under gatt 
the temporary agreement was signed by yeutter and takashi sato 
japans agriculture forestry and fisheries minister yeutter said 
the official documents would be signed in washington hopefully in 
the next few weeks after the united states gathers the documents 
it needs 
cabinet secretary minister keizo obuchi welcomed the agreement 
telling a regular news conference monday that it reconfirms that 
the united states and japan are able to solve their problems 
through joint efforts 
he said the agreement can be fully implemented without hurting 
japanese farmers 
yeutter said the agreement will require some creative and 
innovative thinking on the part of japanese officials in helping 
japanese farmers adjust however he said japanese consumers will 
benefit through an increased standard of living and cheaper prices 
while japans economy will benefit through increased competition 
he said the united states will be closely watching japan to make 
sure the agreement is put into effect 
a similar pact on computer chips came under attack last year 
after the united states accused japan of circumventing the spirit 
of the agreement by selling computer chips at unfairly low prices 
through third countries that battle is still being fought through 
gatt 
yeutter said that it would be unfortunate if government 
agencies were to attempt to circumvent the spirit of this 
agreement 
yeutter also said the united states has no plans at this time to 
expand its demands to include the liberalization of rice another 
thorny issue in japanus relations however he said he could not 
rule out that possibility in the future if the united states is 
provoked 
while agreeing to eliminate the beef import restrictions japan 
retained the right to raise the tariffs temporarily by 25 percent 
if beef imports exceed the previous years level by 20 percent 
after the transitional period ending in 1993 japans beef 
tariffs will be subject to discussions in the gatt 
sato the agriculture minister said the japanese government 
will soon begin negotiations with australia another major beef 
exporter on the japanese import restrictions 
associations of japanese orange growers and cattle farmers 
criticized the agreement 
as producers who had been closely following the course of 
negotiations we cant help but keenly feel regret and anger 
mitsugu horiuchi president of the central union of agricultural 
cooperatives said in a statement

the stock market weakened today in light 
trading with wall street brokers blaming the decline largely on 
fears of droughtspawned inflation and talk of higher interest 
rates 
anytime somebody mentions higher interest rates that spooks 
us said robert otoole manager of overthecounter trading at 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the slow trading volume suggested that large institutional 
investors refrained from participating in the market brokers said 
sharply higher commodity prices caused by fear of a prolonged 
midwest drought combined with a belief that credit conditions will 
tighten in coming months were key reasons 
all of that provides a classic backdrop for timeout said

the european economic community took another 
major step toward creating a single european market by deciding on 
monday to fully liberalize trucking by 1993 officials said 
trucking within the 12country bloc still works mostly under a 
system of licences allocated under quotas that are negotiated 
between individual countries 
only 10 percent of the eecs truck drivers have the right to 
move freely across borders currently the eec has 13477 licences 
outstanding but the number will be increased by 25 percent this 
year and 40 percent next year the eec transportation ministers 
decided 
the next steps toward complete liberalization have not yet been 
decided germany which chaired the meeting and holds the most 
truck licences insisted on the need to harmonize simultaneously 
road taxes and working conditions for truck drivers 
the present fragmented system costs time and money estimations 
of the cost of a fragmented european market including road 
transport range from 50 to 300 billion dollars a year 
the european commission which for years called for free road 
transport claimed the present system acts as a barrier to trade 
is used by some member states to reserve the bulk of their road 
exports to their own national hauliers and discriminates against 
smaller countries especially those on the periphery of the 
community 
the commission has figured that about one vehicle in three 
traveling among eec member states is traveling empty making the 
roads more crowded and wasting time and energy 
industry and commerce are paying more than they should to 
transport their goods and services to markets in other member 
countries the commission says these increased distribution 
costs are reflected in the price of goods to the consumer

international business machines corp unveiled a 
program monday that will allow people to trade in older ibm 
personal computers for credit on its new personal system2 
computers 
ibms announcement came the same day that houstonbased compaq 
computer corp its archrival in pcs announced a pair of personal 
computers using the speedy 80386 microprocessor from intel corp 
compaq said one of its models the deskpro 38625 will be the 
fastest personal computer available in the world but ibm responded 
that it will take the lead when its fastest model announced 
earlier this month becomes generally available in august or 
september 
ibms tradein program will begin july 1 and end aug 31 
although an extension is possible said bill lyons ibms general 
manager of personal system2 merchandising 
the tradein program is for the united states only and will 
apply to any member of the original line of pcs including the pc 
xt at pcjr and pc portable as long as it is in good working 
order it also includes monitors but not other peripherals 
ibm estimates 45 million of the old line of personal computers 
have been sold in the united states and about 6 million worldwide 
the company has shipped worldwide more than 2 million of the new 
ps2 line which was introduced in april 1987 
ibm said the tradeins are available only through authorized 
dealers who choose to participate the dealers will be free to 
decide how much to pay for returned personal computers but ibm 
will support the price by guaranteeing payments to dealers 
payments to dealers could range from 100 or less for an 
original pc or pcjr to 1000 for a recentvintage at lyons said 
dealers also will be reimbursed for handling and transportation 
costs 
the returned personal computers will be resold through dealers 
and brokers in used pcs ibm said 
lyons said he was not concerned that the tradein program would 
release a flood of older personal computers onto the market and 
depress demand for the new machines 
i think its a way to gain excitement over the summer and to 
get people to take a fresh look at our ps2s lyons said 
about half a million used ibm pcs are placed with new users 
annually either by transfer within organizations or through 
resale lyons said 
in addition to its topoftheline deskpro 38625 compaq 
announced a deskpro 386s that is much cheaper than other computers 
in its class because it uses a special new version of intels 80386 
microprocessor 
lyons said ibm is assessing the new intel chip but does not 
want to introduce a computer built around it until it is sure the 
chips will be available in sufficient volume

grain and soybean futures prices spurted sharply 
higher monday in another droughtdriven session on the chicago 
board of trade 
on other markets livestock and meat futures were mixed oil 
futures fell precious metals were lower and stockindex futures 
retreated 
in another signal of rising prices the commodity research 
bureaus index of 21 industrial and agricultural commodities rose 
293 points to a fouryearhigh of 26623 
except for wheat all grain and soybean futures on the chicago 
board of trade shot up their daily allowable limits at the opening 
bell and didnt budge all day 
whenever a futures contracts price moves its daily limit 
trading ceases in that contract the limitup opening left only 
wheat futures open for trading which in turn left most traders 
bored said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
i sat around and talked to people i didnt do very much he 
said 
wheat futures were influenced less by the drought than corn 
oats and soybeans because the winter wheat crop which accounts for 
75 percent of us production is nearly finished growing and is 
being harvested 
lespinasse said some private meteorologists had predicted light 
rain for some parts of illinois indiana and ohio on wednesday and 
thursday 
but thats not for certain of course and judging by the way 
the market reacted its going to stay hot and dry he said 
and as long as its hot and dry well keep going higher 
after the close the national weather service issued a 
sixto10day forecast predicting abovenormal temperatures and 
belownormal rainfall for the grain belt in the first five days of 
next week 
the nearmonth soybean contract for july delivery settled 
above 10 a bushel an 11year high soybeans reached an alltime 
high of 1290 a bushel in june 1973 
wheat futures are at their highest level in nearly seven years 
corn futures prices are at fouryear highs 
the board of trade said the daily limit on corn futures would

delivery in july at 401 a bushel corn was 15 cents higher 
across the board with july at 324 a bushel oats were 10 cents 
higher across the board with july at 308 a bushel soybeans were 
30 cents higher across the board with july at 1001 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange traders used the phrase a 
drought spread to describe mondays pattern of widely mixed 
prices for future delivery of livestock and meat 
most prices for summer and fall delivery moved lower in 
anticipation of increased supplies as higher feed prices and 
shrinking pasture land caused widespread slaughtering of animals 
analysts said 
but prices for delivery in the winter and spring soared some by 
their permissable limits on expectations that over the long term 
the droughtrelated herd liquidation will result in a sharp drop in 
supplies said thomas morgan president of sterling research corp 
in arlington heights ill 
live cattle were 25 cents lower to 150 cents higher with june 
at 7060 cents a pound feeder cattle were 150 cents lower to 122

july at 4197 cents a pound 
crude oil for nearmonth delivery on the new york mercantile 
exchange fell to 16 a barrel for the first time since march 16 due

gold and silver futures slipped lower on the commodity exchange 
in new york in reaction to the drop in oil prices and the strength 
of the dollar analysts said 
gold settled 380 lower across the board with august at 45450 
a troy ounce silver was 55 cents to 6 cents lower with july at 
7195 a troy ounce

southland corp has agreed to pay 
nearly 10 million to settle charges that a former division 
conspired with other producers to fix prices of milk sold to 
florida schoolchildren the state said monday 
past and present officials of velda farms dairy of miami 
formerly owned by dallasbased southland acknowledged the company 
participated in illicit price fixing florida attorney general bob 
butterworth said 
they get together in a room and decide what part of the market 
each one wants and what price each one wants he said we got 
into that room 
southland parent of 7eleven convenience stores will help 
butterworth litigate cases against six other milk producers as part 
of the agreement the state likely will go to trial in early 1989 
against the others he said 
the bid rigging was the action of at least six velda farms sales 
officials and southlands top management was unaware of it he 
said 
they have acted very responsibly since the charges were 
brought to their attention and have taken steps to make amends to 
the victimized school boards he said 
there was still a possibility of criminal charges against 
individual officials of velda farms or other companies but that 
would be decided by a federal grand jury said butterworth 
however immunity was granted to several officials although 
butterworth declined to name them 
he also declined to say whether the 10 million equaled the 
overcharges saying that might hinder his chances of getting larger 
settlements from the other companies 
of southlands 730 convenience stores in florida most have 
beerandwine licenses and all have state lottery licenses the 
company would not say how much those products generate in sales 
but if southland had been found guilty in a criminal proceeding it 
could have lost those licenses under florida law 
obviously those are important factors to us in our business 
especially since we had sold the velda farms dairy said cecilia 
norwood a southland spokeswoman in dallas 
as part of the settlement the state department of business 
regulation has agreed not to take action that could jeopardize 
southlands alcoholic beverage or lottery licenses 
but southland will be placed on probation for three years 
during which it must notify the department of any criminal 
wrongdoing or beverage violation alleged by the state or federal 
governments according to the agreement 
butterworth filed a federal antitrust lawsuit in february 
against the milk firms charging them with unlawfully allocating 
contracts among themselves over 10 years for supplying milk to at 
least 32 of the states 67 school districts 
the other milk producers named in the lawsuit are borden inc of 
columbus ohio flavorich inc of louisville ky pet inc of st 
louis kraft sealtest of chicago harts dairy now dean foods 
inc of fort myers dean food products co of chicago owner of 
tg lee foods inc of orlando and mcarthur dairies inc of miami

pillsbury co announced on monday the 
resignation of j jeffrey campbell who headed its restaurant 
business for more than a year 
pillsbury also announced a series of other organizational 
changes designed to implement its new strategic business plan and 
streamline the structure of its senior management 
in trading on the new york stock exchange pillsbury rose 1 a 
share to 3675 
the company did not provide an explanation for the departure of 
campbell who had responsibility since may 1987 for all of 
pillsburys restaurant operations he could not be reached for 
comment 
campbell began his pillsbury career in 1971 with burger king 
the fastfood chain that is the centerpiece of the companys 
restaurant business but whose future with pillsbury has been the 
subject of speculation in recent months 
william h spoor pillsburys chief executive had said in march 
that burger king is central to pillsbury and said the parent 
company had no intention of selling the fastfood chain 
in addition to campbells resignation as chairman and chief 
executive of its restaurant group pillsbury announced the 
following appointments 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
charles s olcott 41 president of burger king usa was 
named president and chief operating officer of burger king corp 
with responsibility for us and international operations 
richard t crowder 48 senior vice president and corporate 
risk officer was given the added responsibility of distron the 
distribution and procurement division of burger king 
jerry w levin 44 executive vice president for corporate 
development was given the added responsibility for sampa restaurant 
corp operators of steak and ale and bennigans restaurants 
john l morrison 43 executive vice president and chairman of 
pillsbury us foods was given added responsibility for the 
haagendazs co 
olcott crowder levin and morrison will report directly to 
spoor as will russell j bragg 52 vice president and group vice 
president for industrial foods 
we have streamlined our senior management structure to bring 
added strength and focus to our most important growth 
opportunities spoor said 
stephen carnes a securities analyst with piper jaffray amp 
hopwood in minneapolis said campbells departure indicates a 
desire to upgrade the restaurant groups performance but does not 
signal a move away from the burger king commitment 
with his departure it really says that pillsbury is very 
interested in building the restaurant business and restoring a 
higher level of profitability carnes said 
carnes said the strategy laid out at burger king had not 
really been executed and said he believes campbells resignation 
at least indirectly resulted from burger kings problems 
regarding the other changes carnes said the moves spreads out 
responsibility and called newly organized team a good lineup 
he said the men chosen for the new responsibilities fit well into 
those jobs 
lawrence adelman an analyst with dean witter reynolds in new 
york said pillsbury felt it was time to change the leadership to 
see if that would be more instrumental in driving more positive 
results 
i think they want to take a fresh approach to that business 
unit adelman said the future of pillsbury is very closely 
tied to burger king 
pillsbury spokesman larry haeg said he would not comment on the 
views of analysts 
it was his campbells decision and thats all i can say 
haeg said 
pillsburys restaurant division accounted for about 45 percent 
of the companys fiscal 1987 sales 
operating profits for the restaurant group for fiscal 1987 were 
down 28 percent from fiscal 1986 but were essentially 
unchanged from fiscal 1985 haeg said however he was unable to 
locate exact dollar figures late monday adelman said average 
dollar sales per burger king unit have averaged about 1 million 
for the past two years even though sales in the restaurant group 
rose 4 percent to 203 billion in 1987 from 197 billion in 1986 
the increase was largely due to the addition of new stores haeg 
said

usx corp said monday it plans to sell its 
transportation businesses for more than 500 million to a joint 
venture it is forming with blackstone capital partners and managers 
of the rail and water subsidiaries 
industry analysts called the planned sale a good move for the 
oil and steel giant 
the deal would raise the total of usx asset sales to 55 
billion since david roderick became chairman in 1979 it also would 
pare usxs wholly owned transportation businesses to the petroleum 
pipelines and oceangoing tankers of its marathon oil and texas oil 
amp gas subsidiaries 
roderick has said usx intends to sell another 750 million in 
assets over the next year and a half 
the deal also would drain usxs diversified group of its largest 
business segment leaving realty engineering and related 
consulting and several other small businesses 
its a good approach said george gaspar an analyst with 
the investment firm robert w baird and co inc in milwaukee 
the company wants to disengage from the direct whollyowned 
operations that support its steel operations 
the cash theyll get will allow them more flexibility 
gaspar said adding that usx might use the proceeds from the sale 
to make an oilrelatd acquisition or repurchase its own stock

its debt 
usx based in pittsburgh signed a letter of intent with 
blackstone leaving a definitive agreement to be negotiated and 
regulatory approval financing and usx board approval to be 
obtained usx said 
the blackstone group was founded in 1985 by former commerce 
secretary peter g peterson and stephen a schwarzman former head 
of mergers and acquisitions at lehman brothers kuhn loeb inc 
predecessor to shearson lehman hutton inc

blackstone spokesman james mossman said his firm believes the 
units can expand their outside business but he said the success of 
the new company doesnt depend on that 
the new company will be highly leveraged mossman 
acknowledged 
but the cash flows of these companies are quite strong and 
even if theres a downturn we believe theyll still be able to 
support the debt he added 
mossman declined to disclose revenues and earnings of the 
transportation units 
but usxs published financial reports list their combined sales 
at 353 million for 1987 a year in which they were likely hurt by

georgiapacific corp announced monday it has 
agreed to buy brunswick pulp amp paper co for 665 million 
brunswick which owns one of the worlds largest bleached pulp 
and paperboard mills at brunswick ga is a joint venture of mead 
corp and scott paper co the purchase includes that mill three 
sawmills and around 535000 acres of timberland 
the acquisition is subject to negotiation of a definitive 
agreement regulatory approvals and approvals by the companies 
boards of directors final approval is expected within two months 
according to an announcement from georgiapacific 
the brunswick mill produces around 1500 tons a day of bleached 
softwood market pulp and 500 tons a day of bleached paperboard 
used to make products such as folding cartons paper plates and 
cups 
this is an unusual opportunity to make a major acquisition of 
strategic importance to our core business at an attractive price 
the brunswick property provides worldclass manufacturing capacity 
with a strong fiber base said t marshall hahn jr chairman and 
chief executive officer of georgiapacific 
mead has been divesting itself of some basic commodity 
operations so that it can invest in expansion of highervalue 
coated paperboard 
philip e lippincott scotts chairman and chief executive 
officer said an increasingly greater proportion of brunswick 
pulp amp paper cos production is being directed to the worldwide 
pulp market a strategic direction which scott is not emphasizing 
for the future at the same time scott is focusing its fiber 
strategy on dedicated sources of strategic types of fiber such as 
eucalyptus which brunswick does not produce 
he said the sale is part of the companys plan to sell off parts 
of its operation which do not fit its longterm strategy 
georgiapacific said the acquisition represents a significant 
addition to its present position as a major producer of market 
pulp adding 525000 tons a year to its current capacity of 70000 
tons 
it also more than doubles georgiapacifics bleached board 
capacity adding 175000 tons to the 171000ton capacity of tis 
facilty at crossett ark 
the 535000 acres of timberland are located in areas where they 
can be used by the brunswick mill and other georgiapacific 
facilities in south carolina georgia and florida the company said 
the sawmills located at pearson and sterling ga and 
mccormick sc have a combined capacity of almost 200 million 
board feet of southern pine lumber products per year

delaware amp hudson railway co a 
subsidiary of guilford transportation industries filed for 
bankruptcy in us district court in delaware monday after failing 
to recieve approval on a lease agreement that rail officials say 
would save the company more than 1 million a month 
delaware and hudson had been working on negative funding 
said guilford vice president f colin pease without that 
agreement the banks refuse to give damph credit so it cant get 
financing 
a federal arbitrator last week barred damph from leasing its 
railroads to another guilford subsidiary springfield terminal 
pease said springfield terminal operates under lenient labor 
regulations which allow for decreased labor costs 
the arbitrator is wrong pease said his actions conflict 
with every interstate commerce commission decision i can find his 
actions have destroyed a railroad 
the interstate commerce commission is expected to designate an 
interim operator to take over the damph lines which run primarily 
through new york and pennsylvania icc officials said offers have 
been made by consolidated rail corp of philadelphia and delaware 
otsego corp of cooperstown ny 
guilford officials said damph had lost 81 million last year and 
at least 8 million so far in 1988 
meanwhile around 1200 unionized guilford employees returned to 
their jobs monday after a sevenmonth strike over safety 
conditions workers returned to railyards in maine and 
massachusetts in accordance with last weeks arbitration board 
decision 
although the returning strikers were all put back on the company 
payroll pease said it may take a week or so before they resume 
their old positions 
pease said the returnees were meeting with supervisors and were 
being scheduled for physical examinations and tests of railroad 
operating rules a requirement for workers who have been off the 
job for 30 days or more 
the workers from guilfords springfield terminal walked off the 
job to protest safety conditions following a nov 12 fatal accident 
in lawrence mass 
a federal arbitration board ruled last week that the strike was 
legal under federal law as a protest of unsafe working conditions 
at guilford and ordered the company to allow the workers to return 
it also ordered guilford to pay the striking workers an estimated 
15 million in back wages 
guilford appealed the arbitration board ruling in us district 
court in portland maine last wednesday

the mississippi rivers record lowwater 
levels caused by the drought in the midwest and plains threw more 
roadblocks in the way of river barge shipping monday 
and authorities warned that sandbars exposed by the dropping 
water are dangerous and claimed three lives over the weekend 
a little rain at st louis is not what is needed said coast 
guard lt phil rhoades a drenching of the entire mississippi 
drainage basin is needed lots of water 
towboats were freed during the weekend from backups caused by 
shallow water and sandbars at greenville miss and on the ohio 
river after dredges cut fresh channels through the shallow river 
bottoms 
but coast guard cmdr michael donohoe said a low section of the 
river six miles north of memphis probably would be closed for 
dredging and could stay closed for two days or more 
and a barge ran aground early monday in shallow water near 
gunnison miss and engineers said it could take as long as three 
days to dredge a deeper channel at that spot 
the mississippi at memphis was more than 20 feet lower than this 
time last year on monday and 40 to 50 feet below its springtime 
level donohoe said 
the main channel was 9 feet deep and perhaps a little less for 
about 1000 feet at the low spot and the rivers width there was 
down from 500 feet to about 170 feet he said 
a corps of engineers dredge was expected to arrive tuesday to 
begin deepening the channel to 12 to 14 feet and widening it to 300 
feet donohoe said 
a decision on closing the river for the dredging or allowing 
limited barge traffic while the work is under way would be made 
tuesday said lt tony bauncore if it can be done quicker with 
it closed well do that bauncore said 
four towboats with a total of about 35 barges were reported 
grounded monday at other low spots near memphis but bauncore said 
they all were eventually freed 
donohoe said towboats working in the memphis area were being 
limited to six barges each the boats generally can handle 30 to 40 
barges each he said 
the low water also exposed huge sandbars that were drawing 
spectators dangerously close to the river 
three people drowned near natchez miss sunday when a sandbar 
they were walking on fell apart said rhoades 
these sandbars have been under water and theyre not stable 
he said if youve seen the side of a sandcastle just fall away 
thats basically what it can be if youre walking on a sandbar

a man accused of disguising himself with a wig to 
help carry out a fraudulent trading scheme at the chicago board of 
trade pleaded guilty monday to conspiracy and wire fraud 
daniel dewey 39 entered the plea in us district court as 
part of an agreement in which he and two other men will testify 
against a former broker at the board of trade 
prosecutors said the scheme involved dewey wearing a wig 
phony trading jacket and false badges trading us treasury bond 
futures then submitting the trading card to the former broker 
thompson b sanders 45 
if the trade made money sanders would process the trading card 
through his brokerage business the indictment charged 
it said that if the trade lost money sanders would not process 
it the other party to the trade would not be able to trace it 
because of deweys fake identification 
the other two defendants david pelleu 45 and dan kolton 24 
already have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing 
prosecutors said the group made thousands of dollars operating 
the scheme on three days in 1986 
in one instance however sanders and dewey did not claim one 
trade of 600 contracts of treasury bond futures because it turned 
into a loss of more than 100000 the indictment stated 
the market rallied the next day giving them a potential profit 
of 500000 on the contracts but they did not claim it for fear of 
being found out the indictment stated

texas cattlemen say japans decision monday to 
liberalize import restrictions on beef boosts morale by opening the 
door to more trade in the future although they doubt theyll see 
an immediate financial gain 
the agreement announced in tokyo by us trade representative 
clayton yeutter calls for japan to nearly double its beef imports 
by 1991 it also provides for doubling japans imports of oranges 
from the united states 
were very pleased with this agreement said charles e 
ball executive vice president of the texas cattle feeders 
association in amarillo 
it is something that we have felt we should have had for a 
number of years the japanese have been very slow to negotiate on 
quotas ball said 
but cattlemen in texas the nations biggest cattle producer 
last year said the immediate financial impact of the decision is 
less certain 
this japan will become a significant market in the future 
but in terms of dollars this year or next year its going to be 
very difficult to measure ball said 
the import quota as i understand it was very small anyway and 
doubling something that was small to begin with is going to have a 
pretty minor impact but its a step in the right direction said 
san angelo rancher skipper duncan who raises feeder cattle 
under the pact tariffs would be cut gradually to a level of 50 
percent by 1993 and import quotas on oranges would be eliminated 
this has been a psychological thing for our people the fact 
that we import so much from japan while theyve had barriers on our 
beef and citrus over there ball said its going to be a 
morale booster for us and its going to help our markets some 
texas citrus growers heavily concentrated in production of 
fresh grapefruit will be affected indirectly by the pact on 
oranges said ray prewett executive vice president of texas citrus 
mutual the citrus growers trade association in the rio grande 
valley 
primarily our export is in grapefruit and thats in fresh 
grapefruit prewett said 
we will benefit as far as oranges go because if florida and 
california increase their orange exports that will have an effect 
on us by not having as much domestic oranges in the market it 
will have a positive longterm effect 
by 1990 quotas on fresh oranges would be eliminated and tariffs 
set at 20 percent to 40 percent quotas on orange juice also will 
be phased out
