the february freeze spread thursday to new england and the 
midatlantic states while wind and cold lingering in the nations 
heartland and northwest endangered livestock and crops and made 
venturing outside hazardous 
a band of freezing rain extended from texas to new england heavy 
snow was reported in parts of the central rockies and windchill 
readings hit 75 below or lower in parts of montana the dakotas and 
wyoming 
the cold and snow led to a short workday for state workers in 
montana unexpected school and university holidays in several states 
and highway accidents ranchers reported that newborn calves were 
dying in the cold and citrus growers took precautions to keep the 
deep freeze from harming their crops 
the misery stemmed from an ocean of cold air that poured down 
from alaska early in the week after a shift in the jet stream by 
midday thursday its effects in the lower 48 were being felt across 
a vast roughly triangular area from the pacific northwest to texas 
to new england areas that had enjoyed in many cases their warmest 
january in years 
bostonians enjoyed a recordhigh 66 degrees wednesday 
twentyfour hours later the city shivered in 31degree air and 
light freezing rain was falling 
in montana which continued to post the lowest temperatures 
outside alaska gov stan stephens sent all nonessential state 
workers home thursday the capital helena grappled not only with 
the bitter cold but with a train derailment and explosion that 
forced the evacuation of thousands of people and disrupted 
electrical power 
montanas two largest universities shut down through the weekend 
its not the cold because weve been open in much colder 
weather said bill tietz president of montana state university at 
bozeman its the wind chill were concerned about 
classes were canceled at many south dakota schools because of the 
wind chill and blowing snow schools also were closed north dakota 
oregon and elsewhere

great falls lewistown and cut bank and their windchill readings 
were as low as 78 below in billings the record low for a feb 2 
used to be 13 degrees below zero on thursday it went to 28 below 
and 20 below was the high for the day 
in all six record lows for the date were posted including 
astoria ore with 18 above casper wyo 27 below and sheridan 
wyo 28 below 
but temperature records at the other end of the scale though not 
so widespread as on wednesday also were racked up thursday nearly 
30 record highs were set including asheville nc 76 degrees 
cape hatteras nc 74 charlotte nc 80 norfolk va 80 
richmond va 78 and wilmington nc 80 
in alaska temperatures remained in the cellar near the canadian 
border but warmed up elsewhere early thursday it was 37 degrees at 
adak in the aleutian islands and 59 degrees below zero at northway 
at least four traffic fatalities were blamed on the weather and 
in edmonds wash a 35yearold utility worker died thursday when 
he fell while trying to repair a downed power line 
in martin sd a 50yearold man was found dead thursday 
morning in a vacant lot bennett county chief deputy sheriff craig 
dillon said the mans death apparently was caused by exposure the 
overnight temperature in martin was about 25 below zero with a wind 
chill of 60 below 
the man fell down and you could see where he struggled in the 
snow to regain his feet but he was unable to do so dillon said 
but a life was saved in north dakota when searchers thursday 
found a 16yearold boy who got lost monday while driving to his 
familys farm bennett stebleton of rural egeland was coherent but 
too wrung out to show any emotion aside from saying im 
thankful that im alive said volunteer rescuer greg mitchell 
the boy who had only light clothing and car mats to keep him 
warm had badly frostbitten feet and hands and was hospitalized in 
stable condition overnight temperatures in the area had plunged to 
30 degrees below zero

6 new inches by midmorning while 11 inches were reported in 
northern larimer county colo and 4 inches at laramie wyo snow 
also fell in the upper midwest 
in northern california snow blanketed the sierra dusted san 
francisco bay area mountains and fell over beachfront communities 
freezing rain extended as far south as texas and forecasters 
said there was a chance that belowfreezing temperatures could 
extend to the southern part of the state by the weekend 
nervous citrus growers in south texas still recovering from a 
devastating freeze in 1983 were taking precautions officials said 
as people have been leaving my store today ive been telling 
them to go to church sunday and pray for us said mardy eggers 
from her familys rio grande valley citrus farm eggers acres

acetylene torches to some water tanks for cattle partowner steve 
mercer said they also had to stir the cattle feed so it wouldnt 
freeze 
power outages blamed on the weather were reported in washington 
montana utah and nebraska officials in norfolk neb theorized 
that a power line contracted so tightly in 58 below windchills that 
it just snapped

in the mining town of 
carletonville officials voted this week to erect a fence to keep 
blacks off the civic centers lawn 
in johannesburg a mob of whites threatened to kill an indian man 
who hoped to be their neighbor 
near cape town a blond 5yearold boy was expelled last week 
from an allwhite nursery school wayne shirley was a lovely and 
intelligent boy the principal in kraaifontein said and he was 
legally classified as white but he could not stay because his 
mother had mixed racial ancestry 
practices like these pervade south african society what sets the 
country apart however is not the existence of racism but the fact 
that it is permitted even mandated by many of the people in power 
when rightwing whites resegregated parks in the city of boksburg 
last year and blocked the indian man from moving into their 
neighborhood last weekend they were scolded by the government and 
the press but they had the law on their side 
employers face no penalties if they hire according to race but 
colorblind landlords face heavy fines government schools must 
practice segregation and private schools are entitled to do so 
municipal governments are empowered to bar blacks from parks buses 
or beaches 
the racists and bigots will exploit laws as long as they remain 
on the statute books said brian currin director of lawyers for 
human rights 
president pw bothas government has spoken out against racism 
with increasing frequency in recent years in november it banned a 
small whitesupremacist group and it has outlawed the incitement of 
racial hostility 
if apartheid means racial discrimination and encroachment 
on human dignity then i reject it out of hand botha said in 1986 
but rarely is the governments rhetoric accompanied by tough 
action the recent banning of the white liberation movement has not 
been followed by steps against the larger more powerful afrikaner 
resistance movement despite its whitesupremacist ideology 
nazistyle symbols and paramilitary training programs 
nor did police disperse the mob that gathered sunday outside a 
house in johannesburgs mayfair west district draped a noose over a 
wall and shouted threats at the indian who planned to move his 
family into the white neighborhood 
years of forced separation and years of racist indoctrination 
have resulted in people behaving in such abominable ways said the 
sowetan a black newspaper in a subsequent editorial 
information minister stoffel van der merwe said in an interview 
that the mayfair west incident could have happened in the united 
states or britain 
the government was conducting a campaign of persuasion to 
diminish white racism he said but if you overdo that you create 
a reaction 
the eradication of racism from a society is a very complicated 
longterm undertaking as evidenced by the american experience 
van der merwe said compared to 10 years ago weve made 
tremendous progress 
van der merwe described wayne shirleys expulsion from nursery 
school as very unfortunate 
when one lives in a society in a state of change there is a 
gap between morality and legality he said noting that the 
principal acted lawfully 
the government says blatant racism will worsen south africas 
international isolation but it refuses to outlaw segregation of 
local facilities or residential areas 
unfortunately the government is unable to act decisively in 
such matters said the citizen a progovernment newspaper 
prosecuting nonwhites who live in white areas would create 
racial tensions at home and damaging publicity abroad it said 
this week but if the government scrapped the group areas act it 
would lose its constituency 
racism is practiced most enthusiastically by extremeright 
whites who thursday launched a whitesonly rugby league 
but bigotry exists in relatively liberal neighborhoods as well 
in johannesburgs wealthy northern suburbs where most voters back 
antiapartheid candidates doctors willing to treat black servants 
ask them to use separate waiting rooms 
neighborhood newspapers in those suburbs carry ads for 
europeansupervised plumbing or electrical services readers 
know this means that if blacks come to their house to do repairs a 
white man will be in charge 
despite the entrenchment of racial divisions many south africans 
are working to overcome them 
church groups have sponsored workshops in which whites stay 
overnight in black townships while blacks live with whites several 
multiracial private schools are flourishing 
amanda shirley the mother of the expelled nursery school 
student said she will seek out one of these schools for her 
children where they will realize that they are equal to and no 
better than any other child

satirical cartoonists have launched a scathing 
attack on buddhism and superstitious rituals such as fortunetelling 
which are enjoying a resurgence after 40 years of communist 
suppression 
today you will suffer financial losses a fortuneteller in 
one cartoon intones as he holds a customers palm in one hand and 
takes a hefty fee with the other 
another shows a man with a bad leg going from temple to temple to 
pray for healing and finally being carried into a hospital on a 
stretcher 
more than 120 such cartoons were part of an exhibit called away 
with superstition and ignorance shown this week in beijing and 
four other cities 
cartoonist xu jin said the artists timed the show for just before 
the feb 6 celebration of the lunar new year traditionally one of 
the most superstitious dates on the chinese calendar 
setting off firecrackers still popular on the holiday 
originally was intended to scare away evil spirits 
we have a mission to help educate people xu said its not 
just a matter of people losing money to witch doctors and 
fortunetellers its also a problem of increasing the scientific 
spirit 
the rebuilding of temples and the worship of buddhist gods also 
come in for heavy attack 
one cartoon shows a man answering the telephone in a government 
office and telling the caller that all the officials have gone to 
the front line 
where exactly 
to the dragon king temple to burn incense comes the answer 
wang xiuqiao of the chinese research institute for popularizing 
science which helped organize the exhibit said it often is hard to 
separate religion from superstition 
religion often uses superstitious elements for example if it 
claims to be able to cure people who are ill she said 
china says it allows freedom of religion but it is more tolerant 
of christianity which most chinese see as alien and other 
minority religions than it is of buddhism which has deep roots 
among the chinese and greater potential to spread 
religion and superstition played a large role in daily life in 
precommunist china especially in the countryside 
omens were seen in everyday events such as a crow passing 
overhead and people consulted diviners before making important 
decisions single women made offerings at maidens temples in 
hopes of finding good husbands and married women prayed to other 
gods for sons 
the communists quashed most such practices after taking power in 
1949 but the rituals have enjoyed a comeback recently as the 
government has relaxed controls and peasants have acquired more 
money 
in the prosperous southeast rice fields once again are dotted 
with small ancestral shrines and tombs newly built by peasants or 
renovated after decades of neglect 
after they build a new house and buy a washing machine rich 
peasants have nothing else to spend money on so they rebuild the 
family shrine ms wang said also they want to show their 
gratitude for their wealth and ask the gods to keep the government 
from changing its policies of allowing some private industry 
the official media often complain that building shrines and tombs 
wastes money and land and call diviners and witch doctors cheats 
all were targets at the cartoon exhibit which drew about 24000 
viewers during an eightday showing at the china art gallery in 
beijing 
one that drew chuckles from viewers showed a spiritualist telling 
a fearful family that their goat chicken and tv set harbored evil 
spirits the spiritualist loaded them onto his cart and set off 
calling cheerfully now i have all the evil spirits 
others took swipes at the new fad of computerized fortunetelling 
touted by its hawkers as scientific customers feed their birthdate 
into a computer and get a printout with their fortune 
we just came to laugh hardly anyone in beijing believes in 
these things said a young woman who giggled over the cartoons 
with her boyfriend 
ms wang agreed most city dwellers arent as superstitious as 
rural residents 
but she said even in the cities people are turning to old beliefs 
because of a crisis of faith in the government 
during the 1960s and 1970s she said people developed the 
habit of worshipping chairman mao tsetung as a god now they 
dont have mao so they look for other gods

black muslim minister louis farrakhan 
appeared thursday at the racially troubled university of 
massachusetts and angrily told jewish protesters they had no right 
to call him a hatemonger 
farrakhan told an audience of 2000 that he did not come to the 
college to pit blacks against jews but he said blacks learned how 
to hate from the hatred directed at them 
to those jewish students who see me as a hitler as a hater i 
wish you life i wish you life i dont wish to see any human 
forfeit his life said the leader of the chicagobased nation of 
islam 
but farrakhan added your people taught us to hate ourselves 
for years and you have a hell of a nerve to see me today and call 
me a hatemonger 
farrakhan said whites should leave blacks to solve their problems 
themselves 
if the jewish students come together to work out some family 
matter we shouldnt call that racism he said no one outside 
the family should dare to interfere with our family problems 
he said more separation between the races is needed to combat 
black feelings of inferiority 
we dont need a bedroom relationship with white people we want 
a boardroom relationship perhaps some other time we might want to 
entertain some social contacts 
farrakhan added when we awaken we will march against every 
vestige of oppression and if you challenge us then we are going to 
clash with you until death separates us from life or you from life 
but why should that be 
more than 500 students held a quiet candlelight march prior to 
farrakhans visit while members of a militant jewish group led 
students in a loud demonstration outside the hall in which the black 
leader spoke 
farrakhan is a nazi without a swastika declared mordechai 
levi the new yorkbased head of the jewish defense organization 
he should be in libya not in this campus 
the visit by farrakhan and the 38 guards he calls the fruit of 
islam nearly coincided with the first anniversary of a campus 
building takeover by 100 minority students to protest racial 
violence at this 30000student school in western massachusetts 
farrakhan was promised 11000 by a black fraternity and a campus 
speaker program to talk at the universitys fine arts center 
tickets sold out within a day 
farrakhan came to national attention in 1984 for calling judaism 
a gutter religion and making other antisemitic remarks that his 
supporters say have been taken out of context in his campaign to 
foster black pride 
the amherst campus has been the scene of racial strife since a 
fight broke out among black and white students after the boston red 
sox loss to the new york mets in the final game of the 1986 world 
series 
on feb 11 1988 minority students began a weeklong occupation 
of a university building to protest another racial scuffle the 
takeover which was the first of several around the northeast ended 
with the chancellors agreement to boost programs for minority 
students

british spymaster sir william samuel 
stephenson the legendary man called intrepid whose vast 
intelligence web snared german spies in the united states during 
world war ii died at his home he was 93 
stephenson operated out of new york during the war and was given 
his famous code name and a virtual carte blanche to conduct 
espionage by british prime minister winston churchill he died on 
tuesday and was buried the next day 
sources close to him said he died peacefully at home and had 
instructed that his death not be announced until after his burial 
stephenson the son of a lumber mill owner was born in winnipeg 
canada in 1896 and became an engineer during world war i he was a 
pilot in the royal air force and shot down 26 german planes 
he became a millionaire industrialist by the age of 30 largely 
as a result of inventing in the 1920s a method of sending pictures 
by wire he made a fortune through other business ventures and even 
found time to win the world amateur light heavyweight boxing 
championship 
but his most famous exploits came after 1940 when he was tapped 
by churchill to put together the most potent intelligence netork of 
its kind 
he was sent to new york officially to establish an organization 
to protect british shipping during the war and counter the 
activities of nazi spies but in fact the operation he set up was 
later acknowledged to be the hub of all the branches of british 
intelligence 
he also was reported to be the link between churchill and 
roosevelt in the years before the united states entered the war 
he became britains top operator in the americas and was 
responsible for training in canada a cadre of spies and saboteurs 
who operated in nazioccuped europe 
he set up shop in manhattans rockefeller center with the 
approval of president roosevelt and fbi director j edgar hoover 
but without of the official knowledge of the state department which 
was observing neutrality because the united states had not yet 
entered the war 
stephenson and his agents secretly killed at least three german 
operatives in america and ran clandestine operations to discredit 
us politicians who opposed aid to britain according to the 
popular book on the operation a man called intrepid by william 
stevenson 
the book chronicled a dazzling series of successes ranging from 
codebreaking to dropping agents into occupied europe he was a 
severe anticommunist after the war 
he already had retired by the time his exploits became public 
mostly through stevensons 1976 book and the authors subsequent 
intrepids last case in 1983 
stephenson stayed out of the public eye until 1987 when peter 
wrights book spycatcher became famous because of the british 
governments attempts to suppress it 
he went on record as saying that he believed the late sir roger 
hollis head of the mi5 british spy agency was a soviet double 
agent 
hollis was a bad egg if ever there was one he told the 
royal gazette newspaper in bermuda 
stephenson was married in 1924 to mary simmons who died in 1978

jailed political extremist lyndon larouche has 
filed a lawsuit to stop distribution of a newspaper column that he 
says could incite other inmates to harm him because it calls him a 
catkiller a lawyer said 
the column by mike royko syndicated through the chicago tribune 
contends that larouche followers have killed cats of larouche 
opponents a claim larouche followers deny 
i hope that this column finds its way to his fellow inmates 
royko wrote in the column printed monday in the chicago tribune and 
distributed to about 500 newspapers they should know that they 
have a catkiller in their midst and i hope any catlovers among 
them do whatever they feel is appropriate 
michael null the chicago lawyer who filed the lawsuit in cook 
county circuit court said thursday the column is nothing less 
than inciting people to violence null said that is not something 
writers can do under constitutional protections of freedom of the 
press 
this is a case of a verbal act solicitation to commit a 
crime to do great bodily harm to mr larouche or do murder null 
said 
but royko in a telephone interview later thursday said violence 
against larouche was not his intent 
as to what is appropriate for other inmates to do with 
larouche royko said they should lecture him they should tell 
him to caution his people against picking on cats 
a federal judge in alexandria va sentenced larouche to 15 
years in prison friday for scheming to defraud the internal revenue 
service and deliberately defaulting on more than 30 million in 
loans from supporters 
larouche 66 a threetime presidential fringe candidate was 
sent to the alexandria county jail to await transfer to a federal 
prison 
the lawsuit filed wednesday originally stressed the importance 
of keeping the royko column out of the washington times which null 
said is distributed in the alexandria jail however the column ran 
in the newspaper on wednesday 
null said the lawsuit would still be pressed to avoid any further 
distribution and to seek a permanent injunction against any further 
columns that might incite people to harm larouche 
a hearing on the lawsuit was set for friday null said

the nations egg producers are shipping lazy 
hens off to the soup factory in an effort to reduce flock sizes but 
even those stern measures are unlikely to return quick profits to 
the battered industry 
department economists say that losses to egg producers in 1988 
were the highest since usda began keeping those financial records 17 
years ago 
as of jan 1 the hen flock that produces table eggs the kind 
in cartons was estimated by usda at 2334 million birds 6 percent 
fewer than a year earlier overall hen flocks including hens 
producing eggs to hatch new chicks declined 5 percent to 2713 
million birds 
this was the largest liquidation of layers since the avian 
influenza outbreak in 1983 says economist robert v bishop 
egg consumption is expected to continue its decline to around 235 
eggs per person this year from an average of about 243 in 1988 and 
259 in 1984 according to the departments economic research service 
health concerns relating to cholesterol content may be 
affecting egg consumption the agency said in a recent report 
at the same time egg producers have spent little money on 
changing the image of eggs or convincing consumers that eggs are not 
just for breakfast 
meanwhile egg prices at the farm were erratic at times in 1988 
but wound up the year averaging 621 cents per dozen about the same 
as in 1987 
but production costs have risen in recent years and in 1988 
producers nationally lost an average of 52 cents per dozen 
lawrence a witucki another usda economist said thursday in a 
telephone interview that the 1988 loss of 52 cents per dozen eggs 
was the second poor year in a row for egg producers who barely 
broke even nationally with an average net return of 02 cents in 
1987 
according to agency records he said producers averaged a net 
profit of 69 cents in 1986 before rising feed costs and other 
expenses cut margins last year was the first real loss since 1980 
when producers had a negative average of 35 cents per dozen he 
said 
further witucki said last years 52 cents was the largest 
annual loss since the agency began keeping track in 1972 a year 
when egg producers lost an average of 28 cents per dozen 
as with any national figures he said some egg producers have 
made money and others have lost the yearly averages are general 
indicators of how the industry is faring 
we expect more negatives in the first half of 1989 with feed 
prices playing a role witucki said hopefully with normal 
crops feed prices should decline in the second half but im afraid 
it doesnt look real bright 
all states have some commercial egg production even alaska with 
an output of about 700000 eggs last year the top 10 and their 1988 
output in millions of eggs 
california 7718 
indiana 5644

japan is a growing consumer of nuts but an 
agriculture department report says american exporters are finding 
the market a bit hard to crack 
the departments foreign agricultural service said that japanese 
imports of tree nuts increased more than 40 percent in five years to 
almost 64000 metric tons worth 220 million in 1987 
although us almonds and walnuts are on the upswing in japan 
some other foreign suppliers are much bigger for certain kinds of 
nuts 
japan has no quotas on the import of tree nuts the report said 
but import duties have ranged from 4 percent for almonds to 9 
percent for pistachios and macadamia nuts 10 percent for hazelnuts 
and 16 percent for chestnuts and walnuts 
however under the usjapan beef and citrus agreement signed 
last july japan agreed to eliminate the duty on pistachios lower 
it for macadamias and pecans to 5 percent and reduce the walnut 
duty to 10 percent the report said 
although the us share of the market for pistachios hazelnuts 
and macadamia nuts are relatively small sales have increased 
notably in the past few years and the future appears bright the 
report said 
iran is the main supplier of pistachios to japan turkey is the 
largest provider of hazelnuts and kenya has more than half of the 
market for macadamia nuts

the agriculture department has proposed to 
sharply increase inspection user fees on imported fluecured and 
burley tobacco 
j patrick boyle administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said thursday that all fluecured and burley that 
is affirmed by importers to be free of prohibited pesticides is 
currently assessed fees of 01 cents per pound for usda verification 
the proposal would raise the fee to 035 cents per pound and 
establish a minimum fee of 162 per shipment for sampling and 
testing 
boyle said that tobacco not affirmed by importers to be free of 
banned chemicals is currently charged an additional fee of 03 cents 
per pound to cover usdas more extensive testing the proposal would 
raise this fee to 035 cents 
the 1985 farm law required usda to revise its fees to reflect 
changing costs in the inspection and testing of imported tobacco he 
said 
public comments on the proposed rule changes can be sent by march 
6 to director tobacco division room 502 annex building ams

president bush says he is much better thank 
you and so all washington can breathe a sigh of relief and put 
william henry harrison out of mind 
bush caught a stubborn cold a few days after taking office two 
weeks ago and it was the sort thing that calls attention to itself 
in a new president 
his voice turned raspy and he apologized to an audience of 
sailors in norfolk va tuesday for just croaking away on 
wednesday he lost his voice altogether to laryngitis and greeted 
guests at a diplomatic reception that night in a bare whisper he 
canceled a speech looked flushed said he was taking antibiotics 
for an ear infection and kept saying it was only a cold 
but im a totally new man he reported thursday all well 
totally recovered 
bush likes to compare himself to martin van buren but it was van 
burens successor in the white house harrison who came uneasily to 
mind 
harrison 68 gaunt malnourished and apparently suffering from 
ulcers delivered the longest inaugural address on record one hour 
and 45 minutes in cold blustery wet weather on march 4 1841 a 
month later he was dead in the white house 
he refused to wear a hat or coat when riding a horse to his 
inauguration and then despite the weather declined to shorten his 
8578word speech he led a parade back to the white house and that 
night attended three inaugural balls he caught a cold 
harassed and fatigued from the demands of office seekers he was 
unable to shake it off no help was offered by the environment of a 
poorly heated white house 
according to medical coverups in the white house by edward 
b macmahon a doctor and leonard curry a journalist published in 
1987 harrison like many presidents was given inadequate care 
american presidential history is filled with examples of 
medical treatment that has ranged from questionable to downright 
incompetent the authors say 
by march 27 harrison who had avoided standard medical treatment 
all his life was willing to submit to the doctors 
he and they both knew that the diagnosis pneumonia of the 
right lower lobe of the lung with congestion of the liver 
constituted in those days a fatal complication the book says 
the doctors first blistered the skin on the right side of his 
chest then applied suction cups to draw out what they considered to 
be the offensive substance making the president ill that weakened 
him 
next they induced vomiting gave him castor oil to purge his 
bowels and finally gave him sedatives in the form of opium and 
brandy as a last resort they tried a seneca indian remedy 
virginia snakeweed it didnt work either 
bushs treatment was presumably more medically relevant than 
harrisons and presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater was able to 
pronounce his boss fit thursday afternoon 
his prognosis is excellent he said hes in good shape 
his voice is getting stronger he feels well 
so washington relaxed people here laughed again at what comedian 
mark russell said during an inauguration event that the five most 
feared words in washington were barbara i dont feel well

a senate investigative committee may summon the 
head of the nations largest indian tribe to address allegations he 
accepted cash payments and favors from contractors seeking work on 
its reservation 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said after thursdays committee 
session that he is pursuing the question of whether to invite 
navajo chairman peter macdonald to testify before the panel and 
whether to subpoena him if necessary 
a special investigative committee of the senate select committee 
on indian affairs has been holding hearings all week in which 
allegations have been made of corruption and mismanagement in 
federal indian programs and on reservations the investigation was 
inspired by a series of reports in the arizona republic and other 
publications 
two white construction company owners and a navajo contractor 
testifying under immunity spoke thursday of free airplane rides 
cash payments and other favors they gave macdonald in hopes of 
increasing their business on the 25000squaremile navajo nation 
reservation in northeastern arizona and adjoining parts of utah and 
new mexico 
they and another indian construction official also said it was 
common for nonindians to create dummy companies headed by indians 
in order to qualify for federally financed projects set aside for 
members of the minority group 
tribal spokeswoman tazbah mccullah speaking from tribal offices 
in window rock ariz said the accounts of fraud and abuse made 
during the week were malicious allegations designed to 
discredit the integrity of the navajo nation its people 
government and sovereignty 
she said a delegation of 11 tribal officials would travel to 
washington perhaps by monday to testify to the senate panel she 
said macdonald would not be among them 
deconcini said the committee would hear next week about organized 
crime and sexual abuses connected with indian programs 
thursdays session focused on favors allegedly provided to 
macdonald 60 
contractor john a paddock of marana ariz testified he had 
offered macdonald the use of a company airplane and pilot during the 
chairmans 1986 reelection campaign he said macdonald ended up 
taking about 35 flights many of them after his november 1986 
election and including two trips to las vegas nev 
paddock said he had not been reimbursed for the trips he said 
the flights cost him 12000 in pilot and fuel costs and would have 
been worth more than 60000 commercially 
paddock said his company was declared ineligible to work on the 
navajo reservation by peterson zah who had ousted macdonald from 
the chairmanship in 1982 the company was recertified for contracts 
after macdonald recaptured the position 
paddock said macdonald asked him for a 35000 oneyear loan in 
december 1987 money paddock gave macdonald and has not been repaid 
the contractor said he paid many of the expenses of the two las 
vegas trips he and macdonald took with their wives and other 
couples lent a company truck to macdonalds daughter hope and 
paid a 400 bill he received for her use of the vehicles telephone 
he said he also contributed 2500 to a birthday party for the 
chairmans wife wanda and was later reimbursed for only about half 
of the amount 
franz a springer a contractor from albuquerque nm and his 
navajo partner pat chee miller told of giving macdonald 1000 
during his reelection campaign in 1986 they also described 
separate payments of 1000 5000 and 3000 they said were made 
last year and an effort to purchase macdonald a 5500 replica of a 
model a ford that was thwarted after an fbi agent began making 
inquiries 
in my culture when an elder asks you for help i didnt see 
any problem with 3000 or 4000 at the outset said miller it 
was just a small favor but i didnt realize it would get this 
large

the university of chicago law school has barred a 
prestigious law firm from oncampus recruiting for one year because 
a partner made racist sexist and antisemitic remarks during an 
interview with a student 
geoffrey r stone dean of the law school commended the 
chicagobased law firm of baker amp mckenzie on thursday for 
displaying sensitivity professionalism and integrity after 
the incident became public 
but he added in a statement just as baker amp mckenzie has 
assured us it will take strong steps to condemn this behavior and to 
prevent its repetition so too must we take strong steps to protect 
our students against insulting and degrading conduct in the 
interview process 
the ban which covers the 198990 academic year and had been 
recommended by the universitys law students association black law 
students association and the law school placement committee came 
nearly a week after initial reports of the job interview 
this is especially painful because weve always taken great 
pride in being part of the solution rather than part of the 
problem said robert cox chairman of the executive committee at 
baker amp mckenzie one of the worlds largest law firms but 
obviously when something like this happens you must take a look at 
yourself again 
according to last fridays edition of the law school student 
newspaper the phoenix a partner from baker amp mckenzie later 
identified as harry okane conducted the interview with a black 
female law student 
neither the law school nor the firm has disputed the account the 
student has not been identified 
among other things okane asked the student during a discussion 
about the practice of law how she would react to being called a 
black bitch or nigger by adversaries or colleagues 
when the student remarked at another juncture that she played 
golf the partner responded why dont blacks have their own 
country clubs he then answered his own question saying there 
arent too many golf courses in the ghetto 
the newspaper also paraphrased okane as remarking he wouldnt 
want to belong to a jewish country club but at least they had 
their own 
okane declined to comment when reached by telephone thursday 
night at his suburban arlington heights home and referred all 
questions to cox 
cox said okane a partner for 20 years has taken an 
indefinite leave he said that okane is not a racist and 
suggested his commments may have been a kind of stress test for 
the applicant 
but let me reiterate there is no attempt to excuse what he did 
well deal with what disciplinary action is appropriate in the 
days ahead he said 
baker amp mckenzie operates 44 offices in 26 countries and has 
approximately 1300 lawyers worldwide 
of the estimated 400 lawyers working in the united states cox 
said there would be 10 blacks after the current round of hiring 
of the firms 432 partners cox said about 30 were women and none 
are black 23 however are graduates of the university of chicago 
law school

an attractive major new ballet and a brief 
rather insignificant ballet duet both choreographed by peter 
martins were danced for the first time by the new york city ballet 
on thursday night 
mozart serenade for four couples four women soloists and a 
corps de ballet filled the stage in a balanced flowing george 
balanchine way without looking like an imitation of a balanchine 
ballet 
balance is appropriate because the music is selections from 
mozarts serenades in d major however the symmetry is more 
relaxed than rigid giving the dance a contemporary look when one 
of the four lead couples has a duet the other six dancers stand as 
onlookers in two rows of three rather than staying always as couples 
the corps de ballet flowed smoothly melting from three rows of 
dancers which gave soloists aisles to dance in to form a picture 
frame outlining the soloists 
the dancing was of a high order and stressed ensemble with 
soloists and corps presenting one picture the main costume color 
by barbara maters was pearl gray accented attractively by darker 
grays gray draperies were hung at each side of the stage 
the four lead couples mostly relatively new to the company were 
margaret tracey jeffrey edwards roma sosenko michael byars 
zippora karz ben huys marisa cerveris and philip neal 
martins also was in a formal mood for the brief pas de deux 
titled beethoven romance kyra nichols wore green over purple 
chiffon and adam luders costume suggested a viennese cavalry 
officers uniform and boots the dance was romantic the couple 
both dancing beautifully moved away from each other and met again 
in embraces 
miss nichols had a brief solo but there were no solo variations 
for luders he had to be content with dancing away from the 
ballerina and jumping thrusting one leg high and behind him as he 
reached a far corner a step he does very well a viewer was left 
with the feeling that there might have been more 
lamar alsop was the noteworthy soloist in beethovens romance 
in f major for violin and orchestra robert irving conducted 
the evening began with a terrific presentation of interplay 
jerome robbins 1945 witty working of morton goulds music byers 
shone leading the section titled horseplay the finale was 
balanchines exhilarating stars and stripes 
the company is dancing through feb 26 at the new york state

congress has begun to weigh a new package of 
potential us arms sales to the arab world even as prospects for 
mideast peace talks remain cloudy 
the possible purchases under discussion with bush administration 
officials are bound to touch off a row with israels supporters 
saudi arabia for instance might get 315 abrams tanks probably the 
best in the world and the united arab emirates 40 jet fighters 
the list is far from final its only a wish list what the 
oilrich arab countries and other potential customers would like to 
buy reaction to the soundings that began last friday on capitol 
hill could force changes before the white house makes formal 
requests for approval 
in the meantime israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has 
unveiled a proposal to extend autonomy but not statehood to 
palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
the plan was rejected outright by the palestine liberation 
organization which is gaining diplomatic support in western europe 
and apparently sees no reason to compromise on its demand for a 
state carved out of israeliheld territory 
shamir also has not engendered any enthusiasm from the bush 
administration despite his offer to withdraw troops from some of the 
population centers on the west bank and in gaza once palestinians 
there accept autonomy the state department simply has had nothing 
to say about the offer 
in the camp david agreements 10 years ago the united states 
israel and egypt called for autonomy for the palestinians after 
five years of managing their own local affairs negotiations would 
be opened for a permanent arrangement all options including 
statehood would be on the table 
the idea was to see how living together would work but egypt was 
ostracized for approving something less than immediate statehood for 
the palestinians and the plan never got off the ground 
if the bush administration has another approach in mind it has 
not tipped its hand although secretary of state james a baker iii 
ruled out us support for an independent palestinian state at his 
senate confirmation hearing 
the classified arms list under discussion in capitol hill 
corridors and over lunches reflects a traditional us approach of 
trying to lubricate middle east diplomacy with weapons 
a copy obtained thursday by the associated press showed israel 
under consideration for 200 shoulderfired stinger missiles four 
helicopters and some new radar and equipment for its jet fighters 
the potential arab purchases have far more punch 
kuwait a wealthy arab state could receive 200 abrams tanks 
known also as the m1a1 and considered by experts to be the best in 
the world 
other key items include 40 maverick airtoground missiles with 
an infrared guidance system and electronic warfare gear for bahrain 
and 24 f16 jet fighters and 100 mavericks and 100 sidewinder 
airtoair missiles for morocco 
if bush follows through with specific requests he will have a 
battle on his hand israels supporters are concerned that arab 
weapons could be turned against the jewish state in a middle east 
conflict 
congress has the power to block a purchase but only if a 
majority of both the senate and the house reject a white house 
proposal 
charles e redman the state department spokesman declined to 
identify any of the weapons under consideration he stressed it was 
not a sale plan but rather the administrations best 
estimate of other countries weapons needs 
each item has to be reviewed by this administration redman 
said 
israels supporters were successful during the carter and reagan 
administration in blocking some us sales to both jordan and saudi 
arabia 
but the skillful management of baker then the white house chief 
of staff and other reagan administration operatives overcame 
stubborn resistance in 1981 to the sale of awacs radar planes to 
saudi arabia which the senate approved 5248 
the white house in a cover letter informed congress the saudis 
were in the process of deciding whether to request us or european 
fighter planes to replace their f5s in the next decade the sources 
said 
the letter said the saudis were considering jet fighters to be 
jointly produced by britain and west germany and the french mirage 
4000 as well as usbuilt f16s and f18s 
besides the abrams tanks on the list for the saudis were seven 
multiplelaunch artillery rocket systems for battlefield use and 
seven of the boxtype rockets for kuwait along with 1500 tow 
antitank missiles

jack kemp blunted lastminute ethical questions 
about his acceptance of speaking fees exceeding house limits to win 
unanimous senate confirmation as secretary of housing and urban 
development 
the senate voted unanimously to confirm kemp the former 
professional football player who served 18 years as a congressman 
from buffalo ny and unsuccessfully ran for the republican 
presidential nomination in 1988 
the vote followed by hours the senate banking housing and urban 
development committees vote to recommend kemps nomination to the 
full senate 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the housing and urban 
affairs subcommittee said democrats on the committee and the 
committees staff concluded that kemps acceptance of thousands of 
dollars in speaking fees above house limits was part of a 
misunderstanding and no bar to his confirmation 
there was no reason to do anything to embarrass him or to 
harass him to block him cranston said 
kemps financial disclosure reports show that in 1988 he accepted 
or agreed to accept 67350 above what house rules allow a member of 
congress to accept in one year the limit is 30 percent of salary 
or 26850 in addition kemp accepted honoraria far larger than the 
2000 per event limit 
when committee staff raised questions with kemp last week he 
agreed to return forgo or defer more than 67000 in speaking fees 
to bring his 1988 fees within house limits 
congressional and federal ethics officials said thursday 
however that it was unclear whether part of kemps remedy the 
deferral of 12500 in excess fees from 1988 to 1989 was permitted 
by house rules and federal law 
kemp declined to comment thursday on the matter said his 
spokeswoman mary brunette on wednesday he attributed the problems 
to a misunderstanding on his part of the limits 
cranston said there was ambiguity in the rules that led to 
uncertainty as to what one could or could not do 
at the federal office of government ethics deputy director 
donald e campbell said staff attorneys concluded they could not 
resolve the questions over kemps fees and the house rules 
we couldnt get anybody there at the congressional ethics 
committees that would give us any answers campbell said 
as a result the office of government ethics said in a letter to 
the senate committee that it was approving kemps finances within 
executive branch standards only 
house rules forbid members from deferring income from one year to 
the next to avoid the income limitation according to the ethics 
manual for house members senate banking committee staff director 
kevin gottlieb said he did not object to the deferral however 
because he did not believe honoraria were included in that 
prohibition 
john davison staff attorney for the house committee on standards 
of official conduct the ethics committee declined to say whether 
the committee or its staff had examined the kemp case saying such 
information was private he said the deferral question would be up 
to the committee but he added i would suggest caution in making 
an intentional deferral 
the senate ethics committee ruled on that question in a 1984 
case it said a member may not accept the offer of an 
organization to defer payment of an honorarium to a subsequent 
calender year in order to avoid the limitation on honoraria 
applicable for the year in which the honorarium is earned 
kemps move also raised the question of what his 1989 limit would 
be since he served only two days as a member of congress before 
resigning jan 2 the house rules say the limit is 30 percent of 
aggregate salary paid during that calender year which could mean 
30 percent of two days pay or about 150 
under that interpretation he would have to forgo the 12500 or 
give most of it to charity the rules allow members who receive more 
fees than are permitted in a year to reach the limit by donating the 
excess to charity 
asked whether kemp would exceed his 1989 limit by deferring the 
12500 davison said i will not interpret that for you but 
it says aggregate salary as a member paid in a calendar year 
kemp sought to comply with the rules this week by agreeing to 
return 16000 in speaking fees and to forgo another 39400 in fees 
earned but not yet received he deferred receipt of 12500 in fees 
earned in 1988 until 1989 a move that left him 550 under the 1988 
limit 
kemps spokeswoman brunette asked if kemp believed the deferral 
of the 12500 might still be improper she said she would relay 
that question but did not respond further

the senates rejection of a 51 percent

percent a day later 
the senates 955 vote thursday against the raise sent the two

controversy will be resolved said senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan i dont believe well know that for a matter of weeks or 
months 
the senate resolution included language to roll back the raise if 
it becomes law and end the system allowing congressional increases 
along with those for top federal executives and judges to become 
law automatically unless rejected by both houses 
the chief sponsors were republican sens larry pressler of south 
dakota and charles e grassley of iowa 
also approved by unanimous voice vote was a senate rules change 
that would ban senators from keeping fees for speeches articles and 
appearances but the ban on such fees typically paid by 
specialinterest groups would only remain in effect while senators 
were receiving the raise 
the senate action has strong political appeal to a public angry 
with the size of the raise but will have little practical effect 
under house speaker jim wrights plan to let the increase become law 
automatically next wednesday 
wright plans to use a risky parliamentary procedure that requires 
a twothirds majority to scale back the raise to 30 percent and to 
pass a house ban on speaking fees along with other outside income 
restrictions 
house democratic whip tony coelho dcalif said there was only 
a 5050 chance of getting the twothirds while rep tom tauke 
riowa and a leading pay raise opponent predicted it would be 
very difficult for the speaker to find twothirds to vote for the 
resolution 
rankandfile lawmakers would see their salaries rise from 
89500 to 135000 under the full raise but the pay would be 
116350 under wrights plan the same amount house members can now 
receive in salary plus honoraria defined as fees for speeches 
appearances and articles 
even if the wright plan passed the senate would be unlikely to 
go along since senators can now keep 35800 in honoraria and would 
therefore lose money by accepting a smaller 26850 raise while the 
two houses haggled the 51 percent raise would remain in effect 
along with the honoraria bans 
wright explained his rollback plan at a news conference thursday 
emphasizing the virtue of banning honoraria and taking that same 
amount in salary the difference is we will be serving one master 
not two that is the american people he said 
i dont like to articulate failure wright said when asked 
what will happen if his plan is defeated if for some reason it 
doesnt work we will regroup 
the house could try to pass the 30 percent raise by a majority 
like most legislation but opponents might be able to tack on 
language rescinding the raise altogether under the twothirds rule 
no amendments would be in order 
the house plan would scale back the raise for all three branches 
of government even though the constitution prohibits judges pay 
from being reduced 
i think the courts are likely to hold its unconstitutional to 
do this to the judiciary wright said 
wright released results of a survey showing 57 percent of house 
members opposing a pay raise vote before the tuesday midnight 
deadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce the raise 
to 30 percent 
wright said his proposed 26850 pay raise was a decent raise 
but not an exorbitant raise compared with the 45500 increase 
proposed by former president reagan and endorsed by president bush 
actually most house members would find their incomes 
substantially increased since fewer than half reach the current 
honoraria limit of 30 percent of income according to their 
financial disclosures 
the five senators who voted against the package to eliminate the 
currentlyproposed pay increase were christopher dodd dconn 
edward m kennedy dmass spark matsunaga dhawaii frank 
murkowski ralaska and ted stevens ralaska 
their votes do not necessarily mean they support the 51 percent 
raise 
the senate honoraria package would 
prohibit acceptance of honoraria but allow a donation to 
charity on the members behalf donations would be limited to 2000 
per appearance 
prohibit members from receiving any pension or tax benefit 
resulting from the charitable payments 
prohibit conversion of the charitable donations to personal use 
by a member or former member 
require the senate ethics committee to issue guidelines for 
travel expenses reimbursed by outside individuals or organizations

the american bar associations president says 
there are limits to how much secrecy the lawyers group will give up 
in evaluating nominees for the federal bench but hes willing to 
meet with senators about possible changes in procedure 
the issue of how the aba rates judicial candidates came up again 
thursday in the senate judiciary committee it first arose during 
consideration of unsuccessful supreme court nominees robert h bork 
and douglas h ginsburg and came to a head during hearings on 
anthony kennedy whose nomination was approved 
the supreme court is also considering two challenges to the abas 
confidential role in screening applicants 
it seems especially appropriate that we undertake this 
reevaluation before the committee faces another supreme court 
nomination rather than in the context of that operation which we 
started to do during the kennedy nomination sen charles e 
grassley riowa said thursday 
i believe that we must do it if we are to avoid a repeat of the 
very unsatisfying situation and the hard feelings arising out of the 
bork ginsburg kennedy series of hearings he said 
at best there is uniform discomfort with the way the aba 
proceeds said committee chairman joseph r biden jr reflecting 
the bipartisan nature of the criticism 
biden ddel said that he and ranking republican sen strom 
thurmond rsc will arrange to meet with top leaders of the aba 
and its standing committee on the federal judiciary to try to 
resolve the problems 
during the december 1987 hearings on kennedy some republicans 
called for the aba panel to hold its deliberations on judicial 
candidates in public since the senate gives great weight to its 
advice 
however panel chairman harold r tyler jr refused saying 
you are free to accept or reject our views you are free to ignore 
us 
during the bork hearings sen orrin g hatch rutah accused 
four members of the aba panel of being willing to play politics 
on the nomination while 10 of the 15 panel members gave bork the 
highest rating of well qualified four reportedly said he was 
unqualified and a fifth was said to have taken the neutral ground of 
not opposed 
aba president robert raven reached in denver where the aba is 
holding its midyear meeting said his organization would be happy 
to meet with the judiciary committee 
weve been working for them since 1948 and theyre our bosses 
so to speak raven said were always looking for ways to 
improve the system 
but he said there would be limits on how much secrecy the 
standing committee would give up saying some of that material would 
have to remain confidential due to possible repercussions against 
people who speak to the panel when asked about a judicial nominee 
that person practices in the area of the nominee noted 
raven with the san francisco law firm of morrison amp foerster if 
that person said something critical and the nominee became a judge 
it could cause problems for him 
tyler was not in his new york office on thursday and his 
secretary said he would be unavailable until next week 
the supreme court is considering a consolidated case of two 
challenges to the abas confidential role in screening federal 
judicial candidates a lower court judge ruled that imposing the 
federal advisory committee act which requires public scrutiny of 
advisory groups on judicial selection would violate the 
constitutional doctrine of separation of powers 
biden noted that the aba got involved in the evaluation process 
to keep the appointment of judges from being a political 
cesspool and to make it hard for a president or a senator to 
put a crony on the bench 
he asked committee members to give him comments and criticisms of 
the aba for discussion during his and thurmonds meeting with aba 
representatives 
following that meeting there may be an informal session with the 
entire judiciary committee and if necessary the committee would 
call a formal public hearing biden said

onesixth of americas 1988 measles patients 
came from los angeles county where an ongoing outbreak among mostly 
hispanic toddlers demonstrates a nationwide need to vaccinate 1 to 
4yearolds experts say 
we seem to have a toddler immunization gap said dr stephen 
waterman chief of acute communicable disease control for the county 
department of health services a lot of those kids dont get 
vaccinated until they go to school where measles shots are 
mandatory 
the extent of the outbreak of the viruscaused respiratory 
disease in los angeles county was reported by the national centers 
for disease control in todays issue of the agencys morbidity and 
mortality weekly report 
the county last year reported 513 measles cases 175 percent 
or more than onesixth of the nations total of 2933 the 
atlantabased cdc said two of the patients ages 8 months and 23 
months died 
waterman a coauthor of the cdc report said he didnt know how 
many measles cases occurred in the county so far this year but said 
the outbreak is continuing at a slower pace 
eight unvaccinated children of samoan descent were brought this 
week to two long beach hospitals where two of them died said ron 
yukelson spokesman for long beach memorial medical center waterman 
said he understood they belonged to a religious group opposed to 
vaccinations 
of the 1988 cases an ethnic group was identified for 331 of the 
los angeles county measles patients and 776 percent of them were 
hispanic age was known for 353 and of those 25 percent were 
younger than 1 while 40 percent were ages 1 to 4 the cdc report 
said 
the cdc considers 15 months to be the minimum age for 
vaccination and 26 percent fell in the 16monthold to 4yearold 
age group but the outbreak prompted watermans department last july 
to lower the minimum age for vaccination in los angeles county to 1 
year 
infants exposed to the measles in areas where the virus is 
endemic such as los angeles should be vaccinated at 6 months even 
though the vaccines effectiveness is questionable for children 
younger than 1 year waterman said 
officials in some counties recommend dual vaccinations at 9 
months and 15 months he added 
the cdc said lowering the minimum vaccination age is an important 
way to help control measles in infants 
the routine age for vaccination is 15 months but in most 
states where vaccinations are required for school youve got that 
4year period where they are not required to have measles 
immunization said dr paul stehrgreen a cdc measles specialist 
waterman said this immunization gap is worst among the lower 
socioeconomic status population and hispanics they just have 
variable access to health care some of them may be afraid to go to 
institutions because theyre undocumented aliens they may not be 
aware they can get the vaccinations for free with no questions 
asked 
the cdc recommended programs aimed at reaching parents and 
children in poor areas and use of churches schools and mobile vans 
as temporary vaccination sites 
in the late 1970s cdc measles specialists believed the childhood 
disease could be eradicated in the united states by fall 1982 that 
goal wasnt met in the past six years between 1497 and 6282 
cases have been reported nationally each year 
part of the problem is what researchers call nonpreventable 
cases patients too young for vaccinations to be effective and 
those who were vaccinated but still got measles since at best one 
in 20 vaccinations does not provide full immunity in los angeles 
county 58 percent of cases overall were considered nonpreventable 
the cdc said

the energy department said restarting the 
crippled savannah river nuclear reactors probably will take longer 
than previously forecast raising new concerns about supplies of a 
gas used in making atomic weapons 
richard starostecki the departments top safety official told a 
senate armed services subcommittee thursday it was not likely 
that even one of the three reactors would be restarted this year as 
planned all three have been shut down since last spring because of 
structural safety and managerial problems 
the subcommittee was reconvening today for a closed session on 
how long the reactors could remain shut down without harming 
national security among the scheduled witnesses were gen robert t 
herres vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and robert c 
duncan chairman of the pentagons nuclear weapons council 
i expect were going to get some unpleasant news sen jim 
exon dneb told thursdays session 
savannah river is the nations only source of tritium a 
perishable gas used in the production of most us nuclear weapons 
for weeks the energy department has said it expected to restart one 
reactor by the end of the year but starostecki indicated he could 
not be sure it would be operating even by january 1991 
a lot of things would have to happen very quickly and they are 
not happening starostecki said of preparations to meet the 
yearend 1989 target 
troy e wade iii the energy departments acting assistant 
secretary for defense programs told the subcommittee at least one 
of the reactors would have to be restarted by the end of the year to 
avoid a squeeze on supplies of tritium 
the exact level of current tritium supplies is classified 
it is our goal to resume operations this calendar year wade 
said adding im an optimist he later said a restart could be 
accomplished by october at best and that if new problems were 
encountered the target date could slip 
wade said in a written statement to the subcommittee that the 
effort to resume production of tritium is becoming critical 
because of the weapons requirements 
if a reactor is not restarted this year then the supply of 
tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear 
stockpile may be affected wade said 
asked how much confidence he held in the official goal of getting 
savannah river in shape to produce adequate supplies of tritium 
until a proposed new generation of reactors comes on line late in 
the 1990s wade said i wish my confidence were higher 
wade said that by march the department should be able to set a 
target date for restarting the k reactor by then a department 
safety advisory panel is expected to have completed its assessment 
of the criteria for restarting the reactor 
james s moore president of westinghouse savannah river co a 
subsidiary of westinghouse electric corp told the subcommittee 
that his companys own assessment of the safety technical and 
management problems at the plant will be done by march 
westinghouse is due to take over april 1 from ei du pont de 
nemours amp co as operator of the plant which is owned by the energy 
department and has been a key link in the nationwide network of 
nuclear weapons plants since the late 1940s 
some officials voiced doubts about westinghouses claim that it 
will improve safety and efficiency at savannah river by bringing in 
its own core management team while retaining more than 90 percent of 
the 11000strong du pont workforce there 
its going to be very difficult to make the level of changes 
necessary even if westinghouse expands its core savannah river 
management group to as many as 150 people said john ahearne 
chairman of an energy department advisory panel on safety

federal ethics officials say health and human 
services secretarydesignate louis sullivan appears to have no 
conflict of interest problems but an fbi investigation into his 
tenure as a medical school president continues 
an atlanta lawyer said thursday that his client a suspended 
fulton county ga commissioner convicted of extortion told the 
fbi that sullivan never tried to improperly influence him 
in a halfhour meeting with fbi agents earlier this week 
reginald eaves was asked about his relationship with sullivan 
president of the morehouse school of medicine in atlanta said the 
attorney charles r floyd jr 
morehouse paid eaves more than 34000 as a lecturer over four 
years while eaves used his seat on the county commission to promote 
measures that benefited the school published reports said eaves had 
lectured twice during the time he was paid by the school 
according to floyd eaves told agents that sullivan never 
sought to influence any of the decisions he had to make as a 
commissioner either as a result of his friendship or any other 
position he might have had with morehouse college 
the lawyer also said eaves told the fbi he had not negotiated his 
position with morehouse through sullivan directly and was unsure 
sullivan knew that he was being paid by the school as a lecturer 
sullivan and eaves were undergraduates together at morehouse 
college and their relationship has been primarily of a social 
nature floyd said 
the interview took place at a federal prison at maxwell air force 
base in montgomery ala where eaves is serving a sixyear sentence 
for extortion the lawyer said he is appealing his conviction 
on another front sullivan got a boost from the office of 
government ethics which is working on sullivans request for 
permission to maintain a relationship with the medical school he 
founded while at the same time he heads hhs the possibilities 
include a paid sabbatical 
don campbell deputy director of the office told the associated 
press that the office foresees no problems with that issue 
sullivans finances or any potential conflicts of interest between 
the new job and federal aid to morehouse which in fiscal 1988 
amounted to 58 million from hhs 
its simply a matter now of getting the forms written down 
because all the problems have been worked out campbell said 
the white house has cited the continuing fbi background check and 
the incomplete financial disclosure forms as reasons for asking 
congress to postpone sullivans confirmation hearing it had been 
scheduled for wednesday this week but the senate finance committee 
agreed to put if off indefinitely 
the fbi had no comment 
at morehouse the fbi has been asking school officials about 
sullivans connection to eaves who was found guilty last may of 
accepting 35000 from an undercover fbi agent in exchange for his 
vote on a zoning matter he was suspended from the commission when 
he was indicted in october 1987 
they talked to me about a range of issues about dr sullivans 
fitness for the position of hhs secretary including that eaves 
and many other things said dr james goodman executive vice 
president of the medical school 
he declined to identify the other issues 
one proposal eaves pushed as a commissioner was to increase 
morehouses participation at grady memorial hospital he wanted the 
county hospital authority to allow morehouse to provide more patient 
care at grady 
jw pinkston executive director of grady said that the fbi had 
contacted him and that other hospital administrators in the atlanta 
region have told him they also had been questioned by the fbi in a 
background check on sullivan 
he said the agents asked routine questions which were very 
appropriate

to a small caterpillar living in oak trees in 
the southwest the old saying you are what you eat is not just 
wise advice its the code of survival 
erick greene a researcher from the university of california at 
davis reports today in the journal science that the food eaten by 
the caterpillar nemoria arizonaria causes bodily changes allowing 
the insect to mimic the seasonal appearance of its oak tree home 
in effect the caterpillars hatched in spring eat their way into 
bright yellow and green outfits resembling a flower while fall 
caterpillars munch on leaves to assume the subdued graygreen 
appearance of a plain twig 
the survival strategy said greene probably developed as 
camouflage concealment from hungry birds 
both fall and spring caterpillars have identical genetic 
material said greene the spring brood and the fall brood look 
exactly the same when they hatch their later change depends 
entirely on what the caterpillar eats diet cues turn on or off the 
right set of genes so that they turn into the right shape at the 
right time of year 
caterpillars or larvae hatched in the spring come out and 
immediately begin feeding on the oak catkin or flower soon these 
caterpillars turn bright yellow with green dots and develop the 
fuzzy segmented shape that mimics the oak blossom 
after a few weeks the caterpillar turns into a pupa and later 
into an adult moth the adult quickly mates lays eggs and dies 
greene said 
the new eggs soon hatch and caterpillars identical to the spring 
brood appear but once this group start feeding there are quick 
changes 
greene said that by the time the fall brood appears the oak tree 
has lost its blossoms and has leaves the new caterpillars nibble on 
these leaves and soon develop a smooth graygreen body that 
resembles the oak twig powerful jaws capable of chewing the 
leathery oak leaves also appear 
oak leaves have a high content of a chemical compound called 
tannin greene said this compound apparently triggers the genetic 
response to create the fall caterpillars twiglike shape and color 
greene made his discovery by collecting eggs of the insect 
hatching them in the laboratory under controlled conditions and then 
feeding the caterpillars either oak flowers or oak leaves it 
proved he said that diet made the difference 
you could give me a spring or a fall caterpillar and i could 
turn it into either form depending on what i feed it he said 
if i fed the fall caterpillars spring pollen they would all turn 
into the catkin flower form it depends entirely on what the young 
caterpillars are eating 
i just caused a species name to go extinct greene said 
nemoria aemularia was the summer form he said now both 
forms are called nemoria arizonaria 
the california scientist normally studies birds and said in a 
telephone interview that he stumbled into his caterpillar 
discovery while gathering data on the diet of birds living near 
portal ariz 
i was finding lots of caterpillars and i had to raise them to 
produce an adult form that could be identified said greene 
while doing this i realized that something much more interesting 
was going on 
the caterpillars are just bitesized for birds said greene 
about half of each seasons caterpillar hatch is gobbled up he 
said and this may explain why the insect developed such a clever 
camouflage strategy 
birds are a major source of mortality for the caterpillars so 
being very well hidden can pay off greene said 
the nemoria arizonaria caterpillar lives in arizona mexico new 
mexico and parts of california the adult form is a brillant emerald 
moth with a oneinch wingspan greene said it is commonly seen at 
night on windows and screens in the southwest 
science which published greenes study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

minor accidents that would have caused no 
damage to a 1981 small car can bring a big repair bill for 1989 
models according to insurance industry tests 
the insurance institute for highway safety intentionally crashed 
19 new 1989 twodoor cars at 5 mph into two flat barriers once 
going forward and once backward and then bumped the front end of 
each car into an angle barrier and the back end into a post 
damage estimates calculated in january ranged from 3445 for an 
isuzu impulse to 434 for a geo spectrum 
identical tests on a new ford escort in 1981 caused no damage 
institute spokesman brian oneill said thursday 
a 1989 ford escort suffered no damage in the straighton barrier 
tests but the repair cost after the other two tests totaled 1481 
oneill said the lowspeed tests were conducted over the past 
month at test facilities in hartwood va using new cars purchased 
anonymously by the institute which is financed by the insurance 
industry 
the highest repair estimates were for the isuzu impulse the 
daihatsu charade at 3047 and the honda crx hf at 3040 the least 
damaged cars after the geo spectrum were the toyota corolla with 
495 in damage and the plymouth colt with 642 
prior to the 1983 model year federal law required that cars 
sustain no damage in 5 mph front and rear barrier tests for newer 
models the standard was lowered to 25 mph 
nine cars sustained no damage at all in the front and rear 
barrier tests in the 1989 study but all were damaged when nudged up 
against the angle barrier and pole 
ford motor co spokeswoman joyce stinson said the difference in 
damage to the escort is due to changes in the model that include a 
lightweight bumper to help ford meet federally imposed mileage 
standards lighter cars use less gas 
she said the pole and angle tests are very tough but ford has 
voluntarily built other models to comply with the pre1983 standard 
for straighton barrier crashes rather than the lessstringent 25 
mph standard 
a spokesman for isuzu dan mccue said the company had requested 
documentation on the testing and would not respond until it could 
study the material 
kurt antonius spokesman for american honda in los angeles said 
the crx hf model is designed for fuel economy with a lighter bumper 
but other honda models have stronger bumpers than last year 
the most important thing is that this is not related to auto 
safety he said the tests did not cover any injuries that might 
occur to driver or passengers in lowspeed crashes 
the institute said a basic 1989 honda crx model suffered 2061 
in damage compared with 2782 damage in a previous test on a 1988 
model of the same car 
this improvement is encouraging said oneill but there 
was still a lot of damage to the 89 and a very long way to go 
the fourth mostdamaged car a chrysler conquest tsi with a 
repair estimate totaling 2357 required a new front fender costing 
300 
oneill noted that the massproduced sheetmetal fender costs as 
much as a washing machine which comes complete with motor pump 
hoses and circuitry as well as the metal housing

agriculture secretarydesignate clayton yeutter 
says he let a tobacco company pay for an inaugural reception for him 
without thinking about whether it would be a conflict of interest 
yeutter told the senate agriculture committee on thursday that he 
was so busy wrapping up his work as us trade representative for 
president reagan and preparing to become agriculture secretary for 
president bush that it totally disappeared from my attention 
screen 
philip morris inc staged the reception jan 18 for yeutter 
saying it wanted to celebrate his appointment as agriculture 
secretary 
federal ethics rules forbid government officials from accepting 
anything of value from anyone who could be affected by the 
officials actions 
as trade representative yeutter aggressively promoted overseas 
sales of us tobacco products as agriculture secretary he would be 
responsible for policies directly affecting philip morris business 
interests 
the reception arrangement was reported thursday by the washington 
post and sen patrick leahy dvt questioned yeutter about the 
possible conflict of interest during a confirmation hearing 
when philip morris suggested that they would like to hold some 
kind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doing 
in the international trade arena i could see no conflict of 
interest problems in them doing so because i was fully intending to 
go back to the private sector said yeutter 
when the event was agreed to it simply did not ring any 
conflict of interest bells he said noting that it was held in 
the final hours of reagans term you are not going to be causing 
any conflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of an 
administration 
he said then bush asked him to be agriculture secretary after he 
had accepted philip morris invitation 
we probably should have reconsidered because of my expected 
continuation in government frankly i just didnt think about 
it he said 
yeutter was president of the chicago mercantile exchange from 
1978 to 1985 when he became trade representative 
asked about the current fbi investigation of alleged fraud in 
futures trading at the merc yeutter said he didnt know the probe 
was under way while he was its president the fbi began its 
undercover investigation of brokers in yeutters last year at the 
exchange 
some complaints surface almost every week of the year and they 
are brought before a disciplinary committee yeutter said most 
are fruitless some have validity and sanctions are applied upon 
those against whom charges are levied 
i was not aware this was a widespread problem he said i 
know no more than what is in the newspapers 
yeutter emphasized throughout the hearing the importance of 
holding down federal spending in agriculture and finding more 
foreign markets for american products 
we have to find ways to permit american farmers to earn income 
from the marketplace and depend less on the federal government he 
said we have had too high a reliance on government by farmers in 
this country 
yeutter also discussed the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade saying we are not about to abandon any import constraints 
in the united states unless there is quid pro quo in other 
countries giving us export opportunities its a horse trade 
on rural development he said the push and initiative should 
come from local areas we can help coordinate and provide technical 
assistance but he said the federal government does not have 
billions of dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify

the san jose police officers association 
has filed a lawsuit demanding that 500 officers be added to the 
police force in response to the recent deaths of two patrolmen in a 
shootout with a transient 
the association which represents 970 of san joses 1014member 
police force said the current level of 136 officers per 1000 
residents in san jose is inadequate to assure reasonable police and 
public safety and is far below the national average of 258 officers 
per 1000 
mayor tom mcenery called the associations demand for a 50 
percent increase spelled out in a lawsuit filed thursday 
fiscally impossible and unrealistic 
in making the demand which is estimated to cost 25 million 
annually the association is relying on a state labor code provision 
requiring employers to adopt reasonable safety standards for 
workers it may be the first such use of the provision 
with a total of 1500 officers the force would have about two 
officers per 1000 population more than 742000 people live in san 
jose 
the city council on thursday approved mcenerys request for 15 
more officers this spring as part of the midyear budget review the 
mayor said he plans to ask the council for an addition 40 to 50 
officers 
carm grande president of the association conceded the hiring of 
500 officers at one time is an impossible project and said the 
association was willing to negotiate a time period when that many 
officers could be added 
the lawsuit filed in superior court which names as defendants 
the city mcenery the city manager and the city council added fuel 
to a heated debate over police staffing and procedures since the 
jan 20 gun battle in which officers gene simpson and gordon silva 
were killed along with gunman dale randell connors simpson was shot 
with his own gun when connors a transient grabbed the weapon 
during a struggle 
in its suit the association also asked for two officers per 
patrol car but grande said he would drop that demand if the city 
agreed to hire 500 more officers 
mcenery dismissed the need for so many more police arguing that 
despite the recent shootings san jose is the safest big city in 
america 
an fbi report last july showed that san jose has only six violent 
crimes per 1000 population far below detroits 254 per thousand 
portlands 224 new yorks 204 chicagos 196 and los angeles 
191 
san jose also had the lowest homicide rate of californias 10 
largest cities in 1987 when it had 26 killings the city had 30 
killings in 1988 but already has 13 so far this year grande said 
grande said the officers chose to fight the city in court after 
getting nowhere in negotiations 
the mayor has indicated over the past years that he supports 
the police department but we see nothing forthcoming from his 
office grande said

nicaraguan president daniel ortega promised 
ortega also announced a central american summit would be held 
feb 1314 in el salvador 
the president said thursday night that his sandinista liberation 
front was still the largest party in nicaragua but said whoever 
wins the elections will assume power and cope with the most 
battered economy in the region 
if the opposition wins they will have to assume power and 
shoulder the responsibility of fixing the nicaraguan economy which 
wont be easy he told reporters at the end of a 2hour meeting 
with president oscar arias of costa rica

to remedy the ravaged nicaraguan economy which is reeling from 
inflation that reached 20000 percent in 1988 
under the nicaraguan constitution general elections must be held 
in november 1990 and ortega said he has already summoned 
political parties to present their candidates 
until now the sandinistas had refused to speak of handing over 
the power they have held since they led a popular uprising that 
toppled president anastasio somoza in 1979 
ortega conducted intense talks on the central american conflict 
with arias following the swearingin ceremony for venezuelas new 
president carlos andres perez

he was convinced that without a doubt we can reach satisfactory 
agreements about the thousands of nicaraugan rebels in honduras

the german mark 
the dollars overnight retreat in london and new york also 
tempted selling of the dollar yamasaki said 
bolstered by active stock purchases by foreign investors trading

an afghan guerrilla leader says 
president najibs regime will fold shortly after the soviet armys 
departure and guerrillas are making plans to secure the major 
cities without largescale attacks 
gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of the guerrilla group hezbiislami 
said the government will fall in weeks not months he addressed 
a news conference in peshawar a frontier city where a sevenparty 
guerrilla alliance has its headquarters 
neighboring pakistan and iran meanwhile urged the factions to 
end their squabbles and form a broadbased government in kabul when 
the soviet withdrawal is completed pakistan and iran support the 
guerrillas 
the soviet army is due to complete its withdrawal from 
afghanistan by feb 15 under a unbrokered accord signed last 
april 
hekmatyar said the insurgents were determined to avoid attacks on 
kabul the afghan capital and other cities that would endanger 
civilian lives more than 2 million people including many refugees 
have crammed into kabul 
the whole world will be witness to the fact that kabul will 
fall without any major onslaught on the city hekmatyar said 
abdul haq a senior military leader said field commanders will 
need plans for the administration of towns and cities that fall to 
them for bringing in food and keeping water and power systems 
operating 
before we knew only to attack the russians he said in an 
interview now we must secure the nation establish law and order 
feed the people stop looting or killing it is very difficult 
he said the kabul regime was preparing to defend itself and about 
5000 special troopers had returned from training in the soviet 
union in housetohouse fighting the government also is 
strengthening such elite formations as the presidential guard and 
secret police militia haq said 
afghanistans conscript army shows signs of collapse and is of 
little use for major operations he said adding that government 
forces generally are confined to cities and large towns leaving the 
countryside to the guerrillas 
haq said the guerrillas must find a way army units can surrender 
safely and without fear of reprisal so they will not be compelled to 
fight we should not make them fight for survival he said 
hekmatyar told the news conference there were arrangements for 
securing the fall of major cities without largescale attacks but 
gave no details other guerrilla groups said they were unaware of 
such plans 
most of the nations industry agriculture and public facilities 
have been destroyed by the civil war which began after a communist 
coup in april 1978 soviet soldiers intervened in december 1979 and 
an estimated 115000 were in afghanistan when the withdrawal began 
in may under a unmediated agreement 
members of the sevenparty alliance are trying to reach agreement 
on a provisional government but are deeply divided on sharing power 
and other important issues 
syed ahmed gailani head of the national islamic front of 
afghanistan told reporters thursday in islamabad efforts were under 
way to form an interim government he indicated there were problems 
but did not elaborate 
ali akbar velayati and sahabzada yaqub khan foreign ministers of 
iran and pakistan appealed for guerrilla unity after two days of 
meetings in islamabad that ended thursday pakistani diplomats said

president gen alfredo stroessner the 
western hemispheres longest ruling leader was placed under arrest 
early friday by the first army corps after it staged a rebellion a 
spokesman for the opposition claimed 
infantry divisions in three interior cities and an air force unit 
sided with rebels after shooting broke out late thursday and lasted 
more than six hours 
stroessner 76 is a prisoner and gen andres rodriguez 
is in complete control of the situation said the opposition 
political leader speaking on condition of anonymity 
the report on the detention of stroessner who has ruled since 
1954 could not immediately be confirmed 
the government issued no statement from the time gunfire began at 
a military base and tanks rumbled through this semitropical capital 
of 900000 firing on the headquarters of the police and 
presidential guard two planes flew low over the capital early 
friday but did not participate in the fighting 
there was no immediate word on casualties 
rodriguez commander of the powerful first army corps issued a 
statement but it did not mention specific goals or motivations nor 
did it specify whether he was acting against stroessner personally 
dear countrymen appreciated comrades of the armed forces we 
have left our barracks in defense of the dignity and the honor of 
the armed forces for the full and total unification of the ruling 
colorado party for the initiation of democratization in paraguay 
for the respect of human rights and for the defense of our roman 
catholic religion 
rodriguez paraguays no 2 military commander is identified 
with a faction within the ruling party that favors limited 
democratic reforms 
diplomats and political sources said earlier thursday that 
rodriguez for undetermined reasons apparently was ordered to give up 
his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister he 
refused 
his statement was broadcast repeatedly by radio primera de marzo 
one of two stations that stayed on the air 
residents quickly deserted downtown streets on a steamy summer 
night when firefights involving cannon recoilless rifles and heavy 
machine guns broke out in the most serious incident against 
stroessner since he took power 
the revolt by the armys largest and bestarmed corps appeared to 
catch stroessner the army commander by surprise 
rodriguez in his statement asked citizens to remain calm 
shooting was first heard at 945 pm 745 pm est in front of 
the first army corps base in loma pyta four miles to the north 
and continued early today 
some residents fled their homes and witnesses reported seeing 40 
to 50 tanks leave the base and rumble downtown where exchanges of 
gunfire continued past midnight 
were all keeping our heads down we can hear mortar rounds 
landing at the presidential escort battalion said a us 
diplomat the embassy and escort battalion are near one another on 
avenida mariscal lopez lined with fine homes and old mango trees 
the roman catholic station radio caritas reported early friday 
that heavy smoke could be seen from the quarters of the presidential 
guard later the station reported electricity was cut in its sector 
of town 
return home and pray that nothing worse happens the rev 
pastor cuquejo auxiliary archbishop of asuncion urged paraguayans 
in a radio address later the bells of the national cathedral 
tolled briefly in the traditional call for prayer 
the rebellion comes as stroessner is in ill health following 
surgery for a prostate operation five months ago 
the stocky vigorous general in recent months has worked fewer 
hours seen fewer people delegated more work to subordinates and 
looked pale and weak 
the revolt follows a festering dispute within the colorado party 
between a militant prostroessner faction and traditionalists who 
wanted to distance the 100yearold party from the unpopular 
authoritarian general 
domingo laino leader of the authentic radical liberal party the 
biggest opposition group said the fighting has something to do 
with rodriguez and sabino montonaro who is interior minister 
and president of the colorado party 
montonaro leads the partys militant faction which took over 
party leadership in a divisive national congress in august 1987 and 
since has purged its opponents from positions of power 
rodriguez is considered close to the traditionalist faction 
the military and the colorado party control nearly all facets of 
life in the californiasized nation of nearly 4 million between 
brazil bolivia and argentina 
stroessner toppled federico chaves in 1954 the last unrest in 
the military occurred in 1962 when a cadet was slain outside the 
capital

shooting of a black motorcyclist by a policeman

an autopsy was being performed to substantiate the cause of death 
we wanted to dispel any rumors we beat a man to death said 
police chief austin mclane

25caliber derringer in his pockets said police spokesman steve 
cole

to 75 youths believed involved in wednesdays unrest among the nine 
people arrested were four members of the african peoples socialist 
party from st petersburg

us experts were en route today to 
antarctica to clean an oil spill that threatens the delicate 
ecosystem but an environmentalist said only a few weeks remain 
before the areas frigid waters begin to freeze 
a giant c5 cargo plane flew the crew and 52 tons of cleanup gear 
to the southern port of punta arenas on thursday the crew was to 
board on a us research ship departing today for the spill about 
590 miles south of the cape horn 
anton inderbitzen head of antarctic staff for the 
washingtonbased national science foundation said the vessel polar 
duke would take about four days to reach the spill just off the 
antarctic peninsula and about two miles from the us scientific 
base palmer station 
however a greenpeace spokesman cautioned that less than two 
months remain to contain the damage 
they cant hang around too long said peter wilkinson from 
the greenpeace ship gondwana in antarctic waters by mid to 
lateapril the ice will start to freeze over 
any ship thats underwater in antarctica with that amount of 
fuel poses a big problem he said in a radio telephone interview 
to sydney australia 
the environmental group is calling for an international effort to 
contain damage caused by the sinking tuesday of an argentine navy 
vessel that according to the national science foundation was 
carrying 250000 gallons of diesel fuel 
in a stop in santiago on thursday inderbitzen told reporters the 
crew would focus efforts on saving baby penguins in the polluted 
area 
all the young penguins are just about at the age where they 
take their first swim he said when these birds enter the water 
for the first time it could be the last time 
the 9300ton paradise bay was leaking fuel oil at an 
undetermined rate and hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of 
compressed gas had slipped from its decks the foundation said 
a spokesman for the argentine ministry of defense said thursday 
there really wasnt a significant spill 
an argentine navy statement said an icebreaker was to arrive at 
the scene today to assess the best ways available to combat the 
pollution 
some environmental experts and scientific groups have said 
hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked from the ship and created a slick 
up to 16 miles long but the chilean navy said the reports appeared 
exaggerated 
the information that we have is that there is no big spill 
said a navy snnel at palmer station were 
gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around 
the grounded ship 
the latest we have now is that theres probably 150 to 200 
barrels in the water renirie said in a telephone interview from 
santiago and theres still oil coming out of the ship 
inderbitzen said the science foundation which organized the 
cleanup mission and directs all us activities in antarctica 
feared lasting environmental damage 
some dead penguins had already been sighted and the slick had 
caused isolated schools of krill a shrimplike animal to surface 
renirie said 
inderbitzen said antarcticas unspoiled environment requires 
special measures to contain the spill which is near two areas set 
aside for scientific study under terms of the antarctic treaty 
in warm weather its easier for plants and even animals to 
recover from an accident he said but in antarctica it takes 
plants and animals many many years to recover because of the cold 
its a very very fragile environment 
the crew has a 35foot skimming boat for scooping up spilled 
oil and pumping it into floating tanks and a small tugboat and 
inflatable booms to contain drifting oil 
the cleanup work will be peformed by marine pollution control 
co under contract to the us navy renirie said

if and when the afghan insurgents slip 
out of the mountains and attempt to take this capital city the 
governments last line of defense will be a politically select and 
specially trained elite guard 
but like much else in kabul the most important questions about 
the guard how motivated wellequipped and trained it is have no 
certain answers 
as artillery fire greeted one of the final soviet convoys to move 
up the salang highway toward the soviet border thursday soldiers of 
the kabul special guard were training at a former soviet military 
base in the center of the city 
some soldiers lay sprawled on the ground as drills were conducted 
on a paved square 
many troops smiled at western reporters or at each other as about 
50 staged a drill of mounting six armored cars directly behind them 
the uniforms did not match some of those taking part in the 
drill by the armored cars were dressed in brown uniforms while 
others wore khakicolored padded jackets 
males and females as young as 17 or as old as 45 can volunteer 
for the force but some of the soldiers looked younger and others 
much older 
maj gen mohammed asin the groups chief political officer 
told reporters we will defend the city if necessary 
after the withdrawal of the soviet soldiers we will be able to 
defend the country said the general who was dressed in fresh 
camouflage gear and shiny brown leather loafers 
if the resistance wants to impose war on us there will be a 
reaction he said 
soviet troops are due to be out of afghanistan by feb 15 under 
the terms of a unbrokered agreement signed last april 
western observers have said the afghan government force suffers 
from high defections and low morale and is illprepared to fight 
the us and pakistanbacked rebels 
if the rebels are able to close in on this dusty capital in the 
weeks after the soviet withdrawal is completed it is not certan 
whether they will try to slowly squeeze the city into submission or 
try to take it with an allout assault 
in any case it is the special guards task to defend the capital 
the guard was formed several months ago on orders of the office 
of president najib whose prosoviet government is being pressed by 
the rebels as the soviet soldiers leave 
sources in kabul have said the original units of the special 
guard were formed from the best of afghan military units but that 
recent additions to the force have consisted primarily of raw 
recruits 
asin said the force still is gaining members and eventually will 
number more than 10000 troops 
the troops receive training in artillery tactics and other 
military specialties as well as infantry training officers said 
the majority are members of najibs peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan its youth organization or affiliates asin said the 
rest he described as afghan patriots 
one of the duties of the special guard is to protect the 
president himself 
the 42yearold general did not say how much soldiers are paid in 
the special guard but denied money was a factor in attracting 
soldiers 
the military base in kabul serves as a reminder of afghanistans 
long history of struggle involving foreign powers 
an obelisk built at the camp pays tribute to the soviet soldiers 
who have fought in afghanistan 
and high on a hill overlooking the base stands the ruins of an 
ancient stone fort where the afghans say hundreds of british 
soldiers died in 1878 during a britishafghan war 
members of the special guard already have been involved in 
combat asin said one man was wounded in heavy fighting along the 
salang highway north of kabul last week the highway is the only 
ground route for the departing soviet troops and afghan and soviet 
forces have been fighting to keep it open

unveiling and concert in beaumont today on the 30th anniversary of 
their deaths 
this is really an honor said maria elena holly hollys 
widow i have no words to express it is very touching he would 
be so proud he would be crying to be in such good company 
theres no way i can express said bob morales of 
watsonville calif valens brother hed love it its the most 
beautiful thing he could see 
the musicians were killed on feb 3 1959 when their small plane 
crashed in bad weather near clear lake iowa en route to a concert 
date in fargo nd 
at the time holly was a giant on the fledgling rocknroll scene 
and his death became known as the day the music died valens was 
a budding star famous for his hit la bamba 
richardson who was from beaumont was known as the big 
bopper and recently had earned a gold record for his hit song 
chantilly lace 
he was my hero said john palmer a port arthur businessman

clark for the citys historical society which began its sculpture 
collection last year with clarks portait of rock queen janis 
joplin a port arthur native who died in 1970 
clark said he worked from videotapes of richardson and holly and 
from photos of valens his pose of the three with the boppers 
arms around valens and holly is intended to show the trio as if 
they were standing for a picture just before boarding the fateful 
flight to fargo 
i dont know that there really is such a picture clark said 
but i could just imagine someone getting one last shot before they 
got on the airplane 
a second sculpture of richardson alone shows the wideeyed 
grinning singer with a guitar at his waist and his arms wide open 
proceeds from todays event will go toward the purchase of a 
50000 building for a port arthur museum that would include rock 
n roll memorabilia 
until the museum is built the sculptures will stand in a local 
library

a bovine version of the 
peanutbutterandjelly sandwich may help keep hay from spoiling and 
make it more nutritious and delicious for cattle 
researchers at southern illinois university in carbondale are 
spreading a substance that resembles peanut butter onto bales of hay 
to see if it shields the hay from rain and snow and reduces spoiling 
they also may add flavorings to the protective paste to make it 
more appealing to livestock and nutrients to make it more healthful 
said robert wolff a professor of agricultural mechanization at the 
school 
the product called balebutter because it resembles peanut 
butter consists of soybean oil and minerals 
not only does it have the capacity to cut down on hay loss but 
it also utilizes agricultural products wolff said recently we 
need to find new uses for soybeans 
wolff said a farmer dale halford developed balebutter and 
brought it to the university for evaluation 
were still investigating said wolff we dont know yet if 
it has fantastic potential or it doesnt

president carlos andres perez used his 
inauguration ceremony to appeal to latin american leaders to form a 
united front on the 410 billion they owe foreign creditors 
perez who took office thursday will host todays meeting on the 
regions debt crisis with the presidents of brazil colombia peru 
and uruguay and foreignministers of argentina and mexico 
they are expected to consider a proposal to hold a conference 
between the latin debtor nations and seven major creditor countries 
britain canada france italy japan the united states and west 
germany 
the officials attended the swearingin ceremony in which perez 
blamed what he called latin americas vicious cycle of debt and 
economic stagnation on debt payments that consume most of the 
regions resources 
he also said that improved relations between the united states 
and latin america would have to include discussions on the 410 
billion regional debt and peace in central america 
vice president dan quayle also in caracas for the inauguration 
called the proposal a nonstarter 
quayle discussed the issue with latin american leaders including 
brazils president jose sarney whose country heads the list of 
debtor nations with 114 billion next on the debtor list is mexico 
followed by argentina 
sarney told quayle he favored treating the debt as a 
political issue meaning it should be dealt with on a 
governmenttogovernment basis 
quayle said he would relay the demands to president bush but 
that he did not expect major shifts in the us position 
president felipe gonzalez of spain called the idea unrealistic 
on thursday president daniel ortega of nicaragua announced five 
central american presidents agreed to meet in el salvador feb 1314 
for talks on regional peace 
among issues to be discussed would be democratic reforms in 
nicaragua according to ortega 
the central american presidents agreed in august 1987 to a plan 
for ceasefires in el salvador guatemala and nicaragua

first there were the whales trapped in an 
icebound sea as rednosed reporters from around the world shivered 
in wait then things really got cold again chilling alaskas 
efforts to warm its frosty image 
mark rhoads a public relations consultant in washington dc 
said he was watching television this week when he noticed some 
startling mixed messages about alaska 
the weather report had just been on and they were reporting 
these ghastly temperatures in alaska rhoads recalled thursday 
the very next thing after the weather report was a commercial to 
promote tourism in alaska 
the commercial rhoads saw features a southern governor enjoying a 
sunny barbecue along a scenic alaska bay theres blue sky lush 
forest and not a hint of snow or ice the governor has been away 
from his home state a bit too long and when his parkaclad aides 
track him down he jokes that theyre a little bit overdressed 
theyre clever commercials but they were just out of sync that 
particular day rhoads said 
thats the attitude state officials hope potential tourists adopt 
as they plan their summer vacations they say they dont believe the 
publicity will lead to fewer tourists visiting the nations largest 
state which bills itself as the last frontier 
weather stories come along all the time they have a passing 
effect on peoples thinking said hugh gellert director of the 
state tourism division 
but the past several months have focused an unusual amount of 
national attention on alaska all of it having to do with ice 
before the record cold wave there was the effort last fall to 
save the trapped whales near barrow telecasts of shivering 
reporters on the windy and frozen arctic tundra did nothing to warm 
the hearts of alaskas tourism officials 
rod bradley president of the anchorage advertising firm that 
handles the states tourism ad campaign said those scenes reinforce 
a negative image of alaska among residents in the lower 48 states 
they still think we live in igloos and drive dog teams theres 
an ingrained bias there bradley said were the most 
misunderstood state in the union theres no doubt about it 
alaska will spend about 76 million on tourism promotion this 
year of that 25 million is being spent on the television ads in 
major urban markets and on cable 
the ad campaign is part of a longterm effort to change alaskas 
image it is based on extensive research showing many potential 
tourists dont come to alaska because they think its too cold 
the intent of those ads is not to say its not cold ever in 
alaska but to say this is not a yearround land of ice and snow we 
have some parts of the year when its warm sunny and all the nice 
colors come out gellert said 
bob miller director of the alaska tourism marketing council 
says the commercials are under review and the weather strategy 
may be replaced next year he says the icy publicity may actually 
draw tourists 
in many cases in enhances peoples interest in coming in the 
summer miller said 
he may be right seattlebased holland america lines westours 
the largest cruise ship company serving alaska reports heavy 
bookings in recent weeks for summer cruises to alaska 
company spokesman rick skinner said thats because those buying 
alaska cruises know what to expect 
theyve looked at the literature to make sure they know what to 
wear and that sort of thing skinner said they tend to be 
welleducated and much more erudite than the typical caribbean 
cruiser would be

a man dismissed as coach of his 
daughters basketball team after officials discovered he has aids 
won a reprieve while the school board decides whether he poses a 
public health threat 
allen ward who works as the volunteer coach of his daughters 
intramural team at laurel elementary school was dismissed last week 
after only one game he was reinstated temporarily thursday 
in firing ward administrators cited a new aids policy requiring 
school employees suspected of carrying the acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome virus to be tested and their cases reviewed by a 
committee of health and school officials 
don jobe superintendent of franklin county community schools 
said at a news conference thursday that ward would be allowed to 
continue coaching pending a decision by the school board whether his 
condition is a public health threat 
but jobe said he doesnt think wards condition constitutes an 
immediate health threat 
he said he made the decision to reinstate ward after speaking 
with the coachs physician the franklin county health officer and 
officials at the state board of health 
the school board was awaiting written confirmation of wards 
condition from his physician in indianapolis jobe said a final 
decision on whether ward can stay on indefinitely is expected in 
about two weeks he said 
ward was diagnosed as having aids last june while undergoing a 
blood test in indianapolis he contracted the deadly disease from 
tainted blood products used during open heart surgery in 1984 
the parents of some of wards players were upset he was suspended 
everybody is afraid of aids but i dont think breeding 
stupidity into our children will make it go away said dora cable 
of metamora whose 10yearold son is on wards team 
its been blown out of proportion added pam gerrain whose 
sixthgrade child is on the team i dont see anything wrong with 
him coaching the team im not worried about it but theres always 
a chance i guess 
ward who launched a petition drive to be reinstated said he was 
happy to go back to work i really feel good about it i believe 
their decision will come out in my favor 
he said he was concerned that school officials fearing he would 
transmit aids to others would bar him from the school and would 
insist on testing his children dande 10 and christopher 14 for 
the aids virus 
the disease which attacks the bodys immune system is 
transmitted primarily through bodily fluids such as during sexual 
contact intravenous drug use and blood transfusions but not 
through casual contact 
ward had volunteered to coach the team of fourth fifth and 
sixthgraders when his daughter decided to play at the school 60 
miles southeast of indianapolis 
his wife theresa offered to substitute as coach while her 
husbands case was pending but was told that she too would have to 
undergo an aids test 
i have no physical contact with them team members at all 
ward said i might throw a basketball to them but if theyre 
going to get it that way were all in trouble 
a similar argument was made after school authorities in howard 
county barred ryan white from his classes in 1985 because he has 
aids ryan eventually won the legal right to return to classes but 
his family soon moved to cicero in hamilton county

space shuttle discovery was moved out 
of its hangar today on its way to a launch pad where technicians 
hope to replace three engine turbopumps in time for a midmarch 
liftoff 
the earliest possible launch date is march 10 if the shuttle 
cant be launched by march 18 discovery would be pulled back to a 
hangar yielding the pad to atlantis whose crew is to dispatch the 
magellan probe to venus after a liftoff scheduled for april 28 
atlantis planetary payload has priority over discoverys 
communications satellite because after may 23 venus will not be in 
the proper alignment with earth again until 1991 
we are under pressure but in this case its good pressure 
because it will just make us be sure that we pay attention to all 
the details in that we know we have a point to meet but we know we 
can make it said bk davis nasas shuttle engine manager at the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
i think were in good shape rear adm richard truly nasas 
associate administator for space flight said thursday at a houston 
awards ceremony discovery will fly sometime in the middle of 
march 
perched vertically on a giant tracked transporter discovery 
moved out of an assembly building into the darkness at 6 am to 
begin a fourmile trip that was expected to take six to seven hours 
the transporter called a crawler traveled at a maximum speed of 1 
mph 
shuttle managers who had been debating for several days what to 
do about discoverys suspect turbopumps decided wednesday to 
replace all three of them on the launch pad in conjunction with 
other work they also postponed the launch from late february to 
midmarch 
the problem stems from an atlantis flight in december a 
postflight inspection of the shuttles engines disclosed two tiny 
cracks in a bearing housing in one of three highspeed turbopumps 
that convert liquid oxygen to a gas 
engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion 
resulting from moisture trapped inside the housing during the 
manufacturing process because two of discoverys turbopumps 
underwent the same processing nasa decided to replace all three 
pumps with new carefullyinspected units 
the pumps are a critical component because the shuttle could 
explode if one failed during liftoff 
in the past turbopumps have been replaced while a shuttle was 
horizontal in a checkout building but discovery is now in a 
vertical position and without previous experience there is an 
uncertainty about how long the replacement will take the new pumps 
are scheduled to arrive here the week of feb 12 
discovery will be commanded by astronaut michael coats with him 
will be john blaha james buchli bob springer and james bagian 
during five days in space they are to release a communications 
satellite and conduct science and medical experiments

a state lawmaker has proposed that 
12yearolds be allowed to vote in state elections saying arguments 
against her bill are the same ones once used by opponents of voting 
rights for women and blacks 
its kind of an adult supremacist attitude state rep 
phyllis kahn said thursday as she introduced her bill calling for a 
constitutional amendment to be placed on the state ballot for the 
1990 general election 
do i think its going to be instantly agreed upon and pass 
no said kahn a member of the democratic farmer labor party from 
minneapolis i think its a concept that people have to think 
about 
it didnt take much thinking for some legislators like rep 
bernie omann an independentrepublican from st joseph to dismiss 
the idea dubbed the kiddie vote bill 
is this a joke they play a lot of jokes around here said 
omann a freshman representative who is the legislatures youngest 
member at age 24 
pondering the possibilities omann asked what does that mean 
for politicians shaking hands in elementary schools 
the bill wasnt taken as a joke by secretary of state joan growe 
who oversees state elections the proposal accomplishes more than 
raising the argument of who should be able to vote she said 
i also believe it is really a very dramatic way of calling 
attention to the fact that those who cant vote truly have no 
power growe said 
kahn who holds a doctorate in biophysics from yale and a 
masters degree from harvard acknowledged that she and the bills 
senate author donna peterson did have much more in mind than 
childrens suffrage 
i think that giving children the right to vote is an essential 
part of giving them additional political benefits this route is 
just a little less paternalistic she said 
kahn said there is nothing in the us constitution that would 
prohibit lowering the voting age since constitutional language only 
prohibits the denial of voting rights to those 18 or older 
about whether most children under 18 are mature enough to cast a 
vote kahn said the alternative is just because someone is 18 
doesnt mean theyre mature enough to vote

president lee tenghui today signed a law 
that will give large bonuses to lawmakers elected in china 42 years 
ago who voluntarily retire but officials said many of the aging 
politicians refuse to step down 
a statement said the bill part of the ruling nationalist partys 
plan to increase the clout of native taiwanese in the government 
will take effect monday 
the nationalist government which fled to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to communist forces on the mainland still claims 
to be the rightful ruler of all china 
the elderly lawmakers most of them nationalists have been 
frozen in office until they can return to their mainland 
constituencies for new elections 
chang chun a 100yearold presidential adviser signed up today 
to retire from the 880seat national assembly to support the 
government reform assembly secretary gen irwine ho said 
chang the oldest assemblyman will receive a onetime payment of 
about 143000 or more than five times his annual salary for 
stepping down 
ho told reporters only about 100 elderly members of the assembly 
an electoral college that meets every six years to choose the 
president are expected to retire this year approximately 700 more 
aging assemblymen will wait to consider retirement until after the 
next presidential election in may 1990 he said 
meanwhile officials of the 297seat legislative yuan said about 
70 of the bodys 200 elderly members are expected to retire this 
year many others refuse to step down because they believe they 
still represent their mainland constituents the officials said 
the opposition party democratic progressive party has attacked 
the retirement bill for failing to restrict pension payments to 
lawmakers who resign this year but the nationalist party rejected 
the demand to avoid outraging the elderly legislators 
lawmakers elected on taiwan now account for 73 seats in the 
297seat legislative yuan and 106 seats in the 880seat national 
assembly most other members were elected on the chinese mainland 
legislation has yet to be introduced to increase the number of 
taiwans elected members in the two parliamentary bodies 
the nationalist party proposed last week to increase the number 
of elected legislative yuan lawmakers to 130 for the december 
election under the plan taiwanelected lawmakers would rise to 150 
by 1992 when all elderly lawmakers are expected to have retired

palestinian teenagers from arab east jerusalem 
are routinely held for weeks without bail on charges of throwing 
stones or erecting roadblocks an israeli lawyer said today 
in other cases palestinian children under 13 whom the law does 
not consider legally responsible for their acts are held for days 
because their parents cant pay bail said attorney shlomo lecker 
lecker said an 11yearold and two 13yearolds were detained for 
five days each in a cell at jerusalem police headquarters because 
their parents could not come up with 415 bail 
they are held eight to a cell and its dark lecker said 
adding that his young clients have complained of being slapped in 
the face and kicked in the legs during interrogation 
dorit beinish a state attorney in the justice ministry defended 
the practice as legal 
we have many cases of stonethrowing by minors this is a new 
crime part of the uprising and punishments are more severe she 
said in an interview 
ms beinish said she did not recall a case in which a youth was 
held without bail and later acquitted 
ms beinish also said she did not know of palestinians under 13 
being held if this happened it was a mistake she said 
police spokeswoman nurit buton said she would investigate 
leckers allegations that children under 13 have been held 
asked about the charges of mistreatment during interrogation she 
said each complaint was investigated by a special police unit we 
have many complaints that have no basis at all while in some cases 
there may be something to it she said 
nine leftwing israeli legislators have written a letter to 
justice minister dan meridor asking that the practice of holding 
minors be stopped 
standards from the west bank are coming to israel said dedi 
zucker a legislator from the citizens rights movement he spoke in

ruled that minors those between the ages of 14 and 18 can be 
held without bail until the start of trial if they are charged with 
throwing stones 
on thursday israeli troops shot and killed a 16yearold 
palestinian in clashes near the west bank villages of fahme and kfar

the no 2 army commander seized power 
today in a coup the official radio said ousted president alfredo 
stroessner the longest ruling leader in the western hemisphere 
gen andres rodriguez the secondincommand of the army and a 
close associate of gen stroessner said in a radio broadcast that 
paraguays commanderinchief for 34 years had surrendered 
the announcement came after hours of gunfights and cannon fire in 
the capitals streets thursday night between rebel soldiers backed 
by tanks and mortars and forces loyal to stoessner 
there was no official word on casualties but residents who 
ventured out this morning saw bloodstains on the pavement 
the countrys borders were closed 
the police headquarters was pockmarked with bullets from small 
arms fire and metal shredded by the bullets hung from the modern 
national telephone building behind the police station 
order has been reestablished and with it all the human values 
of our entire constitution will be respected said rodriguez who 
is fatherinlaw to stroessners youngest son alfredo 
i communicate to you that gen stroessner has surrendered and 
finds himself in perfect health deprived of liberty being shown 
all human rights at a residence within the first army corps he 
said in the broadcast 
rodriguez said he was taking command of the country from this 
moment 
diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup that 
rodriguez for undetermined reasons apparently was ordered to give up 
his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister he 
refused 
the rebellion also followed a dispute within the ruling colorado 
party between a militant prostroessner faction and traditionalists 
who wanted to distance the 100yearold party from the authoritarian 
general 
in washington a senior us official said the united states was 
monitoring the situation we dont like violence of course and 
we hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy 
stroessner 76 has been the absolute ruler of this landlocked 
south american country since 1954 he was army commanderinchief 
doled out political favors and jobs to his allies and called anyone 
who opposed him a marxist subversive he frequently exiled political 
opponents 
however stroessner a staunch us ally has been in poor health 
following prostate surgery five months ago 
in an earlier radio communique rodriguez said he and his men 
left our barracks in defense of the dignity and the honor of the 
armed forces for the full and total unification of the ruling 
colorado party for the initiation of democratization in paraguay 
and for the respect of human rights 
early today radio reports quoted an infantry division commander 
brig gen ismael otazu as saying the uprising was not 
insubordination but a correction col dionisio cabello told 
march 1 radio he was the new air force commander and pledged 
allegiance to rodriguez 
infantry divisions in three interior cities villarrica san 
juan bautista and concepcion and an air force unit sided almost 
immediately with the rebels the reports indicated 
soldiers today blocked the street in front of the national palace 
near the central business district of this capital city of 900000 
the palace did not look like it sustained damage but residents saw 
bloodstains on nearby streets 
were happy the government is gone but were sad that people 
had to die said one woman who added that the shelling and small 
arms fire had forced her to spend thursday night in a restaurant 
spokesman for the national accord a coalition of business 
church and political leaders who have called for democratic reforms 
said a transitional military junta may be named today to govern 
until general elections are held they spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
rodriguez who did not mention a transitional junta or elections 
is identified with a faction within the colorado party that favors 
limited democratic reforms 
the uprising began late thursday when the nations largest 
military unit the first army corps fired at the headquarters of 
the police and presidential guard in shooting that lasted until dawn 
residents of asuncion quickly deserted the streets when the 
firefights involving cannon recoilless rifles and heavy machine 
guns broke out 
witnesses reported seeing 40 to 50 tanks rumble downtown 
were all keeping our heads down we can hear mortar rounds 
landing at the presidential escort battalion a us diplomat 
said the embassy is located between the battalion and stroessners 
official residence 
domingo laino leader of the opposition authentic radical liberal 
party said it has something to do with rodriguez and sabino 
montonaro who is the interior minister and president of the 
colorado party 
montonaro leads the militant faction which took over party 
leadership in august 1987 and since has purged its opponents from 
positions of power 
the military and the colorado party control nearly all facets of 
life in the californiasized nation of nearly 4 million between 
brazil bolivia and argentina although closely allied with the 
united states stroessner was criticized for human rights abuses by 
the reagan administration in 1986 
stroessner toppled president federico chavez in 1954

south korea and north korea have held 
secret negotiations recently on improving relations and discussed 
the possibility of a meeting between their leaders newspaper 
reports said today 
the reports come two days after the announcement of an 
unprecedented trade agreement involving north korea and the south 
korean conglomerate hyndai the seoul government said today the 
agreement may pave the way toward national unification after 44 
years of bitter rivalry 
local newspapers quoted an unidentified government source as 
saying the secret talks were held overseas and covered most major 
issues between the countries 
the most recent talks the newspapers said were in singapore 
last week between park chulun a special secretary to south korean 
president roh taewoo and an unidentified senior north korean 
official 
during his stay in singapore from jan 24 to jan 30 park met 
with his north korean partner several times and discussed major 
pending issues including a proposed summit between the two koreas 
the reports said 
the newspapers quoted the government source as saying the summit 
could take place by the end of this year 
last month roh renewed a proposal that he and north korean 
leader kim il sung meet to discuss the future of the korean 
peninsula which has been divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south since 1945 
the reported secret talks coincided with the historic visit to 
north korea by a leading south korean industrialist to discuss 
direct investment and joint venture projects 
chung juyung founder and honorary chairman of the giant hyundai 
group was in north korea from jan 23 to feb 1 as a guest of the 
government 
he announced thursday he had agreed with north korean officials 
to undertake several joint venture projects in that country 
including a shipyard a railroad plant and development of a tourist 
resort 
newspapers quoted unidentified government officials as saying 
tours would be available later this year to the planned resort area 
a rugged scenic region 20 miles north of the eastern boundary of the 
zone separating the koreas 
the seoul government said it would propose special legislation to 
facilitate the projects 
in a statement today the government said it in principle takes 
a favorable view of the proposed projects regarding them as 
possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve 
national unification 
chung was believed to be the first south korean business leader 
approved by both governments to visit the north korean capital of 
pyongyang since the division of the peninsula 
north koreas participation in the deal is seen as an attempt to 
revive its sagging economy the north reportedly owes about 5 
billion to east bloc and western nations 
figures published today and attributed to the south korean 
government showed north korea with a trade deficit of 720 million 
in 1987 exports were listed at 167 billion and imports at 239 
billion 
the agreement in the form of a protocol was signed by chung and 
choe su gil director of north koreas taesong bank and consultant 
to the staterun korean association of the promotion of asian trade 
officials requesting anonymity also said the government had 
ordered a special study of the security problems involved in trade 
and personnel exchanges with the north 
under south korean law contact with north korea is a violation 
of national security the two nations are technically still at war 
since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the threeyear korean 
war in 1953 each claims to be the sole legitimate government of 
korea

the fast track at hughes aircraft was too much 
for ed greer but life in the slow lane did not hold the appeal 
fantasized by his former colleagues when the young executive left 
without a trace in 1981 
the man who had become a cult figure to corporate daydreamers was 
tracked down by fbi agents last october in houston masquerading 
under the name of kenneth roy hearn and working quietly at a small 
oil exploration firm 
i hurt a lot of people my parents my exwife and my kids 
greer 40 said in an interview with the los angeles times this 
week i really regret doing this if i had to do it over again i 
would do it differently 
he vanished on sept 10 1981 leaving behind his engineering 
job his parents his wife and two kids and taking a flight to ft 
lauderdale fla before he left he told a coworker never become 
too good at something you hate theyll make you do it the rest of 
your life 
after he left his former colleagues some of whom said they 
wished they had the courage to do the same began throwing annual 
parties often showing up at them wearing ed greer masks 
no one from his past saw or heard from him again until fbi 
agents trying to learn why someone in texas was using the name of 
kenneth roy hearn of alabama tracked him to his office at 
inputoutput inc of houston 
greer first lived in florida for a time fixing boat engines and 
hanging out at the beach 
there are a lot of pretty girls on the beach he explained 
but he eventually decided to go back to a regular job 
after a while i got tired of never having enough money and 
never having an id he said as for the pretty girls 
unfortunately about the time you get to know them theyve gone 
back to muncie ind greer said 
he got hearns name and social security number by placing a 
newspaper ad for an engineering job that the man answered 
he said the fbi agents who caught him lost interest in the case 
after discovering he was not a drug dealer or money launderer 
the federal charge that he was investigated on was possession 
of a false social security card number said assistant us 
attorney don de gabrielle who handled the case in houston

about three dozen payraise protesters gathered 
at union station this morning to greet house democrats as they 
departed by train for a weekend legislative retreat at a luxurious 
west virginia resort 
money for the needy not for the greedy the group chanted 
however the lawmakers arrived by bus under police guard and slipped 
in through a side door of the station to avoid the protesters 
groups represented ranged from the conservative students for 
america to followers of mitch snyder an advocate for the homeless 
maybe we would be less inclined to be here if they were rushing 
through a rise in the minimum wage or other measures to help 
lowincome americans snyder said 
the democrats are spending the weekend at the greenbrier a 
resort hotel in west virginia the annual retreat is subsidized by 
corporate and union interests 
the senate voted 955 thursday to reject the 51 percent pay raise 
recommended by a presidential commission placing the spotlight on a 
house leadership plan to legalize the increase next week but scale 
it back to 30 percent a day later 
the senate resolution included language to roll back the raise if 
it becomes law and end the system allowing congressional increases 
along with those for top federal executives and judges to become 
law automatically unless rejected by both houses 
rankandfile lawmakers would see their salaries rise from 
89500 to 135000 under the full raise but the pay would be 
116350 under house speaker jim wrights plan

the chinese government has invited soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to china setting the stage for the 
first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
the foreign ministry said in a statement today that foreign 
minister qian qichen proposed the visit in talks with his visiting 
soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze who accepted the 
invitation and expressed his gratitude 
soviet embassy spokesman viatcheslav duhin said gorbachevs visit 
could come as early as april senior chinese leader deng xiaoping 
will set the date when he meets with shevardnadze on saturday in 
shanghai duhin said 
shevardnadze left for shanghai today after meeting for nearly two 
hours with premier li peng the soviet embassy said only that the 
summit date and bilateral and international issues were discussed 
gorbachev would be the first soviet leader to visit china since 
nikita khrushchev met mao tsetung in beijing in 1959 a year later 
relations between the countries deteriorated over ideological and 
strategic differences and the soviets halted technical and military 
aid to china 
shevardnadze the first soviet foreign minister to visit china in 
30 years arrived wednesday for a threeday trip to work out final 
details for the summit 
qian said during the talks that china and the soviet union 
should establish a new type of state relationship with each other 
based on principles of equality and peaceful coexistence according 
to the foreign ministry 
qian stressed that china pursues an independent foreign policy 
of peace and that the normalization of the relations between china 
and the soviet union should not prejudice their respective relations 
with other countries the ministry statement said 
china repeatedly has said it will never return to its 
relationship of the 1950s when the soviet union was new communist 
states political mentor and main economic benefactor 
beijing also has assured the united states and other western 
nations with which it enjoys increasingly important economic and 
strategic ties that there is no possibility of a future sinosoviet 
alliance 
earlier today shevardnadze canceled a tour of the forbidden 
palace amid speculation he might meet cambodian resistance leader 
prince norodom sihanouk who now resides in the chinese capital 
china long has insisted that soviet financial backing for 
vietnams 10year occupation of cambodia is the major obstacle to 
normalizing sinosoviet relations 
qian in a banquet speech thursday night said the two sides had 
reached a consensus on many aspects of the problem including 
the need for vietnam to pull out its troops and for some kind of 
international supervision after vietnamese troops leave 
china is the main backer for the threeparty resistance coalition 
battling the vietnamese in cambodia it supports the introduction of 
an international peacekeeping force after vietnams departure an 
idea vietnam has rejected 
in his banquet speech shevardnadze called for joint ventures 
cooperation in science and technology and the transformation of the 
sinosoviet border into a region of peace friendship and 
goodneighborly cooperation 
the two countries fought a short border war in 1969 
economic and cultural contacts gradually have increased in the 
1980s but normalization of political and party relations has been 
stalled by the issues of cambodia the soviet incursion into 
afghanistan and the highly militarized border 
relations have improved rapidly in the past year following soviet 
announcements it is withdrawing from afghanistan and reducing its 
troop strength in asia and with progress in efforts to end the 
cambodian conflict

families of four aborigines who died in 
police custody today denounced a government report on the deaths 
that criticized police but stopped short of recommending criminal 
charges 
the report issued thursday found no evidence of foul play in 
the four deaths but said they probably could have been avoided 
judge james muirhead was ordered by the government of prime 
minister bob hawke in 1987 to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths 
nationwide since 1980 since the inquiry began the number of deaths 
has jumped to 107 
most of the offenders were arrested on minor charges such as 
being drunk and disorderly 
alice dixon whose son kingsley was found hanging in his cell 
in adelaide jail in 1987 wept when she heard the report 
i expected some retribution theyre murdering our people our 
boys and theyre getting away with it she said my son is 
dead other sons are dead and other mothers are grieving and this is 
the result we are going to get 
leila murray whose 21yearold son eddie was found hanged in 
1981 said ive never believed police she said the finding her 
son took his own life shatters my faith in white justice 
muirhead said police fabricated evidence and withheld evidence 
during the inquirys investigation of murrays death 
the judge concluded that proper custodial care and observance of 
prison regulations could have prevented dixons death and that the 
death by heart attack of charles sidney michael 31 in 1984 might 
have been avoided 
muirhead said the fourth death that of john clarence highfold 
37 at adelaide jail in 1983 was from natural causes 
muirhead didnt say when another report on more deaths would be 
released 
the national aboriginal and islander legal service which helped 
pressure the government to investigate criticized the inquiry 
there is no message in there that says to police stop if you 
are killing people or if you all allowing aboriginals to die 
said service director peter coe 
australias indigenous aborigines number about 160000 or about 
1 percent of the 16 million population

protestant and catholic politicians in northern 
ireland confirmed today that party members met secretly in west 
germany but said they found no way to end the provinces sectarian 
violence 
sadly theres no agreement theres no new dawn theres no 
new era we are not on the eve of a breakthrough said peter 
robinson deputy leader of the hardline protestant democratic 
unionist party 
his assessment differed from that of the british broadcasting 
corp which said the talks last year produced unanimous agreement 
on power sharing at all levels of government including the police 
in the britishruled province 
the bbc said the secret fourparty talks could produce the most 
important political breakthrough since sectarian violence in the 
protestantdominated province flared in 1969 the bbc said robinson 
participated in the talks 
meetings have continued in northern ireland since october it 
said 
the bbc said the west german talks included representatives of 
northern irelands two main protestant parties the largest roman 
catholic party and the middleoftheroad alliance party it said 
they took place oct 1415 at the angerhof hotel between duesseldorf 
and duisburg 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed irish 
republican army was not included the report said 
the mostly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant province with 
the 95 percent catholic irish republic about 2700 people have been 
killed in sectarian violence since 1969 
reacting to the bbc report john hume who leads the moderate 
catholic social democratic and labor party said the bbcs version 
of what had happened was wildly exaggerated and completely off 
the wall 
hume said in a bbc radio interview today that the political 
leaders were invited to a meeting in west germany to put forward 
their views on northern ireland he said there had been previous 
similar meetings in west germany and others in england that brought 
together protestant and catholic politicians from northern ireland 
but we did not exaggerate and say that suddenly theres a great 
breakthrough because there has not been i am not aware the four 
parties reached agreement 
james molyneaux leader of the protestant official unionist 
party said thursday night it was crackers to suggest his or the 
rev ian paisleys democratic unionists had been involved in any 
formal talks 
he said the meeting in west germany was merely the kind of 
conference frequently attended by senior protestant leaders there 
has never been any negotiation about the future government of 
northern ireland molyneaux said 
gordon mawhinney deputy leader of the alliance party which 
draws support from both catholics and protestants said a german 
lutheran churchmen organized the west german meeting for a different 
purpose which he did not specify and the talks about political 
differences took place somewhat by accident 
there was a regular line of communication opened between the 
northern ireland political parties and great willingness to look 
at the problems of the other community he said 
in addition to mawhinney and robinson the bbc said the other 
two politicians who worked out the agreement in west germany were 
jack allen chairman of the official unionists the largest 
protestant party and austin currie of humes party the largest 
catholic political group 
catholic and protestant party leaders who were not at the talks 
divorced themselves from the report the bbc said the talks were 
supported by the government of britain and the neighboring irish 
republic

the king legislation so that i may sign it and together we can move

william j bennett president bushs choice to 
direct the federal war on drugs said today he has the confidence 
of the president and will be able to handle the job despite not 
being a member of the cabinet 
in an interview this morning bennett said he appreciated the 
concern of senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr 
and others who have criticized bushs decision to leave him out of 
the cabinet 
on thursday biden said im worried that the president has 
made a crucial mistake maybe in part by oversight by not having 
the drug coordinator at the table 
the director of national drug control policy has to do what 
none of the others in the cabinet has to do said biden he 
has to take them on as a practical matter he is entering the most 
dangerous world in washington and that is the world of fiefdoms 
the director will be called upon to develop a strategy covering 
more than 30 agencies spread throughout the federal government that 
are under the more direct control of individual department 
secretaries 
i have the confidence of the president said bennett i 
know that he said it i heard it he said it to my colleagues 
in a preliminary meeting of the top cabinetlevel appointments 
bush told everyone that bennett would be in charge of drug control 
programs and said you are to work with him bennett recalled 
he has since reiterated that he said hes told me i 
want you to be able to do it the new job in a way thats 
unencumbered 
bennett said hes been assured by bush that he will be invited to 
cabinet meetings when they pertain to the drug effort 
asked if he felt he wasted a lot of time attending cabinet 
meetings on subjects he didnt care about during his 3 years as 
education secretary under president reagan bennett said only i 
went to three years of cabinet meetings and some were more 
interesting than others 
bennett who met with biden last week planned to make courtesy 
calls this afternoon with sens strom thurmond rsc edward m 
kennedy dmass and orrin g hatch rutah all members of the 
judiciary committee that will begin hearings on his nomination 
starting march 1 
biden said thursday that he had wanted to start the hearings a 
month earlier but agreed to the later date at the administrations 
request to give bennett time to prepare 
once bennett is confirmed he must begin work immediately on 
developing a plan that has never been developed in the history of 
the united states of america and that is a comprehensive drug 
plan which is due 180 days after the nominee is confirmed said 
biden ddel 
the clock is running the day im confirmed bennett said 
today senator biden and i discussed this and we decided to put 
off the hearings a bit to give us time to set up our staff figure 
out how the office is going to run 
he said his vow to quit smoking by the time he was confirmed was 
not the reason for the delay in the hearings 
i will be done by the time i take office bennett said 
ive set a date for that but im not going to preach until ive 
succeeded 
biden noted that the job of director of national drug control 
policy is bound to be extremely difficult dr bennett or whoever 
will take that post will be a sitting duck there is no way someone 
can succeed in the first year he said 
the senator said he considered the administrations request for a 
delay until march 1 reasonable 
we have created a completely new cabinet post and this is an 
infrequent occurrence which requires time and great effort to 
implement he said dr bennett has no office no place to 
reside physically and he has no staff 
bennett aide john walters has said bennett has other obligations 
to take care of before he starts his new job those include some 
speaking engagements and completion of a book on education

embassy in luanda angola last year after she escaped from african 
national congress guerrillas who had held her under guard for 22 
months she was allowed to leave luanda in november flew to london 
and then returned to south africa

on the ancs allegation that she was a spy who had infiltrated the 
guerrilla movement her father peter forsyth had insisted she was 
a journalist 
the head of the police security branch maj gen basie smit

gathered valuable information after pretending to defect to the 
anc in 1986 smit said she was tortured at an anc camp in angola 
smit also disclosed the identity of another police spy joy 
harnden who infiltrated prominent antiapartheid organizations in 
south africa such as the black sash civil rights group and the end 
consription campaign 
both women performed a great duty for south africa in 
exceptionally dangerous circumstances said smit he said details 
of their assignments were being disclosed to counter a twisted 
account that might come from the anc 
police also issued a statement from miss forsyth who holds 
british and south african citizenship 
in the statement she asserted that the anc was wracked by ethnic 
conflict disillusionment and alcoholism she said the ancs exiled 
leadership did not want anc leader nelson mandela released from 
prison in south africa because they felt he was more useful to them 
as a martyr she also said mandelas wife winnie was an 
embarassment to the anc 
the anc was outlawed by the south african government in 1960 and 
bagen a bombing and sabotage campaign in 1961 aimed at undermining 
the whiteminority government 
miss forsyth said she tried to convince the anc that she was a 
defector from the south african security forces and made a 
preplanned confession containing both factual and false information 
while the anc investigated her claims she said she was held 
under diabolical conditions at the guerrilla movements quatro 
rehabilitation camp in angola she later was taken to a house in 
luanda and escaped from it in may when her guards became drunk she 
said 
miss forsyth said her first spying mission came in 1982 when she 
was assigned by police to infiltrate antiapartheid student 
organizations at rhodes university in the eastern cape province 
town of grahamstown 
a reporter for south africas argus newspaper group interviewed 
miss forsyth prior to the release of the police statement and 
quoted her account of being a campus spy 
i had to adopt a radical leftwing lifestyle in every respect 
from dress language and manners to living in leftwing communes 
she was quoted as saying my parents at this stage knew nothing of 
my real role and they were extremely disappointed

about 200 people fought police with 
firebombs in kwangju today during a demonstration demanding an 
thorough investigation into the governments suppression of a 1980 
uprising in the southern city 
a police officer was beaten by protesters and taken to a 
hospital but his condition was not immediately known the yonhap 
news agency reported 
the protesters were among about 1000 people who marched through 
downtown after an outdoor rally denouncing the government of 
president roh taewoo and the united states the news agency said 
about 200 people mostly students dashed from the crowd hurling 
rocks and dozens of firebombs when about 800 police halted the march 
50 yards from the us cultural center yonhap reported 
it said the marchers dispersed voluntarily a short time later 
the authoritarian government killed about 200 people when it put 
down an uprising in kwangju in 1980 the protesters accused the roh 
government of blocking efforts to investigate the suppression of the 
revolt 
opposition and dissident figures say some military leaders 
instigated the uprising as part of a plot to seize power in the 
chaotic days that followed the death of thenpresident park 
chunghee in late 1979 
they say the united states acquiesced in a military plan to 
suppress the revolt ruthlessly and therefore is partly to blame for 
the deaths 
the united states has denied the charges and said it will 
cooperate with a parliamentary committee investigating the revolt 
parliamentary officials said today that next week they will send 
a questionnaire to two americans william gleysteen and john 
wickham and ask them to clarify any us role in the case 
gleysteen was the us ambassador and wickham served as the top 
us military commander at the time of the uprising

india used heavy water purchased from the 
savannah river plant in its nuclear weapons program despite 
assurances it wouldnt do so a nuclear expert said 
india exploded a nuclear weapon in 1974 soon after the united 
states and canada which had supplied both nuclear technology and 
heavy water to india cut off shipments india then turned to the 
soviet union for its heavy water 
the savannah river plant in nearby aiken sc at one time sold 
heavy water to 21 countries including eight with nuclear weapons 
programs 
those countries were argentina brazil england france india 
israel pakistan and south africa according to records cited by the 
augusta chronicle and the augusta herald 
england france and india have exploded nuclear weapons israel 
south africa and pakistan either have or are capable of producing 
such weapons and argentina and brazil are close said leonard 
spector senior associate with the carnegie endowment for 
international peace 
india received 36 tons of heavy water in seven sales made in 
1954 1959 and 1960 it returned 15 tons of the water records show 
the heavy water was sold to a facility that was not under 
inspection but india promised it was not being used to produce 
nuclear weapons spector said it looked like a clear 
violation 
spector said most of the heavy water used by india in producing 
its bomb was from other countries but american heavy water had 
been involved 
heavy water is used as a moderator or primary coolant in some 
nuclear reactors including those at srp 
the atomic energy act and its amendments allowed the department 
of energy sell heavy water to foreign countries as part of a program 
to expand the peaceful use of nuclear power as an alternative energy 
source 
chris sankey a doe spokesman said the department made the sales 
with the guidance of the administrations and the state department 
a state department spokesman said thursday the department could 
not comment but would review the report 
a spokesman for the indian embassy in washington who declined to 
give his name contended today that the 1974 explosion was not a 
nuclear weapon it was an underground explosion called a 
peaceful nuclear explosion he said it was not weaponoriented 
it was scientific research for harnessing atomic energy

the bush administration playing host to its 
first big international gathering got a skeptical reception today 
from allied finance ministers over the ability of the presidents 
flexible freeze plan to reduce the federal budget deficit 
participants said 
treasury secretary nicholas brady was holding two days of 
closeddoor discussions with his foreign counterparts the sessions 
began late thursday and continued through dinner 
finance ministers and central bank presidents from japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy rushed from their 
limousines into the treasury department building today without 
speaking to reporters kept across the street by police 
but french finance minister pierre beregovoy told reporters at a 
breakfast meeting that brady had given the group assurances that the 
administration was committed to reducing the budget deficit and 
would meet the 100 billion deficit limit for the upcoming fiscal 
year required by the grammrudman law 
the deficit for fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 is expected to 
top 160 billion 
beregovoy said brady stressed that the administration saw the 
reduction of the deficit as a very important commitment 
however a senior canadian official said the other finance 
ministers displayed much skepticism about the chances of success of 
president bushs flexible freeze his campaign proposal to bring 
down the deficit without new taxes by simply holding overall 
spending growth to the level of inflation 
the canadian official who briefed reporters on condition of 
anonymity said other finance ministers expressed doubt to the 
americans that the proposal could work because it was based on 
extremely optimistic economic assumptions involving steep declines 
in interest rates 
the official said there was also discussion at thursdays dinner 
meeting by the socalled group of seven over the problem of third 
world debt and the need for west germany and japan to do more to 
reduce their huge trade surpluses 
beregevoy said france hoped the united states and the other 
countries would be willing to set up new machinery to guarantee 
interest paymnents on the debt using money supplied by the 
international monetary fund 
but he said he was willing to listen to other suggestions while 
officials agree that there is a pressing need to do something to 
relieve the growing debt burden of developing countries no final 
decision is expected to come out of this meeting 
the countries are expected to carry on talks at a lower level 
hoping to come up with concrete proposals to consider at the march 
31april 4 meetings of the international monetary fund and world 
bank 
the washington talks coming only two weeks after bushs 
inauguration mark the first time americas major trading partners 
are getting a chance to discuss international policy issues with the 
new administration 
the talks were coming during a period of relative calm for global 
currency markets but investors were still watching with keen 
interest hoping to learn more about the new administrations views 
on international economic matters 
brady was criticized last november for botching an effort to calm 
financial markets concerned about a steep drop in the value of the 
dollar during a television interview he said markets go up and 
down i dont really worry about the dollars decline very 
much 
the dollar plunged further following bradys comments 
the greenback has since stabilized however as the 
administration has repeatedly declared that it is serious about 
attacking the huge federal budget deficits 
there has been growing pressure from other countries to move away 
from the approach to third world debt first advanced by 
thentreasury secretary james a baker iii it proposed new loans 
but no reduction of debt burdens for 15 of the largest debtor 
countries 
many industrial countries and debtor nations believe the time has 
come to grant debt relief in his inaugural speech thursday 
venezuelas new president carlos andres perez called for a summit 
meeting between debtor nations and the industrial countries to 
search for a way of breaking the vicious circle of debt and 
stagnation 
perez said the world needs to abandon the casebycase approach 
that is supported by the united states saying this has not been in 
the best interests of latin american debtors 
each country found itself alone facing a formidable cartel of 
creditors whose schemes and interests prevailed perez said 
bush has promised a new look at the debt problem but has revealed 
no specifics about what the new administration might favor 
representatives of latin american governments who are the biggest 
debtors were meeting today in caracas venezuela they were expected 
to propose a new international body to buy up some of the debt at 
discounts from the face note on the loans

church of england leaders have rejected a plan to 
give black anglicans more seats on the main policymaking body of 
the church 
after a twohour debate lay members of the anglican state church 
on thursday blocked the proposal by a 9680 vote despite favorable 
votes of 173 by bishops and 10362 by clergy the plan needed a 
majority of each group to pass as well as approval by the british 
parliament 
barbadosborn bishop of croydon wilfred wood the first black 
bishop of the state church to serve in england left church house in 
westminster immediately after the vote he looked upset and declined 
comment 
although woods committee for black anglican concerns proposed 
the plan he and the seven other black members of the general synod 
did not speak during the bodys debate 
the proposal would have set aside a minimum of 24 seats for 
blacks on the 574member policymaking synod in 1990 proponents 
said the arrangement would better reflect the estimated 2 million 
blacks among englands 49 million people wales and scotland have 
separate churches 
during the debate senior synod member oswald clark said legal 
advice had shown parliament would reject the plan as inexpedient 
businessman timothy royle said parliament had never reserved 
seats for any particular party or race we wont make restitution 
for our past to those who come from abroad particularly from the 
former colonies by giving one group a special role he said 
archbishop of york john habgood urged the synod to approve the 
plan and negotiate with the government on what it would accept 
one generation of black people has already been lost and unless 
we do something now we shall lose the next generation and the 
generation after that habgood said 
several speakers said they saw the plan as offensive to black 
people because it implied they were incapable of helping themselves

gen alfredo stroessner relied on a canny blend of military 
force political patronage and selfdiscipline to maintain control 
over paraguay for 34 years longer than any leader in the western 
hemisphere 
but a rebellion by army gen andres rodriguez stroessners 
secondincommand today ended the dictatorship that began when 
stroessner seized power in a 1954 military coup 
stroessner 76 won eight presidential elections despite 
opposition charges the balloting was rigged even his critics admit 
he helped stabilize a nation that before him had endured 22 
presidents in 31 years 
but at the same time he was accused of brutal repression and 
corruption and his country became a haven for fugitive nazis drug 
traffickers and former dictators the list of refugees included 
josef mengele the auschwitz death camp doctor and gen anastasio 
somoza debayle the ousted nicaraguan dictator 
the redhaired stroessner son of a bavarian immigrant father and 
paraguayan mother of spanish heritage oversaw the countrys 
transformation from a neglected backwater with open sewers and no 
running water to a relatively prosperous and modern nation 
scores of schools and buildings in addition to asuncions 
international airport were named for the man who began his military 
career at age 20 and quickly distinguished himself on the battle 
field 
in a central plaza in the capital a huge neon sign blinked 
incessantly with the slogan stroessner peace work and 
wellbeing an important city is named puerto stroessner 
in his innumberable speeches which sometimes lasted hours he 
liked to list in detail the public works projects achieved by his 
regime 
among the most important works was the 16 billion itaipu dam 
the worlds largest hydroelectrical project built in partnership 
with neighboring brazil it began producing power in early 1985 
he attended hundreds of groundbreakings and other public 
ceremonies each year even in outlying towns and served regularly 
as a witness at weddings even when he didnt know the bride or 
groom 
stroessner credited his longevity and energy to spartan habits 
he did not smoke and drank little and a busy work schedule 
public dissatisfaction with the government became increasingly 
evident in the mid1980s when protesters and police clashed in 
street demonstrations 
the nations roman catholic church and even a faction of 
stroessners colorado party began criticizing the president 
accusing him of unjust repression and demanding democratic reforms 
human rights groups said many of stroessners foes were tortured 
and killed during his early years in power others were simply 
jailed indefinitely convicted of political crimes or forced into 
exile 
a rabid anticommunist and staunch us ally stroessner was 
stung by the reagan administrations labeling him as a dictatorship 
and relations between the countries declined 
stroessner attended the nations military academy graduating in 
1929 and as a 20yearold lieutenant led a mortar platoon in the 
chaco war against bolivia he distinguished himself for bravery in 
the war which lasted from 1932 to 1935 and rose quickly through 
the ranks being promoted to general at age 40 he became army chief 
of staff in 1951 
after taking power stroessner put down five attempted coups by 
exiled politicians from 1954 to 1958 and began dismantling the 
opposition 
employing special powers under a state of siege renewed each 90 
days until last year civilian and military police arrested 
thousands of opponents 
stroessner branded virtually all his opponents as subversives 
critics charge his government promoted a growing private sector 
dominated by contraband many government and military officials 
including relatives and close assocites became enriched through 
their ties with stroessner 
stroessner reportedly has been ill since a prostate operation 
five months ago his apparent slow recovery increased the demands by 
opposition leaders that the army and colorado party consider a 
transition to democratic rule

attorneys fees to a contra leader a former cia official and others 
who had been accused in a civil lawsuit of mounting a gunsfordrugs

chief us district judge james lawrence king in june threw out 
the 24 million lawsuit filed by the christic institute on behalf of

knowledge

extensive illegal operation were contra director adolfo calero 
former cia deputy director of operations theodore shackley 
irancontra figures richard secord and albert hakim and former maj

decision 
the liberal washingtonbased christic institute which has 
appealed kings original decision to the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals had no immediate reaction to todays ruling 
avirgan and honey filed the lawsuit in may 1986 prior to many of 
the revelations in the irancontra affair 
it grew from a 1984 bombing in nicaragua apparently aimed at 
maverick contra leader eden pastora pastora escaped but avirgan 
was injured and several other people were killed 
the lawsuit accused the defendants of setting up the bombing as

a huge column of soviet tanks and 
trucks rumbled out of kabul early today and soviet and afghan 
sources said the departure left only about 1500 red army soldiers 
in the country 
the convoy rolled out of the marshaling yard at the base of the 
salang highway under cover of darkness and began the 260mile 
journey north to the soviet border in a heavy snowstorm 
afghan soldiers manned the soviet outposts along the highway and 
soviet flags were replaced with the red green and black flags of 
afghanistan 
the usbacked guerrillas called mujahedeen have pounded 
departing soviet convoys with artillery fire in recent days 
the afghan and soviet sources said that no more than 1500 red 
army soldiers would remain in the country once the convoy reached 
soviet soil 
they said they did not know how many vehicles or soldiers were in 
the convoy which took three hours to move out early this week 
western and soviet diplomats said about 15000 soviet soldiers were 
still in the country 
the afghan and soviet sources said the small contingent that 
remained in kabul today will guard the citys airport during an 
airlift that will continue for at least a week 
the soviet union which once had about 100000 troops in 
afghanistan is to complete its withdrawal by feb 15 under the terms 
of a unbrokered accord signed last year 
on thursday president najib said his army was mightier than 
ever and ready for battle with the guerrillas who predict an easy 
time overthrowing the government once the soviet pullout is 
completed 
the afghan army can defend the country against any onslaught 
and we will prove it najib said at a twohour news conference at 
the foreign ministry in a room unheated because of the fuel 
shortage in the capital

vehicles and tanks headed for the salang highway

will fall in weeks not months gulbaddin hekmatyar head of the

insurgents would not have to attack the cities 
speaking of a possible political settlement with the rebels 
najib said his communist party must be part of any future 
government any attempt to exclude the party and its allies 
from a coalition goverment will be in vain he said 
the guerrillas have rejected offers of settlements based on that 
assumption and say they are forming a council to choose an islamic 
government 
explosions and artillery fire could be heard in and around the 
capital thursday where insurgent attacks have created severe food 
and fuel shortages

million afghan refugees live urged the squabbling guerrilla 
factions thursday to patch up their differences and form a 
broadbased government in kabul as soon as the soviets are gone 
najib asked whether he would be willing to resign as part of a 
settlement said the resignation of a person will not help to 
solve any problem 
he expressed optimism that eduard a shevardnadze the soviet 
foreign minister would work out a settlement at a meeting with 
pakistani leaders saturday but added that pakistan must change its 
position 
pakistan has not only refused to adhere to its commitment under 
the geneva agreements but it has quantitatively and qualitatively 
intensified and expanded its armed interferences and aggressions 
he said 
najibs assurances about the ability of his conscript army 
estimated to number about 140000 contrasted with uncertainty on 
the part of others

the government can fine railroads or 
individuals up to 20000 for tampering with locomotive safety 
devices under new rules issued by the federal railroad 
administration 
investigators found that the intentional disabling of a safety 
warning device contributed to the collision of an amtrak passenger 
train and a conrail locomotive killing 16 people at chase md two 
years ago 
since then government inspectors have found more than 70 
locomotives with warning whistles automatic stopping devices and 
other safety systems intentionally diconnected 
many of the 25000 locomotives operated by the nations railroads 
are equipped with one or more of the devices designed to either 
record data on the engines operation or to make it safer the 
administration said in issuing the final rules thursday 
the devices range from audible alerts on changing conditions 
along the rails such as speed limits to devices that stop or slow 
the train if the engineer fails to respond 
under the new rules fines include 2500 for knowingly operating 
or permitting the operation of a locomotive with disabled equipment 
and 7500 for tampering with the equipment 
the administration also has the right to increase the fines to as 
high as 20000 per violation when it finds gross negligence or a 
pattern of violations which cause death or injury or create an 
imminent hazard 
the amtrakconrail crash on jan 4 1987 was blamed on gross and 
willful negligence by the conrail crew conrail engineer ricky lynn 
gates pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is serving a fiveyear 
prison term he admitted the crew had used marijuana before the 
accident and violated a number of safety procedures 
conrail last july agreed to pay 58 million to survivors of those 
killed and amtrak agreed in august to pay 82 million the 
railroads also agreed to create a 9 million fund to pay 330 
passengers who filed claims for injuries or distress suffered in the

britains princess diana toured an aids pediatric 
ward at a harlem hospital today asking questions about the 
dimensions of the problem and winning praise for her interest and 
involvement 
hundreds of excited harlem hospital workers craned their necks 
for a glimpse of the 27yearold princess there were cheers 
applause and shouts of welcome to america 
diana dressed in a doublebreasted red suit and white silk 
blouse shook hands with some in the crowd and then used the stairs 
to get to the second floor of harlem hospital because the elevator 
bank was blocked by wellwishers 
the princess described on thursday night as tired and perhaps a 
little homesick planned to head home to england today 
before touring the childrens aids ward diana attended a 
10minute briefing given by dr margaret heagarty director of 
pediatrics dr elaine abrams head of the pediatrics aids unit and 
martha grates nursing director 
during the session the princess listened as heagarty spoke about 
how 1300 children have been infected with aids nationwide to date 
harlem hospital is treating about 100 children with the deadly 
disease 
diana occasionally interrupted asking questions about whether the 
situation would get worse the outlook for the next five years and 
when you have the problem of drugs how do you deal with aids as 
well 
diana thursday night went to the brooklyn academy of music for 
the american debut of the welsh national opera after which she 
returned to manhattan and dazzled guests at a gala dinner in her 
honor at the world financial center 
earlier she visited a familys apartment at a lower east side 
shelter for the homeless and browsed at the giant fao schwarz toy 
store 
i dreamed about this last night said wanda morales who 
shook dianas hand it was better than the dream it was really 
better we can hold our head up high and say princess diana came 
to the lower east side 
cheering crowds turned out at each stop to glimpse the princess 
the lone note of dissent was heard outside the opera performance 
where more than 400 protesters chanted ira ira and waved signs 
denouncing the princess 
charles j hynes a potential mayoral candidate who is active in 
irishamerican affairs said the protest is not directed against 
princess diana its directed against her as a symbol of british 
government which for much too long has inhabited northern ireland 
mayor edward i koch and developer donald trump were heckled as 
they entered the elegant concert hall located in a rundown 
brooklyn neighborhood 
but all was calm and serene inside where the princess watched a 
performance of giuseppe verdis falstaff which tells the story 
of sir john falstaff shakespeares knight of the paunch 
she was very proud of the company said brooklyn academy of 
music president harvey lichtenstein who sat next to the princess 
during the opera and at the dinner that followed as princess of 
wales she is the patron of the company 
diana sat in a balcony box festooned with garlands of purple and 
red satin as she entered the orchestra sounded a drum roll and 
played god save the queen the star spangled banner and 
land of my fathers the welsh national anthem 
from the stage koch told her i want to bid you welcome the 
city is graced by your presence we want to be sure your visit goes 
just the way you want it to be so that when you go home you can say 
you had a royal new york welcome 
although tickets for the performance of falstaff and the 
dinner afterward went for 1000 operalovers and fans of the 
princess who were on a tighter budget could attend the show alone 
for as little as 40 
i wanted to see the princess i bought my ticket two days 
ago said margaret skinner a secretary who lives in brooklyn 
she has a very nice quiet air about her not ostentatious very 
royal 
after the threehourplus opera the princess returned to 
manhattan by limousine to the gala dinner in the world financial 
centers winter garden where guests were seated at candlelit tables 
covered in deep red linen cloths 
potted palms rose majestically into the towering canopied space 
which diana entered by sweeping down a sparkling marble staircase 
dressed in a white evening gown with beaded bolero 
the guests were impressed but lichtenstein who sat at the head 
table with the princess said the strain of her solo tour was 
beginning to tell 
i think she was very tired and this has been a rough couple of 
days for her said lichtenstein she was very hungry i dont 
think she had eaten all day and she was anxious to get back home

who has taught classes in statistics 
if this is supposed to be a comprehensive study id hate to 
see one that isnt manganello said the study should have gone 
back more years and collected more data 
the cancer study looked at data from 1980 through 1984 and the 
infant birth weight studies compared babies born in the 1960s 1970s 
and 1980s according to todays editions of the philadelphia 
inquirer 
these findings suggest that the most adverse health effects 
occurred during the 1970s when exposures to hazardous substances 
were probably the heaviest the study concluded but it stressed 
that the limited information covered by the study could not prove 
that the landfill caused the increased leukemia and lowbirthweight 
rates 
the federal environmental protection agency has set aside 20 
million to clean up the 15acre landfill 12 miles south of camden 
which is ranked at the top of the superfund priority list of more 
than 900 toxicwaste sites 
the lipari landfill began operations in 1958 taking wastes from 
several nearby plants it was closed by the state in 1971 after 
residents complained of respiratory problems nausea dying 
vegitation and odors numerous carcinogens such as benzene 
methylene chloride and aresnmic have been found at the site 
in 1983 the landfill was sealed off by a containing wall and 
cover made of polyethylene the next phase of the cleanup involves 
flushing contaminants from the landfill a process that could take 
up to seven years

the judge at oliver norths irancontra trial 
selected four more people as prospective jurors today including one 
who said she doesnt pay attention to news because its 
depressing and thinks the controversy over north is boring 
the woman a secretary to a hospital director said her mother 
who lives with her pays such close attention to current events that 
i call her news media 
when her mother approaches her about the news i always tell 
her to get out of my room i dont want to hear it said the woman 
she acknowledged she had been aware from other people but said 
she paid no attention to norths immunized congressional testimony 
in 1987 in which he detailed many of the activities for which he is 
now accused of crimes 
us district judge gerhard a gesell qualified her for the jury 
pool over the objections of north attorney barry simon who said the 
woman was bombarded at a minimum with references to north 
gesell also selected a military personnel clerk for the pool to 
which 29 people have been sent since the trial opened tuesday he 
hopes to build it to 50 before selecting a jury 
three people were rejected for the pool including a 
businesswoman who said north was involved in money and arms on 
an international scale she said she knew that north had a boss 
named poindexter and he had a blond secretary a reference to 
fawn hall who has been granted immunity from prosecution by the 
government in exchange for her testimony 
the businesswoman who has a masters degree said she didnt 
watch the 1987 congressional hearings because she was starting a 
business and working 14 hours or more a day 
on thursday gesell said that security gurus from the cia and 
other intelligence agencies wont be permitted to disrupt norths 
trial 
gesell responded angrily to a request that courtroom seats be 
reserved for intelligence experts from the justice department and 
agencies including the cia defense department state department 
the national security agency and possibly others 
gesell agreed to set up four seats for the intelligence 
community but said he is very concerned about their function 
i do not intend to have this case run by two or three security 
gurus sitting in the audience said gesell i dont want to be 
in a position where every time a document flashes by you go to these 
people who check with their department 
gesells admonition reflects a continuing behindthescenes 
dispute in norths trial 
the nsa is worried that government secrets will be disclosed in 
the courtroom even though the two central charges against north 
were dropped jan 13 due to national security considerations the 12 
charges that remain generally accuse the former national security 
council aide of attempts to cover up his activities in the 
irancontra affair activities which in many cases have since been 
made public 
the nsa had gone to attorney general dick thornburgh with a list 
of objections it said warranted blocking the trial government 
sources said the attorney general has the authority to prevent 
disclosure of sensitive information that might harm national 
security but thornburgh overruled the nsa objections 
gesell in his courtroom remarks thursday disclosed that he had 
turned down an earlier unspecified request from the intelligence 
community concerning how the trial would be conducted 
he did not discuss the ruling but said i do not want to see 
that proposal reestablished in some other form 
gesells comments came at the end of a day in which nine 
prospective jurors were sent into a jury pool the judge wants to 
build to 50 before selecting a 12member jury and six alternates 
the judge predicted it will take most of next week to 
complete the jury selection process 
gesell has spent much time since the irancontra indictment was 
handed up last march dealing with the problem of classified 
information which the prosecution and defense want to present at 
trial

the general who ousted military 
dictator alfredo stroessner in a coup today is a career soldier who 
rose from a humble background to become commander of the armys 
premier unit and a wealthy man 
gen andres rodriguez the son of a farmer grew up in the rural 
town of san salvador but now lives in a mansion in a plush suburb of 
asuncion 
little is known of his early career but rodriguez about 64 was 
named commander of the first army corps in 1961 the corps one of 
three is the largest and best equipped in the army 
when rodriguez attacked police headquarters and the presidential 
guard to oust stroessner he had 40 to 50 tanks at his disposal plus 
mortars cannons recoilless rifles heavy machine guns and manpower 
it was not clear why rodriguez chose to unseat the 76yearold 
stroessner or why he acted when he did 
but diplomatic and political observers said that shortly before 
the coup rodriguez a stocky man of medium height was ordered by 
stroessner to retire as army commander and become defense minister 
rodriguez refused 
opposition leader domingo laino speculated that rodriguez acted 
because he had privately sided with the traditionalist wing of the 
ruling colorado party which has called for a transition to a more 
democratic government and sought to distance itself from stroessner 
rodriguez and stroessner were personal friends as well as 
professional colleagues their families became joined when 
rodriguezs daughter marta married stroessners son alfredo 
rodriguez was well known inside the capital but the first time 
many paraguayans heard of him was this morning when he said in his 
clipped commanding voice on the radio that stroessner was under 
arrest and he was taking command of the country from this moment

william j bennett who will lead 
administration antidrug efforts said friday his lack of a 
permanent seat at president bushs cabinet table will not impair his 
ability to deal effectively with other top officials 
i have the confidence of the president bennett said in an 
interview i know that he said it i heard it he said it to my 
colleagues 
in a meeting of toplevel appointees bush told everyone that 
bennett would be in charge of drugcontrol programs and said you 
are to work with him bennett recalled 
he has since reiterated that he said hes told me i 
want you to be able to do it the new job in a way thats 
unencumbered 
bennett also said hes been assured by bush that he will be 
invited to cabinet meetings when they pertain to the antidrug 
effort 
several members of congress including senate judiciary committee 
chairman joseph r biden jr who will preside over bennetts 
confirmation hearings starting march 1 have criticized bushs 
decision to leave the drug czar out of the cabinet 
im worried that the president has made a crucial mistake 
maybe in part by oversight by not having the drug coordinator at 
the table biden said thursday 
the director of national drug control policy has to do what 
none of the others in the cabinet has to do said biden he 
has to take them on as a practical matter he is entering the most 
dangerous world in washington and that is the world of fiefdoms 
as soon as bennett is confirmed he will have 180 days to develop 
a drug control strategy covering more than 30 agencies spread 
throughout the federal government those agencies are under the more 
direct control of individual department secretaries 
i appreciate the concern of senator biden said bennett who 
met with him last week and was making courtesy calls on other 
members of the judiciary committee on friday afternoon 
bennett also said he had met with some department heads such as 
attorney general dick thornburgh 
he said he has not been involved except in a very general way 
in developing the budget for fiscal 1990 that bush is to present 
feb 9 were not going to get really involved in that until weve 
finished our sixmonth plan he said 
the 180day deadline for development of a drug strategy is the 
reason his confirmation hearings were delayed until march 1 
according to both bennett and biden who said he originally had 
wanted the hearings to begin a month earlier 
the clock is running the day im confirmed bennett said 
senator biden and i discussed this and we decided to put off the 
hearings a bit to give us time to set up our staff figure out how 
the office is going to run 
he said he still has not decided who will be his top two deputies 
one to work on reduction of demand for drugs and the other on 
cutting the supply 
bennett vowed the day he was named to the job by bush jan 12 
that he would quit smoking by the time he was confirmed he said 
friday he hadnt yet but i will be done by the time i take 
office ive set a date for that but im not going to preach until 
ive succeeded

japan will pardon about 30000 people and reinstate 
certain rights for about 11 million others as part of the funeral 
for emperor hirohito news reports said friday 
chief government spokesman keizo obuchi said the government would 
pardon people guilty of 17 minor offenses including violations of 
traffic laws and the alien registration law news reports said 
the plan also includes reinstating certain rights for about 11 
million people such as the right to vote to run for public office 
or to obtain drivers licenses because of past offenses the reports 
quoted obuchi as saying 
the plan is to be approved at a cabinet meeting next week after 
prime minister noboru takeshita returns from the united states the 
reports said 
thirtyone foreigners on trial for violating the controversial 
alien registration law have said they are opposed to pardons because 
they would eliminate their ability to protest in court against the 
laws requirement that all resident aliens be fingerprinted and 
carry identification cards 
the amnesty plan excludes people convicted of bribery and 
therefore will not apply to former prime minister kakuei tanaka who 
was convicted in 1987 of receiving a bribe of 39 million from the 
us lockheed corp to facilitate the sale of aircraft to a japanese 
airline 
the government has pardoned criminals on previous occasions such 
as japans admission to the united nations in 1956 the wedding of 
then crown price akihito in 1959 and the return of okinawa from the 
united states in 1972 
the foreign ministry said friday that 133 countries have notified 
japan they will send representatives to hirohitos funeral on feb 
24 of the total 54 nations have said they will send their head of 
state a ministry official said 
a senior official in the national police agency said it plans to 
mobilize 32000 police to guard dignitaries and japanese officials 
at the funeral at least six radical groups opposed to the imperial 
system have threatened to disrupt the funeral

kent county officials had no trouble 
turning down an offer by the federal government to help house the 
homeless the government was offering an old military observation 
tower as a shelter 
the federal department of health and human services recently 
notified county officials that they could lease the abandoned tower 
for the homeless its 80 feet tall devoid of heat electricity or 
running water and situated in a remote part of the county 
its ludicrous said county administrator william h landon 
i cant believe anybody ever bothered to take a look at the 
thing the largely rural county has few problems with homeless 
anyway officials said 
if we had any homeless we certainly wouldnt take them down 
there and put them in an 80foot tower not if we had their best 
interests at heart said county commission president alexander p 
rasin iii 
a spokesman for the us department of housing and urban 
development said thursday that the notice to the county may have 
been an error 
weve been getting a lot of calls about things like this 
said the spokesman william a glavin either properties are too 
remote or they somehow wouldnt work 
a federal judge in washington ordered hud to determine which of 
more than 300 surplus government properties could be used to shelter 
the homeless under the stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act 
of 1987 the ruling resulted from a lawsuit brought by homeless 
advocates 
hud officials had only a month to determine which surplus sites 
should be offered and gathered information by sending questionnaires 
about the properties to other federal agencies it is unlikely that 
anyone from hud actually visited the tower or contacted local 
officials about it until now glavin said 
the 1940sera steel tower was used by the us army as an 
observation platform during gun tests at aberdeen proving ground

the air force said friday it lost one of its 
new b1b bombers in a crash last fall because the pilot and copilot 
lost track of their altitude while attempting an instrument landing 
the accident which occurred nov 17 at ellsworth air force base 
sd destroyed the 280 million plane the four crewmen ejected 
safely 
the detailed accident report released by the strategic air 
command was unusually direct in citing crew error 
the bombers pilot a highly qualified instructor aircraft 
commander allowed the aircraft to descend below the published 
minimum descent altitude for the approach being flown and the 
plane hit a power line and poles more than a half mile from the 
runway the report said 
it said the planes copilot failed to advise the pilot he was 
too low 
lt col george peck a spokesman for sac said friday no 
disciplinary action had been taken against the crew he declined to 
speculate whether any would be 
the aircraft commander was maj thomas c skillman of bellmeade 
nj his copilot that night was capt mick r guthals of los 
alamos nm 
also aboard were capt grover m gossett of aiken sc the 
offensive system operator and maj dean c spraggins an instructor 
defensive system operator from voorheesville ny 
the crash at ellsworth occurred at 1040 pm local time while 
the weather conditions were cold and foggy with a low cloud ceiling 
another b1b landed safely just moments before the crash the report 
said 
it said neither aircraft nor engine icing was a contributing 
factor to the accident and maintenance and other records revealed 
no other factors leading to the mishap 
skillman and guthals were making their second attempt to land 
that night having broken off an earlier approach 
on the second try skillman had leveled the plane off at 3480 
feet the minimum altitude specified for that runway and approach 
but then allowed it to drift lower the report said after an 
unidentified crewman called out altitude the pilot applied 
additional power to arrest his descent 
the plane remained level or in a slight descent for five 
seconds and then commenced an uninterrupted descent seven seconds 
later the right wing struck and sheared three wooden far field 
monitor poles the investigators wrote 
the crash was the third involving a productionmodel b1b in 14 
months leaving the air force with 97 of its original 100 planes 
the fourengine swingwing b1b is the first addition to 
americas manned bomber force in more than 25 years the plane is 
designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of b52 bombers and 
the new b2 stealth bomber 
the b1b built by rockwell international corp has a maximum 
speed of about 1000 mph and a range of more than 7000 miles

someone used accurate police jargon over a 
restricted frequency to report an officer had been shot sparking a 
hunt involving 24 officers two helicopters and police dogs 
authorities said

a woman who allowed her daughter to skip 
school was ordered to attend classes with the teenager but she 
said friday would be her last day in school 
jeanetta norvell 45 was sentenced monday to one day in jail and 
the rest of the school year with her daughter diana at west junior 
high school because diana missed too many classes 
but mrs norvell who skipped math class to speak in a telephone 
interview friday said her school days are over because her daughter 
turns 16 saturday and is eligible to drop out 
im withdrawing her monday mrs norvell said its a 
pretty sad thing that a 45yearold adult has to go to a junior high 
school but it was more humiliating to be treated like a common 
criminal 
mrs norvell was convicted of permitting her daughter to skip 
school five days between october and december of last year 
diana hates school mrs norvell said 
cabell county circuit judge dan ohanlon ordered mrs norvell to 
accompany her daughter to school for the rest of the year and stay 
with her throughout the school day the judge also said she may not 
leave the state without permission of the county probation office 
according to court records 
it was believed to be the first time in west virginia that a 
parent has served time for allowing a child to be truant 
west junior high principal charles buell said some of his 
students have been required in the past to attend school past the 
age of 16 but he said a final decision is up to ohanlon 
i guess if this is the only way to make sure that children 
attend school its worth it buell said but im really not in 
favor of having parents follow their children around in school

thousands of people returned to their homes 
following a spectacular railroad explosion and fire but the blast 
damage threatened a dangerous power shortage today as temperatures 
ranged to 38 below zero 
weve got to minimize power usage right down to the last light 
bulb said leroy lamach helena division engineer for montana 
power co its that critical 
as wind chills dipped to 70 below zero national guard and air 
force troops relieved local firefighters late thursday to monitor 
the explosion scene overnight and extinguish the last stubborn fires 
were just going to keep pouring water on it all night said 
sgt ron weber a national guardsman stationed in helena the cars 
that were the most threatening are now huge ice cubes 
the wreckage continued to smolder this morning said paul 
spengler lewis and clark county disaster services coordinator the 
temperature at 7 am was 29 degrees below zero 
bitter cold weather that swept down out of alaska was indirectly 
responsible for the predawn explosions that rocked montanas 
capital thursday severing power lines and showering some 
neighborhoods with shrapnel 
authorities said the accident occurred when railroad workers 
tried to switch locomotives on a freight train because the heater in 
one locomotive had failed fortyeight freight cars rolled away 
during the switch traveling nine miles into helena before derailing 
and plowing into a propane tank 
the tank exploded authorities said igniting a rail car filled 
with highly flammable hydrogen peroxide which also exploded but a 
second hydrogen peroxide car was coated with ice in the frigid cold 
apparently preventing it from exploding 
the owner of the propane tank said today that his tank did not 
explode 
only two minor injuries were reported which spengler termed 
miraculous adding we are all speculating what a disaster 
wed have had if that had happened at the rush hour 
it was one of two major train derailments in montana on thursday 
in the second 52 burlington northern grain cars derailed near 
glacier national park spilling more than 5000 tons of corn and 
blocking tracks in both directions the derailment forced amtrak to 
suspend service indefinitely between minnesota and the west coast 
the explosions in helena scattered debris for a quartermile 
radius showering a nearby college campus and sending a 1500pound 
coupling unit through a dormitory roof windows were blasted out of 
homes and businesses up to two miles away 
about 2000 residents were evacuated within a squaremile area 
around the blast site as the temperature hovered near 30 below zero 
power was knocked out in parts of helena for up to six hours 
by thursday night the evacuation order had been lifted although 
parts of neighborhoods near the blast site remained without power 
lamach said the strain on substations carrying rerouted power was 
so heavy that any further problems could force rolling blackouts 
throughout the city 
many homes in helena rely on electricity as their primary source 
of heat with forecasters predicting a high of 20 below zero today 
and a low of minus 38 tonight officials pleaded with residents to 
cut back on all but essential electricity use 
mayor russ ritter who also is vice president of carroll college 
said damage in the city was estimated at 3 million with 2 million 
on the college campus a cement plant near the blast also suffered 
extensive damage authorities said 
ritter said college officials hoped to have the 700 to 800 
students evacuated from carrolls three dormitories back in their 
rooms this weekend and to resume classes monday the students were 
staying in private homes while hundreds of windows in dormitories 
and other campus buildings were being repaired 
in washington the federal railroad administration said the chain 
of events began when a cab heater malfunctioned in a montana rail 
link inc locomotive hauling 48 freight cars over the continental 
divide west of helena 
the crew stopped the train to exchange locomotives and in the 
process set the freight cars loose 
when the exchange of locomotives was complete the crew 
returned to pick up the freight cars only to find they were gone 
the federal agency said the cars rolled into helena setting off 
the days chain of events 
bill brodsky president of montana rail link said proper 
procedure requires train crews to set the brakes on a train before 
cars are disengaged from the locomotive 
he said it was not known whether the air brake system failed to 
function properly or whether the crew did not follow proper 
procedure when they switched locomotives 
theres a considerable amount of investigation that has to be 
done brodsky said we just dont know at this point 
investigators from the national transportation safety board 
arrived thursday night spengler said the fra also planned an 
extensive investigation 
officials asked residents today to report but not move any 
debris they find that might have come from the blast debris has 
been spotted as much as a mile from the site 
were going to give it to the ntsb spengler said they 
need to know what flew where so we dont want the citizens to pick 
it up

it was bad enough when west germany had 
to let foreign beers in now fatty and gristly sausages from other 
countries will be competing alongside the beloved domestic wurst 
farming and meat industry officials are fuming over the ruling by 
the european economic communitys top court forcing west germany to 
import wurst and other meat products that dont measure up to the 
nations purity laws 
this is an extremely regrettable decision said rudolf 
schnieders a spokesman for the west german farmers federation it 
amounts to allowing in products that west german law still forbids 
us to make 
he said west german store shelves will soon be able to stock 
products colored with chemicals and filled with fat blood soya 
and milkbased lactoproteins 
the masscirculation bild tabloid bannered its story on the 
decision with the headline red wurst 
wurst products are a traditional staple in the german diet food 
stores and butcher shops offer a wide range of wurst including 
dozens of varieties of pork and liver sausage compared to the high 
prices of other meat products wurst is relatively economical and 
can be used in many dishes 
the eecs court of justice in luxembourg struck down the west 
german import restrictions on thursday saying they violated fair 
trade agreements among eec members 
the court rejected west germanys contention that plant proteins 
in meat products were less nourishing than allmeat varieties 
while west german law allows some additives to meat products 
their amount and nature are strictly limited 
thursdays decision followed a similar ruling two years ago when 
west germany was forced to allow the import of foreign beer that did 
not conform to the nations brewing purity laws 
that decision drew a loud outcry from the nations brewers who 
pride themselves as being among the worlds best beer makers 
the courts decision thursday drew immediate calls for stricter 
labeling laws to make sure consumers know what theyre buying 
the reaction wasnt all negative however 
the bonnbased west german consumers working group hailed the 
ruling saying foreign products are not necessarily better or 
worse than local products 
the group criticized the west german goverments position on the 
imports it said government resistance was aimed more at reducing 
competition for west german producers than protecting public health 
interests 
the conservative die welt newspaper in bonn in an editorial 
said the governments position was untenable from the start adding 
that those who want to eat soya wurst ought to be able to 
meat store owners in bonn seemed undisturbed by the decision 
our customers are accustomed to the best and the purist 
products said gabriela fischer who works at a specialty butcher 
shop in bonn 
we dont expect that to change fischer said from behind a 
counter wellstocked with a variety of german meat products 
and the wurstloving consumers 
i prefer the german products because thats what im used to 
said a shopper in downtown bonn but id still like the 
opportunity to choose between them and what the french belgians and 
italians have to offer 
its all wurst to me said another consumer using a popular 
german slang phrase indicating indifference

the government claims that a man described as 
an international terrorist for carrying explosives on the new jersey 
turnpike planned three bombings in new york a defense attorney said 
today 
ronald kuby yu kikumuras attorney said that in a presentence 
report filed by the government prosecutors claim his client 
targeted the united nations building a navy recruiting office and 
an area of manhattans garment district 
us attorney samuel a alito alleges kikumura 36 is a member 
of the terrorist japanese red army who was secretly planning attacks 
in retaliation for the 1986 united states bombing of libya alito 
would neither confirm nor deny reports that kikumura was acting at 
the direction of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
kikumura convicted of illegally transporting explosives 
possession of firearms by an alien possession of unregistered 
firearms and carrying false travel documents is to be sentenced 
monday 
alito said he would release the presentence report later today 
we are saying the attacks were planned by the japanese red army 
in retaliation for the bombing of libya alito said any other 
reports are probably coming from the defense attorneys and they are 
incorrect 
the washington post reported in todays editions that alito 
identified kikumuras targets as the three new york sites alito 
said the reports were incorrect 
kuby said this morning and government sources previously have 
confirmed to the associated press that a map of new york was found 
in kikumuras car when he was arrested april 12 
kikumura was arrested at a highway rest area with three 18inch 
pipe bombs in his car the government says the bombs were capable of 
destroying an average building 
kuby said the government claims the map had pinholes in them that 
marked the three targets 
the government says there was three pinholes in the map and 
they were near a us navy recruiting office the united nations and 
the garment district kuby said theyre are identifying the 
targets and were saying its not true 
us district judge alfred j lechner convicted kikumura nov 29 
in a nonjury trial he faces up to 100 years in prison

the government announced a crackdown friday on 
stateowned businesses that have raised prices and cut the 
production of inexpensive products 
the action taking by the council of ministers or cabinet was 
another attempt to ease chronic shortages of consumer goods 
the council said it would require businesses to produce a minimum 
amount of inexpensive consumer goods and would ban price increases 
for items whose consumer properties change insignificantly the 
tass news agency reported 
price increases for new and fashionable goods may not exceed 
15 percent the council decided 
the decision was announced friday but had been approved in early 
january council of ministers spokesman lev voznesensky said in a 
telephone interview it did not affect the burgeoning cooperative 
movement that has arisen under president mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev has said tackling the countrys shortage of consumer 
goods and food is a top priority of his economic restructuring 
program 
because of gorbachevs drive to make each factory pay its own 
way however soviet managers are in effect encouraged to seek the 
highest markup they can on their products and even to curtail 
manufacture of cheap goods that bring little return 
the consumer goods shortages known as deficits have 
plagued the country for years but soviets complain that under 
gorbachev new ones have appeared including inexpensive items 
one of the most talked about examples is soap soviets have 
flooded the official press with angry letters and grumbled privately 
that inexpensive soap has disappeared from shelves while expensive 
bars are plentiful 
i am writing this letter out of happiness that my husband 
according to a waiting list received one bar of household soap and 
a tube of zefir toothpaste one woman wrote sarcastically dec 
28 in the labor daily trud i will take care of it to make sure it 
lasts long because its unknown when such good fortune will visit 
me again 
for stateowned soviet factories and other businesses the 
problem is one of profits they are required to be selffinancing 
meaning they must not spend more money than they take in and will 
not be bailed out by the government 
as a result many businesses have reduced production of 
inexpensive goods that bring in little money and increased output 
of expensive items 
many soviets complain they cant afford the costly alternatives 
on their meager salaries which average about 333 monthly they 
even charge that factory managers are withholding consumer goods 
from the stores to try to sabotage gorbachevs economic reforms 
in october nikolai g belov deputy director of the state 
committee on statistics called the substitution of cheap goods with 
expensive alternatives hidden price hikes and said that along 
with increases in wages inflation had developed he did not give a 
figure for inflation 
another decision of the council of ministers did pertain to 
cooperatives but its immediate effects were uncertain 
tass said cooperatives will be allowed to buy nonscarce foods 
and nonedible commodities presumably from the state but that 
any products made from them should be sold at prices fixed for 
staterun retail shops 
in the past cooperative restaurants and other ventures could 
only buy supplies from other cooperatives or independent sources 
like the countrys peasant markets

if his successors want to obliterate 
the stamp gen alfredo stroessner put on paraguay they will have to 
take down hundreds of pictures rename towns and schools and change 
the thinking habits of two generations 
one of the biggest towns in this landlocked nation is ciudad 
presidente stroessner asuncions airport bears his name and he had 
a huge neon sign erected in its central plaza to blink out the 
declaration stroessner peace work and wellbeing 
he seized power in 1954 and ruled for nearly 35 years longer 
than any leader in the western hemisphere with a canny blend of 
military force political patronage and selfdiscipline 
the redhaired son of a bavarian immigrant whose mother was of 
spanish heritage began his military career at 20 and quickly 
distinguished himself 
during his long rule stroessner oversaw paraguays 
transformation from a backwater with open sewers and no running 
water to a relatively prosperous and modern nation 
then on friday the 76yearold generals era ended as it began 
with a coup by his secondincommand gen andres rodriguez 
stroessner won eight presidential elections despite opposition 
charges of fraud 
even his critics admit he helped stabilize paraguay in the 31 
years before he took over it had 22 presidents 
yet he also was accused of brutal repression and corruption and 
his country became a haven for fugitive nazis drug traffickers and 
former dictators 
among the refugees were josef mengele the auschwitz death camp 
doctor who became a citizen of paraguay in 1959 and was befriended 
by nazi sympathizers edward rochmann the nazi butcher of riga 
ousted president anastasio somoza of nicaragua who was assassinated 
in paraguay drug trafficker joseph august ricorde and croation 
militant and convicted assassin miro baresic 
as convenient tools for keeping order stroessner had his 
perpetual state of siege and law 209 the law for the defense of 
democracy that gave his government the power to make sure there 
was no democracy to defend 
stroessners ubiquitous approach to governing included 
innumerable speeches sometimes lasting hours in which he often 
would list his public works projects in great detail 
among the most impressive of those was the 16 billion itaipu 
dam the worlds largest hydroelectrical project built in 
partnership with neighboring brazil it began producing power in 
1985 
he attended hundreds of groundbreakings and other public 
ceremonies each year even in outlying towns and served regularly 
as a witness at weddings even when he didnt know the bride or groom 
spartan habits and a busy schedule were the reasons for his 
longevity and energy he said stroessner does not smoke and drinks 
little 
public dissatisfaction with the government became increasingly 
evident in the mid1980s when protesters and police clashed in the 
streets 
the roman catholic church and even a faction of stroessners 
colorado party began criticizing the president accusing him of 
repression and demanding democratic reforms 
human rights groups said many of stroessners foes were tortured 
and killed during his early years in power others were jailed 
indefinitely convicted of political crimes or forced into exile 
he was a rabid anticommunist and staunch ally of the united 
states but the generals relations with washington cooled when the 
reagan administration referred to his government as a dictatorship 
stroessner attended paraguays military academy graduating in 
1929 and as a 20yearold lieutenant led a mortar platoon in the 
chaco war with bolivia he distinguished himself for bravery and 
rose quickly through the ranks reaching the rank of general at age 
40 he became army chief of staff in 1951 
in the first four years after seizing power stroessner put down 
five attempted coups by exiled politicians and began dismantling the 
political opposition 
using special powers under the state of siege which was renewed 
every 90 days until last year civilian and military police arrested 
thousands of opponents stroessner referred to virtually all his 
opponents as subversives 
critics say his government promoted a side economy dominated by 
contraband many government and military officials including 
relatives and close associates became rich through ties with 
stroessner 
the general is said to have been ill since a prostate operation 
five months ago his apparent slow recovery increased demands by 
opposition leaders for a transition to democratic rule by the army 
and colorado party 
he and his wife eligia have three children gustavo an air 
force colonel with many business interests hugo alfredo a 
businessman and graciela gonzalez llamas

china on friday formally invited soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to come to beijing for their nations first 
summit in 30 years and the soviet union accepted 
the meeting between gorbachev and deng xiaoping will normalize 
relations that turned hostile in 1960 when their predecessors 
nikita s khrushchev and mao tsetung quarreled over the border and 
leadership of the world communist movement 
the coming chinesesoviet summit will be an event of great 
significance the official xinhua news agency quoted premier li 
peng as telling soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze he said 
the normalization of ties will help promote world peace and 
stability 
its official soviet embassy spokesman viatcheslav duhin 
said at a news briefing he said shevardnadze who has been in china 
since wednesday will make an announcement about the date saturday 
after consulting with deng 
he said only a general timeframe may be announced such as late 
april or midmay so far both sides have said only that the summit 
should be held in the first half of the year 
shevardnadze the first soviet foreign minister to visit china in 
30 years flew friday night to shanghai for his meeting with deng 
duhin said he had heard deng was in shanghai for medical 
examinations but later said he had heard only rumors nothing 
official 
rumors that the 84yearold deng is in poor health have 
frequently circulated in beijing 
after meeting deng shevardnadze will fly back to beijing for a 
news conference before leaving for pakistan 
the soviets released few details of shevardnadzes meetings 
friday with his chinese counterpart qian qichen and the premier 
but they confirmed the issue of cambodia was discussed for a second 
day the chinesesoviet border over which the two countries fought 
briefly in 1969 also was discussed duhin said 
as far as i understand he shevardnadze was satisfied with 
the talks he said some problems still have to be resolved and some 
things are left for mr gorbachev but he was satisfied in 
general duhin said 
xinhua quoted li as telling shevardnadze his visit would give 
impetus to resolving the cambodian issue and remove a major 
obstacle to the normalization of relations between china and the 
soviet union 
china had long refused to normalize ties with moscow until among 
other things sovietallied vietnam ended its occupation of cambodia 
under pressure from the soviet union vietnam has said it will 
pull out by september if a settlement can be reached on the makeup 
of a future government china has agreed in principle to end its 
support to antivietnamese guerrillas by then 
both the soviets and chinese have said during shevardnadzes 
visit they still differ on aspects of the cambodian problem but 
neither has disclosed the specific points of disagreement 
xinhua said li stressed the withdrawal must be carried out under 
international supervision the vietnameseinstalled government in 
cambodia has rejected this in the past 
shevardnadze canceled without explanation a planned sightseeing 
tour friday to the forbidden city the former residence of chinas 
emperors and there was speculation he met with cambodian resistence 
leader prince norodom sihanouk sihanouk spends much of each year in 
beijing and lives at the same state guesthouse as shevardnadze 
duhin said he could not confirm the two met asked if the soviet 
union like china wants sihanouk to head a postoccupation 
government in cambodia duhin said that is up to the cambodians 
duhin said that when gorbachev comes to beijing it will also be 
natural to restore ties between the two countries communist 
parties severed in the 1960s 
gorbachev will be coming in his capacity as soviet president but 
he also is secretarygeneral of the soviet communist party duhin 
said restored party ties would allow for exchanges on ideological 
matters ideological differences were one of the key reasons for the 
1960 split 
now duhin said we dont speak about ideology

when residents of other states telephone 
this spring to ask about vacation prospects in north carolina the 
voice on the other end will belong to a state prisoner 
beginning in march inmates at the north carolina correctional 
institution for women will field inquiries for the division of 
travel and tourism gov jim martin announced thursday 
the 16 or so women will be instructed about vacation 
opportunities and on how to dispense advice the governor said the 
program should provide valuable job training for the inmates while 
improving the efficiency of the touristinquiry service he said 
inmate labor has been used successfully for similar tasks in 
other states said commerce secretary claude pope 
martin drew criticism during his reelection campaign last year 
because of slow responses to outofstate inquiries about vacation 
prospects in north carolina at one point in the summer the backlog 
of unfilled requests for information neared 100000 and critics 
said it was costing the state money in lost tourism dollars 
the division of travel and tourism has already used female 
prisoners to package travel brochures eventually eliminating the 
backlog now they will answer calls as well 
david guth spokesman for the state corrections department said 
the inmates will earn 1 a day the standard rate of pay for state 
jobs done by prisoners 
male inmates can get jobs in printing agriculture and furniture 
making for the state but the states only womens prison has few 
similar jobs 
there are just not a lot of opportunites for our women 
prisoners to work and this seemed like an ideal one guth said 
and from a psychological standpoint women offenders are 
generally better suited to this kind of work guth said male 
offenders are often rougher and committed rougher crimes than women 
offenders and they are not the types you want answering questions 
on the phone 
even women offenders who commit murder generally did so as a 
result of abuse or some other factor and they better fit the 
psychological profile we want for this type of job

as the soviets prepare to leave afghanistan 
moslem guerrillas continue their assaults on government outposts in 
the countryside here is a report by an ap correspondent who spent a 
week with a group of the insurgents in their mountain strongholds 
southwest of kabul 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bent against a wind that 
howls through afghanistans snowcovered mountains moslem 
insurgents with stocking feet covered only in sandals coax camel and 
mule supply convoys over rugged passes 
the guerrillas say the snow that clogs the winding trails will 
confine their military activities mainly to harassment of communist 
troops until the spring thaw 
they say the harsh weather prevents them from launching major 
assaults on afghan cities vacated by the withdrawing soviet army 
winter has turned the imposing peaks that have harbored the us 
and pakistanbacked guerrillas during their 10year war against the 
communists into frigid citadels 
the turbaned fighters huddled in blankets say that until spring 
they will concentrate on weakening government forces by harassing 
them and blocking their overland supply routes of food and fuel 
god willing we are near to freedom said jabbar already a 
seasoned guerrilla with the hardline yunis khalis faction at the 
age of 24 ten years ago he traded his textbooks for a sovietmade 
kalashnikov assault rifle 
but until the spring we cant do much says rahoney wardak 
who along with his two brothers commands several hundred guerrillas 
in afghanistans central and southern provinces of wardak and ghazni 
moscow pledged in a un accord to withdraw all of its more than 
100000 combat troops from afghanistan by feb 15 half were out by 
august and the final pullout in under way 
the marxist peoples democratic party of afghanistan seized power 
in a 1978 coup sparking the moslem insurrection soviet soldiers 
marched in a year later to replace one promoscow government with 
another then remained to help it fight the burgeoning civil war 
negotiations for the accord signed by afghanistan neighboring 
pakistan the soviet union and the united states excluded the 
guerrillas who say it was their own persistence that forced the 
soviets to leave 
the guerrillas some wearing sovietmade fur hats and woolen 
uniform pants captured from fallen government posts said morale 
within their loose ranks is rising peaking while the morale among 
kabul troops is at an ebb 
they are very nervous says wardak with the soviets pulling 
out of the country they cant imagine what will happen to them 
the guerrillas have promised amnesty to defecting troops 
if the soviets really leave regime forces will fall down on 
their own said wardak if they really take their hands off of 
afghanistan then the fighting can be finished in a short time 
in the eastern afghan city of ghazni about 100 miles from the 
pakistan border guerrillas divided into small cells of 15 have 
breached the governments security belt and are inside the city 
limits 
about 2000 government troops are posted in more than 130 
positions in and around ghazni guerrillas say half are from the 
ranks of kabuls elite tsarandoy police and half from the khad state 
security force 
until the soviets pulled out of the city of 100000 last year 
guerrilla access to it was severely curtailed by red army troops who 
stalked the perimeter and ambushed squads 
when the russians were in ghazni every day there was an 
ambush said abdul raqib a commander in the city but he said 
communist troops stay within the confines of their posts when 
returning fire 
a handful of guerrillas one wearing a captured sovietissued 
tank helmet moved within the ghazni city limits to within several 
hundred feet of its ancient balahisar fort which seems inpregnable 
from its perch overlooking the city 
the guerrillas harass troops in the bastion with 82mm rockets 
we dont expect to capture the fort we just want to keep the 
government off guard said raqib within minutes a tank rumbles 
out and indiscriminately blasts away in the direction of the 
guerrillas fire 
he said the only time the troops venture out is when the fort is 
attacked and only then in tanks 
since the red army began withdrawing government posts in the 
countryside began falling to guerrillas the insurgents now move 
freely from neighboring pakistan where much of their weapons and 
ammunition originate 
obscure villages with names like loghari bandi sadr and ya khiel 
are memorials to sovietafghan war dead and testimonials to 
guerrilla tenacity 
rusting sovietmade t62 tanks and military vehicles are 
partially buried in the snow outside bandi sadr in ya khiel 
guerrillas with rocketpropelled grenade launchers slung over their 
shoulders climb over the remains of a sovietmade helicopter 
the guerrillas want the major cities to collapse from within 
we have adopted this strategy because the civilians are afraid 
of retaliatory soviet bombing raids he said 
because of this he said the cities will stay in communist hands 
until the snow melts away and the last of the red army has gone home

a 137yearold covered bridge that 
survived floods tornadoes and an assault by confederate troops was 
done in by a gasoline leak and a car with a hot catalytic converter 
officials said friday 
the 312foot philippi covered bridge the longest twolane 
covered bridge still in use on a federal highway was destroyed by 
fire thursday night

and jumped out when they saw the road on fire 
no one was injured in the incident 
mattaliano who was driving across the bridge when it caught 
fire said i saw a wall of fire coming at me in my rear view 
mirror i got off the bridge in a hurry and called the fire 
department

arched allpoplar frame held together by iron bolts it survived a 
1910 flood and received minor damage in a 1985 blood during the 
civil war fleeing confederate troops tried to burn the bridge to 
prevent union troops from following but the attempt failed 
this bridge is part of the history of west virginia said 
mattaliano it survived floods and tornadoes 
with its loss philippi a town of 3700 people about 20 miles 
southeast of clarksburg was left with only one other bridge and 
mattaliano predicted traffic backups until the covered bridge could 
be repaired

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze enters talks this weekend in a bid to forge a political 
settlement from nine years of futile intervention in afghanistans 
civil war 
his 17hour visit beginning saturday night caps a week of 
hectic diplomatic efforts to avert more bloodshed as the red army 
continues its troop withdrawal from afghanistan 
shevardnadze will be talking to officials of the pakistani 
government which has backed and sheltered the most powerful 
guerrilla forces fighting afghanistans sovietbacked regime 
we hope our talks with the soviet leader will pave the way for 
a peaceful settlement although the situation on the ground in 
afghanistan is depressing a pakistani government spokesman said 
this week 
he was referring to bitter fighting between communist forces and 
moslem guerrillas some of the worst reported attacks have occurred 
along the main soviet withdrawal route from kabul north to the 
soviet border 
moscow signed a un accord last spring providing for removal of 
the approximately 100000 soviet combat troops by feb 15 
although the last units are said to be en route home there still 
are no prospects for peace between kabuls communist government and 
tenacious moslem insurgents armed by the united states pakistan and 
other islamic countries 
all sides agree on the need for a settlement that will produce a 
broadbased government to succeed the current regime which seized 
power in a bloody 1978 coup 
president najib of afghanistan insists that such a new government 
should retain some of his officials 
however the guerrillas consider the communists traitors for 
inviting the soviets to intervene in december 1979 and refuse to 
negotiate with them 
in addition the guerrillas cannot agree among themselves on how 
to form a transitional regime leading to a postwar islamic republic 
of afghanistan 
the insurgents seven major parties sunni moslem groups 
headquartered in pakistan are at odds with shiite moslem insurgent 
groups based in iran over proportional repesentation in a grand 
consultative council that is to lay groundwork for a new 
government 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran flew to pakistan 
earlier this week for two days of talks when he departed thursday 
he said only that the antigovernment forces of afghanistan should 
work together to restore peace 
in addition to backing the insurgents pakistan and iran also 
shelter more than 5 million afghan refugees 
shevardnadze is the highestranking soviet official to visit 
pakistan in more than 20 years he initiated the trip himself said 
a pakistani foreign ministry spokesman on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman did not disclose the agenda

a new preservative is keeping livers for 
transplantation alive outside the body up to three times as long as 
before and could significantly increase the number of successful 
transplants experts said friday 
researchers from the university of pittsburgh reported in 
fridays journal of the american medical association that the 
chilled mixture can preserve human livers outside the body for 24 
hours 
dr satoru todo who headed a sixmember research team at the 
university of pittsburgh said that since the article was written 
the solution has been used to keep livers viable as long as 34 
hours the old time limit was about 9 hours 
given the critical shortage of donor livers and their relatively 
quick deterioration outside the body the new solution could greatly 
aid liver transplantation and increase the distances livers can be 
transported to get the best match between donor organ and recipient 
experts said 
the mixture uwlactobionate has also been used to extend the 
viability of pancreases from six hours to more than 24 hours dr 
james southard a university of wisconsin biochemist who helped 
develop the solution said it has proven as effective for kidneys 
as the conventional method capable of preserving the organ for 30 
to 40 hours 
experimentation with preserving hearts still is limited to 
animals so far dog hearts have been preserved for 12 hours 
compared to the conventional three to four hours he said 
its badly needed in hearts southard said 
under the older preservation method livers are chilled and 
flushed with eurocollins solution a mix of electrolytes and 
glucose 
the new solution which includes hormones amino acids and 
sugars is being tested on liver transplant patients in pittsburgh 
wisconsin and 20 to 30 other centers worldwide an additional 100 or 
so transplant centers are using it for kidneys and pancreases 
uwlactobionate has not been cleared by the food and drug 
administration for general use developers applied for fda approval 
last august and approval could come at any time southard said 
the remarkable effectiveness of the uw solution has 
revolutionized liver transplantation at almost every level todo 
wrote in the journal the enhanced margin of safety has permitted 
more effective use of organs that can be stored safely while waiting 
for operating room facilities or personnel to become available 
in their study todos group found that transplants of 185 livers 
preserved with the new solution for up to 24 hours were more 
successful than 180 livers preserved up to 9 hours with the old 
mixture the researchers measured success by the need for another 
transplant and the rate of clotting of the main artery leading to 
the liver 
todo said the wisconsin solution limits swelling in the 
transplanted organ 
one liver preserved with the wisconsin solution but not included 
in the study was shipped last fall from toronto to paris and 
successfully transplanted southard said 
it was the first intercontinental sharing of livers he said 
another liver was shipped from the united states to brazil 
since the solution was first used in august 1987 at the 
university of wisconsin doctors there have used it to preserve 
about 80 livers and 50 pancreases according to southard as a 
result surgeons can now schedule liver transplants at 8 am rather 
than rush around in the middle of the night 
if you do it at midnight after youve done a full days work 
with the emergency crew rather than the nurses and 
anaesthesiologists who should be there its not as safe for the 
patient southard said 
in pittsburgh about 600 livers have been transplanted after 
being preserved in the mixture tudo said liver transplant surgeons 
at both institutions have abandoned the more conventional 
preservation method

a huge soviet convoy rolled out of 
kabul in a snowstorm friday and afghan and soviet sources said no 
more than 1500 red army soldiers would remain in afghanistan once 
the convoy reached soviet soil 
the column of trucks and tanks began their 260mile journey north 
up the salang highway under cover of darkness said the sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the 1000 to 1500 soviet soldiers still in kabul will guard the 
citys airport during food airlifts that are to continue for at 
least a week the sources said 
under an accord sponsored by the united nations to end the 
soviets nineyear intervention in afghanistan the red army has 
until feb 15 to withdraw 
guerrillas fighting the promarxist government since 1978 are not 
a party to the agreement and say they will take over when the 
soviets are gone 
president najib however said thursday that his conscript army 
believed to number 140000 was prepared to repel the insurgents 
a united nations human rights report issued friday said the 
soviet union and afghan army had violated international law during 
the withdrawal by sowing mines many of them in civilian areas 
un workers who visited afghanistan in june found soviet mines 
in agricultural areas rivers and villages and said the number of 
explosives ranged from 5 million to 30 million according to the 
report to the un economic and social council 
mines designed to cause unnecessary suffering have been widely 
dispersed throughout afghanistan the report said this is a 
clear violation of customary and conventional international law 
many diplomats say the afghan civil war will become a bloodbath 
when the soviets are gone and most major western countries 
including the united states closed their embassies in kabul this 
week 
heavy snow friday delayed the departure of british diplomats and 
their staff who were to leave on a chartered plane for india 
government officials in london said there was no immediate word on 
when they would leave 
soviet flags friday were replaced with the red green and black 
flags of afghanistan and afghan soldiers took over the soviet 
outposts along the salang highway 
afghan soldiers said the soviet convoy snaked through the salang 
pass and the mountains where guerrillas have pounded departing 
contingents with artillery fire in recent days 
the sources said they did not know how many vehicles or soldiers 
were in the latest convoy but that it took three hours for it to 
depart 
early this week western and soviet diplomats said about 15000 
soviet soldiers remained 
a genevabased un office coordinating relief for afghanistan 
said friday that it planned to airlift food and medicine to kabul 
whose population has swollen to 2 million because of refugees 
streaming into the city 
un officials in geneva speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed an agreement in principle had been reached with afghan 
guerrillas not to shoot down incoming relief planes in return the 
united nations has pledged to send more relief supplies into regions 
controlled by the guerrillas 
also on friday officials in neighboring pakistan denied claims 
by kabul that pakistani jet fighters shot down an afghan passenger 
plane 
official radio kabul monitored in the pakistan capital of 
islamabad thursday night said the plane was carrying food suppplies 
from kabul to khost 12 miles from the pakistan border when it 
strayed off course tuesday 
it said pakistan ignored the pilots call for help and shot it 
down killing all five passengers and a crew of nine 
pakistani military spokesman riaz ullah said the afghan plane 
crashed inside pakistani territory apparently after running out of 
fuel during a possible attempt to defect 
the united states and pakistan back the guerrillas who began 
fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 the soviet soldiers 
entered the country in december 1979 and grew in number to an 
estimated 115000 by the time the pullout began may 15

inflation is 1000 percent 
corruption charges abound hospitals are closed because staffs 
havent been paid 
does anyone worry 
next week during lent sure but right now its carnival 
brazils famous annual party runs from saturday through wednesday 
and the nations 140 million people at least those in rio seem 
determined as usual to set aside their woes for a few days 
carnival is a time of renewal it is a balsam said trajano 
ribeiro president of the municipal tourism board riotur brazil 
has serious problems but thats no reason not to enjoy carnival 
the scala nightclub site of some of the most raucous carnival 
balls announce plans to stock a ton of filet mignon 650 pounds of 
shrimp 210 cases of scotch and 2600 gallons of draft beer 
brazilians are naturally happy people said roberto coure 
president of rios monte libano club another center of carnival 
fun carnival emotion is a great phenomenon 
i just spent a month in england and the people over there 
looked sad he said and they dont have inflation 
coures main ballroom has a silverandgold arabian nights motif 
this year 
major carnival balls draw 600010000 people each and are 
covered on live television among the best known are the grande gala 
g for homosexuals and the bum bum ball featuring a competition of 
paintings rendered on the fundaments of young women 
ribeiro said a special police protection system for 
foreigners had been established because of increasing street crime 
in rio and suggested visitors stay together in organized groups 
it is not recommended for foreigners to go about on their 
own he said 
some americans west germans italians israelis and argentines 
who arrived early got an unpleasant initiation when a band of 
thieves armed with pistols and crowbars invaded their hotel on 
ipanema beach 
they shouted happy carnival broke open guest safes in the 
lobby and made off with 190000 worth of cash travelers checks 
credit cards cameras and airline tickets 
rios samba school parade held in two 15hour sessions 
sunday and monday nights is the undisputed highlight of carnival 
each of the 18 schools neighborhood clubs generally located 
in poor districts where most residents are black puts as many as 
5000 dancers in dazzling costumes on the six blocks of openair 
paradeway known as the sambadrome 
schools compose their own melodies and lyrics each year each has 
a theme for its constumes and floats and its own rhythm beaters who 
drive the display with a powerful africantropical beat on hundreds 
of drums and other percussion instruments 
themes usually are about mystical kingdoms or events in brazilian 
history but this year ones schools lyrics deal with the racism 
many say still exists in this huge racially diverse nation 
one part translated from portuguese goes im black yes 
freedom and poetry and in todays society we are fighting for 
equality 
a continuing controversy is whether the samba parade is being 
taken away from the people for the benefit of entrepreneurs 
riotur charges foreigners the equivalent of 213 for the best 
parade seats but also returns 150000 to each samba school to help 
pay for costumes and floats ribeiro said this means ordinary 
brazilians can participate in carnival 
in the other 51 weeks of the year most of the dancers and 
musicians are anonymous toilers for the government minimum wage 
equal to about 2 a day 
a newly formed independent samba school league has negotiated 
for greater revenue from television and advertising rights for the 
parade ribeiro said the league wants to turn carnival into a 
media event show biz 
the head of the samba league a banker of the 
illegalbuttolerated numbers game called capt guimaraes told a 
newspaper the samba schools are the ones who provide the show 
the authorities want us to hold the cows legs while they take the 
milk

each of the federal governments three branches will study the 
federal judiciarys structure its relationship to state courts and 
the types of cases it should be handling

they should avoid ideological discussions about the role of federal 
courts so that their efforts are not perceived as 
courtstripping attempts 
past efforts in congress to limit the purview of federal courts

prayer or abortion have proved controversial

gen andres rodriguez is a farmers son 
who found his niche in the military rising to command its most 
elite unit and ultimately overthrowing the western hemispheres 
longestruling leader 
rodriguez was secondincommand to president alfredo stroessner 
the military dictator and personal friend he ousted friday 
rodriguez who is believed to be 64 grew up in the town of san 
salvador 250 miles east of the capital he left his rustic 
beginnings for a career in the military and in 1961 was named 
commander of the prestigious first army corps 
instead of the farm his home is a plush mansion outside the 
capital 
the first army corps one of three is the biggest and best 
equipped in the army whose overall size numbers about 12500 
rodriguez and stroessner were friends as well as professional 
colleagues the two families became joined when rodriguezs 
daughter marta married stroessners son alfredo 
it was not clear why rodriguez chose to unseat stroessner or why 
he acted when he did 
when he struck it was with great force rodriguez moved in on 
the headquarters of the police and presidential guard with 40 to 50 
tanks plus mortars cannons recoilless rifles heavy machine guns 
and manpower 
diplomatic and political observers link the strike by rodriguez 
a stocky man of medium height with an order he received from 
stroessner to become defense minister or at least step down as army 
commander rodriguez refused 
opposition leader domingo laino speculated it was because the 
general privately sided with the traditionalist wing of the ruling 
colorado party which has called for a transition to a more 
democratic government and sought to distance itself from stroessner 
rodriguez is wellknown in the capital but the first time many 
paraguayans heard of him was friday morning when he said in his 
clipped commanding voice over the radio that stroessner was under 
arrest and he was taking command of the country from this moment

chinese artists held an exhibition friday night to 
raise money for the relatives of jailed dissidents rekindle a 
oncebanned literary magazine and set up a foundation to publish 
controversial political essays 
the artists who live in china and abroad were once members of 
the star group an underground art and political society that 
flourished briefly during a period of relative political freedom 10 
years ago 
the exhibition was held in the apartment of a western european 
diplomat and attended mostly by foreigners and chinese artists 
at least nine of the 25 works of art were sold raising about 
5405 for the group said ren wanding a chinese dissident who was 
jailed from 1979 to 1983 for advocating multiparty democracy all 
the buyers were foreigners 
ren said some of the money will be used to help people whose 
relatives were jailed for political reasons 
amnesty international says thousands of people are in jail in 
china for their beliefs religious political or otherwise 
wei jingsheng an electrician who was active in the 1979 
democracy wall movement and xu wenli a leading figure in the 
prodemocracy april 5 forum are two of the best known political 
prisoners both were sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1979 for 
counterrevolutionary activities 
ren said some money also will go to the rebirth of today 
magazine a periodical of experimental poetry and short stories that 
was published underground from 1979 until it was banned in late 1980 
during its time the organizers of today escaped jail terms 
because the periodical was purely literary and avoided politics bei 
dao a wellknown poet said the new magazine would follow the same

news of a secret twoday meeting 
at a west german hotel reveals that after years of baleful silence 
northern ireland politicians are talking again across the communal 
divide 
but the sudden glare of publicity threatens to push them back 
into their trenches 
for warweary northern irelanders the report that dominated 
bbctv news thursday night was electrifying leading catholic and 
protestant politicians had spent two days in a duisburg hotel in 
october working out a proposed formula for jointly governing the 
british province under a form of autonomy known as devolved 
government 
but by friday party leaders from all sides had poured cold water 
on the notion accusing the bbc of overdramatizing its story 
john hume who as leader of the social democratic and labor party 
is the provinces top catholic politician called it nonsense 
ian paisley the hardline protestant leader of the democratic 
unionist party and james molyneaux leader of the official 
unionists the larger more moderate protestant party also denied 
any negotiations had taken place on the form of northern irelands 
future government 
the meeting was arranged by an unidentified german clergyman and 
was attended by paisleys deputy peter robinson jack allen of the 
official unionists austin currie of the mainly catholic sdlp and 
gordon mawhinney deputy leader of the alliance a small strictly 
nonsectarian party it was followed up over the past four months by 
talks in northern ireland 
sinn fein the irish republican armys political wing was not 
invited 
mawhinney insisted friday that despite the poohpoohing from 
party leaders progress was made 
the mere act of talking was significant he said in an interview 
because stalemate has prevailed ever since the signing of the 1985 
angloirish agreement which gave dublin a say in northern irelands 
affairs 
protestant politicians who regard the agreement as a gross 
foreign intrusion into the affairs of their 1 million followers 
have refused to negotiate with the sdlp unless the accord is shelved 
the sdlp having helped midwife the pact on behalf of the 
600000strong catholic minority predictably rejects that condition 
thus for more than three years northern ireland politics has 
amounted to little more than a prolonged sulk leaving the field 
open to the ira and its extremist protestant counterparts since the 
agreement was signed 258 more lives have been lost 
what was different about duisburg in many respects was that the 
parties agreed that instead of us all going home and putting our 
feet up we would see if there was any basis for moving forward 
said mawhinney 
a basis was found he said in a form of words which the 
participants felt they could present to their leaders for further 
discussion 
he said it entailed agreement on devolved government as the best 
way forward and putting the angloirish agreement aside for a fixed 
period while negotiations continued at a higher level 
currie confirmed that he and the three other parties agreed that 
to facilitate dialogue it was worth considering a suspension of 
the main workings of the agreement the periodic meetings between 
british and irish ministers to discuss ulsters affairs 
the angloirish agreement broke the irish logjam by forcing the 
protestants to realize that they had lost their traditional veto 
over any compromise with the catholics 
but it created another logjam downstream said mawhinney 
a key question is whether the irish and british governments 
which signed the agreement are willing to see it put on ice the 
widely held assumption here is that they will go along with anything 
that offers real prospects for peace 
another question is whether the publicity has killed the 
initiative already angry words have been exchanged among the 
participants over who was to blame for the story getting out 
the nature of northern irish politics is that progress can 
only be made behind closed doors and when it comes out into the 
open people tend to scurry back to secure positions said peter 
barry irelands former foreign minister who helped negotiate the 
1985 agreement 
mawhinney said the duisburg parley reflected a new realism 
among northern ireland politicians a willingness to look at the 
other side of the equation to say yes i recognize that you have a 
problem but you must recognize that i have a problem too and how 
can we overcome these problems

vice president dan quayle told 
the salvadoran government today that democracy eocnomic growth and 
respect for human rights go hand in hand as he pledged a 
continuing relationship between the bush administration and el 
salvador 
in a toast during a luncheon for government officials at the home 
of president jose napoleon duarte quayle repeatedly mentioned 
commitment to human rights as a guiding principle for democratic 
government 
earlier today quayle was urged by archbishop arturo rivera y 
damas acting as a gobetween for a peace proposal by 
antigovernment rebels to consider the dissidents point of view 
quayle said in his toast that under duartes fiveyear term el 
salvadors human rights record has improved but that there are 
challenges yet to be met and hurdles that must be overcome 
and the antidemocratic forces of the extreme left and the 
extreme right are ideologically exhausted and weakened he said 
but he added theyre still out there 
he assured the salvadorans of the commitment of the united states 
to a shared vision of a secure democratic future in el salvador 
this is a vision of democracy economic growth and respect for 
human rights the three go hand in hand quayle said 
he made the comments following morning meetings with 
representatives of duartes christian democratic party and the 
rightist republican national alliance or arena two of the parties 
vying to win next months presidential election 
during his meeting with the archbishop quayle said he was in san 
salvador in the interest of helping salvadorans move toward peace 
and democracy said david beckwith quayles press secretary 
strifetorn el salvador relies heavily on us aid of some 15 
million per day 
flying to san salvador from caracas quayle was taken by 
helicopter from the airport to a point near the residence of 
ambassador william walker which was surrounded by security 
personnel he then got into a motorcade where press vans were 
equipped with oneinchthick windows against possible attack 
quayle was expected to discuss with duarte and other political 
leaders a proposal in which the rebels offered for the first time to 
participate in elections if certain conditions are agreed to 
state department officials view the proposal as significant 
because it marks a departure from the rebels demand for 
powersharing but say a decision on whether to act on it is in the 
hands of duarte and his government 
as part of their proposal the rebels want the march 19 elections 
postponed until september while that would violate the 
constitutions election timetable a state department official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said outright rejection of the 
plan could be used by us opponents of aid to argue that duartes 
government is not serious about seeking peace 
it would present some obstacles to winning continued aid the 
official said 
quayles talks thursday with presidents of costa rica honduras 
and guatemala were among the 10 bilateral sessions he held during a 
hectic visit to caracas for the inauguration of venezuelas new 
president carlos andres perez 
costa rican president oscar arias author of a regional peace 
plan signed in august 1987 by the five central american presidents 
said after meeting with quayle that he was optimistic the bush 
administration would allow further regional diplomatic efforts to 
proceed instead of moving to restock the nicaraguan rebels with 
weapons 
mr quayle told me they want to give us a chance arias said 
quayle told reporters there is now a hiatus with no us move 
to renew funding for the contras battling nicaraguas leftist 
government 
although he contended that nicaraguas record on civil liberties 
has regressed since congress cut off military aid to the contras he 
said we are going to give the diplomatic route a chance 
this is a testing period for us to see if nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega is serious about holding free elections and 
implementing democratic reforms he agreed to in the arias plan 
asked how the bush administration would differ from president 
reagans hardline procontra policies arias adviser francisco 
aguilarurbina said bush is more pragmatic and that latins feel 
positively about his presidency so far 
quayle criticized former president jimmy carter who also 
attended the venezuelan inauguration for meeting with ortega on 
wednesday 
obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads 
of state we dont meet with it has a chance of complicating 
matters quayle said at a news conference 
the us government has refused to hold talks with nicaragua 
carter said ortega had shared with him and perez a new peace 
proposal regarding the contras 
carter did not release details and us officials said they had 
heard only general components of the ortega proposal they said it 
dealt with resettlement of the contras into nicaragua once peace is 
declared 
carter also talked at length with cuban president fidel castro at 
the inauguration ceremony 
arias met at length with castro asking his support for the 
regional peace initiative president mario soares of portugal also 
met with castro shortly before soares meeting with quayle thursday 
night 
quayle said he was pleased with his own meetings 
you can feel the good chemistry he said adding that the 
latin leaders appeared to be positive about dealing with the 
bush administration

an army general today seized power from 
president alfredo stroessner in a coup that ended the military 
dictators 34year grip on power and reportedly left hundreds of 
soldiers and civilians dead 
gen andres rodriguez who was stroessners secondincommand and 
whose daughter is married to stroessners son said in a nationwide 
radio address the commanderinchief was under house arrest 
rodriguez later took the oath as provisional president then 
swore in a ninemember cabinet that included seven civilians one 
active general and one retired general 
a message read over national radio and reportedly signed by 
stroessner said the 76yearold ruler resigned as president and army 
commander 
sources said the coup occurred after rodriguez was ordered to 
resign 
stroessner who was the western hemispheres longestruling 
leader was given 12 hours to leave paraguay and chose exile in 
chile the roman catholic station radio caritas reported 
in santiago chile foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz said 
no asylum request for stroessner had been received 
about a dozen bodies of soldiers loyal to stroessner lay outside 
the headquarters of the presidential guard and radio stations 
reported by military and civilian casualties but there was no 
official death toll 
opposition leader domingo laino put the death toll at 250 
benjamin fernandez of the roman catholic station radio caritas 
said there are reports of more than 100 dead but that the 
figures were speculative 
the gray colonialstyle police headquarters was pockmarked with 
bullet holes its windows shattered armed soldiers manned 
roadblocks in front of the nearby national palace which was not 
damaged and at checkpoints throughout the city of 900000 
stroessners arrest followed eight hours of gunfights and cannon 
fire in the capitals streets between rebel soldiers backed by tanks 
and mortars and forces loyal to stroessner witnesses reported 
seeing 40 to 50 tanks moving through the city streets late thursday 
when the uprising began 
order has been reestablished and with it all the human values 
of our entire constitution will be respected said rodriguez a 
career army officer allied with a faction of the ruling colorado 
party favoring democratic reforms 
i communicate to you that gen stroessner has surrendered and 
finds himself in perfect health deprived of liberty being shown 
all human rights at a residence within the first army corps he 
said in the radio broadcast speaking in a clipped authoritarian 
voice 
diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup that 
rodriguez for unknown reasons apparently was ordered to give up 
his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister he 
refused 
the rebellion also followed a dispute within the colorado party 
between a militant prostroessner faction and traditionalists who 
wanted to distance the 100yearold party from the aging dictator 
richard alan white a senior research fellow at the 
liberalleaning council on hemispheric affairs in washington said 
rodriguez acted in order to prevent others including stroessners 
son from seizing power as the aged and sickly dictator was losing 
his grip 
white who just returned from a trip to paraguay said 
rodriguezs talk of democratization and human rights is merely a 
camouflage for his intention to continue the stroessner regimen 
between cars with tires shot flat several large bloodstains 
dried in the oppressive heat of this tropical city 
were happy the government is gone but were sad that people 
had to die said one woman in the capital she said the shelling 
and small arms fire forced her to spend thursday night in a 
restaurant 
radio itapiru reported that 32 government officials including 
stroessners longtime private secretary mario abdo benitez were 
arrested and being held at a naval base 
a member of the 3000man presidential guard who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said there was practically no battle they 
didnt even ask us to surrender they just opened fire and battered 
down the gates with small tanks 
in washington a senior us official said the united states was 
monitoring the situation we dont like violence of course and 
we hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy 
stroessner was the absolute ruler of this landlocked south 
american country since seizing power in a 1954 military coup that 
ousted president federico chavez 
stroessner was army commanderinchief doled out political 
favors and jobs to his allies and labeled his opponents marxist 
subversives 
under stroessner paraguay developed a record of providing refuge 
to fugitive nazis ousted dictators and drug traffickers the list 
includes auschwitz death camp doctor josef mengele the ousted 
nicaraguan dictator gen anastasio somoza debayle and heroin 
kingpin joseph august ricorde 
a staunch us ally stroessner was criticized for human rights 
abuses by washington and in 1986 the reagan administration labeled 
his government a dictatorship he has been in poor health since 
prostate surgery five months ago 
radio reports quoted an infantry division commander brig gen 
ismael otazu as saying the uprising was not insubordination but a 
correction 
col dionisio cabello told march 1 radio he was the new air force 
commander and pledged allegiance to rodriguez who is believed to be 
64 years old 
infantry divisions in three interior cities villarrica san 
juan bautista and concepcion and an air force unit sided almost 
immediately with the rebel soldiers radio reports indicated

a state senator has introduced a bill to 
repeal a 1923 law that if enforced he says would have caused the 
arrest of almost every dancing teenager in the state at least since 
the dawn of rock n roll 
the old blue law among other things requires that public 
dancing places be brightly illuminated it outlaws dances that are 
indecent and immoral or are characterized by immodest 
motion of the body and prohibits public dances from 1 am to 6 
am and from 1 am and noon on sunday 
what weve in effect been doing is practicing behavior thats 
not legal said sen jerome hughes 59 
it was hughes daughter maggie towle who brought the archaic 
law to his attention shes the associate administrator at the 
coffman memorial union on the university of minnesota campus where 
officials have puzzled over then ignored the statute for years 
i can tell you right now that the number of dances with bright 
lights at coffman is none towle said 
although hughes confesses to dancing in rooms that were merely 
partially lit his daughter doubts it could have gotten him into 
too much trouble 
my mom and dad dance a lot towle said but they wouldve 
never been arrested under that law

officials from 22 african countries called 
on the continents nations friday to do more to save the lives of 
pregnant women hundreds of thousands of whom die each year 
more than 1000 pregnant women die around the world each day from 
complications during pregnancy or childbirth or from illegal 
abortions according to a study by the united nations childrens 
fund 
the study was the focus of a fiveday conference of 
frenchspeaking african nations which called the deaths the shame 
of modern times 
what a woman loses life in giving life is as intolerable as it 
is unjust a conference declaration said 
about 450 pregnant women per 100000 die each year in 
underdeveloped nations including those in africa compared with 30 
per 100000 in the west 
health ministers doctors and representatives of african womens 
organizations were among the participants of the conference which 
ended friday the sponsors were unicef the world health 
organization and the world bank 
they said the conference was part of an effort to get third world 
countries to devote more time and resources to saving the lives of 
pregnant women 
a similar conference was held two years ago in nairobi kenya 
for englishspeaking african nations 
participants said africa should try to reduce the number of women 
dying in childbirth by 50 percent in the next 25 years 
according to un studies african women furnish 80 percent of 
the food their families eat 
they gather firewood carry water plant gardens prepare food 
care for animals and look after children and the elderly the women 
work at least 12 to 16 hours a day and experts on third world 
development say they hold the key to helping nations struggling out 
of poverty 
yet african women also are the most vulnerable members of their 
society said edward jaycox world bank vice president for africa 
when food is in short supply she is the one who goes without 
when there is no doctor she is the one who must deal with the risks 
associated with frequent pregnancies he told the conference 
at least 63 percent of pregnant women in africa suffer from 
anemia and vitamin deficiencies that affect the health of their 
infant according to a unicef report more than 45 percent of the 
women deliver their children without medical help or midwives the 
report said 
throughout africa women also marry young and often have their 
first child before age 15 
the major problem in africa today is preventing children from 
having children said dr frederick sai the world banks 
population specialist and women of 45 or 50 who are having their 
eighth or ninth child are dying from it

a federal appeals court friday upheld the 
authority of the environmental protection agency to make agreements 
with pesticide manufacturers permitting inventories to be used up 
after federal pesticide licenses are cancelled 
us district court judge louis oberdorfer had enjoined epa from 
permitting velsicol inc the only manufacturer of chlordane and the 
related chemical heptachlor from selling the chemicals under an 
agreement that included cancellation of the companys license 
that september 1987 agreement provided that no more chlordane or 
heptachlor could be sold by velsicol after april 15 1988 epa was 
concerned however that it might not be able to win agreements to 
end the use of other pesticides if oberdorfers decision stood 
the chemicals have been used to drive termites away from the 
foundations of houses epa believes the pesticides pose a high risk 
of cancer to people living in homes treated that way 
oberdorfer held that epa must examine the risks and benefits of 
using up existing stocks epa maintained that it was not required to 
make such an examination because it was clear the agreement with 
velsicol would result in a dramatic reduction in use and less 
risk to the public than any other course of action 
the agency said it could not justify an emergency ban stopping 
all use immediately and in any lesser proceeding to end use the 
manufacturer could continue to produce and sell the chemical 
meaning that more would be introduced into the environment than 
would be the case if inventories were used up under the agreement 
at the time of the agreement inventories were estimated at 
110000 pounds about a two months supply

aerospace executive ed greer has resurfaced 
seven years after abandoning his wife two sons and the corporate 
life to become the vagabond beach bum his yuppie colleagues 
fantasized about 
anyone with any attachment to the human race couldnt do what 
he did said the wife he left behind i will never forgive him 
for what he did to the boys 
although greer was on the fast track at hughes aircraft in el 
segundo the young executive hated the whitecollar pinstripe 
world on sept 10 1981 he left without a word 
i felt trapped i didnt like my life greer said friday from 
houston in a telephone interview with the associated press its 
something that is hard for me to imagine even now leaving and 
walking away from it all 
this wasnt planned and certainly wasnt rational 
before he disappeared he told a coworker never become too 
good at something you hate theyll make you do it the rest of your 
life 
the greed as for the pretty girls 
unfortunately about the time you get to know them theyve gone 
back to muncie 
he got hearns name social security number and resume by placing 
a newspaper ad for an engineering job that the man answered 
he said he filled in fbi agents on those details when they caught 
him under an agreement with the government he must stay out of 
trouble for a year or face charges in the case 
now to an extent he must face the past 
the woman he left behind kit clark is remarried and living 
somewhere in northern california after divorcing greer in absentia 
the times said she told him he could contact his sons now 9 and 16 
in addition to being fedup with struggling up the corporate 
ladder greer said he left because there were pressures from his 
wife and from his father whose offer of 100000 for information 
about greers whereabouts set private investigators scurrying across 
the country 
asked if he ever came close to calling his kids greer said 
yes many times 
i just tried not to think about it he said adding he has 
written his sons but hasnt talked to them or received a response 
is he happy with his new life im certainly not satisfied im 
happy now with the work im doing but i wouldnt recommend doing 
this disappearing to anyone else 
after he left his former colleagues some of whom said they 
wished they had the courage to do the same began throwing annual 
parties often showing up at them wearing ed greer masks greer now 
40 said he wasnt aware of the celebrations which attracted 
national media attention if theres another he wont make an 
appearance 
as for his former coworkers reactions include both relief and 
disappointment 
im glad hes ok said sherry mccullough greers former 
secretary who spoke with him by telephone on thursday but it is 
kind of disappointing that the mystery is gone im not sure we can 
have any more parties unless we invite him im not sure he would 
want to come

hundreds of buddhist monks in tibet paid last 
respects to the panchen lama on friday with ancient chants and 
prayers for reincarnation of the man who served as tibets top 
religious leader in china 
about 800 monks lined up in the early morning outside the panchen 
lamas official residence in xigaze tibets secondlargest city 
according to the official xinhua news agency they filed by to view 
the body of the government loyalist and presented white silk scarves 
as a sign of respect 
other monks chanted ancient scriptures praising the panchen lama 
and prayed for his early reincarnation and tens of thousands of 
faithful paid homage to a photograph of the panchen lama in an 
adjoining hall 
the panchen lama who died of a heart attack jan 28 in xigaze 
was revered as a reincarnation of the buddhist god amitabha he 
served as the main tibetan spokesman for the chinese government 
xinhua said his body would be preserved by being treated with 
precious medicines and bound with fine silks and satins which will 
be changed regularly it said golden powder will be painted on 
his face 
the body will then be placed in a special shrine to be built in 
his honor at xigazes tashi lump monastery his religious seat 
his predecessors also were preserved but their funeral shrines 
were destroyed and their bodies dismembered by leftists during 
chinas 196676 cultural revolution 
a memorial service for the panchen lama also was held in tibets 
capital of lhasa xinhua said it said hundreds of monks nuns and 
local government attended 
tibets communist party secretary hu jintao praised the panchen 
lama for playing an enormous and incomparable role in putting 
into effect party policies and managing tibets temples and 
monasteries under a socialist mantle 
xinhua also quoted hu as urging tibetans to honor the panchen 
lamas appeals and strive for a united prosperous and culturally 
advanced new tibet 
the panchen lama who ranked second in tibetan buddhism after the 
dalai lama consistently supported chinese rule in tibet 
by contrast the dalai lama who fled to india in 1959 after an 
abortive tibetan uprising against chinese rule has harshly 
criticized chinese repression and demanded freedom for his people 
the chinese communists occupied the fabled mountain land in 1950 as 
they consolidated national control after their revolution 
the panchen lama who was educated by communists from age 11 
criticized separatists without mentioning the dalai lama by name he 
denounced monks and lay tibetans who held repeated antichinese 
protests in lhasa over the past year and a half three of those 
protests ended in violent clashes 
however the panchen lama spoke out against harsh treatment of 
tibetans and urged the government to promote tibetans with talent 
not simply lackeys 
the official media has given heavy coverage to his death 
recalling his support for chinese rule in tibet 
officials have refused to disclose funeral plans it was not 
clear if fridays ceremonies in tibet were meant to serve that 
purpose 
a ceremony is again likely when the body is placed in his shrine 
which will take months to build

two consumer watchdog groups said friday the 
agriculture department should allow more public review of a proposal 
to overhaul federal inspection at meat and poultry processing plants 
the government accountability project and the community nutrition 
institute said in a statement filed with usdas food safety and 
inspection service that the changes should have an adequate 
scientific basis and that swift and meaningful penalties should 
be imposed on processors who violate the rules 
usda issued the proposal last november to carry out a 1986 law 
that would get tougher on inspections of the most troublesome 
processing plants but ease up on those with good records 
the agency estimated that over time its inspection force would be 
reduced by half by retirements and resignations the program would 
rely increasingly on good plants policing themselves 
but the two organizations said the proposed rules fail meet the 
1986 laws requirements and are unacceptably general and vague to 
the point where they only propose a structure for relaxing 
inspection but not intensifying it where needed 
also they charged the agencys own evaluation of pilot projects 
using the proposed system showed serious deficiencies 
the regulations were developed and drafted with no consultation 
with consumer or other public interest groups or inspectors the 
statement said 
as proposed the new rule would apply to plants that make 
frankfurters beef stew chicken soup luncheon meats and scores of 
other processed items that include meat and poultry the proposed 
rule would not apply to slaughter plants which would remain under 
continuous federal inspection

after four days of questioning prospective 
jurors the judge and lawyers in oliver norths irancontra trial 
are learning that even in this news hub there are people who dont 
give a darn about whats happening 
by the end of fridays session us district judge gerhard a 
gesell had declared 24 women and eight men ignorant enough of 
norths 1987 congressional testimony to earn them a shot at being on 
the jury twenty didnt pass that muster 
gesell had wanted a panel of 50 from which the jury of 12 and six 
alternates will be chosen maybe next week but friday he reduced 
that target to 45 the panel will consist only of those who persuade 
the judge and lawyers they did not watch north on television hear 
him on the radio or read about him in newspapers and magazines 
have you heard of colonel north gesell asked a nurses 
assistant no she said 
have you read of colonel north he asked 
she said no she only read her horoscope 
does the irancontra matter carry any meaning for you 
no she said 
but gesell dismissed the woman when she said she could not find 
the defendant guilty because i wasnt there 
a supervisor of banquet cleanup at a posh white housearea hotel 
said im the type of person who once the news comes on i switch 
it off and when she was asked if she heard north testify on 
television she said with due respect to colonel north i found 
the conversation boring and walked away 
to that north lawyer brendan sullivan responded he doesnt 
mind at all 
north at the defense table smiled 
those chosen friday included a woman who said she doesnt pay 
attention to news because it is depressing 
i dont like the news she said and when her mother who 
does turns it on she said i go to my room and lock my door 
sullivan pressed her for her recollections of the six days in 
which north testified before the irancontra investigative 
committees at those joint hearings in the summer of 1987 the 
former marine lieutenant colonel detailed many of the activities 
that are now charged to him as crimes 
he was on tv all day long on all morning all afternoon and 
rerun at night sullivan said 
it made me mad he was on all the channels the woman said 
i did not look at it at all my mother probably did i call 
her the news media she said 
one woman who publishes newsletters and the like said she was 
trying to get her business going at that time and by the time the 
day was over and the news came on i was out walking my dog 
but she did know that north had a blonde secretary fawn hall a 
boss named john poindexter that he was a godfearing man and that 
he had something to do with money and arms on an international scale 
i know people either are for him or against him said the 
woman whose office is on capitol hill she was excused 
a female military personnel clerk at the pentagon qualified after 
testifying i hate bad news a legal secretary in the federal 
trade commission didnt qualify because she saw the first few 
minutes of norths testimony before changing the channel

sunday with much fanfare but few viewers 
when media magnate rupert murdoch launches his fourchannel sky 
television network the number of channels available to most britons 
will instantly double 
but the equipment needed to receive the satellite signals in 
british homes is in short supply and will be for several more weeks 
if not months 
only 5000 to 20000 homes will be equipped to tune in on sunday 
giving just a fraction of the 56 million britons a chance to watch 
the 6 pm premiere 
watching television is britains most popular leisure activity 
even with only four regular channels two commercial and two run by 
the statefunded british broadcasting corp 
direct satellitetohome television has been hailed as a 
revolution in british broadcasting and the beginning of a new 
skirmish between britains two biggest newspaper publishers who 
both are trying to crack the satellite market 
time out the weekly guide to whats happening in london has 
billed it the biggest aerial dogfight since the battle of 
britain and a noholds barred star wars 
critics praising the highquality shows now produced in britain 
already have turned up their noses at murdochs programming which 
will rely heavily on imported american soap operas situation 
comedies and game shows 
michael grade chief executive of the highbrow commercial channel 
4 called it junk fastfood takeaway telly 
sky television will be vying with a consortium involving rival 
publisher robert maxwell and a third international consortium 
british satellite broadcasting bsb 
murdoch has managed to get sky on the air seven months before 
bsbs target date 
hes using the astra satellite owned by a luxembourgbased group 
and put into orbit in december 
bsb was awarded three of the five channels on another satellite 
under international treaty that satellite isnt scheduled to be 
launched until august and programming is not expected until 
september 
maxwells two channels screen sport and lifestyle also will be 
bounced off the astra satellite as soon as contractual snags are 
ironed out said spokesman chris howland maxwells two channels and 
one of murdochs now are available only to british cable subscribers 
cable subscribers have more channels than the regular four but 
very fewer britons have cable it is available in only three of 
londons 32 boroughs plus a handful of other cities the cable 
television association says there are 265645 subscribers

a federal judge on friday criticized a 
gunsfordrugs conspiracy lawsuit against contra and excia figures 
calling it an abuse of the legal system and awarding the defendants 
1 million in fees and costs 
chief us district judge james lawrence king last june threw out 
the 24 million lawsuit filed by the christic institute on behalf of 
journalists tony avirgan and martha honey 
on friday king issued a followup ruling requiring the 
plaintiffs to pay the defendants 955000 in attorney fees plus 
79500 in court costs 
some of the 29 defendants who include contra rebel leader 
adolfo calero excia deputy chief of operations theodore shackley 
irancontra figures albert hakim and richard secord conservative 
activist former maj gen john k singlaub and others promised 
action against the liberal washingtonbased christic institute 
this is the signal to begin the counterattack singlaub said 
of kings action i think this will put a damper on this kind of 
courthouse terrorism against those who are fighting against the 
radical left 
singlaub said his attorneys would act quickly against the 
christics to seize any assets to fulfill the judgment 
avirgan and honey filed the suit in may 1986 before many of the 
revelations about the irancontra affair it grew from a 1984 
bombing in nicaragua apparently aimed at contra leader eden pastora 
he escaped but avirgan was injured and eight people including 
three journalists were killed 
the suit accused the defendants of setting up the bombing as 
well as working with drug traffickers in a 30year rightwing 
conspiracy that included anticommunist activities in southeast 
asia central america and other locations 
in washington shackley said he will try to keep the spotlight 
of public scrutiny on the group and intends to continue his 
campaign to drive the christics out of business 
the christic institute bitterly criticized the ruling by king 
noting that their appeal of his decision last june was still before 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta they also are 
appealing fridays ruling seeking an immediate stay 
judge kings decision was a legal disgrace said christic 
attorney daniel sheehan who assembled much of the case his 
ruling will only strengthen our position in the appeals court that 
judge king is committing a consistent pattern of legal error 
sheehan noted that while king criticized the suit as having no 
legal merit three of the defendants hakim secord and civilian 
materiel assistance head thomas posey are under federal indictment 
on related charges another defendant john hull has been arrested 
by costa rican authorities on drug and gunrunning charges 
the christic institutes allegations were based on 
unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from unidentified sources with 
no firsthand knowledge king said in the ruling 
theodore klein an attorney for three of the defendants said the 
case could now be consigned to the oblivion it richly deserves 
asked what he planned to do with his share of the money klein 
joked buy guns for the contras

todd bridges a star of the diffrent 
strokes television show was held for investigation of attempted 
murder friday just days after a drug possession arrest 
bridges 23 and harvey duckett 30 were arrested late thursday 
at a residence a block from a vacant house linked to narcotics 
activity where kenneth clay was shot five times and stabbed said 
sgt doug tantee 
clay was in critical but stable condition at martin luther king 
jrdrew medical center police had no other details about the 
victim including his age or residence 
duckett was also held for investigation of attempted murder 
police said bridges was arrested at the same vacant house jan 25 
for investigation of possession of cocaine deputy district attorney 
richard weber said that case was rejected but the file was not 
immediately available to determine why 
bridges best known for his role as gary colemans older brother 
on nbcs diffrent strokes from 1978 to 1985 has had several 
brushes with the law including a nocontest plea to making a bomb 
threat several years ago 
clay told police he confronted bridges and duckett late thursday 
in the vacant house after an unidentified person told him someone 
was breaking in 
an argument ensued and bridges allegedly pulled a gun and shot 
clay five times and duckett allegedly slashed clay with the knife 
tantee said 
after bridges and duckett were taken into custody a 22caliber 
handgun and a shotgun were seized shortly afterward at the arrest 
site tantee said

shot was the site of numerous calls over the past few weeks 
regarding narcotics 
in 1983 bridges paid a 240 fine after being arrested for 
carrying a concealed firearm 
he received a suspended sentence in january 1987 after pleading 
no contest to a charge of making a bomb threat that stemmed from the 
bombing of an auto customizers car during a dispute over work on 
the actors porsche 
bridges also appeared in court in january 1988 to answer a 
reckless driving complaint in which police said he was driving about 
80 mph in a 35mph zone in san fernando

balmy southern breezes gave way friday to 
frigid north wind but raucous mardi gras revelry continued building 
to a fever pitch including preparations for the nearly nude french 
quarter fashion show 
with mardi gras less than five days away maskers made ready to 
roll on the elaborate floats of 40 metropolitan parades 
assistant police chief ray holman said the freezing temperatures 
predicted for the weekend were unlikely to stop the fun 
snow sleet ice or 80 mile an hour winds those are the only 
things that would stop a parade said holman cold weather 
doesnt dampen many spirits but it may cause people to drink more 
of them 
each year on mardi gras wood enterprises sponsors the bourbon 
street awards a costume contest in which many of the participants 
are male crossdressers or undressers 
kenneth french of wood enterprises said hundreds of people turn 
out each year in everything from elaborate creations of beads and 
feathers to barely legal outfits thousands more are there to watch 
and he doesnt expect this year to be any different in spite of the 
weather 
people work all year on their costumes they arent about to 
cover it up or not wear it just because it gets cold he said 
holman agreed that the chill probably wont do much to tone down 
the french quarter celebration or cover up the celebrants 
mardi gras day even if its 30 degrees as predicted youll see 
people not nude but pretty close to it he said

top house democrats leading 
their members to a weekend retreat at the luxurious greenbrier 
resort tried to put the onus on the senate friday as they faced 
heat over speaker jim wrights plan to let a 51 percent 
congressional pay raise take effect at least temporarily next week 
but many lawmakers doubted wrights gambit letting the raise 
automatically go through and then having the house vote to cut it 
back to 30 percent would end public demand for rescinding the 
entire 45500 pay increase 
rep tony coelho the house majority whip told reporters the 
senates 955 vote thursday to reject the pay raise was an easy one 
that left the difficult decision to the house 
we intend to send that 30 percent increase over to the 
senate those folks over there who are very strong willed and well 
stand up and see what they do and see if theyre interested in a 50 
percent increase or not he said 
were taking the heat and theyre not he said defending the 
need for a pay increase or some sort 
the chairman of the house democratic organization rep william 
h gray iii dpa said the senate was wanting it both ways 
keeping honoraria and afterhours earnings while appearing to be 
pure on the pay raise 
the pay raise which would increase rankandfile congressional 
salaries from 89500 to 135000 takes effect wednesday unless the 
house joins the senate before then in voting to kill it 
in washington meanwhile a group of republicans were planning to 
force a house vote monday on the pay raise 
the group planned to offer a resolution calling on wright to hold 
a vote on the pay raise before it goes into effect the draft 
resolution asserted that the dignity of the house of 
representatives is being sullied from coast to coast because of 
wrights failure to schedule a vote 
if the leadership declines to allow an immediate vote on the 
resolution proponents would call for a vote to override the ruling 
and seek to construe that vote which could be forced without 
majority approval as a test vote on the pay increase according to 
gop aides 
the move is being led by reps robert smith rnh and william 
dannemeyer rcalif 
on the train ride here coelho and other democratic leaders and 
aides worked to explain wrights decision which blocks a vote 
before the raise takes effect many of the 142 house democrats 
accompanied by their families to the resort wondered aloud whether 
the speakers strategy which could keep the pay fight going for 
weeks or months was wise 
the opponents of the pay raise will try a repeal every two 
weeks until christmas eve said rep pat williams dmont 
i have never received such vicious mail said rep bill 
richardson dnm he said constituents were promising to vote 
against him even if the pay raise took effect over his objections 
richardson said he understood wrights position but said it 
will not help because 30 percent and 50 percent are still viewed as 
excessive and the public doesnt understand honorariums 
rep vic fazio dcalif who has been working with the 
bipartisan house leadership on the pay issue and a companion measure 
to ban members from taking speaking fees or other honoraria 
declined to criticize the speakers plan but said he doubted it 
would defuse the situation 
the issue caters to trash television and talk radio if they 
had their way this wuld go on for months he said it could 
become a far more dominant issue than it has been already he said 
williams said he thought wrights plan would still be seen as a 
way to protect a raise while the public wanted none and the 50 
percent will be repealed he predicted 
the lawmakers were reminded of the public outcry at the outset of 
their trip as their buses arrived at the side door of union station 
to avoid a protest and along the way a prominent trackside sign 
read spike the pay hike 
privately members also worried that wrights strategy would not 
only fail to net them a pay raise but cost them their income from

jim moody who portrayed a teacher at the high 
school of performing arts in the 1980 movie fame lost and then 
regained his reallife job as a drama teacher at the school for 
aspiring actors and dancers 
moody who also acts professionally and was at one time a student 
at the school holds a temporary teaching certificate and was told 
wednesday he was being replaced by a drama teacher with a permanent 
license and more seniority 
but on friday the united federation of teachers announced that an 
agreement had been reached with the board of education for moody to 
remain in the drama class and teamteach with his replacement said 
bert shanas spokesman for the union 
teamteaching puts more than one teacher in the same classroom 
and takes advantage of each teachers special skills shanas said 
his temporary license still entitles moody to teach in other city 
public schools but he said i just want to work in a place that i 
think of as my home 
moody said he chose to teach with a temporary license because it 
meant he could take acting jobs he has appeared in eight movies 
if he wants the freedom to be an actor it is to his advantage 
to be a temporary employee said rosenfeld with that he is 
accepting the risk you cant have it both ways 
he said the district superintendent pat black had wanted a 
permanent license holder who would not leave when an acting job came 
up

about 400 people were reported missing last year in 
new cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances mostly in 
latin america a un report said friday 
it said the number of cases nearly doubled compared to 1987 and 
the number of countries where disappearances were reported also rose 
most of the alleged disappearances reported by human rights 
groups were linked to a countrys authorities 
the report compiled by a fivemember working group for the 
current annual session of the un human rights commission cited 
evidence of disappearances in 15 of the 44 countries examined 
it voiced special concern about disappearances of women and 
children but gave no breakdown 
the working group asked the governments concerned for comment on 
the latest cases but most of them remain unresolved the report 
said 
perus 170 cases topped the list of alleged disappearances 
reported last year also figuring prominently were colombia with 70 
people reported missing guatemala 53 el salvador 40 and the 
philippines 39 
it said argentina had the largest number of outstanding cases 
3387 but it noted no disappearances have been reported there since 
1983 
the report said disappearances increased in peru because of the 
governments fight against two guerrilla groups shining path and 
mrta and its imposition of a state of emergency and military 
administration in about 30 provinces 
it quoted people who reappeared after arrest as implicating 
peruvian army police and security forces 
in guatemala evidence indicates that disappearances have 
continued despite recent democratic government elections the report 
said peasants religious activists and clergymen and trade union 
leaders were most often reported abducted or arrested the report 
blamed soldiers members of paramilitary groups or security 
services and armed men in civilian clothes 
most of those reported missing in the philippines are young men 
in rural areas who were arrested as part of the governments fight 
against the leftwing new peoples army the report said 
laws in most of the countries investigated are inadequate for 
quickly determining the whereabouts of disappeared people the 
report said 
the working group chaired by yugoslavian expert ivan tosevski 
appealed to governments for sparing use of emergency powers in times 
of civil conflict 
it criticized afghanistan angola chile guinea iran nepal and 
the seychelles for failing to reply to allegations of disappearances 
the working group said it has compiled evidence of about 17000 
enforced disappearances since it began issuing annual reports in 
1980 
a separate report by the un commissions special investigator 
on religious intolerance friday singled out positive developments in 
the soviet union 
it cited large imports of bibles for the commemoration of 1000 
years of christianity in russia early release or reduced prison 
sentences for jailed believers and moves toward legal reform 
but the report said the worldwide persistence of many different 
forms of religious discrimination often by governments hardly 
inspires optimism

the interior department plans to stick with its 
recommendation that a vast wildlife refuge in northeastern alaska be 
opened for gas and oil exploration interior secretary manuel lujan 
jr said friday 
environmentalists have said the bush administrations actions on 
development of the 15 million acre coastal stretch of the alaska 
national wildlife refuge will be a test of the administrations 
intentions toward environmental issues 
asked about the alaska refuge during his first news conference 
after being sworn in as interior secretary earlier in the day lujan 
replied that president bush has said we should explore the 
refuge in an environmentally acceptable manner and the question 
is out of my domain 
congress must approve any such oil exploration and legislation 
has been introduced in both the senate and house that would open the 
refuge for drilling but other legislation also has been introduced 
that would make the refuge a wilderness area protected from 
exploration 
the oil industry for years has been pushing for access to the 
refuges northern coastal plain where there are indications of large 
oil and gas deposits 
in the final days of the reagan administration outgoing interior 
secretary donald hodel sent a recommendation to congress endorsing 
development earlier interior had sent congress a formal assessment 
that drilling would not cause undue harm to the environment 
a dozen environmental groups including some of the countrys 
largest last month urged in letters to bush and lujan that interior 
review its findings contending the conclusions were based on 
incomplete or false research 
lujan told reporters friday he was not aware of the petition from 
the environmental groups and said of interiors earlier 
recommendation to congress i dont think i can pull it back 
he said that bush has made it clear he favors oil and gas 
exploration as long as it is acceptable environmentally lujan 
declined to suggest how the refuge might be opened for exploration 
and suggested he favors approaching that slowly 
should we open the refuge up in an environmentally acceptable 
manner that decision has been made he said alluding to the 
presidents previously proclaimed position he emphasized that no 
development in the refuge can proceed without congressional action 
environmentalists and conservationists including the sierra club 
and the wilderness society have vowed to fight any drilling in the 
refuge which is home for the porcupine caribou polar bears and 
millions of birds 
on other subjects during his news conference lujan said 
he has recommended abandonment of a proposal suggested by his 
predecessor that firefighting on federal lands be paid for partly 
from funds that now go to the states from lumber and mineral lease 
receipts 
he opposes selling oil shale development rights on public lands 
for 250 an acre as interior has proposed saying thats too little 
he plans in coming days to visit the trust territory islands in 
the pacific over which interior has jurisdiction as well as tour a 
number of schools run by the bureau of indian affairs in the west 
he intends to develop a strong antidrug program aimed at 
eradicating illegal marijuana growing on public lands including 
increased use of aircraft used by the national park service a 
federal court this week ordered a halt to random drug testing of 
interior department employees

the single gas line into this tiny town 
broke early friday cutting off heat to more than 800 homes and 
businesses for most of the day in the coldest weather this winter 
after an arctic cold front chilled most of the state 
temperatures dipped to below 4 degrees and the 4inch steel pipe 
that delivers natural gas to the town of 2200 contracted and pulled 
apart said officials of lone state gas co owner of the pipeline 
almost twothirds of the towns homes and businesses were without 
gas for heating hot water or cooking and schools were closed for 
the day 
boy was it cold said kenny bragg a janitor at the cottle 
county courthouse i dont think i would have made it without my 
electric blanket 
no injuries were reported either as a result of the break or the 
cold said officials 
the pipeline broke about 3 am in an isolated area of ranchland 
said lsg regional superintendent bob clark 
fire chief don dillard sounded a fire alarm about 415 am to 
warn residents and he and other volunteers began rounding up 
electric space heaters to take to the elderly 
i scared everbody to death blowing the whistle he said 
but we needed to warn em 
space heaters were taken to the wood convalescent home where 44 
people live nurses gathered ambulatory residents together in the 
hall and draped bedspreads over windows for insulation said nursing 
home director gwynna stofel 
luckily it never got below 68 in here she said we used 
hot plates to serve a warm breakfast 
the nursing home was the first place in town to have its service 
restored at about 11 am after the break was repaired 
gas crews then went to work restoring heat to the homes of the 
elderly said dillard others had to wait until late afternoon and 
early evening 
the cold sparked a run on 14 electric space heaters at west 
texas utilities co said office manager patsy walling 
we brought them in from all the offices around and we sold 
those so they had to bring more all the way from abilene she 
said adding that more than 50 had been sold by early afternoon 
some people gathered on the town square at the senior citizens 
center which has electric heat stoves and ovens and served a warm 
breakfast to about 125 residents said center director emma james 
restaurant owners willa and bill isbell lacking gas to fire 
their stoves took food from their steakhouse to feed the hungry and 
cold 
isnt it wonderful how a little town just rises up and pitches 
in when something like this happens said geneva bragg who 
ventured out in the cold early to unlock the electricheated cottle 
county courthouse so people would have someplace warm to go

if a pay raise that would increase pensions of 
former presidents becomes law former president nixon will use the 
additional money to pay for security for himself and his wife a 
spokesman said friday 
john h taylor assistant to the former president wrote on 
nixons behalf to david keating executive vice president of the 
national taxpayers union who had written to nixon urging him to 
publicly oppose the pay increase 
the pay raise proposal approved by former president reagan 
calls for increasing the salaries of members of the cabinet to 
155000 from 99500 
since a 1971 law links presidential pensions to cabinet salaries 
the pensions of all former presidents would be increased by the same 
amount 
keating wrote nixon on jan 17 in view of your recent public 
statements urging the new administration and the new congress to 
control the federal budget deficit i hope that you will publicly 
issue a statement urging congress to reject the increase and saying 
that you will refuse to accept a 56 percent pension increase 
taylor noted in his reply that former first lady pat nixon 
relinquished her right to secret service protection in 1983 and the 
former president did so the following year 
the nixons are now paying for their own security an expense of 
over 500000 since 1985 he said it is rns intention to apply 
whatever increase may be enacted in his pension entirely toward 
defraying the cost of his and mrs nixons security 
taylor also told keating that the richard nixon library and 
birthplace now under construction at yorba linda calif would be 
the first such facility to be both built and operated without 
expenditure of public funds 
in sum i am sure you will agree that by his decisions 
regarding secret service protection and private funding for the 
operation of his library and birthplace president nixon has already 
demonstrated extraordinary leadership on the deficit issue taylor 
said 
the pay raises automatically go into effect unless they are 
disapproved by both houses of congress before wednesday 
house speaker jim wright dtexas however has proposed that the 
house vote thursday on a proposal that would scale the increases 
back both for members of congress and for cabinet officers and 
other executive branch officials 
taylor released the correspondence from nixons office in 
woodcliff lake nj

the house energy and commerce committee on 
friday asked fcc commissioner dennis r patrick to explain the 
rationale and justification for his proposal to change the 
twodecadesold system that regulates american telephone amp telegraph 
cos longdistance rates 
a letter from committee chairman john d dingell dmich and 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee chairman edward j 
markey dmass urged patrick to submit a detailed description of 
the plan which patrick revised after failing to sell it on capitol 
hill last year 
patrick acknowledged congressional concern about the price cap 
proposal last week when he postponed a commission vote on the plan 
until march 16 
we are pleased that you have agreed to a procedure that will 
permit the public and congress to review the details of the price 
cap plan said the letter which also was signed by rep norman f 
lent of new york and matthew j rinaldo of new jersey the ranking 
republicans on the committee and subcommittee respectively 
it added we also would appreciate your explanation of the 
rationale and justification for adopting this price cap plan 
fcc spokeswoman maureen peratino said the commission would have 
no immediate comment on the letter 
a committee aide who asked that her name not be used said patrick 
would be invited to testify at a feb 28 subcommittee hearing 
since the early 1960s the government has allowed atampt a certain 
profit beyond its costs but the fcc proposed replacing this 
socalled rateofreturn regulation for dominant carriers such as 
atampt and the regional bell companies with ceilings on prices 
the commission proposed to let atampt raise rates 3 percent less 
than annual inflation a move it said would would encourage greater 
efficiency and innovation and save customers 16 billion over four 
years if all the dominant companies participated atampt officials 
have applauded the plan as being a longoverdue concession to 
changing economies in the telephone industry 
but lawmakers said the plan didnt guarantee that atampts rates 
would remain in a zone of reasonableness 
the letter friday asked patrick to outline how the price cap 
plan will benefit residential consumers business users and rural 
telephone subscribers please specify both the safeguards proposed 
to prevent the dominant carriers from engaging in anticompetitive 
practices and assess the role of competition in determining the 
applicability of the price cap plan in each segment of the market 
it asked for computer models and analyses used to derive the 
proposal including any analyses of the impact of price caps on 
residential and business consumers and a comparison of how 
consumers would fare under prices caps and under the current 
rateofreturn regulation please include the origin of the starting 
rate that you propose to adopt for each element of service and the 
method of adjustment proposed for each element

representatives of north and south 
korea have held secret talks about improving relations and discussed 
the possibility of a meeting between their leaders newspaper 
reports said friday 
two days before the reports an unprecedented trade agreement was 
announced between the south korean conglomerate hyundai and 
communist north korea the south koreans said friday the agreement 
could open the way to reunification after 44 years 
seoul newspaper reports quoted a government source who was not 
identified as saying the secret talks were held abroad and covered 
most major issues between the rival koreas 
they said the most recent meetings were in singapore during the 
past week between park chulun a special secretary to president roh 
taewoo and a senior north korean official who was not identified 
park met with the north korean several times to discuss major 
issues including a proposed summit the reports said the 
government source was quoted as saying the summit could be held this 
year 
last month roh renewed a proposal that he and north korean 
leader kim il sung discuss the future of the korean peninsula which 
was divided in 1945 
the reported talks coincided with the historic visit to north 
korea of a leading south korean industrialist to discuss direct 
investment and joint venture projects 
chung juyung founder and honorary chairman of hyundai was in 
north korea from jan 23 to feb 1 as a guest of the communist 
government 
he said thursday he had agreed with north korean officials to 
undertake several joint ventures in the north including a shipyard 
railroad plant and tourist resort 
newspapers quoted unidentified government officials as saying 
tours would be available later this year to the resort area a 
rugged scenic region 20 miles north of the eastern boundary of the 
demilitarized zone that divides the peninsula 
rohs government said it would propose special legislation to 
facilitate the projects 
contact with north korea is a violation of south koreas national 
security laws the two nations are technically still at war because 
no peace treaty was signed when the threeyear korean war ended 1953 
in a statement friday the government said it in principle 
takes a favorable view of the proposed projects regarding them as 
possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve 
national unification 
chung was believed to be the first south korean business leader 
approved by both governments to visit the north 
north koreas participation in the deal is seen as an attempt to 
revive its economy it is reported to owe 5 billion to soviet bloc 
and western nations 
figures published friday and attributed to the south korean 
government said north korea had a trade deficit of 720 million in 
1987 exports were given as 167 billion and imports as 239 
billion

a british woman who fled from 
an outlawed guerrilla group last year was actually a south african 
police officer assigned to spy on the antiapartheid movement the 
government said friday 
olivia forsyth 28 was held captive by the african national 
congress for 22 months before she fled in may to the british embassy 
in luanda angola she holed up in the embassy for six months before 
returning here 
until friday neither she nor south african police would comment 
on the african national congress allegation that she was a spy who 
had tried to infiltrate the guerrilla movement her father peter 
forsyth had insisted she was a journalist 
the head of the police security branch maj gen basie smit 
said in a statement that miss forsyth was a police lieutenant who 
gathered valuable information after pretending to defect to the 
guerrilla group in 1986 smit said she was tortured at an african 
national congress camp in angola 
smit also identified another police spy joy harnden who 
infiltrated leading antiapartheid organizations in south africa 
such as the black sash civil rights group and the end conscription 
campaign 
both women who are white performed a great duty for south 
africa in exceptionally dangerous circumstances said smit he 
said details of their missions were being disclosed to counter a 
twisted account that might come from the guerrilla organization 
police released a lengthy statement by miss forsyth who holds 
british and south african citizenship 
in the statement she said she was beaten while in custody and 
said the groups exiled leadership did not want their leader nelson 
mandela released from prison in south africa because they felt he 
was more useful as a martyr 
she also said mandelas wife winnie was an embarrassment to 
the group because she never does as she is instructed 
she also asserted that a leadership struggle between two young 
guerrilla leaders chris hani and thabo mbeki was likely whenever 
president oliver tambo stepped down 
tom sebina an african national congress spokesman based in 
zambia denied a leadership split and said miss forsyth and not been 
mistreated while in custody he said britain should take away her 
british passport because she had spied for another country 
regarding morale problems within the group sebina said it was 
possible there had been shortages of food and supplies in angola 
the national union of south african students one of the 
antiapartheid organizations that miss forsyth infiltrated at rhodes 
university issued a statement saying miss forsyth was believed to 
have caused the detention of at least four human rights activists 
whom she pretended to befriend while at the school

government in 1960 and began a bombing and sabotage campaign in 1961 
aimed at undermining the whiteminority government

defense news and army times two independent 
newspapers read by the military and congress are calling on john 
tower to withdraw from consideration as defense secretary citing 
recent allegations about his personal life and past ties to defense 
contractors 
out of concern for the military which the former texas senator 
clearly loves he should step aside tom donnelly writes in an 
editorial to be published in mondays edition of army times 
the 49yearold independent publication has a worldwide 
circulation of about 125000 including most of the uniformed 
military 
towers public position has been so compromised by the 
agonizing process by which he was nominated and is being confirmed 
that he cannot be the strong spokesman the defense department 
needs now the editorial said 
more troubling and more at issue is towers position as a 
consultant to defense contractors the speed and greed with 
which tower spun through the revolving door is appalling it said 
the editorial suggests that either president bush who is 
concerned about ethics in government reconsider towers 
appointment or that the former senator summon personal courage of 
his own it might be the best help he can give to his friends in 
the military 
defense news in an editorial for monday written by richard 
barnard says towers withdrawal would be the act of a seasoned 
politician who understands that the best interests of the nation 
sometimes require personal sacrifice by those who would help lead 
it 
withdrawal is necessary because the record of mr towers 
professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with 
utmost effectiveness at a time when defense priorities and the 
defense department each are undergoing periods of vital but delicate 
change the editorial said 
defense news is a threeyearold independent publication with a 
circulation of about 30000 including the top level of the pentagon 
and defense industry and members of congress 
defense news suggests that tower links to defense consultants is 
the most troubling aspect of the recent confirmation process 
the principal task of the next defense secretary is to build 
public confidence that the pentagon is being wellmanaged and that 
defense dollars are being carefully spent the editorial said 
the defense secretary must be an independent voice of force 
authority and reason 
there is ample reason to doubt whether mr tower is the man for 
these times the editorial said 
tower in his testimony before the senate armed services 
committee said he had received more than 1 million in fees for 
defense consulting over a 2 year period he said he had severed all 
ties with the consultants as of dec 1 1988

acting president after botha suffered a stroke jan 18 promised 
full civil rights for all south africans in a speech to

generalities offered in the past another liberal leader denis

incidents nationwide

leader by a 6961 vote defeating a slightly more liberal candidate

pointing to several people in the room she said i see a 
difference in you and you and you not me i mean its just 
different when youre president everybody treats you differently 
when youre president 
joking about her husbands former status as vice president mrs 
bush said i spend half my life saying could you please get the 
vice president on the phone and the operator says do you really 
want dan quayle or dont you know dan quayles in venezuela 
more seriously she said one big difference for bush is that 
everything you say becomes major and it is major he is the 
president of the united states 
and yet she said of her husband i think hes exactly the 
same she said many people who used to kid with her husband had 
stopped doing that briefly but after awhile they all became normal 
again it just took a little while 
i call him mr president sometimes when im needling him 
to tease him yes mr president 
the first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of laws 
banning sale to the public of military assault guns measures to 
outlaw the manufacture sale or possession of a variety of rifles 
are pending in congress and dozens of states it was a chinese ak47 
assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which five 
children were killed and 29 others as well as a teacher were 
wounded in stockton calif last month 
mrs bush said she thought such weapons already were outlawed 
they should be absolutely she said 
while refusing to discuss her position on handguns mrs bush 
said that she does not like to go hunting as does her husband an 
avid outdoorsman 
i went hunting with george once mrs bush recalled he 
told me to follow the bird and i followed the bird and his head 
came right through that little circle the rifle scope i put down 
the gun and said thats it im not going to do that again 
earlier friday mrs bush visited the united community ministries 
inc in the washington suburb of alexandria and praised the centers 
staff of volunteers 
it reinforces my belief that we have got to help the working 
poor she told reporters during her 40minute visit

plastic bags full of clothes and toys that she and members of the 
white house staff donated 
the center is a private nonprofit organization whose programs 
include a thrift shop food pantry medical clinics day care

vice president dan quayle on 
friday called for improvements in human rights conditions in el 
salvador saying future us support for the central american nation 
is tied to such efforts 
quayle also said during a oneday stop here that if president 
jose napoleon duarte agrees to a request by the leftist rebels to 
postpone the countrys march 19 election the bush administration 
will back him 
duarte in a luncheon toast honoring quayle on thursday called 
the rebels election plan a step in the right direction because 
for the first time they expected there exists an electoral 
alternative 
the rebels said they would recognize the election under certain 
conditions including postponement until september 
after praising duarte as a champion of human rights during his 
fiveyear term which is coming to a close quayle said now as we 
approach elections there has been more violence on both the left 
and the right 
why i am here today is to reiterate in the strongest terms 
possible our commitment to democracy and the advancement of human 
rights he told reporters in a news conference at the home of 
ambassador william walker 
there are consequences to human rights violations in the 
future he added then he left to privately address military 
leaders on the human rights issue 
we the united states are committed to the process and the 
system of democracy democracy means human rights and decency he 
said our commitment and our support is conditioned on this 
process and this system 
one day earlier quayle had taken strong issue with former 
president carters comment that the new bush administration should 
rely on economic pressure to further the cause of human rights 
in el salvador 
at the white house friday presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said of quayles comment on carter the vice president 
is free to say whatever he wants to say i think the vice 
presidents a pretty astute fellow 
quayle said friday he would speak in direct emphatic and 
specific terms to the military leaders who have been accused of 
failing to adequately curb human rights violations he compared his 
planned comments to those of thenvice president bush who in 1983 
told the salvadorans that us aid would dry up if the human rights 
situation did not improve 
a senior state department official who attended the meeting said 
quayle told the military leaders the congressional consensus behind 
aid to el salvador was of necessity a fragile thing and that 
sliding back on the human rights question would threaten it the 
official commented only on condition he not be named 
the vice presidents visit came against a backdrop of el 
salvadors presidential campaign and maneuvering over how to deal 
with the peace proposal offered by the rebels last week 
if president duarte announces a consensus within the 
constitutional framework i am sure there would be strong support 
from the administration on postponement of the election quayle 
said in the strongest statement to date by a us official on the 
peace proposal 
the proposal by the farabundo marti national liberation front or 
fmln is a step forward he said he said that was why duarte 
after an initial negative reaction did not reject it outright 
but now it is incumbent for reciprocity from the fmln 
reciprocity to cease fire now quayle said 
quayle met friday also with political leaders and roman catholic 
archbishop arturo rivera y damas an intermediary in carrying the 
rebels peace proposal to san salvador 
the political delegation that quayle saw included presidential 
candidates alfredo cristiani of the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance or arena and fidel chavez mena of duartes christian 
democratic party 
arena leader roberto daubuisson who has long faced allegations 
of involvement with rightwing death squads was not invited to the 
meeting 
quayle also chose not to meet with a third trailing presidential 
candidate guillermo ungo of the leftist democratic convergence 
coalition which is closely allied with the fmln 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
left was passed over because we feel it is inappropriate because 
we do not know how serious the fmln is with this proposal 
duarte initially blasted the jan 23 proposal as unconstitutional 
because it called for changing the constitutionally mandated march 
election 
us officials felt the proposal was worth examining because of 
the rebels firstever offer to join in elections without demanding 
powersharing as a precondition 
the united states has provided more than 3 billion in aid to el 
salvador this decade 
the early 1980s were marked by many killings of civilians and 
soldiers and rightwing death squads were blamed after 1984 human 
rights violations seemed to decrease but violence by both left and 
right has picked up again in the last year 
quayle was under heavy security during his visit the press corps 
in the motorcade behind his bulletproof limousine rode in vans 
customized against attack

the justice department declined friday to 
intervene in a suit charging that lockheed missiles amp space co 
billed the pentagon for more than 10 million in fraudulent charges 
the departments decision not to intervene in the case at this 
point indicated it had legal reservations about the complaint by 
current and former workers at the companys sunnyvale calif 
aerospace plant 
the complaint filed last year in federal court in san jose 
calif alleged that employees among other things charged the 
government for using computers to operate private businesses while 
awaiting security clearances and to run a football pool 
the suit also charged that a senior plant manager had lockheed 
machinists build him a private airplane at government expense 
employees were also allegedly told to charge their time to contracts 
on which they did no work the complaint said 
the suit was filed under the false claims acts a civil warera 
statute that was amended in 1986 to allow whistleblowers to collect 
a percentage of judgments against companies that cheat the 
government 
the justice department said it had elected not to join the 
lawsuit after a review and investigation of the case 
the department added however that it would continue to monitor 
the case brought by a former software manager and a technician 
currently employed at the plant 
the statute allows the government to intervene at a later time 
upon a showing of good cause the department noted 
the plant employs 23700 workers to develop space craft 
satellite systems and submarinelaunched missiles lockheed missles 
amp space a subsidiary of lockheed corp has vigorously denied the 
allegations in the complaint 
but the lawsuit said the defense contract audit agency 
substantiated the allegations made by margaret newsham the former 
software manager who was fired in 1984 for allegedly padding her 
time card copies of the agencys reports were appended to the 
lawsuit 
ms newshams dismissal is the subject of a separate lawsuit 
against the company

a school survey of junior high students 
romantic attitudes was withdrawn after parents complained that it 
amounted to little more than a computer dating service school 
officials said friday 
the survey passed out to sixth seventh and eighth graders at 
harrison middle school in nearby sunnyside asked students thoughts 
on kissing parties buns and other subjects 
i think its an overreaction said principal dennis birr of 
the parental response it was never intended to be a sexual 
offensive type of survey 
but upon review birr said he decided there were a few questions 
not appropriate for this age level and decided thursday to 
collect the forms and dispose of them 
the 30question survey was put together as a fundraiser by 
members of the schools science club and passed out in class to the 
11 to 13yearold students 
i guess i was really concerned about the judgment of the adults 
at that school said sherry mashburn of sunnyside one of the 
objecting parents whose son is a sixthgrader 
members of the science club were supposed to collect the 
completed forms and punch the data into a computer birr said 
for 1 a student could receive a list of eight to 10 names of 
classmates of the opposite sex who shared similar interests birr 
said 
i dont know what they were supposed to do with those names 
ms mashburn said id prefer my son not to do a lot 
but he is 12 and he is interested she added 
the survey was called a heart to heart personal questionnaire 
for the question when i think of kissing i get possible 
multiplechoice answers were really excited interested bored 
sick or fanatic 
for the question which of the following fascinates you the 
most possible answers included electronic games nicelooking 
cars nicelooking bodies the moon and the stars 
asked what sort of parties they liked possible answers were 
loud and wild quiet and dignified all none birthday and illegal 
another question asked which physical feature eyes smile legs 
or buns the participant noticed first in the opposite sex 
elevenyearolds dont need to worry about what their buns look 
like parent sara robert told the yakima heraldrepublic 
but birr said most of the questions involved attitudes toward 
friendship sports and other personality characteristics

a group that once included president bushs new 
national security adviser recommended friday that bush stagger 
deployment of longrange atomic weapons as part of an effort to 
control defense spending 
the report is likely to find a receptive ear at the white house 
because the national security adviser brent scowcroft helped write 
early drafts although he dropped out of the working group following 
his appointment 
the report reiterated a view previously stated by scowcroft but 
not repeated publicly since he joined the administration that 
former president reagans vision of a star wars umbrella against 
nuclear attack would be impossible in the foreseeable future 
research has made clear that there is no nearterm prospect 
that any combination of defensive sytems will make possible 
exclusive reliance on defense to defeat the projected threat said 
the report drafted by members of the foreign policy institute of 
johns hopkins university and the center for strategic and 
international studies a pair of think tanks 
spending should remain constant for strategic defenses rather 
than increasing sharply as requested by reagan group members said 
sens sam nunn dga and john warner rva the chairman and 
ranking republican on the senate armed services committee 
respectively and rep les aspin dwis nunns counterpart in the 
house presented the report at a news conference with former 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane and former defense 
secretary harold brown 
congress is unlikely to increase defense spending this year as 
requested by reagan in his final budget proposal and the united 
states will not be able to pay for all the bombers missiles 
submarines and other systems underway 
therefore congress and the administration must agree on which 
are most urgently needed deploy them first and then add others as 
necessary they said 
two of the three legs of the us nuclear triad the bomber 
and submarine forces will survice any plausible soviet attack 
it said 
we cannot however extend this confidence to our landbased 
missiles in silos it said against a surprise attack by soviet 
forces in which only about onethird of their currently available 
icbm intercontinental ballistic missile warheads are used only 
about 5 percent of us icbms would survive 
the situation could worsen under the proposed strategic arms 
reduction treaty under negotiation between the united states and the 
soviet union because it would reduce by about half the number of 
delivery systems one side would require fewer weapons to knock out 
the others fixed landbased weapons 
foremost among the groups recommendations was that the 
administration and congress agree to develop a mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missile class to match two classes 
deployed by the soviets 
mobility is key said aspin 
and they urged the administration to proceed cautiously on the 
b2 stealth bomber to avoid a repeat of problems suffered by the b1 
bomber which was rushed through the development stage 
nunn and aspin also urged the new administration to drop reagans 
proposed ban on mobile missiles arguing that such weapons reduce 
the danger of nuclear war since it would be almost impossible for an 
adversary to destroy a significant percentage in a surprise attack 
the group leaned toward the small roadmobile midgetman as the 
best option the same conclusion reached by a presidential 
commission headed by scowcroft in 1983 
the midgetman would be more expensive than other alternatives 
however costing an estimated 39 billion versus 12 billion for a 
railmobile version of the 10warhead mx missile and 19 billion to 
40 billion for the socalled carryhard approach in which the 
mx midgetman or minuteman iii missile would be encased in capsules 
hardened against nuclear attack and scattered in a deceptive pattern 
among a large number of silos 
reagan in proposing a budget for the next fiscal year cut all 
money for the midgetman in favor of the mx

more than two decades after a grand jury 
charged bernice van heise in the shooting death of her married 
boyfriend the woman pleaded innocent friday 
the woman who disappeared after the slaying was found living 
quietly in rural elburn married and going by the name greta 
knickerbocker 
mrs knickerbocker 62 was reindicted wednesday on charges of 
murder and involuntary manslaughter in the jan 31 1968 shooting 
death of eugene douglas in this prosperous suburb north of chicago 
she was sad and nervous it seemed in her court appearance 
friday before lake county judge harry hartel said joe collina 
chief of investigations for the lake county states attorneys 
office 
she was accompanied in court by her husband of 20 years conrad 
knickerbocker collina said bond was set at 100000 he said 
adding police do not believe mrs knickerbocker is likely to flee 
she remained in jail friday afternoon 
mrs knickerbocker was arrested thursday in st charles west of 
chicago where she was having lunch at a restaurant with her 
son he said 
this is a touchy situation conrad knickerbocker told the 
chicago tribune on thursday we thought it was over years ago 
he said his wife worked occasionally in parttime retail jobs but 
was primarily a homemaker 
he declined to comment further and no one answered the phone 
friday at the knickerbocker home 
the case was reopened in november when police received a tip on 
mrs van heises whereabouts she was found through a friend of 
her daughters collina said 
investigators said douglas survivors lobbied hard to have 
charges renewed after it was learned where she was that month 
at the time of the shooting 21 years ago mrs knickerbocker 
then mrs van heise was a divorcee involved with douglas a 
married 49yearold artist who lived in the north chicago suburb of 
glenview collina said 
witnesses said eugene douglas had decided to go back to his 
wife and children collina said he was breaking off the 
relationship 
the shooting occurred at mrs van heises coachhouse apartment 
collina said she told police at the time that she had been showing 
douglas a gun and that it fired accidentally when she was handing 
it to him 
the physical evidence doesnt support that according to the 
police collina said 
mrs van heise was a suspect just after the shooting but a judge 
at the time rejected a murder charge ruling there was insufficient 
evidence a grand jury later indicted her on a murder charge but 
she had disappeared authorities said 
that indictment was withdrawn about 1975 said deputy chief 
robert boone of the lake forest police he did not know why the 
charge was dropped but said the case had been inactive for many 
years 
the knickerbockers have lived near elburn about 40 miles west 
of chicago since 1976 when they moved from the suburb of hinsdale

the nations jobless rate inched up to 54 
percent last month even as the economy created 408000 new jobs the 
government said friday in a report showing stronger than anticipated 
earlyyear economic strength 
while the report was good news for people seeking work in all 
700000 americans found jobs last month out of 865000 who began the 
search analysts said the economy may be growing too quickly and 
predicted the federal reserve would move to rein it in 
the report however had a neglible immediate impact on wall 
street where stock prices were little changed and the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials slipped 250 to 233125 reducing its 
gain for the week to 839 points 
januarys unemployment rate was up 01 percentage point to 54 
percent the labor department said but that masked the job gains 
and the fact that a record 629 percent of workingage americans 
were at work 
its a much stronger report than we thought said davis wyss 
chief economist at data resources inc a lexington mass 
forecasting firm it suggests we are going into the first quarter 
a lot stronger than we thought the fed is going to tighten and 
shortterm interest rates will be going up 
some predicted that action will come next week when the federal 
reserves open market committee meets to set 1989 targets for growth 
in the money supply tight growth restrictions act as a brake on 
economic growth by pushing interest rates upward 
in another sign of robust economic strength as 1989 began the 
average manufacturing work week rose by 6 minutes to 410 hours 
average factory overtime held steady at 39 hours a week 
and in data showing the pace of wage gains picked up in january 
the department said average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory 
workers climbed by 06 percent while average weekly earnings rose 
12 percent 
its a quite disturbing spillover into wages of the strong job 
growth said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
wage increases also put more money in consumers wallets the 
resultant increased purchasing could stymie efforts to reduce the 
us trade deficit analysts said 
the government also reported friday that orders to us factories 
for manufactured goods surged 41 percent in december the biggest 
rise in six months and were up 97 percent for all of 1988 the 
best showing since 1979 
combine the increase in factory orders with the tremendous 
generation of jobs and building inflationary pressure and that 
smacks of anything but a soft landing sinai said that smacks 
of a booming economy one that could get too hot to handle 
the growth in new jobs as calculated from the departments 
monthly sampling of households nationwide was led by activity in 
the construction and the service industries 
construction added 102000 jobs more than analysts had expected 
even with unseasonably warm weather in most of the country 
retailtrade jobs grew up 135000 service industries added 75000 
workers gains of 45000 were recorded for manufacturing industries 
and for transportation and public utilities 
the overall january job gain far outpaced the consensus 
prediction of a 250000 increase 
the labor deparment said that of the 1234 million people in the 
civilian labor force last month 1167 million had jobs and 67 
million were seeking employment 
a separate unemployment calculation that includes the nearly 17 
million members of the armed services stationed in the united states 
also stood at 54 percent in january like the civilian rate up 01 
percentage point from december 
in the civilian economy the jobless rate among whites remained 
unchanged at 46 percent the rate was 4 percent for white men down 
from 41 percent and 39 percent for white women unchanged from 
december 
unemployment among blacks climbed to 12 percent in january from 
116 percent while the jobless rate among black teenagers jumped 
to 345 percent from 296 percent 
unemployment among teens overall rose from 148 percent to 164 
percent 
there also was an increase in unemployment among hispanics from 
76 percent in december to 84 percent last month

somalias prime minister mohamed ali samantar 
was heckled by dissidents friday as he accused ethiopia of arming 
somali rebels and promised to free all political prisoners in his 
country 
stop the killing stop the genocide shouted several somalis 
as samantar was answering reporters questions at the national press 
club outside about 15 protesters shouted samantar is a killer 
samantar who has met with vice president dan quayle and members 
of congress to respond to accusations of human rights violations 
said somalia would allow representatives of amnesty international to 
visit and investigate without restrictions 
the government has decided to release all political prisoners 
in somalia without exception including those interned during the 
last year in connection with the troubles in the north samantar 
said 
amnesty international issued a report last september saying the 
government had executed as many as 1000 unarmed civilians last year 
while trying to put down an insurgency in the northern part of the 
country on africas eastern coast 
us officials and congressional aides noted that an amnesty 
visit had been postponed from january to april 
in response to reports of torture and killings congress last 
summer froze some 55 million of us aid to the impoverished 
african nation after somalia freed about 100 political prisoners 
recently there were indications that lawmakers might be willing to 
release 17 million of the aid for payment of arrears to the 
international monetary fund said congressional sources who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity 
but samantars talks this week failed to convince some lawmakers 
that his government was making much progress on human rights the 
sources said 
for the time being its promises said one source he said 
somalia is still rejecting a us condition for peace talks between 
the government and the rebels 
samantar said the rebels were being armed by ethiopia in 
violation of a 1987 pact between the two countries that ended their 
11year war and stipulated that they would not arm each others 
insurgents 
samantar said his government had brought the matter up with 
ethiopias marxist leaders and was told they had not authorized such 
aid although it may have been approved at a lower level of 
government 
us officials say that although some 200000 to 300000 somalis 
had found refuge in ethiopia from last years fighting in their 
country there is no evidence to support somalias accusations that 
ethiopia is arming the rebels who have been seeking to topple the 
government for seven years 
samantar denied rebels claims that his government had received 
chemical weapons from libya but said the two countries had 
normalized their relations in recent years 
asked whether somalia had received shipments of conventional 
weapons from libya to help combat the insurgency samantar said 
its possible 
us officials say they have evidence that libya sent light 
weapons and ammunition to somalia last summer but when asked about 
this in congress samantar denied any libyan help the congressional 
sources said 
somalia has been ruled by army general siad barre since he took 
power in a 1969 coup the country of 53 million was originally 
allied with the soviet union but switched allegiance to the west in 
1977

a veteran georgia county commissioner has told 
the fbi he doubts that health and human services secretarydesignate 
louis sullivan was trying to buy influence when his medical school 
put another county commissioner on its payroll 
lee j roach vice chairman of the fulton county commission said 
friday the fbi which is conducting a background investigation on 
sullivan questioned him about the nominees connection with 
reginald eaves a commissioner who was suspended upon conviction of 
extortion last may 
roach and other atlanta public figures interviewed by the fbi say 
agents have concentrated on sullivans links to eaves 
it is this continuing inquiry that prompted the white house 
earlier this week to get congress to indefinitely postpone 
sullivans confirmation hearing 
eaves was paid more than 34000 over four years as a guest 
lecturer at morehouse school of medicine in atlanta while he 
promoted school issues before the commission sullivan is president 
of morehouse published reports has said eaves gave only two 
lectures 
roach dismissed the idea that sullivan hired eaves to increase 
morehouses influence on commission votes 
i was not aware of whether dr sullivan knew or did not know 
about eaves being hired i guessed that he did not roach told 
the associated press in recounting his interview with fbi agents 
which he said lasted 1015 minutes 
eaves who knew sullivan from their undergraduate days at 
morehouse college was an active supporter of the medical school 
which sullivan founded but roach said the rest of the commissioners 
also strongly backed the school 
the support for morehouse was solid we were committed to do 
what we had to do for morehouse roach said there was nothing 
eaves could do to make that more solid 
roach said commissioners were unaware eaves was on the schools 
payroll during the four years but the link between eaves and the 
school became public last july after eaves was convicted 
roach said he did not know how much direct contact eaves had with 
sullivan 
an oldtime seasoned politician might have looked at that and 
might have asked whats going on but sullivan is not a 
politician hes an administrator roach said if theres any 
sin on dr sullivans part its that hes not a seasoned 
politician roach said 
few issues involving morehouse came before the board though the 
ones that did were important and usually involved large 
appropriations to the school roach said 
earlier eaves told the fbi he was unsure whether sullivan his 
friend and associate knew he was being paid as a lecturer at the 
school and that the nominee had never tried to influence him 
improperly according to eaves lawyer charles r floyd jr 
eaves was questioned by the fbi earlier this week at a federal 
prison in montgomery ala where he is serving a sixyear sentence 
floyd said 
eaves was convicted of accepting 35000 from an fbi undercover 
agent in exchange for votes on zoning issues 
reached by telephone at the prison friday eaves declined to 
discuss his relationship with sullivan whom he said he has known 
since 1952 he said he is not granting any interviews because his 
case is on appeal 
the fbi has refused to discuss its background investigation 
on capitol hill the questions about sullivans link to eaves do 
not appear to threaten his nomination to head the largest federal 
department 
we dont read anything into this at all said a senate 
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity

space shuttle discovery moved to the 
launch pad friday but it may have to be taken back to a hangar if 
technicians on a tight schedule cant replace three engine pumps in 
time for a midmarch liftoff 
the five astronauts who will fly the mission rode partway to the 
launch pad with their spaceship and later swooped low over the pad 
in three t38 jets as they headed back to their training base in 
houston the shuttle arrived at the pad about 1 pm 
tip talone discoverys processing director said march 10 is the 
earliest possible launch for the planned fiveday mission 
officials had said earlier that if discovery could not be 
launched by march 18 it would have to yield the pad to atlantis 
set for liftoff on april 28 but on friday nasa officials said they 
might extend that march 18 deadline a few days by trimming the 
potential number of launch days available to atlantis 
only one shuttle launch pad is currently available while a second 
is being refurbished 
atlantis has priority over discovery for use of that launch pad 
because it is to send the magellan probe to venus if atlantis is 
not launched april 28 to may 23 venus will not be in the proper 
alignment with earth for the magellan project again until 1991 by 
contrast the discovery flight could be rescheduled relatively 
quickly if it has to be postponed 
if we can get discovery out of here in midmarch we will 
protect the magellan window talone said referring to the 
period available for the atlantis launch were going to make it 
nasa would like to have the entire launch period available for 
atlantis in case problems develop but it might be willing to 
shorten that window slightly if discovery is nearly ready march 18 
if discoverys three suspect turbopumps cant be replaced in 
time its mission with a communications satellite would be put off 
until later this year 
talone acknowledged there is a lot of work to be done and some 
uncertainty about how long the pump replacement will take because 
technicians have never made such a changeout with a shuttle in the 
vertical position 
he said he expects all three of the old pumps to be out by next 
friday the new units will arrive here the week of feb 12 and the 
plan is to have all installed and checked out by the end of february 
we dont feel any pressure on this he said 
after atlantis flew in december an inspection of the shuttles 
engines disclosed two tiny cracks in a bearing housing in one of 
three highspeed turbopumps that convert liquid oxygen to a gas 
engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion 
resulting from moisture trapped inside the housing during the 
manufacturing process because two of discoverys turbopumps 
underwent the same processing nasa decided to replace all three 
pumps with new carefully inspected units and to delay a planned 
feb 23 launch 
shuttle engineers said friday they think the corrosion resulted 
when the trapped moisture mixed with chlorine from a common 
household cleaner they said the cleaning material probably was not 
thoroughly wiped off after a scrubdown 
the pumps are critical because the shuttle could explode if one 
failed during liftoff 
attached to its two solid fuel booster rockets and external fuel 
tank discovery moved out of an assembly building into the darkness 
at 6 am to begin a fourmile trip that ended seven hours later at 
launch pad 39b the transporter a giant tracked vehicle called a 
crawler traveled at a maximum speed of 1 mph 
the astronauts rode part of the way on the crawler they are 
commander michael coats john blaha james buchli bob springer and 
james bagian as they left for houston they swung their jets in a 
wide circle over discovery then about half a mile from the pad

opposition leaders said friday that the man 
who may be the next us ambassador to mexico helped orchestrate the 
civil war in nicaragua and is a master of meddling in other nations 
affairs 
rightwing and leftist groups said relations with washington 
would worsen if president bush selects john negroponte as the next 
ambassador 
sources in washington said this week that negroponte a deputy 
national security adviser will be picked to replace ambassador 
charles pilliod 
when he served as us ambassador to honduras from 1982 to 1985 
negroponte had a major role in assisting the usbacked rebels 
seeking to overthrow the leftist government in nicaragua honduras 
was a major base of operations for the rebels known as contras 
critics also said negroponte also sought unduly to influence the 
honduran government 
the foreign ministry said it would not comment publicly on the 
selection until it had advised the us government of its views but 
leftist and conservative parties suggested mexico investigate 
allegations about negroponte and consider rejecting him 
national authorities have the right to keep officials who are 
highly discredited and who have violated human rights from assuming 
posts in mexican territory diego fernandez a leader of the 
conservative national action party was quoted as saying by the 
liberal daily la jornada on friday 
amalia garcia of the mexican socialist party the largest leftist 
party urged the government not to accept the appointment the 
newspaper said 
she was quoted as saying it will make problems more complex and 
deepen differences between the two nations 
oscar mauro ramirez ayala leader of the congressional delegation 
of the centerleft authentic party of the mexican revolution also 
called for a thorough analysis of negropontes background saying 
according to reports about him hes an expert in combating the 
libertarian forces of the latin american countries 
jorge bustamante of the colegio del norte a northern think tank 
in tijuana said in a television interview on friday that the choice 
was bad news for bilateral relations and worked against mexicos 
efforts to achieve peace in central america 
mexico opposes us support for the contras 
the independent but progovernment daily excelsior ran a lengthy 
frontpage story on thursday describing negroponte as a diplomat who 
has earned the reputation of being more astute and calculating 
than machiavelli 
la jornada in a frontpage editorial on thursday called the 
appointment an ominous decision and began a threepart series 
called the path of an ultrahawk 
the government newspaper el nacional said negroponte simply 
complied like a good ambassador with orders from washington in 
the rebel effort 
negroponte had a close relationship with gen gustavo alvarez 
martinez who was head of the honduran military from 1982 until his 
overthrow in 1984 and for a time was considered for a time the most 
powerful figure in the country 
as head of the national police in 1981 alvarez told cia director 
william casey the nicaraguan rebels could operate from honduran 
territory allowing the movement to take root 
alvarez was assassinated in tegucigalpa the honduran capital in 
january a leftist group claimed responsibility for the killing

soviet cadets may be strolling around the 
west point campus next fall while american cadets study at russian 
military academies officials said friday 
an exchange of cadets between the two superpowers has been 
approved by top government officials according to west point 
officials the idea was first proposed last july by the deputy 
commander of the soviet ground force col gen dmitri a 
grinkevich during a visit to west point 
the exchange of military cadets would be for brief periods 
probably lasting two weeks initially according to col james 
hawthorne director of academy relations at west point 
anything can happen of course but there is no plan for it to 
develop into anything longer than a shortterm program hawthorne 
said 
the purpose of the exchange would be to help american and soviet 
cadets better understand each other 
its a cultural exchange program with military implications of 
course said hawthorne the purpose is not for us to learn 
the inner workings of the red army 
he said the programs benefits may be decades away 
these will be 19 and 20 year olds it will not be for some 
years that they will be in any position to make decisions that might 
result in an easing of tensions but who knows this may pay 
dividends in the future 
he said us and soviet officials were to meet in moscow to 
negotiate the timing of the exchange 
the proposed program reflects a significant change in 
sovietamerican relations at west point 
two years ago soviet astronaut vladimir a dzhanibekov was 
forbidden by the army to speak at west point and an invitation to 
poet yevgeny yevtushenko was withdrawn on orders from the pentagon 
for 100 years west point has been training foreign cadets in a 
fouryear program currently 30 cadets from foreign countries are 
at the military academy

the mayor ordered 11 photographs in a 
vietnam war exhibit that made some people literally sick to their 
stomach moved from city hall lobbies to a less traveled corridor 
an official said friday 
joseph carbone an aide to mayor biagio dilieto said the rest of 
the exhibit 56 photographs remained in the lobbies 
dilieto feared the material was too graphic for children who 
regularly visit the building on tours carbone said in addition he 
said some city employees complained after seeing the photographs 
some were literally sick to their stomach he said 
but veterans said the point of the traveling exhibit is to 
illustrate the horrors of war and that moving the offending 
photographs undermined the message 
i think the exhibit is the most powerful antiwar statement 
ive seen if people have to be made a little uncomfortable to 
understand what war is about i think thats fine its worth the 
jolt said ernest amabile director of the new york state vietnam 
memorial which owns the collection 
joe tomorrow an artist and vietnam veteran who helped city 
officials hang the exhibit earlier this week said the mayors 
action was very insulting to the spirit of the photographers who 
died to take the pictures 
all 67 photographs were taken by news photographers who were 
killed in the war or are listed as missing in action 
i can respect that some people may be disturbed by it but i 
think they should also realize there is freedom of speech 
tomorrow said 
the 11 photos show dead or wounded soldiers and civilians 
including one of bodies of 13 vietnamese lying face down on a mud 
flat and another of a medic attending to a young girl with a hole in 
her thigh 
carbone said the mayor by not removing the 11 photographs 
entirely sought to accommodate people who wanted to see the entire 
exhibit and those who may find the most graphic pictures too painful 
most of the 15 previous exhibits of the collection have been at 
art galleries or museums but the show has been displayed at a 
private high school and in a lobby of the state government complex 
in albany ny 
visitors to galleries or museums are tacitly agreeing they will 
accept being shocked surprised or delighted said tamara real 
new havens cultural affairs director when people walk into city 
hall they may end up being shocked or surprised but thats not why 
they are coming

military provocation the north korean central news agency 
reported saturday

some 10 armed bandits fired several rounds of machinegun fire 
toward the post on the north korean side on friday 
radio pyongyang also reported the alleged incident saying it 
seriously threatened the north korean security guards on duty 
and destroyed some facilities at the military post 
the south korean puppets committed a grave military provocation 
by firing largecaliber machinegun bullets at a post of our side in 
the dmz southeast of mount sobang in the central part of the dmz 
that divides south korea from its communist neighbor to the north 
the north korean news agency said 
the military provocation of the south koreans fully shows 
that they seek confrontation and war not detente and dialogue 
the news agency said 
the north korean news agency also reported north korea seized two 
south korean ships that allegedly trespassed into north korean 
waters northwest of changsan cape on jan 29 
the news agency said the alleged intrusion into north korean 
territorial waters was a deliberate plot and that north korea 
captured the ships in selfdefense

princess diana who returned friday from her 
twoday visit to new york won praise from british newspapers for 
making it a success but some said the city expected a combination 
of superstar and girl next door 
the big apple goes bananas over princess the sun tabloid 
crowed in a headline the daily mail called her the queen of new 
york in glowing coverage 
some papers reported cool spots in a warm reception and one said 
americans are overeager and dont understand real royalty 
americans love a star with a generosity that is not quite 
british charles laurence wrote in the conservative daily 
telegraph 
they are imbued with an egalitarian streak that demands their 
stars be as human as the boy or girl next door 
this creates a sense of impatience that the royals insist on 
the protocols of address and seniority even offscreen and a 
refusal to accept that in such delicate matters as love and marriage 
they are different from that boy and girl next door 
he and other british reporters said americans had asked whether 
making the trip alone meant diana and was having marriage problems 
with her husband prince charles heir to the british throne 
that sort of speculation was frontpage news in britain for a 
time last year 
the telegraph gave first honors for what it called royal 
exploitation to a shop that displayed crude mannequins of the 
royal family with boxes for heads 
to the times dianas reception was hot and cold and 
interpreted critical reports as antibritish while small crowds 
of fans gathered to cheer and socialites gathered for eleventhhour 
tickets to a reception it said others were declaring their 
distaste for royal fuss 
new yorks welcome for the princess veered to the extremes for 
which the city is famous the august journal pronounced 
reports in most papers ooohed and aaahed over both dianas poise 
and the fans who praised her glamour or waited for a quick glimpse 
leaving prince charles behind on her first visit to new york 
she enchanted hardened new yorkers and turned thousands of ordinary 
americans into avid royalists the tabloid daily mail said it 
printed a picture of diana with the caption instant hit 
columnist pete hammill called diana the most famous welfare 
mother in the world they said an apparent reference to the fact 
that her motherinlaw queen elizabeth ii and other members of the 
royal family receive government allowances 
diana and charles the prince of wales live on his income from 
from land and investments and do not receive such an allowance

the president of the american bar association said 
friday he has asked attorney general richard thornburgh to recommend 
a federal waiting period for the purchase of firearms saying 
loopholes in gun laws make it easy to buy semiautomatic weapons 
robert raven a san francisco attorney and president of an 
organization that represents 350000 lawyers nationwide said at a 
news conference that the growing civilian use of military assault 
weapons has focused attention on a problem which our nation cannot 
afford to ignore the association is meeting this weekend in 
denver 
he cited the recent slaying of five schoolchildren and wounding 
of 30 others in stockton calif and a shooting last week at a 
washington dc school in which four were wounded 
raven said that the antidrug abuse act of 1988 gives thornburgh 
the power to develop and begin a federal system to identify 
potential purchasers of handguns who are ineligible by federal law 
to own firearms 
we urge you to conduct the necessary study and swiftly complete 
your recommendations and we specifically urge you to recommend a 
federal waiting period prior to the purchase of firearms he wrote 
in his feb 2 letter to thornburgh in the letter raven did not 
recommend a time frame for a waiting period 
raven said he has not heard from thornburgh but that he hopes to 
talk with him saturday when the attorney general is scheduled to 
attend the meeting 
raven said recent reports indicate the number of assault rifle 
sales has risen from 4000 in 1985 to nearly 40000 last year 
he said there is a glaring loophole in federal gun laws that 
has created easy public access to the assault weapons which can be 
easily modified to be fully automatic 
this problem is not going to go away on its own after the 
stockton incident people flocked to gun shops to buy ak47 
lookalikes or other semiautomatic military weapons he said 
just last week a gunman opened fire on 200 students at a 
washington dc school wounding four our nation must take 
immediate action to put an end to such gunrelated violence 
also friday former democratic presidential candidate gary hart 
addressed the conference and urged lawyers to support a national 
community service program he said it would replace student loan 
programs with a program that requires two to four years of community 
service in return for a college education

stroessner tried to force his most powerful military leader gen 
andres rodriguez into retirement and his recent shakeups of the 
army caused widespread resentment among his officers 
that combined with stroessners ultimate plans to have his son 
succeed him as president led to the violent coup that ended the 
76yearold generals rule and vaulted rodriguez to power on friday 
stroessner tried to take away some of the regiments controlled 
by rodriguez and thus reduce his power a technique he stroessner 
has used for years but this time he committed a very big 
indiscretion edgar insfran an interior minister for 10 years 
during the 1950s and 1960s said in an interview 
rodriguez was bolstered by disaffected officers who resented a 
reshuffling last month that resulted in the retirement of about 100 
army colonels and 35 navy captains said opposition leader domingo 
laino president of the authentic radical liberal party and leader 
of the national accord opposition coalition 
rodriguez took advantage of the general ill feeling within 
most of the military units to deal stroessner a lethal blow said 
laino who returned in 1987 from a long period of exile and now is 
paraguays bestknown human rights activist 
conflict between the two generals had been simmering since 1984 
when the ruling colorado party split divisively into two factions 
the militants who supported stroessner unconditionally and the 
traditionalists who favored democratic reforms and a distancing of 
the 101yearold party from the unpopular authoritarian ruler 
differences between stroessner and rodriguez reportedly came to a 
head in 1987 when the militant faction wrested leadership of the 
party from traditionalists by using strongarm tactics including 
the barring of traditionalist delegates from entering the congress 
where leaders were elected 
at that congress juan ramon chaves in his 25th year as party 
chairman was unseated by sabino montonaro stroessners interior 
minister on friday rodriguez replaced chaves 87 as chairman to 
the cheers of 15000 people who gathered outside the party 
headquarters 
in the five months since stroessner underwent a prostate 
operation from which he has been slow to recover his militant 
supporters have promoted his son gustavo a lieutenant colonel in 
the air force to succeed him that too alienated the military 
rodriguez wanted to break away from the militant group that was 
pushing for the continuance of stroessner line by saying after 
stroessner another stroessner said laino 
in the perspective of acevedo the detonating factor was the 
threat of retiring rodriguez 
in spite of the predominantly military motives for the rebellion 
opposition leaders remain optimistic that rodriguez could bring 
greater democratization of paraguay 
we have firm hopes a government of transition cannot 
survive without a democratic opening said euclides acevedo of the 
revolutionary febrerista party 
other factors such as paraguays deteriorating economy and 
stroessners apparent failing health played a role in the rebellion 
the military crisis alone could not have done this said juan 
carlos galaverna of the dissident popular colorado movement its 
important to remember the real protagonists are the people and the 
military has simply been the instrument 
said insfran the military issue is over now now they have to 
deal with the political problem

last years global average temperature was the 
warmest of the century and the six warmest years of the century all 
have occurred in this decade a study shows 
meteorological officials said it was too early to conclusively 
blame the greenhouse effect by which heat from the sun is trapped 
in the atmosphere by gases acting like the glass walls in a 
greenhouse 
while a warming of this amount is consistent with the 
greenhouse effect caused by the rise in the levels of carbon dioxide 
and other manmade gases in the atmosphere the earths temperature 
fluctuates considerably due to natural causes and no unambigious 
connection can yet be made said david parker a climate expert at 
britains meterological office headquarters in bracknell southern 
england 
it could take 20 years of temperature rises before the greenhouse 
effect could be detected with much certainty he said in a recent 
interview 
the apparent warming trend was revealed in analyses of global 
weather records by the meteorological office and the university of 
east anglia in norwich southeast england 
their work showed that 1988s global average temperature was 572 
degrees fahrenheit 05 degrees higher than the 30year global 
average ending in 1979 
since 1979 the succession of tiny increases has been too steady 
for the weathermen to ignore parker said 
the six warmest years in the century have all been in this 
decade he said they were 1988 1987 1983 1981 1980 and 1986 in 
descending order of warmth 
global temperatures have risen by about 08 degrees since the 
beginning of the century he said 
britain has had a mild winter with temperatures averaging 5 
degrees above the normal temperature of 40 degrees in december and 
january 
spring flowers are shooting up and blooming and a blackbird 
nested and reared its young two months early in a department stores 
outdoor christmas tree in cheltenham southwest england 
the debate over whether there is a greenhouse effect has been 
fueled by unusual weather patterns in recent years including a 
serious drought in the united states last summer 
last week us scientists said they could find no evidence of 
any overall temperature increases for the united states from 1895 to 
1987 
but they stressed that the united states makes up only 6 percent 
of the earths surface and said studies of other portions of the 
earth could have different results

the interior ministry on friday accused 
the cia and salvadoran navy officers of plotting to falsely portray 
the nicaraguan government as an arms supplier to leftist salvadoran 
guerrillas 
officials said four nicaraguan criminals were hired to steal 
weapons from the nicaraguan army and smuggle them into el salvador 
where the arms were to be intercepted and shown as proof that 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government was aiding the rebels 
the nicaraguan government has long denied that it has shipped 
weapons to the guerrillas fighting el salvadors usbacked 
government 
the us embassy had no immediate comment on the interior 
ministry charges and no spokesmen were immediately available at the 
us embassy in san salvador because of vice president dan quayles 
visit 
a salvadoran navy spokesman lt jose castellanos said he knew 
nothing about the accusations 
oscar loza operations chief for nicaraguas state security 
agency said the alleged plot came to light after the four 
nicaraguans were arrested in december and january during an 
investigation of a crime streak in chinandega and leon two 
provinces close to el salvador 
loza said the men never got a chance to actually steal any 
weapons 
this is a group of delinquents used by the cia and salvadoran 
naval intelligence in subversive acts against nicaragua loza 
said thats the only type of people they can hire now 
loza spoke at a news conference at the interior ministry which 
includes the security agency 
he said the men were robbery suspects who fled to el salvador in 
november el salvador is across the gulf of fonseca from nicaragua 
on the pacific coast 
after being arrested in el salvador the men allegedly were 
approached by cia agents and salvadoran officials who offered them 
10000 and told to return to nicaragua and steal weapons from a 
military installation on los castanones a small island off the 
northwestern port of corinto 
he said the men also were promised 5000 for each redeye 
surfacetoair heatseeking missile they stole and about 200 for 
each ak47 assault rifle

some danced some sang some merely 
gaped at the pools of blood in the street thousands cheered the end 
of a 34yearold dictatorship and others wondered whether a new one 
had begun 
thousands of people poured out of the homes on friday the 
morning after the night that gen alfredo stroessner was overthrown 
by his secondincommand gen andres rodriguez 
for many stroessner was the only leader they have ever had a 
man who snatched power in a 1954 coup then lost it more than three 
decades later to another military leader 
but paraguayans of all ages and political persuasions left their 
homes to celebrate to satisfy curiousity and to simply stare at the 
damage left by nearly five hours of heavy fighting between rebels 
and loyalist troops 
an estimated 5000 people gathered in downtown asuncion two 
blocks from the rallying crowd wreckers towed away bulletriddled 
cars that were caught when rebel tanks and troops attacked police 
loyal to stroessner 
five hundred yards away about 100 troops guarded the gray 19th 
century presidential palace overlooking the paraguay river where 
stroessner ruled and where rodriguez was sworn in 
two miles from downtown small groups of citizens gathered in 
front of the presidential escort battalion which remained loyal to 
stroessner and was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting 
throughout the night 
the roof of one of the four buildings had collapsed and there 
were gaping holes in the brick walls 
caravans of cars many flying the red white and blue paraguayan 
flag or the crimson banner of the ruling colorado party or the 
blue banner of the opposition liberal party drove through 
downtown horns honking 
the nations principal radio stations and their mobile units 
carried on a marathon of interviews with politicians and citizens 
many of whom suffered at the hands of the stroessner regime 
i think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affected 
our country for so long has come to an end thanks to the armed 
forces said aldo zuccolillo publisher of abc color the 
countrys biggest newspaper at the time it was shut down by the 
stroessner government in 1984 for among other reasons preaching 
hatred among paraguayans 
zuccolillo said he will reopen the paper as soon as he can obtain 
printing paper and ink 
im happy that this man stroessner is gone for good but im 
sad about the dead said a young waitress who spent the night 
huddled in a restaurant near the police headquarters estimates of 
the dead ranged up to 200 
i dont know if were going too have democracy and liberty now 
but weve taken the first step said humberto rubin owner of 
radio nanduti forced to close in 1987 for its criticism of the 
government

paul g kirk jr the outgoing democratic national 
party chairman is considering a run for governor of massachusetts 
next year two newspapers reported friday 
kirk who is well known in national political circles but not a 
household name in his home state was described as weighing a run 
for governor in stories that appeared on fridays front pages of the 
boston globe and the wall street journal 
kirk who has never held elected office is stepping down next 
week as dnc chairman he was traveling in hawaii on friday and could 
not be reached 
in massachusetts democratic professionals said kirk could be a 
formidable candidate 
the apparently orchestrated effort to float his name as a 
contender took some democratic political veterans by surprise but 
nearly all agreed that he would be a serious candidate 
im surprised my own sense of pauls decision was he wanted to 
return to private life said political pollster and consultant 
john marttila but he added hes a capable talented human 
being 
kirk 51 was born in the boston suburb of newton and owns a home 
in marston mills on cape cod he had worked for a boston law firm 
and was expected to return there 
kirk who turned down a chance for another four years as 
committee chairman would be seeking the post of gov michael s 
dukakis the former democratic presidential nominee who has said he 
will not seek reelection next year 
likely democratic candidates for governor include lt gov evelyn 
murphy and former massachusetts attorney general francis x 
bellotti in addition there is great suspense surrounding the plans 
of us rep joseph p kennedy ii 
kirk was a longtime aide to sen edward m kennedy dmass and 
served as political director in the senators 1980 presidential 
race according to marttila and others it is highly unlikely that 
kirk would enter a democratic primary for governor if the race 
included joseph kennedy the senators nephew 
the younger kennedy has topped the list of preliminary polls of 
likely candidates for governor but he has not revealed his plans

in a sex discrimination challenge to the 
scholastic aptitude test a federal judge ruled friday that new york 
state may not use sat scores as the sole criterion in determining 
scholarship winners 
us district judge john walker said it apparently was the first 
case in which female students sought to use federal civil rights 
statutes to challenge a states reliance upon standardized tests 
the evidence is clear that females score significantly below 
males on the sat while they perform equally or slightly better than 
males in high school walker wrote 
the judge said the state education department and its 
commissioner thomas sobol both named in the suit rely solely upon 
the sat in awarding regents and empire scholarships he said that 
practice deprives young women of the opportunity to compete 
equally for these prestigious scholarships 
the judge ordered the state to change its method of awarding the 
scholarships 
state officials said they had no immediate comment on the ruling 
isabelle katz pinzler director of the womens rights project for 
the american civil liberties union and lead attorney for the case 
hailed the decision 
its really a very important precedentsetting case she 
said its really not fair to anybody to give a scholarship based 
on a threehour test given on a saturday afternoon rather than 
basing it upon four years of high school 
stanford vonmayrhauser general counsel for the educational 
testing service of princeton nj the creator of the sat said 
i think it the ruling will have limited application critics of 
the sat will have false comfort if they think the test is doomed 
new york and massachusetts are the only states that give state 
scholarships based solely upon sat scores 
the suit was filed by the aclu on behalf of the new york chapter 
of the national organization for women the girls club of america 
and 10 female students

directoractor john cassavetes known for his 
freewheeling improvisational style in such movies as faces and 
a woman under the influence died friday he was 59 
gena rowlands his wife of three decades and the star of most of 
his films was at his side when he died at cedarssinai medical 
center said his publicist esme chandlee 
he died of complications resulting from cirrhosis of the liver 
ms chandlee said 
cassavetes was one of only four entertainers ever to be nominated 
for an academy award in three different categories ms chandlee 
said he was nominated as best writer for his original screenplay of 
faces in 1968 as best supporting actor in the dirty dozen 
in 1967 and as best director for his original film a woman under 
the influence in 1974 
among cassavetes bestknown acting roles was as the husband of a 
woman who conceives a baby by the devil in rosemarys baby a 
1968 film that also starred mia farrow 
he also starred with miss rowlands susan sarandon and molly 
ringwald in tempest director paul mazurskys film adaptation of 
shakespeares play among other films 
faces which he also directed was a personal probing study 
of loneliness the film won three oscar nominations and five venice 
film festival awards 
a woman under the influence is the story of the souring of a 
middleclass marriage which starred his wife 
i think they both had a great fondness for a woman under the 
influence ms chandlee said of cassavetes and miss rowlands 
it was certainly his most commercial film 
the movie earned miss rowlands a golden globe as best actress and 
an academy award nomination for best actress 
his first movie as a director was shadows filmed from 
195760 on what amounted to pennies using a handheld 16mm camera 
technically the film was a misfit but as an art form it has been 
referred to by film buffs as a masterpiece the movie is about a 
fairskinned black girl living in new york with her two brothers 
the type of films we do are different cassavetes once said 
in an interview with the associated press commercial movies have 
no feeling no sensitivity most people tell me that people wont 
understand films with feeling but everyone can feel 
i think people are very stiff money makes people stiff and we 
want it and we have to pay the penalty i never agreed with 
stiffness i think people have an understanding of what their life 
is i define success by being a realist and not humiliating people 
im a revolutionary but not in the political sense 
in 1980 he was honored by the museum of modern art with a 
retrospective of his works that same year he was also honored by 
filmex the los angeles film festival he was 50 at the time 
by the age of 50 i would like to know that im not dead that 
theres some continuity to my life he said 
cassavetes a native of new york grew up poor his break in 
acting came when he played a brooding young bullfighter in a 
production of the old omnibus tv series in 1953 that led to 
roles in playhouse 90 studio one kraft theater and 
climax his official debut on the silver screen was as an extra 
in 14 hours in 1951 he starred in taxi in 1953 and was in 
the night holds terror in 1955 
he remained an independent filmmaker who marched to the tune of a 
different drummer if it came to a good film or what makes 
feeling id take feeling he once said 
cassavetes developed close friendships with a few actors 
including peter falk a spokeswoman for falk said he was 
devastated by cassavetes death and production of the reprised 
columbo television series was halted so falk could be at home 
alone 
this has been a terrible jolt for peter said his assistant 
april araynell there was a very strong bond between them a love 
between them peter is just trying to hold up any way he can 
cassavetes and miss rowlands were married in march 1958 and their 
careers were seldom separate after that they had three children 
nicholas alexandra and zoe 
cassavetes had a vast enthusiasm for films especially his own 
a woman under the influence rips your guts out he said 
i have seen it 30 times and i cant look at it any more it is too 
powerful an experience 
private funeral services were scheduled for monday in los angeles

while critics say he has broadcast dissonant 
signals about the economys health alan greenspan has made it clear 
beyond any misunderstanding that his no 1 fear is inflation 
based on greenspans repeated acknowledgment of that fear and 
his actions in allowing interest rates to rise substantially since 
becoming federal reserve chairman greenspan might appear to be at 
odds with the white house 
is he 
on january 24 greenspan told congress that in his view inflation 
was too high from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth of 1988 
the gross national product deflator a measure of inflation rose 
41 percent compared with 31 percent a year earlier he said it 
might have been even worse were it not for higher interest rates 
the next day president bush stated that his fears of inflation 
were not as acute as those apparently held by greenspan igniting 
rumors of a rift between the fed and the white house 
greenspan denies it stating that such notions are exaggerations 
the white house hasnt declared itself on whether there is a 
disagreement but there are signs that a fundamental one could 
develop 
it lies in differing priorities 
greenspan has a lot of experience with inflation having honed 
his advisory skills during the days of the great and unlamented 
inflation of the 1970s he knows that when it gets a head of steam 
it cant be stopped short of a crash 
in his view that point may be approaching there is evidence 
that labor is beginning to press for more costly benefits if not 
higher wages the jobless rate is down to very low 53 percent and 
perhaps falling still there may be little idle industrial capacity 
that can accommodate further growth 
bushs economic plan is based on economic growth which rising 
interest rates generally obstruct there are many reasons political 
and economic for seeking that growth none is more important than 
this growth means revenues 
nobody needs to be reminded how important higher revenues are for 
reducing a budget deficit which the administration is commanded by 
law to do higher revenues improve your options you dont need cut 
politically popular projects 
higher interest rates can cause a lot more problems for the 
administration if only for the reason that nobody owes more money 
and pays more interest than uncle sam interest costs today are 
about 15 percent of budget outlays 
higher interest rates also impact business development the 
answer to capacity restraints is for industry to expand production 
facilities but will that happen if business fears interest rates 
will continue to climb 
the expansion issue touches on two more important considerations 
the value of the dollar and the trade deficit higher interest rates 
might strengthen the dollar a stronger dollar would hurt us 
exports and might raise imports 
higher interest costs also would add difficulties to an already 
impossibly complex and politically tricky issue that of bailing out 
the failed savings and loan associations as it is this issue is a 
nowin situation anyway 
nobody yet knows for example where the scores of billions of 
dollars needed will come from now consider that just tiny increases 
in interest rates could make that job billions of dollars more 
difficult to manage 
it might be as greenspan indicates that any differences of 
opinion with the white house are exaggerated but the potential is 
there and if only minor differences now exist they could become 
exaggerated by events

please excuse this question which might seem idiotic oh great 
monarch of triumph but werent you supposed to be in bulgaria 
today bahbah langthegoat asked kermitterrand in a recent 
episode 
of course im in bulgaria puerile lamb kermitterrand snaps 
whats the point of being god if you cant be in two different 
places at the same time eh 
another memorable segment found humor in the release of the last 
three french hostages from lebanon a few days before the first round 
of presidential elections last may 
charles pasqua interior minister in chiracs conservative 
government then in office took the credit chirac was criticized on 
grounds he was trying to manipulate voters 
how did you get them to release the hostages one incredulous 
puppet asked a longtusked walrus pasqua 
simple the walrus replied i promised to give them back on 
monday amadou said he never dreamed the show would be so 
successful 
kermitterrand has graced magazine covers babete watches are the 
latest chic souvenir and cocreator jean roucas who appears on the 
screen with the puppets is stopped frequently for autographs 
people realize more and more that politicians are conniving 
wheelerdealers on the left and the right and we say so on the 
show said roucas 36 who does the voices for all the puppets 
the political press in france is at the service of politicians 
were saying things the way they are 
the bebete show its title plays on the twin meanings of the 
word bete stupid and animal is written the same day its 
broadcast taking final form in midafternoon by the time they meet 
amadou and roucas have already combed the newspapers and the jokes 
fly 
france recently has been following the news of an insider trading 
scandal that touched friends and associates of mitterrand and forced 
the resignation of a highranking finance ministry official 
on the final show before a break it will return in late 
february kermitterrand appeared as a machinegun toting 
kermitterambo 
furious because he could neither stop his political enemies from 
fueling the insider scandal nor prevent amadou and roucas from 
writing it into their script kermitterambo gunned them all down 
alone at last he quickly reassured viewers 
dont worry on feb 27 god will bring them all back to life

the spanishlanguage television networks 
univision and telemundo are convinced they have more viewers than 
nielsen and arbitron ratings show so they may pay for a special 
survey of hispanic viewers 
the competing networks joined last year to explore better ways of 
charting hispanic viewing habits much is at stake because ratings 
are used as a basis of negotiating advertising rates 
i dont think that its any secret that the hispanic 
representation of households included in the survey samples is far 
less than it should be said univision vice president emma 
carrasco 
both ac nielsen co and arbitron ratings co the leading 
television audience rating services bid on a possible contract that 
could total 40 million over the next five years said norman hecht 
chairman of the spanish television research committee formed by the 
two networks 
tests of the hispanic ratings could start next fall 
both ratings companies propose using people meters handheld 
devices viewers use to punch in individual code numbers as they 
watch television to allow tracking by age and gender 
univision and telemundo have competed for hispanic viewers with 
increased newscasts and new entertainment shows since 1987 they 
hope a tailormade rating service will come up with higher audience 
numbers 
the payoff will be that we will get our share of the general 
market advertising budget said milagros carrasquillo univisions 
director of network research right now were less than 1 percent 
of the total revenue to television and were 8 percent of the total 
marketplace 
hispanic broadcasters have long contended differences in 
language culture and viewing habits have led to low hispanic 
representation by the rating services 
theyre underreporting our core audience said mike martinez 
sales manager for los angeles kmex he said only 17 percent of 
hispanics responded to arbitrons may ratings survey in spanish but 
stationcommissioned surveys show spanish is preferred by about 80 
percent of the areas hispanics 
the rating services dont admit theyre shortchanging 
spanishlanguage stations pointing to bilingual materials and other 
adjustments in arbitrons november ratings for los angeles 198 
percent of households were listed as hispanic slightly below the 
areas 207 percent hispanic representation in the general 
population a spokeswoman said 
a national survey targeted at hispanics and finetuned to their 
language and culture could produce a better picture of hispanic 
viewing but arbitron research chief jim peacock doesnt think it 
will mean a big ratings jump for spanishlanguage stations 
the hispanic market is coming of age there is a lot more 
money real or potential at stake said donald travis telemundo 
general sales vice president in new york us hispanics number 185 
million and their number is growing at a faster rate than the us 
population overall according to the us census bureau 
hispanics are projected to spend 141 billion in 1989 according 
to hispanic business magazine and are being targeted by more big 
companies last year advertisers spent 550 million to reach 
hispanics about 46 percent going to spanishlanguage television 
the magazine reported 
for several years univision has paid miamis strategy research 
corp to measure hispanic tv viewing through personal interviews 
these surveys show greater numbers for hispanic television stations 
than arbitrons ratings of the same markets 
arbitrons may book showed kmex averaged 170000 homes in 
primetime evening hours while the strategy research figures 
estimated 470000 homes martinez said 
many advertisers say strategy research overstates the numbers 
and arbitron understates them said telemundos travis there is 
a sizable market out there we have to have that measured by a 
rating system that is accepted throughout the country 
univisions carrasco called strategy researchs approach the 
most effective technique that is currently available and said its 
figures are widely accepted by advertisers most familiar with the 
hispanic audience 
strategy research is not bidding on the possible new contract 
instead the two spanishlanguage networks are reviewing arbitron 
and nielsen proposals that addressed their concerns 
a new rating tool could also break out hispanic viewing for abc 
nbc and cbs not just univision and telemundo telemundos travis is 
willing to take the risk apparently confident his networks numbers 
will increase 
were not interested in loading the deck what we want is an 
accurate crosssection of the us hispanic population said 
travis any service we have will include ratings for the anglo 
networks it would give us an idea of where the crossover is and 
what were up against

the syndicated travel show the great 
escape takes you to wonderful places around the world but cohost 
bob chandler admits that everything is not quite what it seems 
this show is geared for the consumer said chandler a former 
pro football player who is cohost with michelle russell we dont 
offer vicarious travel like the lifestyles of the rich and 
famous we occasionally do an upscale place but mostly we tell 
people about places they can afford to visit a part of any 
successful show is knowing what your direction is our direction is 
to go to places that are easily accessible and that are good 
so you will rarely hear a discouraging word 
we dont go out of our way tosay something is bad or to be 
critical said chandler if we run into a situation we dont 
like well handle it by omission were not selling out and its 
not because were afraid of losing our tradeoff its just that our 
goal is that were looking only for the great places to visit 
we get tradeoffs in the form of free travel and accommodations 
were upfront about that weve got two hosts and four camera crews 
going all over the world and its the only way we could afford it 
its common practice for television shows to accept free travel 
and accommodations but federal regulations require that such 
arrangements be acknowledged on the air 
each weekly halfhour show visits three places a feature 
destination thats usually foreign a discover america segment and a 
weekend escape 
chandler has spent a large part of the past few years on the 
road first as cohost of two on the town a magazine show for 
kcbstv in los angeles and for the great escape 
he had been a been a sportscaster after his football career he 
was a wide receiver for the buffalo bills and played in super bowl 
xv for the oakland raiders he earned a law degree while playing 
professional football 
for this show were on the road 10 to 15 days then were home 
for about the same time he said its tough to complain about 
this job people say you kidding you get to travel everywhere 
they dont see us packing 18 trunks of equipment checking into a 
different hotel every night i was out once last year for 27 days 
we were in seven different locations 
chandler said the great escape uses only original footage 
taped around the world the only exception was one minute of the 
follies bergere at las vegas 
we get offered a lot of footage said chandler but one of 
our strengths is our cameramen we have four crews and they 
frequently work without a host or correspondent besides michelle 
and myself we have used correspondents in australia and europe 
chandler and russell go to different places so they can cover 
more places 
ive been just about everywhere he said but when we start 
traveling again in march i hope we go to the orient the funny thing 
is before this id only been out of the united states once 
the great thing is you learn a lot about the areas you have to 
do research and when you get there you get involved with the 
people you get to see a lot more than tourists do 
i do have some favorite places he said the northern 
island of new zealand at the huka lodge its like an oldfashioned 
hunting club theres a wonderful lake for trout fishing and you can 
go skiing only a few hours away i also love the eastern coast of 
australia from sydney to the great barrier reef the third place is 
the south of france from the burgundy region and the loire valley 
to the mediterranean 
where does chandler go on vacations i usually stay home he 
said he has two children and he and his wife marilyn are 
expecting another child

when george baileys savings and loan verged on 
collapse it escaped a conniving financiers takeover plot with help 
from depositors who donated cash to help the thrift account for 
thousands of missing dollars 
that happens only in the movies 
the script from the 1940s hollywood classic its a wonderful 
life starring jimmy stewart as the virtuous smalltown banker 
would have to be revamped today to dramatize the frightening world 
of failing thrifts 
while washington may eventually require depositors or taxpayers 
to help rescue the countrys most beleaguered savings institutions 
few george baileys have emerged to rally the little people 
instead the government has embraced some of wall streets 
biggest dealmakers people known for multibilliondollar buyouts 
and takeovers not lowrisk lending and christmas clubs 
they include such names as texas tycoon robert m bass and revlon 
group inc chairman ronald o perelman both ranked among forbes 
magazines richest 400 americans 
in exchange for passing off the rescue effort to these 
financiers the government has offered them guarantees against 
losses and in some cases magnanimous tax benefits but the tradeoff 
is raising questions about the buyers motives and their impact on 
the industrys longterm survival 
its very unclear whether many of these investors want to be in 
the sampl business on an ongoing basis said john j kriz a thrift 
and banking analyst at moodys investors service a number of 
them no doubt have exit strategies which call for flipping the 
businesses to others 
critics of the bailouts have implied that the lowpaid 
bureaucrats who rushed to seal many of these deals at the end of 
1988 were no match for the shrewd investors who entered bids 
some of those critics now worry that sickly thrifts could be used 
by their new owners as governmentbacked vehicles to engage in the 
kind of business adventurism that originally sucked the institutions 
into insolvency 
others believe the buyers simply saw shortterm opportunities to 
exploit the grandiose tax benefits which in some cases are worth 
more than the governments sale price of an institution 
john buchanan a first boston corp thrift analyst and former 
chief of staff at the federal home loan bank board the governments 
sampl regulator said takeover artists look at failed sampls as an 
opportunity to make money quite frankly given the nature of the 
transactions they struck im certain theyre not going to do it for 
free 
by far the two deals that best symbolize these concerns were the 
boards biggest sale the american savings amp loan association of 
stockton calif to a group run by bass and the sale of five 
bankrupt texas thrifts to a concern run by perelman 
in the american savings arrangement the bass group is putting up 
500 million receiving 17 billion in government aid and obtaining 
control of a vast network of assets worth more than 30 billion 
perelmans group is putting up 315 million and getting 51 
billion of government aid in exchange for savings units with assets 
of more than 12 billion 
bass 40 is one of four texas billionaire brothers known as 
the boys in their hometown fort worth who control an empire of 
businesses that include oil wells real estate and stocks 
over the last few years bass has dabbled in broadcasting and 
publishing with strategic investments in taft broadcasting co 
macmillan inc and most recently houghton mifflin co 
perelman 45 is known as a ruthless negotiator and manhattan 
partycircuit celebrity whose sprawling macandrews amp forbes 
holdings inc has interests ranging from jewelry to licorice extract 
by far perelmans most flamboyant acquisition has been revlon 
the cosmetics maker hes also made unsuccessful but lucrative 
runs at gillette co the mens toiletry maker 
both men rarely grant interviews and have said little about their 
reasons for buying sampls an area in which theyve had no experience 
but the financiers have hired highly respected conservative 
thrift managers to run the businesses an outward indication they 
want them to pursue the historic strength of the thrift industry 
lowrisk home mortgages 
that would be a welcome change from the ambitious commercial real 
estate lending and generous rates of interest on deposits offered by 
hundreds of nowinsolvent thrifts primarily in the southwest that 
resulted from deregulation in the early 1980s 
perelman and his aides declined to respond to three telephone 
requests for comment bass likewise failed to respond to requests 
but people familiar with his sampl venture said bass was in it for the 
long term 
the bass negotiations werent without controversy in september 
he proposed creating a thrift subsidiary that would use 15 billion 
in assets to engage in merchant banking activities such as 
takeovers the proposal created such a stir it was hastily scrapped 
and the merchant banking plans were scaled way back at the behest of 
government regulators 
the bass and perelman deals differ in a number of key ways those 
differences may determine how well the two sampl ventures perform and 
how long they survive for one thing bass will get relatively few 
tax advantages while perelman can apply previous losses from the 
thrifts as tax deductions for his other businesses 
those deductions are considered so valuable that a rival takeover 
strategist saul steinberg sued the government and perelman 
claiming his offer for the same sampls was unfairly rejected from 
consideration 
on the other hand some analysts have said basss acquisition 
has a greater chance of success over the long haul partly because 
of governmentimposed restrictions on the types of investments it 
can make 
american savings 187 branches also provide a wellestablished 
lending network and the government itself has a 30 percent 
profitparticipation interest 
american savings is somewhat tarnished but its not a bad one 
assuming the deal holds together from the government end bass 
should do fairly well said bert ely a thrift industry consultant 
ely dismissed much of the criticism leveled at the financiers who 
have purchased thrifts saying any blame must be shared by 
regulators and congress 
we can beat up on the perelmans of the world these guys are 
getting rich and maybe they are but only because a federal agency 
went into these deals and did them the way they did he said

a posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago 
for emperors awaits president and mrs bush when they come to china 
feb 25 the guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs 
20000 a night for regular guests 
an electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main 
bedroom 
the diaoyutai state guesthouse stands almost as a contradiction 
to the austerity of todays china 
yes we are socialist explains sun guotong one of the 
officials who run the place but for heads of state you must have 
such things 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union will stay 
there if he accepts chinas invitation to visit this spring so will 
prince charles and princess diana when they come in november 
the 26room guesthouse on the complex simply called no 18 was 
remodeled for queen elizabeth ii when she visited beijing in 1986 
the chinese government pays the bill for official and state 
guests such as these but others have to come up with 20000 a 
night 
diaoyutai which means fishing terrace sits on 100 acres of 
pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond 
the complex is made up of 15 large guest villas no 18 is the 
most sumptuous 
from its goldplated bathroom fixtures and silkcovered walls to 
its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne the villa 
radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby gray city where 
egalitarianism so lately was in style 
but ideology seems to stop at the gates to diaoyutai even during 
the extreme leftist cultural revolution of 196676 chairman mao 
tsetungs wife jiang qing relaxed in villa no 17 by watching 
western movies 
chinas shifting foreign policy can be charted however from the 
guest list in 1959 when the separate villas were built most of 
the guests were communist comrades 
now director cheng shaoliang said most guests are americans and 
japanese 
the vietnamese revolutionary ho chi minh soviet leader nikita s 
khrushchev president francois mitterrand of france and presidents 
richard m nixon jimmy carter and ronald reagan were among the 
parade of world leaders who stayed at diaoyutai 
other hotels in beijing may be more convenient guests can 
come and go more freely cheng said in a recent interview but 
we offer quiet and security they cant match 
diaoyutais telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls 
to guests if the caller doesnt know their room number the police 
who stand at attention at the compounds gates admit only cars whose 
license plates have been cleared in advance 
for the guests however almost anything is possible cheng tells 
a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the 
winter when they were out of season the guesthouse sent peoples 
liberation army soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and 
try to find some he said 
now we wouldnt do that cheng said but almost diaoyutai 
sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has 
special ingredients flown in from all over the country 
it pays 1000 yuan 270 a pound for a rare herb necessary for a 
special scallop soup 
hotels wont do that cheng said 
with that kind of overhead rates start surprisingly low at 140 
a night for a standard room presidential suites cost 500 a night 
but the fanciest villas no 12 and no 18 must be rented in 
their entirety for 20000 a night 
among other recent users of no 18 were prime minister rajiv 
gandhi of india and armand hammer the american industrialist 
prince charles and princess diana are booked for nov 1 
no 18s presidential suite includes separate hisandher 
bedrooms and bathrooms each thickly carpeted and decorated with 
costly art works 
he gets the electric massage chair and whirlpool bath 
she gets a sunken tub with brass rails 
to help cover its annual 28millionyuan 75million budget 
diaoyutai began selectively accepting nonvip tourists and 
businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign 
businessmen last year 
but nonvips need connections to get a room reservation 
people cant come in off the street said sun guotong 
chengs deputy 
the club with a 40000 membership fee also is intended only 
for the leading people sun said 
if a lot of people come the air is not so fresh he added 
while walking through the deserted exercise room threelane bowling 
alley and billiards room the indoor swimming pool is only four feet 
deep very safe for visiting leaders sun said 
he paused in front of a green feltcovered table used for playing 
the chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to 
reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new 
game 
mahjong in china is practically synonymous with gambling which 
is illegal do guests gamble 
i dont know sun said diplomatically

by his own account oliver l north would have 
fallen on his sword for president reagan more than two years ago if 
it werent for the prospect of the irancontra indictment which 
finally has gone to trial in us district court 
now north and his attorneys have made clear that none of his 
former superiors is immune from their strategy for beating a 
criminal rap in reagans worst scandal reagan himself may be called 
to the dock only president bush has been excused so far by judge 
gerhard gesell 
after exhaustive investigations by a presidential commission and 
the congress it remains to be seen whether norths trial expected 
to last five months will produce any startling new revelations 
about the bizarre sale of weapons to iran and the transfer of 
profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
but north armed with reams of previously undisclosed documents 
has vowed a fight to the end to prove that his actions in the 
case were authorized by others 
as far as reagan and bush are concerned neither north nor other 
irancontra defendants could produce in the previous investigations 
any conclusive evidence to undermine the thenpresident and vice 
presidents mutual disclaimer of any prior knowledge about the 
diversion of some of the iranian arms money to the contras at a 
time when congress forbade us assistance to the rebels 
but north repeatedly told congress he presumed reagan knew 
and that he had sent several memos up the line from his national 
security council desk others have wondered how bush who attended 
many meetings where the arms deal was discussed could have been 
out of the loop as he has said 
north also told congress that the irancontra caper was fully 
supported not only by his former immediate bosses national security 
advisers robert mcfarlane and john poindexter but thencia director 
william j casey who died on may 7 1987 a month before north 
broke his silence casey had acknowledged the cia played a role in 
the shipment of arms to iran but denied knowing anything about the 
contra end of the scheme 
i was not the only one who was enthusiastic about the idea 
said north in his capitol hill testimony the director used many 
words all effusive 
according to north casey looked upon the irancontra operation 
as just the beginning of things to come he had in mind an 
overseas entity capable of conducting operations or activities in 
assistance of us foreignpolicy goals north said 
in caseys view north said it would bestandalone 
selffinancing and independent of appropriations 
north said casey and other top administration officials wanted 
north to take the hit if and when the scheme unraveled and the 
former marine lieutenant colonel said he was prepared to do just 
that to a point i do honestly believe that they expected ollie 
would go quietly north testified and ollie intended to do so 
right up until the day that somebody decided to start a criminal 
prosecution 
it is a case which had its beginnings not in the united states 
or iran or nicaragua but in lebanon and that is where it blew up 
in the administrations face when a prsyrian magazine first 
reported in early november of 1987 mcfarlanes secret trip to 
tehran in 1985

while a dozen congressional committees grope 
publicly for ways to raise an estimated 85 billion to end the 
savings and loan crisis the most important decisions will likely be 
made by a handful of players far from the television lights 
foremost according to others involved in the process are likely 
to be president bush himself rep dan rostenkowski dill and 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
rostenkowski and bentsen chair respectively the taxwriting 
house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee 
these two men will be capitol hills brokers with the bush white 
house on who will pay for the cleanup of the ailing industry 
well hold our hearings and other committees will hold theirs 
but ways and means will grab it in the end says rep henry 
gonzalez dtexas who heads the house banking committee that 
panel along with the senate banking committee chaired by sen 
donald riegle dmich have jurisdiction over the savings and loan 
industry 
treasury secretary nicholas brady already is bushs point man in 
the dealings with congress requesting weekly meetings with the four 
committee chairmen the senior republicans on those panels and the 
speaker of the house jim wright 
bradys credibility was badly damaged in floating one of the 
major ingredients of the rescue package as a user fee on bank 
and sampl depositors instead of as higher federal insurance premiums 
on the institutions themselves 
one source close to the backandforth floating of ideas said 
rostenkowski expects to bargain any compromise directly with bush 
who as a texas congressman two decades ago served on the ways and 
means panel with rostenkowski 
the illinois democrat after meeting with brady gonzalez and 
wright recently described bradys proposed 25cent user fee on each 
100 of deposit as flat as a pancake he said he is concerned 
that whatever agreement is reached the administration will say it 
was congress doing 
briefly here are sketches of some of the central figures in 
resolving the sampl crisis 
m danny wall the chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
who said when he took the job 18 months ago that he was confident of 
resolving the industrys problems now he has lost the confidence of 
key house republicans because of the manner in which the bank board 
rescued 75 institutions in december at a cost of nearly 20 billion 
to the government over the next decade 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp the relatively flush fund that insures deposits in commercial 
banks carrying an fdic sticker on their windows he supports the 
separation of the federal savings and loans insurance corp from the 
bank board and opposes charging banks higher insurance fees to raise 
money to resolve the sampl problems some industry and government 
officials say siedman wants to take over the governments deposit 
insurance programs covering savings and loans and credit unions as 
well as banks 
wright criticized by walls predecessor edwin gray for 
intervening in 1986 on behalf of savings and loan institutions in 
his home state it was that action gray says that delayed for 
nearly two years legislation that gave fslic an infusion of 108 
billion in new money to close insolvent sampls 
wright contends he was seeking only a hearing on behalf of his 
constituents his intervention is one of six allegations of 
wrongdoing under investigation by the house ethics committee 
sen jake garn of utah a former banking committee chairman and 
now its senior republican he was the prime author along with 
exrep fernand st germain dri and onetime chairman of the 
house banking committee of the 1982 law deregulating the thrift 
industry 
critics blame part of the current crisis on that legislation 
which allowed sampls to expand their lending activities away from home 
mortgages into more risky commercial ventures 
gonzalez a 72yearold outspoken maverick who succeeded st 
germain as the banking committee chairman after st germain was 
defeated last november gonzalez wants to separate fslic which 
insures accounts in thrift institutions from the federal home loan 
bank board the governments umbrella agency for sampl regulation he 
is sympathetic however to the plight of sampls in texas the center 
of the industrys insolvency 
riegle a onetime republican with one of the most liberal 
records in congress he is a relative neophyte on savings and loan 
issues despite 12 years on the banking committee while he has been 
unsympathetic to allowing banks and sampls to venture into new areas 
of investment he says it would be an enormous shift backwards 
to require thrift institutions to return to what was once their 
prime line of business home mortgages 
bentsen whose home state is at the heart of the sampl crisis has 
called the depositor fee proposal really very foolish as 
chairman of the finance committee bentsen will wield considerable 
influence over any eventual solution to the sampl crisis

it was a bank examiners nightmare an 
electronic run at american savings and loan association of stockton 
calif the nations largest insolvent sampl a year ago 
big depositors worried that the longtroubled institution was on 
the verge of toppling sent wire orders yanking out nearly half a 
billion dollars in the first two months of 1988 alone 
regulators ended the nightmare with a few soothing words they 
waved a magic wand called deposit insurance 
the episode symbolizes both the great strength and the underlying 
weakness of the us system of insuring bank and sampl deposits a 
system created half a century ago as part of franklin d roosevelts 
new deal 
bank run the very words make financial regulators queasy and 
evoke depressionera memories of long lines of depositors anxiously 
clutching savings passbooks 
but the run at american savings and loan was straight from the 
hightech 80s there were no mobs pressing at the institutions 
doors only clacking computer terminal keys and whirring magnetic 
discs as money brokers withdrew their wealthy clients cash 
officials at the federal home loan bank board the agency that 
regulates nearly 3000 federally insured sampls stopped the run in 
midmarch with the simple announcement that they would protect all 
depositors even those with accounts exceeding the federal savings 
and loan insurance corps 100000 limit 
ironically the deposit insurance that saved the california sampl 
also helped create the industrys mess the insurance allows savings 
and loan owners to put up a little of their own money take in a lot 
of deposits and gamble on risky loans potentially at the taxpayers 
expense 
thats what occurred with american savings and loan once a 
conservative mortgage lender new management took over in 1983 and 
embarked on a program of rapid growth and aggressive real estate 
lending bad loans grew and last december the fslic had to pay 17 
billion to have the institution taken over by a new owner 
if deposit insurance is part of the problem it has also been a 
source of security for millions and the only thing that has staved 
off disaster for people who found that the repositories of their 
life savings had gone under 
people have an almost mystical degree of confidence in the 
federal sticker on the wall says robert litan a banking expert 
at the brookings institution a liberal washington think tank 
even though the fslic is insolvent they believe the government 
can come up with the money somehow george bush just told them 
that 
one week into his term bush made a point in his nationally 
televised news conference of reassuring sampl customers deposits in 
the nations sampls are sound they are good nothing is going to 
change in that regard the president said 
how then did a once sleepy seemingly secure industry come to 
the point that it needed presidential pronouncements to steady its 
customers nerves how did it sink so low that regulators would 
pledge 31 billion to rescue 205 institutions in 1988 and still have 
350 insolvent but still open institutions to babysit 
the seeds of the ailment have been buried deep within from the 
start they lay in the inherent instability of borrowing short from 
depositors and lending long to home buyers for 20 or 30 years 
that was fine during the long economic boom and stable interest 
rates that followed world war ii sampl executives lived by the 363 
rule take in deposits at 3 percent interest lend the money to home 
buyers at 6 percent and hit the golf course by 3 pm 
by the late 1970s and early 1980s however the industrys 
underpinnings had become wobbly inflation was soaring into double 
digits and the federal reserve board responded by pushing interest 
rates past 20 percent money poured out of the thrifts with their 
low interest rates and into highyield money market mutual funds 
offered by brokerage firms 
by 1980 congress felt it had little choice but to lift the 55 
percent cap on interest paid to sampl depositors or watch thrift 
institutions shrivel at the same time the limit on federal 
insurance was raised from 40000 to 100000 per account 
then two year later new laws gave thrift owners fresh 
investment opportunities commercial and consumer loans 
construction lending and direct investments in development projects 
the idea was that diversification would give sampls a chance to 
enter more lucrative fields and grow less dependent on the roller 
coaster housing market 
regulators also lifted rules limiting brokered deposits to 5 
percent of the total brokers divy up the money of wealthy clients 
and institutions into 100000 chunks parceling them out to 
institutions paying the highest rates 
some thrifts thrived in the new climate but many didnt have the 
experience to succeed and saw their portfolios grow ever more shaky 
even more bedeviling were laws lying dormant in states such as 
texas california and florida giving thrifts power to make risky 
investments as long as the federal interest rate cap and the limit 
on brokered deposits remained in place institutions couldnt 
attract enough deposits to get into risky areas in a big way 
after 1982 that changed enter a new breed of player the high 
flier 
men like don dixon and ed mcbirney who purchased small staid 
institutions such as dixons vernon savings and loan and mcbirneys 
sunbelt savings both in texas and both later bailed out for 
billions of dollars these new owners opened up the phone lines 
scooped up brokered deposits and shoveled the money into risky 
construction and development projects 
along the way they lived well and made powerful political friends 
such as house speaker jim wright dtexas mcbirney threw lavish 
parties at his north dallas home serving exotic game and dressing 
servants in costume he flew important customers on a las vegas 
junket in a borrowed jet 
dixon lent his yacht high spirits to california rep tony 
coehlo chief of the democrats congressional campaign committee 
for lucrative democratic fundraisers 
the party lasted until 1986 when oil prices collapsed across 
texas real estate projects begun on projections of 70abarrel oil 
fell apart borrowers defaulted but the collateral they turned over 
was now worth only a fraction of what they owed regulators estimate 
that about half of the nations sampl problem is centered in texas and 
other oil states 
as the comptroller of the currency robert clarke says of bank 
failures when the economic tide goes out you find out who is 
swimming naked 
and while more and more sampls were becoming financially shaky the 
government had fewer cops sampl examiners on the beat 
the reagan administrations budget office rebuffed edwin gray 
then chairman of the bank board when he pleaded for money to hire 
more and betterqualified examiners 
in 1985 he did some administrative maneuvering freeing the 
examination force from white house budget controls he raised 
examiners salaries and by last year the force had doubled

gray also began the process of requiring sampl owners to put more 
of their own money into their institutions by 1991 the capital 
requirement will be 6 percent 
previous regulators had relaxed the requirement from 5 percent to 
3 percent seeing the move as a way to give struggling thrifts 
greater latitude to work out their problems in the end it just 
created an incentive to gamble because sampl owners had less of their 
own money at risk economists call it moral hazard 
in fact owners of the 350 insolvent institutions still open have 
nothing left to lose a situation ripe for fraud 
bank board chairman m danny wall says fraud contributes 
significantly to 20 percent of all sampl failures and plays some part 
in 70 percent as managers swing for the bleachers in an attempt to 
hit a financial home run and prevent bankruptcy 
while the bank boards push for tougher capital rules and 
supervision will help prevent future problems it came too late to 
head off todays crisis by 1986 the fslic was broke 
early that year the reagan administration proposed selling bonds 
to raise 15 billion and then assessing sampls to pay off the bonds 
the industrys biggest trade association the us league of 
savings institutions one of the most effective lobbies in 
washington balked and found a good deal of sympathy on captiol hill 
when congress thought of thrift executives the image was not of 
dixon and mcbirney but of george bailey the small town idealistic 
building and loan officer played by jimmy stewart in the 1946 movie 
classic its a wonderful life 
congress dithered and finally in august 1987 authorized 108 
billion in industryfunded borrowing by then almost everyone knew 
that would be only a down payment 
today the general accounting office the congressional auditing 
agency estimates it will cost 85 billion to close or merge all the 
insolvent sampls roughly 500 for every taxpayer in the nation 
if you roll back the clock to five years ago this was a 10 
billion to 20 billion problem said litan of the brookings 
institution if we had shut them down then we wouldnt have a 
100 billion problem today 
in the meantime the bank board has been selling insolvent sampls 
to new owners using as little government cash as possible it 
handled 205 last year a postdepression record 
bank board members say they dont have the money to simply shut 
down sampls and pay off the depositors and that its better to arrange 
a rescue than to let an insolvent institution hemorrhage further 
but private analysts say such deals some of which offer large 
tax benefits to the new owners may come back to haunt the 
government by requiring a second and more expensive generation of 
rescues 
typically a large part of the bank boards assistance is in the 
form of a promissory note on which it pays the acquiring 
institution interest 
at years end the fslic had 203 billion in such notes 
outstanding in 1988 alone the agency issued 145 billion in the 
bonds the government is also guaranteeing owners of rescued sampls 
against loss on the existing loan portfolio 
the risks to the government are unlimited said lowell l 
bryan an analyst for mckinsey amp company inc 
now congress and the white house are struggling to raise 85 
billion to 100 billion to deal with the remaining 350 insolvent 
thrifts to pay off the promissory notes and make good on the loss 
guarantees 
treasury department officials have told members of congress they 
will propose another bond issue the difficulty comes in deciding 
where to get the 7 billion to 9 billion a year to pay off the 
bonds 
there are basically three choices all painful 
depositors could pay through a fee but that could send money 
pouring out of federally insured institutions and into money market 
funds 
the institutions themselves could pay but that means either 
further erosion of fragile profit margins or depositors end up 
paying through a lower return on their savings which in turn could 
also send them to money market funds 
the taxpayer could pay but that would either cut president 
bushs already slim chances of keeping his no new taxes pledge 
or mean deep cuts in other government programs 
meanwhile troubles arent over for sampls which lost a 
postdepression record of 94 billion in the first nine months of 
1988 
for one thing the oncehot northeast real estate market is 
cooling a potentially ominous sign for that region 
for another interest rates have been heading higher since last 
spring threatening to recreate on a smaller scale the interest rate 
spread problems of a decade ago that got thrifts into trouble in the 
first place 
moreover the debate in washington over how to solve the problem 
of insolvent sampls may in itself be making the situation worse as the 
public becomes increasingly aware of the problem 
the fear and uncertainty are growing with each succeeding 
article its a real land mine said mark riedy president of 
the national council of savings institutions 
if consumers get it in their heads that im going to play it 
safe and put my money under my pillow you have a real problem that 
youre not going to stop very easily he said 
public officials including the president need to drive home 
again and again that the debate in washington is over the best way 
to raise the money to end the crisis not over whether to protect 
the deposits he said 
along with finding the money congress must also look at some 
sort of never again reforms guaranteeing that the government 
will not be asked again to bail out the sampl industry 
there is some sentiment for turning back the clock returning 
thrifts to their traditional role of home mortgage lending and 
steering them out of speculative commercial ventures 
however that ignores that overspecialization in housing is at 
the root of the industrys trouble private analysts say its both 
too late and unwise to return to the days of george bailey and the 
bedford falls building and loan 
thrift viability in the long run is threatened by a return to 
traditional mortgage lending which according to my research has not 
shown a profit in five years said andrew s carron an analyst 
with first boston corp 
the bank board has already moved toward a number of key reforms 
bigger capital cushions and more vigorous regulatory supervision 
and congress likely will reinforce that in some way 
as to administrative changes the bank board is almost sure to 
lose some of its independence and may lose control over its 
insurance fund

britain is in danger of losing many important art 
works some hanging in hallowed halls for centuries because 
national museums cant match the high prices offered by foreign 
buyers art critics say 
one such work is mappa mundi a 13thcentury world map on vellum 
that is one of the countrys greatest medieval treasures it now is 
held by the hereford cathedral which plans to put it up for auction 
in june because it needs money for extensive building repairs 
some experts say the work could fetch 25 million pounds 44 
million at recent exchange rates 
in 1952 the government set up a safety net in an effort to 
keep important art treasures in britain 
under the plan export licenses are required for objects more 
than 50 years old and in most cases worth more than 16000 pounds 
28000 but if an object is more than 50 years old and also has 
been in britain for 50 years or more a panel of experts is called 
in 
if the experts conclude the item should stay in britain a 
government reviewing committee can delay its export for up to six 
months while museums try to match the buyers price 
works are judged by their aesthetic historic and scholarly 
importance 
one painting that met all three criteria was selfportrait as 
saint matthew by the dutch artist anthony van dyck it had hung in 
england for centuries and went on sale in 1987 the experts 
concluded that its departure would be a great loss to the nation 
but no british museum could match the price of 430000 pounds 
then 785000 offered by a foreigner the painting then was 
shipped to its new owner in zurich switzerland identified only as 
p nathan 
another such setback may be in store this year 
seascape folkestone by the famous landscape painter jmw 
turner 17751851 sold in 1984 to an anonymous private buyer for a 
british record of 73 million pounds 10 million not until 
recently was an export license applied for since no museum has been 
able to match the record price the export license is expected to be 
issued soon 
art critics say the problem derives partly from spiraling market 
prices that have placed some works out of reach of all but the 
gettys of the united states and the japanese the latest rising 
force on the international art market 
but many critics increasingly blame the conservative government 
of prime minster margaret thatcher for failing to help local museums 
keep pace they suggest that government strategies for keeping 
treasures at home arent working 
the rising prices appeal to private collectors faced with high 
inheritance taxes or rising costs of maintaining stately homes 
universities and similar institutions are tempted to sell their art 
collections because of government budget cuts 
the likelihood that the mappa mundi will wind up overseas has 
prompted one member of the house of lords to propose an outright ban 
on exporting some objects 
government officials acknowledge that british rules are among the 
most flexible in europe but they argue that tightening them would 
stifle an export market than brings 21 billion a year to britain 
the system to safeguard this countrys treasures is coming 
dangerously close to being a pointless sham anna somerscocks 
editor of the respected art monthly apollo wrote in a recent 
editorial the collapsing safety net 
it was time she said for the government to decide whether we 
are at all serious about trying to keep great works of art in this 
country 
the export review system created in 1952 endeavored to balance 
the art markets needs with that of the nations art critic kevin 
conru wrote in a survey of the systems used by more than 50 other 
nations 
france he said has a reputation for having arbitrary and 
unpredictable rules which auctioneers believe have inhibited 
trade the netherlands bans entire collections from foreign 
ownership 
nowadays major museums simply cant afford to compete with the 
big foreign buyers the getty museum in malibu calif for 
instance spends more each year on purchases than the combined 
purchasing budgets of britains 13 state museums 
conru and others say the export review system one of the first 
of its kind in the world now is in need of reappraisal 
in 198687 the government reviewing committee considered 26 
objects and delayed the export of 15 eight of them worth a total 
of 26 million stayed in britain the other seven worth 60 
million went abroad 
those that went abroad included old masters drawings from the 
chatsworth stately home whose export was one of the greatest 
artistic losses to this country this century the committee noted 
in the last year 12 objects worth 18 million were saved while 
a dozen worth 14 million went abroad 
sir peter wakefield director of the only private art charity 
helping public collections says the small number of objects 
reviewed indicates something is wrong 
the great bulk of art objects are flowing out without any 
restraint at all he said in an interview 
ms somerscocks says the expert advisers tend to lack vigilance 
knowing that their efforts will be useless since the museums 
lack the money to buy objects back 
museum purchase grants many smaller than the cost of a single 
impressionist painting nowadays have been frozen since 1982 and 
will remain so until 1991 
arts minister richard luce has agreed to review the grant system 
although not necessarily to strengthen it said the governments 
office of arts and libraries 
the money shortage has increased the burden on britains two main 
art funding groups wakefields private national artcollections 
fund and the larger quasigovernmental national heritage memorial 
fund 
the latter created in 1980 has spent more than 100 million 
pounds 175 million saving important art objects 
but art accounts only for a fraction of its work which ranges 
from coastal scenery to endangered butterflies and stately homes 
brian morris a fund trustee says the fund so far has not failed 
to save an important object from being exported 
but this year he said in an interview if things go on 
increasing in price and number as they have then the collision 
course between demand and lack of funds is likely to come 
lord blake chairman of the royal commission on historical 
manuscripts has called for a ban on exporting objects like the 
mappa mundi but doubts it will happen 
memorial fund chairman lord charteris opposes a ban 
one of the beauties of london is that its the center of the 
art trade and i wouldnt want that changed he said still im 
worried about the future

in a longrunning serial with no final 
installment every president tries to find a formula that will 
produce a smooth mutually satisfactory system for dealing with the 
white house press 
president bush and his advisers have been working on it and 
there already is some sniping from an institution that probably is 
impossible to satisfy reporters always will have another question 
and presidents wont always answer 
that conflict is built into their jobs it can be controlled but 
it cant be eliminated 
before laryngitis temporarily stilled his voice bush held an 
informal press conference his first day in office then a pooled 
interview then a 43minute televised news conference 
critics in the media promptly complained that reporters hadnt 
been tough enough in their questions and that bush hadnt been 
specific enough in his answers 
vice president dan quayle held a briefing for reporters the other 
day and stirred a microcontroversy because he wouldnt be quoted by 
name 
bush asked white house reporters to advise him on press 
conference ground rules but got no clear answer 
theres a message in all this accessibility does not guarantee 
satisfaction 
access was an issue and a valid complaint when bush was waging 
his winning campaign there was virtually none because his managers 
were determined to keep control of the news agenda 
but during the transition and in his first weeks as president 
bush has proven far more accessible than ronald reagan ever was 
there is a tradeoff the bush formula precludes questions shouted 
on the white house lawn or at picturetaking sessions or as of 
wednesday night by pool reporters representing the rest of the 
press at white house social events 
reagan took questions at such events but seldom provided 
meaningful information nevertheless that made him appear 
accessible to questioning newsmen 
bush has said hed provide opportunities for meaningful questions 
in place of the shouted ones the news of course is not in the 
questions anyhow it is in the answers 
the willingness of presidents to meet with reporters and answer 
their questions varies with circumstances in the best of times 
most presidents are very accessible in the worst they usually 
avoid questions 
lyndon b johnson sometimes seemed bent on nonstop news 
conferences indoors and out until vietnam policy became an 
overriding and tormenting issue richard m nixon clammed up during 
the scandal that ended his presidency save for periodic news 
conferences he convened to protest his innocence and say that one 
then two years of watergate was enough reagans low access became 
just about no access while the irancontra scandal was unfolding 
bush openness will face its real trial when something goes badly 
wrong 
that latest quayle controversy hardly a blip compared with those 
that hit him during the campaign came when he took part in a 
background briefing for reporters who covered his threeday trip to 
latin america 
such briefings are traditional prior to presidential and vice 
presidential travels they usually are conducted by members of the 
national security council staff and by state department experts on 
the areas involved they speak on condition that they be identified 
only as administration officials the briefings cover logistics and 
explain us policy in the areas involved 
quayle appeared at the briefing on his own trip but couldnt be 
identified by the reporters who attended he could and was by 
reporters who did not attend and the background rules drew 
criticism 
but quayle isnt the first toplevel traveler to take a hand in a 
trip briefing presidents sometimes have done so themselves 
at the same time the incident teaches one of the lessons of 
politics at the top if its said it might as well be said on the 
record because background rules even offtherecord strictures are 
must about impossible to keep 
spiro t agnew learned that the hard way in 1971 after a 
midnight conversation in a williamsburg va hotel suite he 
invited a handful of reporters there for a nightcap conversed off 
the record for an hour or so and expressed misgivings about us 
overtures toward china nixon was just beginning the process that 
restored us ties to the communist mainland the vice presidents 
comments didnt stay off the record for long they found a way into 
print the next day

wealthy sir harry oakes was murdered in 1943 
at his home in the bahamas during an apparent voodoo ritual and 
although the scandal reached the level of the duke and duchess of 
windsor his killer is still unknown 
not that there was a lack of suspects they ranged from his 
soninlaw to the mafia from gamblers angered by his opposition to 
their plans for casinos in the islands to a rabblerousing native 
revolutionary 
the murder of oakes and the cast of suspects detectives and 
royalty might have been put together by agatha christie but the 
story is true and is told in the fourhour twopart miniseries 
passion and paradise which airs sunday and tuesday on abc 
the murder was very big in the headlines said catherine mary 
stewart who plays oakes daughter nancy people were very 
anxious to read anything that would take their minds off world war 
ii 
nancys husband alfred de marigny played by armand assante was 
a major suspect in the murder he was penniless and reputedly had 
been a gigolo 
he was a playboy who had married several wealthy women said 
stewart when he started hanging out with nancy the immediate 
suspicion was that he was after the money her parents were totally 
opposed to the marriage he and the father were alike in some ways 
and even advised each other but my husband felt my father had too 
much control over me 
its a fascinating story and what attracted me to nancy is that 
shes such a complex character she starts out as a teenager 
raised in this protected environment in paradise shes bored and 
when she meets this man of the world he sweeps her off her feet 
apparently it was a very passionate relationship 
despite the title oakes was an american who had made a fortune 
as a gold miner in the klondike he moved to the bahamas to take 
advantage of its lenient tax laws 
the miniseries was filmed in jamaica harvey hart directed from a 
screenplay by andrew laskos 
rod steiger plays oakes mariette hartley is his wife michael 
sarrazin is an island gangster and kevin mccarthy is a real estate 
dealer wayne rogers plays raymond schindler an american detective 
called in to investigate the murder 
schindler was a detective nancy brought in because he had been 
a friend of her fathers said stewart hes not your typical 
private eye he was frumpy rumpled a lot like lt colombo wayne 
rogers played him as rather sarcastic wayne himself is the king of 
bad jokes he was always telling these terrible jokes 
i was with some real pros in a courtroom scene all we had to 
do was sit there and react kevin wayne mariette and i watching 
these people perform i got so distracted i was dead in the water 
kevin would cough and pull at his hankerchief then turn and look 
around mariette was doing all her little things it was magnetic 
stewart said she was pleased that she was openly welcomed by the 
other actors they made me feel a part of the group she said 
so often you work with older stars and they keep to themselves 
she said working opposite assante helped her performance hes 
a very disciplined actor she said he kept me on my toes you 
cant let up when you work with armand 
oakes murder occurred while the duke of windsor was governor of 
the bahamas the scandal including a police conspiracy reached 
into his government but mainly he is pictured as inept when the 
scandal heated up the duke and duchess left the islands to avoid 
the publicity 
the legal investigation was very shoddy said stewart the 
duke hired a couple of detectives from miami who already had very 
bad reputations thats why nancy took it upon herself to hire an 
investigator the murder was made to look like a voodoo ritual 
there were bloody handprints on the walls and chicken feathers 
everywhere the bed had been burned 
the next day the murder scene had been cleaned up all the 
evidence was removed the only fingerprint found was nancys 
husbands but that was suspect there were so many loose ends even 
today 
one theory was that oakes had been killed because he was blocking 
legalized gambling in the bahamas mafia gangsters wanted to expand 
their profitable casinos in havana to the bahamas 
immediately after his death gambling was approved for the bahamas 
and the largest casino of all was built on the site of his mansion

ronald reagans last day in office was quiet 
the white house press room mostly empty but sam donaldson had not 
given up even though it was his last day too 
lets see whats in the driveway he said and trotted 
outside into the bright sunshine of the crisp january morning 
thats one of the things i told brit hume his successor if you 
hang around outside you see a lot of things 
but there was nothing to see even though reagan had conducted an 
east room ceremony and a small motorcade was lined up in the west 
wing parking lot 
donaldson stood on a curb shielding his eyes against the glare 
of the sun and searched for signs of the principals two white 
house guards walked by amused theres sam on a stakeout said 
one laughing 
donaldson moved to another vantage point opposite the door to the 
west wing a vague smile seemed to drift across the face of the 
marine guard stationed at the entrance as donaldson strained on 
tiptoes and shouted at the empty doorway come out come out 
he finally gave up 
the prevailing mood in the white house seemed to be boredom in 
the press room there was nostalgia it was the end of the 
donaldson administration 
donaldson 54 had been abcs chief white house correspondent for 
12 years and was leaving the beat for a new primetime news program 
scheduled to debut later this year 
during his white house years especially during the reagan 
administration donaldson became synonymous in the public mind with 
the pushy reporter it was donaldson who most often shouted 
questions at reagan from the press corral during public appearances 
donaldsons shouting seemed to many viewers rude unseemly 
disrespectful 
for some rightwing columnists donaldson even became shorthand 
for what they saw as a biased liberal eastern press 
the height of this recalled donaldson sitting on the curb 
of the west wing drive came shortly after the republican 
convention reporters were with thenvice presidential candidate dan 
quayle in his hometown huntington ind and there was this sort 
of confrontation as he tried to answer reporters questions people 
im told were booing me go on donaldson go home get out of 
here sam 
i wasnt there i wasnt within a thousand miles of there i 
dont think theres anyone who looks like me and vice versa so you 
see the reaction was simply to find my name and use my name as a 
symbol 
i do not welcome this he said i will be delighted as this 
recedes 
but i understood it because these people who loved ronald 
reagan as a political hero would condemn me and other reporters and 
because of my nature and my visible platform particularly the 
david brinkley shows roundtable it was easier to find me than 
bill plante or chris wallace or somebody else id also been here 
longer 
i put it to you this way yes im aggressive by nature and i 
do not believe in the adage one should be seen but not heard 
no one ever heard me yell at jimmy carter because it was 
unnecessary to talk to jimmy carter except in the last few years 
of his presidency when he hunkered down over the hostage crisis he 
was available 
for reagan the alternatives were go for months or speak out 
and if as they always did when he was in public keep him 50 yards 
away to speak out meant that you had to raise your voice i trust 
from what we know about him no one will have to yell at george 
bush but what im saying ive used whatever tools i felt i needed 
at the time to do my job as a television reporter no more but no 
less 
if he raised the ire of viewers donaldson earned the respect of 
his colleagues despite a healthy ego that once prompted washington 
post reporter marty schram to observe that if there were no such 
thing as television donaldson would go door to door 
sanford socolow former executive producer of the rival cbs 
evening news says donaldson served a very important function 
insisting on openness in a reagan administration that increasingly 
tried to close up 
everybody fought that battle socolow said but donaldson 
was always up there unremitting uncompromising twofisted 
fighting for everybody 
i had a negative impression of him before i went to the white 
house said maureen santini who has covered the white house for 
10 years first for the associated press and now for the new york 
daily news once i got there and met him and got to know him a 
little bit i totally changed my impression ive seen that happen 
time after time after time people get to know him and realize hes 
this delightful character 
it was donaldson she said who most often stood up for the other 
reporters rights 
when presidential spokesman larry speakes was there speakes 
style of dealing with the press was to pit everybody against each 
other she said he would make fun of the person asking the 
question and his ridicule was really very cruel oftentimes it used 
to anger me that the press corps would just sit there and let him do 
that to one of us sam is one of the few people who on occasion 
would come to someones defense 
abc news last week signed cbs correspondent diane sawyer to be 
coanchor with donaldson on the new program as yet untitled 
looking forward to the new assignment seemed to have muted any 
sentimentality donaldson might have felt on his last day at the 
white house 
i want to go ive wanted to go now for some time he said 
if you were to say to me youre going to walk out that gate and 
youre never going to do anything again thats going to be as 
interesting or as important in your business yeah id be upset 
but i dont think thats the case 
nevertheless as he roamed the white house on his last day 
colleagues and staffers continually told him how much they would 
miss him im not leaving abc news he insisted in response 
as he checked in at the tiny abc booth in the far corner of the 
white house press room correspondent lark mccarthy informed him 
that the crew out on the lawn was demanding that he come out for a 
rehearsal of an exchange with anchor peter jennings 
donaldson said they would have to wait tell them he said 
they can fire me as white house correspondent if they dont like 
it

sold during the previous year the commerce department reported

consumers shopping for discounts at general merchandise and 
apparel stores in january probably were disappointed inventories 
were so tight after christmas that many merchants didnt have to 
mark down prices to clear out goods 
the nations largest retailers on thursday reported they had good 
sales gains last month but some industry analysts speculated that 
if stores had more merchandise to sell their january volume might 
have been better 
this trend may continue retailers were still wary about demand 
prospects when they placed their orders for the next several months 
so their stock will remain low 
consumers looking for heavy markdowns may be disappointed 
said edward johnson a retail specialist with the investment firm 
prescott ball amp turben inc i dont think you will see them in the 
spring 1989 season either 
goods were sharply depleted during december as business surpassed 
expectations also stores didnt have much merchandise left over 
after christmas because they had held inventories in check to avoid 
having to run clearance sales with drastic price cuts 
unseasonably warm weather throughout much of the country probably 
encouraged people to go out shopping last month analysts said 
by far the brightest spot in the industry was womens apparel 
jeffrey feiner a vice president at merrill lynch amp co said 
apparel retailers have enjoyed a resurgence over the past few months 
and will probably continue to benefit from womens favorable 
reactions to the more conservative styles now in the stores 
johnson of prescott ball amp turben believes higher outlays for 
womens clothes will lead the turnaround in general merchandise 
spending people will steer a larger share of their spendable income 
toward general merchandisers and away from autodealers for instance 
as he put it women have stopped sitting on their hands 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
reported a 34 percent jump in overall sales last month while sales 
at stores open at least a year known as samestore sales in the 
industry rose 28 percent 
retailers and industry analysts believe samestore sales are a 
more accurate measure of a companys performance than figures that 
include sales from new stores 
analysts recommended against attaching too much significance to 
the tallies because january is the least important month on the 
industrys calendar 
january is such an insignificant month januarys a cleanup 
month after christmas if you had a couple of good days that makes 
a big difference observed jeffrey edelman of drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
moreover several store executives and analysts explained that at 
least part of the percentage increase reflected the fact that this 
januarys sales were being compared to last years fairly anemic 
amounts 
analysts expressed optimism about the retailers earnings for the 
fourth quarter of their fiscal year which for many of them ended 
january 28 the financial results are due out later this month 
among the major retailers reporting thursday the nations 
largest sears roebuck and co said its overall sales rose 114 
percent in january and 73 percent for its entire fiscal year its 
samestore sales were up 62 percent for the month and 34 percent 
over the course of the year 
k mart corp said its overall sales rose 69 percent in january 
and 65 percent over the year its samestore sales rose 25 percent 
last month and 28 percent for the full year 
walmart stores incs overall sales rose 30 percent last month 
and 29 percent for the year the discount retailers samestore 
sales rose 13 percent in january and 12 percent for the year 
jc penney co inc posted a 24 percent gain for january and a 
decline of 01 percent over the year the companys samestore sales 
rose 02 percent last month while falling 18 percent for the year 
the decline in penneys sales occurred in part because the 
company discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year 
dayton hudson corp a big department store owner reported a 
152 percent overall sales gain in january and a 144 percent rise 
for the full year its samestore stores rose 94 percent in the 
month and 31 percent in the year 
may department stores cos january sales rose 258 percent and 
fullyear sales rose 189 percent samestore sales rose 76 percent 
last month and 37 percent last year 
fw woolworth co said its overall sales increased 122 percent 
in january and 123 percent in the 12 months samestore sales rose 
6 percent in the month and 64 percent in the year 
montgomery ward amp co reported an 83 percent january sales 
increase and a 46 percent rise for the year it did not provide 
samestore sales figures 
despite strong results in december and january many stores were 
unable to keep place with inflation during the year for all of 
1988 inflation grew at a rate of 44 percent 
the results reported were from the biggest general merchandise 
and apparel retailers unlike monthly retail sales figures released

chrysler corp has announced its second foreign 
joint venture this week an estimated 500 million deal with 
frances renault to build a fourwheel drive sport vehicle 
codenamed jj 
the deal announced thursday by chrysler chairman lee a iacocca 
heralds the first european production for the nations no 2 
automaker in more than a decade 
chrysler also said it posted a 238 percent fourthquarter 
earnings increase although annual profits for 1988 shrank 186 
percent and announced its workers would receive 720 in 
profitsharing this year 
iacocca said joint production of the jj called a minisport 
utility vehicle was scheduled to begin in july 1992 at an 
existing us plant and one in either portugal or spain the 
jeeplike vehicle would cost under 10000 he said 
you look at it and its a wow car iacocca told a new york 
news conference 
chrysler earlier this week announced it would market autos made 
in canada by south koreas hyundai motor corp beginning in 1991 
iacocca said the 5050 venture with frances stateowned 
automaker aims to sell 100000 vehicles in the united states and 
50000 in europe he said the companies contribution to the deal 
would total about 500 million 
chrysler will handle north american sales while renault will be 
responsible for france italy portugal and spain 
iacocca also said hourly and salaried workers would receive 
profitsharing payments averaging about 720 in march the payments 
would be the companys first under a profitsharing agreement signed 
last year with the united auto workers 
general motors corp late last year announced profitsharing of 
about 200 per employee officials at no 2 ford motor co are 
expected to announce profitsharing well over 1000 per worker 
chrysler closed at 2850 down 37 cents a share in new york 
stock exchange composite trading thursday 
iacocca also renewed his argument that the us treasury 
department should impose a 25 percent tariff on all imported trucks 
including minivans and sportutility vehicles some foreign 
automakers slightly modify vehicles to classify them as cars such 
as the popular minivans and thereby have to pay only a 25 percent 
tariff 
iacocca gm chairman roger b smith and ford chairman donald 
peterson have called on the treasury to slap the truck tariff on 
lightutility vehicles 
if it looks like a truck and walks like a truck and acts like a 
truck then its a truck iacocca said 
chrysler reported a profit of 4336 million or 185 a share 
in the three months ended dec 31 that compared with earnings of 
3502 million or 157 a share in fourth quarter 1987 
revenue totaled 969 billion up 136 percent from 853 billion 
in the corresponding 1987 quarter 
for the full year chrysler had a profit of 105 billion or 
466 cents a share down 186 percent from 129 billion or 590 
a share in 1987 annual revenue rose to 355 billion from 293 
billion the previous year 
the 1988 results were reduced by 931 million due to a 150 
million charge for previously announced plant closings in chryslers 
acustar parts subsidiary 
iacocca said annual results also were affected by the companys 
strategy to increase market share by reducing some auto prices and 
offering sales incentives 
chryslers share of the us car and truck market rose to 14 
percent from 123 percent in 1987 chrysler said it sold 221 
million vehicles the first time it sold a million cars and a 
million trucks in the same year compared with 192 million in 1987 
chrysler financial corp the automakers financing arm reported 
a fourth quarter profit of 74 million up from 60 million a year 
earlier for the full year chrysler financial had a profit of 259 
million up from 226 million in 1987 
automakers and analysts have predicted 1988 would be the 
industrys best earnings year ever with the big three posting 
combined profits of 11 billion the previous record was the 
combined 98 billion profit in 1984 
general motors corp and ford motor co are expected to release 
their fourthquarter earnings in midfebruary

for more than 10 years general motors 
corps sprawling assembly plant here has been lurching and stalling 
like an old duster 
so frequent have been the layoffs and startups union officials 
said thursday that many of the 2100 workers are skeptical about 
gms announcement that the plant will shut down indefinitely in 
august 
theyre still in a waitandsee mode said arthur t grniet 
a 24year veteran of the plant because there have been so many 
layoffs the perception in everyones mind is that ill get called 
back 
but gm officials and industry analysts threw cold water on that 
perception thursday 
id say the chances of that plant reopening are very low 
because gm still has too much production capacity said douglas 
laughlin who follows the automaker for the wall street investment 
firm bear stearns amp co 
the plant built in 1948 assembles two of gms abody cars the 
oldsmobile cutlass ciera and buick century it was hit by temporary 
shutdowns ranging from a few weeks to several months in 1977 
1981 1982 and 1987 
adding to workers optimism that this shutdown too will prove 
to be temporary was the wording of gms announcement the automaker 
said it would idle the plant for an indefinite period rather 
than shut it down permanently 
but that wording in fact was dictated largely by the companys 
contract with the united auto workers which prevents it from 
permanently shutting most factories 
gm spokesman dee allen sought thursday to underline that the 
coming shutdown differs fundamentally from earlier ones 
the real difference is that in the past when the plant has had 
to be shut down or a shift taken off its been because of a 
temporary volume related adjustment he said 
this time allen said gm has decided to reduce its productive 
overcapacity and bring down costs by building acars only at its 
plants in st therese quebec oklahoma city okla and ramos 
aripze mexico 
those plants which already build acars can easily meet the 
demand for the olds cutlass buick century and other models in 1990 
and beyond he said 
what that means is we dont have a product to build in 
framingham anymore thats very different from the simple volume 
adjustments that weve had to make in the past allen said 
philip b ernst chairman of framinghams board of selectmen 
said thursday he was optimistic gm would eventually decide to build 
some other models in framingham but allen was skeptical about that 
too 
it isnt as if there is a shelf with a lot of products and all 
you have to do is get someone to give you one he said there 
arent those products out there 
the plants high point in recent years came in august 1987 when 
gm invested 240 million in a new paint shop 
until this weeks announcement the low point was in november 
1987 when the plant shut down indefinitely laying off 3700 
workers it reopened last may with the current 2100 employees more 
than half of whom have 20 years or more of service 
allen refused to explain why gm chose to close the framingham 
operation rather than one of the other three acar plants 
each facility has certain advantages and disadvantages some 
are material some are physical some have to do with human factors 
you have to weigh all of those things when you make one of these 
decisions he said gm is not going to discuss the specific 
reasons behind its evaluation of a facility

the investigation into alleged fraud at the 
nations major futures markets may have doomed the timehonored and 
lucrative practice of dual trading on at least one of the exchanges 
a newspaper reported today 
the chicago tribune quoted unidentified sources as saying chicago 
board of trade officials are drafting a plan that would force 
traders to trade either for themselves or customers but not both 
on a given day 
dual trading under which a trader buys or sells futures 
contracts for himself and for customers has come under attack as a 
potential conflict of interest 
one complaint against the practice is that it creates a situation 
which allows a trader who has a customer order for a large 
transaction to first trade his own account in a way that would 
profit from price swings resulting from filing the customers order 
this practice would violate the current law 
the board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange both 
permit dual trading however some traders who fill orders for 
brokerage houses are prohibited by the firms from trading their own 
accounts 
brokers and traders at both the merc and the board of trade have 
been under investigation for two years by federal agents who suspect 
customers may have been defrauded of millions of dollars 
in addition to restrictions on dual trading the board of trade 
officials also are expected to propose a deadline for bringing large 
orders to the trading pits the tribune said 
as it is now large orders sometimes show up just seconds before 
closing creating frantic buying and selling as well as completion 
of deals after the closing bell has sounded 
the tribune said the board of trade is expected to announce these 
and other proposed reforms next week 
meanwhile at the merc richard lowrance resigned from the 
exchanges 24member board of governors 
the exchange said thursday that the resignation was for personal 
reasons 
the resignation was not related to the continuing federal 
investigation of suspected trading fraud said merc spokesman andrew 
yemma 
in washington the chairman of the house agriculture committee 
said thursday that congress could reauthorize the commodity futures 
trading commission more quickly if the fbi would share findings from 
its tradingfraud investigation in chicago 
were not asking to be part of the criminal investigation 
said rep e kika de la garza dtexas all we want is 
information that will help us do our job 
the cftcs authority to regulate the nations commodity markets 
expires this year and lawmakers expected fast action on legislation 
to reauthorize the commission through 1994 de la garza said 
thursday 
their plans were altered by disclosure of the fbis undercover 
investigation of the futures markets 
de la garza said he contacted the fbi once the probe was 
disclosed several weeks ago seeking information that would help in 
the committees review of the cftc reauthorization 
we havent seen a thing he said zilch at this time 
the fbi had no immediate comment

coworkers probably tumbled in laughter when 
someone not too long ago adjusted his tie stood up in the boardroom 
and said with a straight face i predict people will actually pay 
real money to watch fake wrestling on television 
but the idea was so crazy it was brilliant in todays expanding 
universe of payperview television no programming concoction is 
too outrageous for those addicted viewers cruising for a new video 
fix 
with payperview cable television subscribers can wolf down a 
buffet of television events including movies concerts boxing 
and more than enough wrestling without winching themselves off the 
sofa seats are frontrow and best of all there are usually no 
stupid commercials 
carrace fanatics with 13 to spare can see the miller high life 
500 on june 17 with no breaks in the action 
stircrazy businessmen taking shelter in some holiday inn can 
fork over 7 for a private television broadcast of a softcore porno 
movie 
thousands of viewers are expected to shell out 15 bucks in april 
to watch evel knievels son go motorcycle jumping 
and in 1992 nbc will offer up to 200 hours of selected summer 
olympic events on a payperview basis the network announced dec 
22 
with so many options theres a heap of money coming through the 
door payperview will become a billiondollar industry within 10 
years up from less than 100 million in 1988 according to industry 
estimates 
its completely convenient said jerry hartman vice 
president of marketing and sales for universal pay tv at eight 
oclock if youre bored you can watch something you dont have to 
get up you dont have to go to the video store or anywhere else 
in theory the payperview process is simple enough you order 
good morning vietnam at 7 pm it arrives descrambled on your 
television set an hour later and the movies charged on your next 
bill in practice however it can be a more frustrating experience 
while most of todays payperview transactions from 5 to 40 
are conducted over the phone future technologies may streamline the 
process to a single remote control opticalfiber 
videoondemand cable systems now being tested in southern 
california by gte corp will supply hundreds more titles at any 
time in the day 
for payperview companies the easier the transaction the 
brighter the future parents beware 
payperview caters to the same impulsive buyers who grab cheap 
pens and eyeglass nose cushions at supermarket checkouts never 
realizing they could probably do without until its too late with 
payperview though theres the added chance that just once the 
purchase could be electrifying 
about 600000 fans optimistically coughed up 35 per home to 
watch last junes fight between mike tyson and michael spinks 
which ended abruptly after 91 seconds the nov 7 title match 
between sugar ray leonard and donny lalonde brought in close to 20 
million in payperview grosses just behind the tysonspinks 
receipts 
i think people love the excitement of a big championship 
fight said jeffrey reiss chairman of payperview giant request 
television you can have a group of people over to the house for 
the price of one ticket and have a beer and popcorn party 
nielsen ratings that would make network programmers scribble out 
suicide notes can be solid gold on payperview due to higher 
profit margins we can make money on one rating point said 
scott kurnit president of showtime event television 
although payperview has been workable throughout the 1980s 
only 21 percent of the countrys 45 million cable households now 
have equipment permitting phone orders that figure may double by 
1990 and 40 million homes may have access to payperview by 1994 
according to estimates by paul kagan associates a media research 
firm 
yet the longtouted promise of payperview has been slow in 
arriving stalled by poor marketing filmstudio fears and 
technological obstacles 
cable televisions reputation for poor customer service hasnt 
encouraged subscribers to experiment with a more complicated 
product theres still a long way to go in consumer marketing 
said tim clott executive vice president of the video division at 
paramount pictures and we want to find a technology that 
prohibits home taping 
the studios dont want payperview broadcasts to undermine the 
2 billion home video market worried that payperview customers 
will videotape their purchases the studios typically offer movies 
to payperview systems more than a month after their homevideo 
debut thereby dulling the excitement 
meanwhile payperview program options continue expanding 
robbie knievel evels son will try to hurdle the caesars 
palace fountains on april 14 abc cbs and nbc wont have it but 
you can see the leap or crash on showtime event television on 
feb 10 request television will carry a taped concert of frank 
sinatra liza minnelli and sammy davis jr at 1495 
leaders in the payperview business are predicting that broadway 
openings more pop music concerts art auctions business seminars 
and possibly the super bowl and the world series soon could become 
payperview staples 
so in the end payperviews future may lie in giving customers 
those unusual attractions they cant find at theaters in video 
stores or on any other broadcast or cable television channel 
said showtimes kurnit weve always looked at the event 
business as where well make our money 
what the word event comes to mean though is anybodys guess

president bush said today that any plan to 
rescue the troubled savings and loan industry will not be 
popular but he pledged that the government will continue to 
guarantee the safety of insured deposits 
bush met at the white house with democratic and republican 
leaders of congress to seek their ideas on how to resolve the crisis 
of failing savings and loans a bailout may cost the public upwards 
of 100 billion 
weve got a big problem in the savings and loan industry 
bush told the lawmakers meeting in the cabinet room there are no 
easy answers no worrying about blame plenty to go around i want 
to see the problem solved 
house speaker jim wright dtexas and senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine pledged their cooperation in seeking a 
solution 
after the meeting sen jake garn of utah senior republican on 
the senate banking committee said an idea floated by the 
administration last week for a fee on savings deposits is not a 
live option even though the white house has not disavowed it 
publicly 
however garn said he believes savings institutions will have to 
pay a higher premium to obtain federal insurance for deposits 
sen donald riegle dmich chairman of the banking committee 
said bush did not give a clue about what he would propose i 
wouldnt say he gave an indication where his thinking is going he 
did take a lot of notes on the points raised by participants 
were going to look to find a way to put together a funding 
package that is as fair as it can be riegle said were going 
to look to the taxpayers absolutely as a last resort 
setting out a timetable for producing an administration plan 
bush said he will meet saturday with treasury department officials 
to hear their final recommendations and then early next week reveal 
the course he will take 
nevertheless bush told the congressional leaders youre not 
being presented here with a stacked deck we need ideas and if were 
overlooking something we want to know what it is 
the president said whatever we come up with will not be 
popular and i expect then whatever you come up with will not be 
popular but weve got to get on and get the problem solved 
we want to work with you this is a serious problem mitchell 
told bush 
the administration is worried that advertisements from banks in 
three states questioning the safety of savings and loan accounts may 
needlessly scare depositors who are already worried 
white house chief of staff john sununu who was present at 
todays meeting criticized the ads thursday at a private hourlong 
meeting of bush and five sampl and bank trade associations said 
frederick webber president of the us league of savings 
institutions who attended the meeting 
sununu waving copies of several of the ads said gentlemen 
it is absolutely unequivocally irresponsible to have placed those 
ads according to another participant who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
at todays meeting bush did not mention the ads but said the 
safety of those deposits is guaranteed will continue to be 
guaranteed and there should be no feeling around the country that 
some solution will do anything to diminish the credit of the united 
states being behind the deposits the fslic fdic whatever it is 
the federal savings and loan insurance corporation insures 
deposits at sampls and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
insures those at commercial banks 
maryliz meany a spokeswoman for the american bankers 
association said sununu gave the association copies of 
advertisements placed by banks in texas arkansas and kansas 
we are going to call the banks and inform them of the concern 
in washington and the sensitivity that they might not be aware of 
she said we made a promise to the administration that we would 
certainly monitor it and we agreed with their concern 
bush did not speak at the meeting about the ads or reveal any 
preference among the many options for addressing the sampl crisis 
according to participants 
he was there to learn from us and hes a good listener 
webber said it was very gratifying the man is personally 
involved in this 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said proposals in the 
presidents address to congress thursday will be pretty specific 
youll know exactly what our proposal is 
the spokesman outlined the basic points guiding the president 
insured savings must be protected 
current problems must be solved and losses stopped 
permanent reforms preventing a recurrence must be enacted 
the deposit insurance system should be put on a sound financial 
footing 
cleanup costs must be equitably allocated 
sununus anger over the advertisements underscores the 
administrations concern that the debate in washington over how to 
pay for the sampl crisis has unnerved some thrift depositors 
last week regional federal home loan banks reported 
higherthanexpected sampl withdrawals after treasury secretary 
nicholas brady and other administration officials discussed a 
suggestion that depositors pay a fee to raise money for the sampl 
bailout 
meeting participants said bush stressed as he did a week ago in 
a nationally televised news conference that the deposits are backed 
by the full faith and credit of the federal government he planned 
to make the same point in his speech next week 
but mark riedy president of the national council of savings 
institutions added the feeling in the meeting was this is a 
serious situation by the time it gets to be a real run its too 
late 
on capitol hill charles o bowsher head of the general 
accounting office urged the government to take prompt control of 
the 350 remaining insolvent but still open sampls after agreement is 
reached later this year on a bailout and reform package 
the congressional auditing and investigative agency said congress 
should provide a plan to raise 85 billion over three years coupled 
with a reform package at that point which some senators say may 
be as late as the fall regulators should take control of 
institutions placing them into receivership as necessary 
in testimony before the senate banking committee bowsher 
criticized regulators current approach of using promissory notes 
and loss guarantees to conserve cash and spread rescue costs over 10 
years 
in another development the house banking committee released a 
longawaited report from the gao that turned up six instances in 
which independent accounting firms did not adequately audit 
institutions that later failed 
the gao said auditing and reporting problems were significant 
enough in six cases to warrant our referring the cpa firms 
performing the audits to regulatory and professional bodies for 
their review

unemployment rose slightly in january to 54 percent but the 
number of jobs created last month shot up to 408000 the government 
said today in a report that indicated strong economic growth 
the labor department said the civilian unemployment rate rose by 
01 percentage point from the december rate of 53 percent 
but the first major report of the economys 1989 performance 
showed continued strong growth something analysts have predicted 
would feed inflationary fears and perhaps convince the federal 
reserve board to tighten its reins on credit 
in another report signaling vibrant economic growth the commerce 
department said orders to us factories for manufactured goods 
surged 41 percent in december the biggest rise in six months 
bond prices were modestly lower after the reports indicating 
investors concerns about inflation caused by overheating the yield 
on the treasurys benchmark 30year bond which rises when the price 
falls climbed to 884 percent from 880 percent late thursday 
the dollar rose on speculation that the federal reserve would 
push up shortterm rates to hold down inflation making shortterm 
dollardenominated securities more attractive to global investors 
not willing to let the dollar climb too high central banks of 
the united states west germany france switzerland austria and 
belgium all reportedly intervened in the market to sell dollars 
at midmorning in new york the central banks sales managed to 
hold the dollar below the psychologically important level of 189 
west german marks the dollar rose nevertheless against the mark 
and the british pound while declining slightly against the japanese 
yen 
stock prices were mixed the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
rose 893 to 234268 in the first hour of trading 
the 408000 new nonfarm jobs created last month followed a gain 
of 279000 in december and nearly matched novembers robust gain of 
440000 new jobs 
analysts had predicted that january job growth would be in the 
250000 range and that any growth of more than 300000 could trouble 
the markets 
the labor department said the unemployment rate rose because the 
number of people in the labor force grew even faster than the number 
of people with jobs the labor force expanded by nearly 900000 
people with about 700000 of them finding jobs a record 629 
percent of the workingage population had jobs 
on thursday reports indicated that higher interest rates are 
hurting the housing market but havent dissuaded consumers from a 
generous spending spree at the nations big department stores 
the commerce department said thursday new home sales rose a 
meager 09 percent last year to 677000 dwellings vs 671000 sold 
in 1987 housing industry analysts said they expected continued 
increases in interest rates and a slowdown in the economy to result 
in decreased new home sales this year 
the bottoms not falling out of the market by any means but we 
do expect a modest slowing said economist richard peach of the 
mortgage bankers association 
fixedrate mortgages last week stood at 106 percent up from 
1016 percent a year earlier according to a survey by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp many economists are predicting interest 
rates could hit 115 percent by the middle of this year 
tighter credit evidently isnt hurting the nations biggest 
retailers however most said thursday in reporting january sales 
that they benefited from light inventories and an unusually warm 
winter 
the low inventory levels due to unexpectedly brisk christmas 
business and tight control of stocks saved general merchandise and 
apparel retailers from having to slash prices to move out the excess 
goods 
patterns of retail purchases are closely watched for indications 
of overall consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the 
countrys overall economic activity 
in other economic news thursday federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said he would prefer a gasoline tax increase to an oil 
import fee in the event congress cannot meet its deficitreduction 
targets through spending cuts alone 
greenspan told the taxwriting house ways and means committee in 
washington he would most prefer that congress cut spending to meet 
the fiscal 1990 deficit target of 100 billion 
none of the thursday developments had much effect on the 
financial markets stocks meandered and the dow jones industrial 
average fell 446 to 233375 bond prices barely budged and the 
dollar ended mixed in slow trading

unemployment rose slightly in january to 54 
percent but an unexpectedly high 408000 jobs were created at the 
same time the government said today in the first major economic 
report for the new year 
the labor department said the civilian unemployment rate rose by 
01 percentage point from the december rate of 53 percent 
but the report showed continued strong growth something analysts 
have predicted would feed inflationary fears and perhaps convince 
the federal reserve board to tighten its reins on credit 
the 408000 new nonfarm jobs created last month followed a 
revised gain of 221000 in december and nearly matched novembers 
robust gain of 440000 new jobs 
anaysts had predicted that january job growth would be in the 
250000 range and that any growth of more than 300000 could trouble 
the markets 
its a much stronger report than we thought said davis wyss 
chief economist at data resources inc in lexington mass it 
suggests we are going into the first quarter of 1989 a lot 
stronger than we thought the fed is going to tighten credit and 
shortterm interest rates will be going up 
in another report today signifying strength in the us economy 
the commerce department said orders to factories for manufactured 
goods surged 41 percent in december the biggest rise in six months 
and a sharp upturn from the increases of 05 percent in november and 
20 percent in october 
the labor department said the labor force expanded by nearly 
900000 people with about 700000 of them finding jobs and that a 
record 629 percent of the workingage population had jobs 
the unseasonably warm weather in much of the country helped 
contruction employment rise by 102000 jobs last month the 
department said manufacturing employment also was up for the fourth 
month in a row with 45000 new january jobs split virtually evenly 
between the durable and nondurable goods industries 
there were 260000 new jobs in the serviceproducing sector of 
the economy with the 135000 in retail trades accounting for more 
than half of that figure service industries reported adding 75000 
new jobs last month down from an average monthly gain of 110000 in 
that sector throughout 1988 
in data closely watched for signs of inflation the labor 
department reported that average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory 
employees climbed by 06 percent or 9 cents while average weekly 
earnings rose 12 percent in january those figures are adjusted to 
reflect traditional seasonal changes in the employment picture 
in another sign of continued economic strength the manufacturing 
work week rose by 01 hour to 410 hours and average factory 
overtime held steady at 39 hours 
janet norwood commissioner of the departments bureau of labor 
statistics said it was difficult to interpret the january data 
because of the seasonal pressures on the economy usually triggered 
by colder weather and the passing of the christmas season 
supported by januarys mild weather and an economy that 
continues to grow many of the usual seasonal job reductions did not 
take place this year ms norwood said in testimony prepared for 
the joint economic committee of congress 
because of the 865000 gain in the number of americans seeking 
jobs last month the unemployment rate edged up slightly despite the 
job growth of the 1234 million people in the labor force last 
month 1167 million had jobs and 67 million were seeking 
employment the government said 
a separate government unemployment rate that includes the nearly 
17 million members of the armed services stationed in the united 
states also was 54 percent in january like the civilian rate up 
01 percentage point from december 
in the civilian economy the jobless rate among whites remained 
unchanged in january at 46 percent the rate was 4 percent for 
white men and 39 percent for white women 
the civilian unemployment rate among blacks climbed to 12 percent 
in january from 116 percent in december while the jobless rate 
among black teenagers jumped to 345 percent from 296 percent 
there also was an increase in unemployment among hispanics from 
76 percent in december to 84 percent last month 
the robust report on the job market comes on the heels of several 
other reports this week suggesting continued economic growth at 
rates some economists believer are too high to ward off inflation 
todays unemployment report was the first of the bush presidency 
and came just four days before the federal reserves open market 
committee meets to set monetary targets for the new year 
earlier this week the government reported its index of leading 
indicators its main economic forecasting gauge climbed 06 percent 
in december also out this week were reports that construction 
spending rebounded and jumped 22 percent in december and that 
personal income rose 09 percent in the final month of 1988 
last week the government reported a 2 percent gain in the gross 
national product for the fourth quarter of 1988 and a 64 percent 
december jump in durable goods orders 
their statistics on the economy continue to flash green 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said thursday 
there is no stopping this economy

grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly 
mixed early today on the chicago board of trade with bullish fears 
of coldweather damage to the winter wheat crop offset by slack 
foreign demand for us grains 
the winter wheat crop appeared to be most vulnerable in kansas 
and nebraska where temperatures have plunged after rising in the 
past week to levels high enough to cause some seed germination 
the biggest threat is heaving of the ground where you have 
alternate hot and cold said ted mao a grain specialist with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
weve certainly had the warm part of it and now it looks like 
well have the cold he said 
export sales of us grains and soybeans have slowed to a crawl 
and there was little news to influence corn and soybean prices 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 427 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cents lower with march at 271 a bushel oats were 
cent to 1 cents lower with march at 216 a bushel soybeans were 
2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with march at 762 a bushel 
cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early 
trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 05 cent to 13 cent higher with february at 
7512 cents a pound feeder cattle were 27 cent lower to 03 cent 
higher with march at 8450 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent to 
50 cent higher with february at 4390 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 10 cent to 25 cent higher with february at 3980

investors in the securities markets will have a 
special interest in the budget proposal president bush makes to 
congress this week 
of course anyone with a stake in stocks and bonds will be eager 
to see what the new administration and the legislators can do to 
deal with the governments deficit problems 
but beyond that bushs message scheduled to be delivered 
thursday is expected to contain a proposal dear to the hearts of 
many wall streeters restoring a tax break for longterm capital 
gains 
before passage of the tax reform act of 1986 the maximum tax 
rate on capital gains from the sale of stocks bonds and other 
assets held for more than six months was 20 percent while other 
types of income fell into tax brackets as high as 50 percent 
tax reform lumped all income including capital gains into a 
single category with a maximum tax rate that now stands at 33 
percent 
bush has said he would like to cut the top rate on longterm 
gains to 15 percent 
such a change would seem to go against the spirit of the nations 
new tax system in addition preferential treatment of capital gains 
has long been opposed by some members of congress and others who say 
its benefits go disproportionately to the wealthy 
yet many observers believe bushs idea will get serious 
consideration i think theres a very good chance it or 
something like it will be enacted said wallace head a tax expert 
at the accounting firm of arthur andersen amp co 
the present tax system provides no incentive for longterm 
investment head observed and thats not what we should do 
the tax law now defines long term as more than one year 
between the date of purchase and sale a single maximum rate could 
be established for assets held that long 
alternatively capital gains rates could be set on a sliding 
scale declining as the holding period for an investment increases 
proponents of a break for longterm gains say it would help 
maintain a stable base of capital for business and perhaps 
discourage the kind of shortterm rollofthedice trading that 
contributes to market volatility 
of course given the problem of the budget deficit this is not a 
likely time for politicians to be handing out new tax breaks 
before any change is made in the tax system these days a 
persuasive case must be made that the new setup will add to tax 
receipts or at minimum be revenue neutral 
in the current discussion head acknowledges people will 
allege that the wealthy are getting something so they ought to give 
something back 
advocates of lower capital gains rates insist however that they 
actually increase revenues to the treasury by encouraging more 
people to pursue and realize longterm gains 
it is even possible analysts say that the talk generated by 
bushs proposal has contributed to the improved mood of the stock 
market in recent weeks 
the prospect of a change in the rules has begun to carry some 
weight in the investment decisions people make 
for anyone planning to sell an investment or other property in 
the next year or two the debate certainly bears watching

congress could give the commodity futures 
trading commission its reauthorization more quickly if the fbi would 
share its findings from a tradingfraud investigation in chicago 
the chairman of the house agriculture committee says 
were not asking to be part of the criminal investigation 
said rep eligio kika de la garza dtexas all we want is 
information that will help us do our job 
the cftcs authority to regulate the nations commodity markets 
expires this year and lawmakers expected fast action on legislation 
to reauthorize the commission through 1994 de la garza said 
thursday 
but their plans were altered by disclosure of a twoyear 
undercover fbi investigation of alleged widespread fraud and illegal 
trading practices in the chicago futures markets 
de la garza said he contacted the fbi once the probe was 
disclosed several weeks ago seeking information that would help in 
the committees review of the cftc reauthorization 
we havent seen a thing he said zilch at this time 
the fbi acknowledged receipt of the request from de la garza in a 
jan 19 letter and said it had contacted his office today 
however a spokesman said the bureau could not reveal the nature 
of the response and also refused to discuss the investigation of 
allegations that brokers and traders cheated customers out of 
millions of dollars in deals on the chicago mercantile exchange and 
chicago board of trade 
de la garza assigned an agriculture subcommittee headed by rep 
glenn english dokla to conduct its own investigation of the 
chicago trading scandal to see if the cftcs regulatory authority 
needs to be strengthened 
congressional critics have challenged the cftcs effectiveness as 
a regulator and contend it should become part of the securities and 
exchange commission 
a cftc spokeswoman said the chicago investigation places an added 
burden on proponents of an independent futures commission 
it puts us in a defensive position and thats not the position 
wed like to be in spokeswoman kate hathaway said but i think 
the issue that is more important rather than whether or not we have 
to defend our image is what this is doing to market confidence 
we do have some very serious concerns and have reason for 
them based on responses were getting from people in the industry 
about public perceptions of the markets and confidence in those 
markets 
the cftc was established in 1974 to enforce federal laws relating 
to commodities futures and options including gold and silver 
the house and senate agriculture committees have jurisdiction 
over the commission because futures and options trading originally 
involved only agricultural commodities 
the chicago merc and board of trade account for thousands of 
dollars given annually to members of congress either in honoraria 
for visits or in campaign contributions through political action 
committees however english said financial contributions would not 
affect lawmakers handling of the exchanges regulators 
lawmakers agreed the congressional investigation was unlikely to 
result in elimination of the commission and said the cftc probably 
would be reauthorized even with the delay 
if the investigation does not give us information that we need 
for our reauthorization by the end of may then we may have to 
proceed de la garza said then if information is given that 
means we need to change law we can do that but it would be better 
for all concerned if we did it all at one time 
separately the cftc voted unanimously thursday to allow the 
chicago mercantile exchange to implement its planned globex 
electronic trading system which would permit worldwide computerized 
trading during hours when the exchange floors are closed 
the commission authorized the exchange to begin using the system 
this fall 
initially trading would be limited to gold futures contracts 
us treasury bills and various currencies but all existing and 
subsequent merc futures and options contracts eventually would be 
eligible for trading through globex the cftc said 
supporters of the system say that in addition to making the us 
exchange more competitive in world markets electronic trading could 
enhance the ability to police and detect trading abuses

west pointpepperell incs directors put the 
company up for sale today saying a sweetened bid of 154 billion 
from farley inc was unacceptable but they would entertain higher 
bids from others 
it is the intention of the board to effect a sale of the 
company assuming that an acceptable proposal is received said a 
statement from the west point gabased textile giant it said the 
board has authorized its advisers to notify parties that have 
expressed an interest in a possible buyout that it would consider 
their bids 
the announcement marked a significant shift in the pepperell 
boards position on the matter of a takeover in a filing last week 
with the securities and exchange commission the company said it was 
not for sale but indicated it was talking with third parties that 
might be interested in a purchase 
chicagobased farley which originally offered 48 per share for 
pepperells outstanding stock last october increased its bid to 
52 or a total of 154 billion on wednesday 
the pepperell board today considered farleys new offer and 
decided that values in excess of 52 per share could be realized 
in a sale of the company the statement said 
farley spokesman jack albertine was out of his office today and 
could not be reached for comment on pepperells announcement 
on thursday farley chairman 
house passed it last week and it now goes to gov joe frank harris 
tidwell upheld the georgia business combination statute which 
was passed last year at the urging of the states textile industry 
under the statute a company cannot buy another firm and then merge 
with it for five years unless it acquires 90 percent of the 
outstanding stock of the target firm 
farley had challenged the statute as part of its hostile attempt 
to take over west point 
farley in a statement thursday said he remained undeterred by the 
ruling 
a statement from pepperell said the company was pleased with 
tidwells ruling but did not elaborate 
tidwell in his ruling said farley failed to show that the 
statute prevents hostile bidders from enjoying a meaningful 
opportunity to complete buyouts of georgiabased companies 
farley declined to say whether it would appeal tidwells ruling 
but indicated that it is counting on a special meeting of west 
points shareholders feb 25 to win the threemonth takeover fight 
at that meeting farley will seek to replace west points board 
members with its own directors who would remove the poison pill and 
coverage of the state statute

japans massive current account surplus shrank in 
1988 for the first time in seven years but progress toward reducing 
it petered out at the end of the year a government report showed 
friday 
the finance ministrys report showed that japan continues to 
export far more than it imports and no end to the imbalance is in 
sight 
the current account surplus fell 87 percent to 795 billion 
from 87 billion in 1987 the ministry said in december the 
surplus shrank to 927 billion from 944 billion a year earlier 
but the december surplus was sharply higher than november 1988s 
676 billion the ministry said 
the current account is the broadest measure of a nations 
international financial flows and includes trade investment 
income tourism and other transactions 
japans trade surplus also declined 17 percent during the year 
to 948 billion from 964 billion the previous year it was the 
first annual drop in the trade surplus in six years ministry 
officials said 
but decembers trade surplus continued a recent upward trend 
rising to a record 109 billion from 996 billion a year earlier 
and 756 billion in november 1988 
the ministry announcement did not include breakdowns of trade 
figures by country or region 
the decline in the current account surplus was due primarily to 
the growing number of japanese traveling overseas and increasing 
payments of patent royalties ministry officials said 
a record 840 million japanese travelers spent a record 158 
billion abroad in 1988 compared to the previous years 866 
billion they said 
the yeartoyear drop in the current account surplus during 
december came as a relief to the government which had expressed 
concern when the gap grew for two months in a row in october and 
november 
the recent increases in the surplus raised the prospect that the 
governments attempt to restore balance to its external accounts may 
have begun faltering after months of steady declines resulting 
partly from the appreciation of the japanese yen 
the drop in the current account surplus in 1988 does not 
necessarily give reason for optimism according to finance ministry 
officials we cant say whether the downtrend is going to 
continue one ministry official said it depends on a lot of 
things like oil prices 
a rise in oil prices would increase japans import bills and 
result in a reduction in the current account surplus 
exports and imports last year as measured when contracts were 
settled were at record highs with exports reaching 2596 billion 
surpassing the previous record of 2246 billion in 1987 imports 
came to 1648 billion far more than the prior record of 1296 
billion in 1981 
japan includes freight and insurance costs in its import figures 
but not in its exports that method makes imports look bigger and 
thus makes the trade surplus appear smaller 
the 1988 statistics showed that vigorous domestic demand in japan 
has pushed up imports finance ministry officials said oil prices 
drifted down most of the year but strong domestic demand for 
manufactured goods led to an increase in imports and helped reduce 
external surpluses they said 
december was the third consecutive month in which japans trade 
surplus showed an increase in addition the surplus was a record 
high exceeding the previous record of 102 billion set in december 
1986 
confounding predictions the record monthly surplus came at a 
time when the yen was at one of its highest points against the us 
dollar making japanese products more expensive overseas since 
then the dollar has rebounded against the yen possibly leading to 
further increases in japanese exports in coming months 
the decrease in the current account surplus in 1988 was the first 
since the account began showing a surplus in 1981 ministry 
officials said

new tax laws to take effect here april 1 are likely 
to boost sales of automobiles liquor jewelry and hightech 
electronics good news for companies exporting to japan 
economists say although the mainstay of the tax reform a 3 
percent sales tax will raise many prices in this most expensive of 
nations the overall impact of the reform on the japanese economy 
will be positive 
the new laws the first major overhaul of japans tax system 
since 1949 will reduce income residential corporate and 
inheritance taxes by 45 billion in fiscal 1989 which begins april 
1 
in line with government policy the reform will encourage 
consumption of luxury products through the elimination of a variety 
of special taxes on cars liquor jewelry golf equipment and 
electronics 
this step is expected to inject an additional 26 billion into 
japans robust economy in fiscal 1989 
japan also is trying to get its people to work shorter hours 
banks that used to be open on alternate saturdays will now be closed 
all saturdays starting with this one under a plan to move key 
institutions to a fiveday work week 
reflecting japans economic strength the government said friday 
that the jobless rate fell to a 6year low of 23 percent in 
december while the surplus in the broadest measure of foreign trade 
rose again because of booming exports 
japans 40yearold tax structure no longer suited the needs of 
an affluent aging society shigeo ohara director of the finance 
ministrys research division said friday 
the system drafted by us occupation authorities while japan 
was rebuilding after its defeat in world war ii slapped high taxes 
on purchases of liquor tobacco furs jewelry large appliances and 
other items considered to be luxury goods 
now its hard to decide what goods are luxury items ohara 
said 
retailers will see sales increase when commodity taxes as high as 
23 percent are replaced by the 3 percent sales tax says richard c 
koo senior economist at nomura research institute 
its a positive step in encouraging consumption it should 
make a big difference koo said 
the reform also is intended to help cut japans trade surplus and 
respond to foreign criticism of taxes on highquality liquor and 
other goods that boost import prices ohara said 
the finance ministry estimates the new tax laws alone by 
slashing prices on luxury imports will cut japans current account 
surplus by 2 billion in 1991 
overall the tax reform is expected to boost japans output of 
goods and services by about 02 percent 
although consumer prices are forecast to rise 12 percent as a 
result of a new sales tax taxes overall will decline by 20 
billion the government estimates 
however some predict the government will quickly raise the sales 
tax rate from the initial 3 percent resulting in an increase in 
total taxes 
the main goal of the reform the government maintains is to 
distribute the tax burden more equitably the tax cuts favor 
middleaged salary earners through special deductions for dependents 
aged 16 to 22 
the middleaged salary workers felt their tax burdens were 
heavy and unfair given the high educational expenses for their 
children ohara said 
critics say the new sales tax is a virtual sieve of loopholes 
that favors the rich while squeezing lowerincome earners ohara 
responded that while higher and middleincome earners will benefit 
most all taxpayers will benefit from the cuts 
the new sales tax exempts small businesses a feature that gained 
the taxs acceptance among the shopkeepers associations which had 
helped defeat earlier attempts at tax reform

when youre looking for signs of inflation as 
everyone seems to be these days youll find them there are always 
little pimples that have the potential to become open sores 
the jobless figures are one of them 
unemployment is now down to 52 percent of the labor force a 
level that many economists feel is scraping the bottom of the 
barrel it is after all less than half the unemployment rate at 
which the current expansion began 
when you scrape bottom you tend to get inferior workers they 
have fewer skills and probably none at all they require expensive 
training and even then tend to perform poorly they are costly 
such a situation puts pressure on profits and according to 
inflation theorists causes employers to raise prices thus an 
inflationary spiral is begun 
but is there an alternative to that thesis thats just one of 
the questions being asked by a small number of economists who are 
questioning a lot of the conventional thinking of late 
one of those challenges to convention is that a labor shortgage 
rather than forcing up prices will finally force some industries to 
do without additional labor and instead institute more efficient 
procedures 
some of those industries it is argued have had it too good in 
some of the retail service industries for example employers have 
been able to tap a huge supply of unskilled workers and homemakers 
seeking parttime jobs 
tremendous numbers of workers have been hired by fastfood 
outlets for example because there was an available supply of 
teenagers and adult women seeking parttime jobs it was easier to 
hire than to improve efficiency 
edward yardeni prudentialbache economist observes that from 
1968 to 1988 when payroll employment rose by 38 million 
serviceproducing jobs accounted for an astounding 95 percent of the 
total gain 
these employers are now facing a critical situation do they seek 
to hire more workers from a smaller labor supply and pay them 
everhigher wages or will they be forced to reconsider the 
situation and take another course 
giving urgency to that consideration is another factor many 
service companies are facing a profits squeeze because of consumer 
resistance to higher prices if puts them in the position of being 
unable to tolerate higher costs 
looking for a solution to the problem many companies might be 
forced to reconsider their labor policies they might seek instead 
to obtain higher productivity through better systems for producing 
and delivering products 
there is nothing new in this and it might have been forced on 
service companies long ago were it not for the availability of 
lowcost labor but now that pool may be drying up and no matter 
it is getting more costly 
if this occurs says yardeni and likethinkers then low jobless 
rates in effect will boost national productivity which should 
reduce inflationary pressures 
during the 1970s we experienced high unemployment and high 
inflation in the 1990s we should experience low unemployment and 
low inflation he says 
it is something to think about when you hear the inflation 
alarmists shouting their equivalent of fire they have been at 
it for several years now and one day they might be right 
but as yardeni and others remind us inflation is not an 
inevitable and automatic response to any uncomfortable news 
sometimes we put the proper salve on the pimple sometimes inflation 
doesnt happen

factory orders shot up 41 percent in december 
as american manufacturers bolstered by a boom in export sales last 
year posted their best showing since 1979 the government said 
friday 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
manufactured goods reached a seasonally adjusted total of 2376 
billion in december after making more modest gains of 05 percent in 
november and 20 percent in october 
while many analysts are expecting economic growth to slow during 
the coming year 1988 closed on a strong note with many yearend 
reports showing vigorous activity in december 
decembers rise much of it pinned on increased orders for cars 
ships and planes was the biggest monthly gain since a 54 increase 
in june 
orders for manufactured goods were up a strong 97 percent to 
266 trillion for all of 1988 the best showing since a 121 
percent increase in 1979 
the overall picture is of an economy that is quite bouyant 
robust humming along said boston co chief economist allen sinai 
factory orders also had been up sharply in 1987 rising 71 
percent after falling 12 percent in 1986 and 06 percent in 1985 
american manufacturers rebounded in the last two years as the 
decline of dollar against foreign currencies made american products 
more competitive overseas in the previous two years manufacturers 
had lost both domestic and overseas sales to foreign manufacturers 
robert brusca chief financial economist for nikko securities co 
international inc in new york said that while the latest factory 
orders report was positive we are not producing goods at a rapid 
enough rate to make progress on the trade deficit 
as good as it is brusca said of the report its not good 
enough 
the us trade deficit ballooned to a fivemonth high in 
november reflecting a surge in imports and a slight drop in exports 
the volatile category of defense orders surged 19 percent in 
december to 10 billion after plunging 215 percent during the 
previous month 
even excluding the militarysector however manufacturers orders 
in december still were up a healthy 36 percent after a 16 percent 
gain in november 
transportation orders another area subject to wide swings 
jumped 197 percent to 388 billion after falling 72 percent in 
november the motor vehicle aircraft and shipbuilding industries 
all showed large gains 
excluding transportation orders were up 16 percent in december 
after a 18 percent rise in november 
even taking out some of the increases in airlines and 
automobiles and transportation total orders look to be taking off 
toward the end of the year sinai said 
meanwhile the key category of nondefense capital goods 
considered a barometer of industry investment plans rose 82 
percent to 387 billion in december 
big ticket durable goods items expected to last three years 
or longer posted a robust 64 percent increase in december to a 
seasonally adjusted 131 billion largely on the strength of the 
transportation orders 
nondurable goods meanwhile were up 14 percent to 1066 
billion with the largest gains occurring in rubber and plastics 
paper and apparel 
shipments of manufactured goods were up 24 percent in december 
to a seasonally adjusted 2301 billion shipments for the year

quickly increased expectations of further credittightening by the

offset to a significant extent by the dollars rise in foreign

directors of west pointpepperell inc put the 
textile giant on the auction block friday while urging stockholders 
to reject a sweetened 154 billion bid from farley inc 
farley which offered 48 a share when it started its hostile 
takeover bid in october raised the offer to 52 wednesday but the 
west pointpepperell board decided they think stockholders can do 
better 
it is the intention of the board to effect a sale of the 
company assuming that an acceptable proposal is received said a 
statement from the west point gabased company 
it said the board has authorized its advisers goldman sachs amp 
co to tell interested parties that it would consider their bids 
pepperell has said it has no other bids in hand 
trading of pepperell stock was halted friday morning as is usual 
when a company has an announcement to make that could affect its 
stock price when trading resumed the stock rose 125 a share to 
5487 
patricia ryan a textile analyst with raymond james and 
associates of st petersburg fla said the formal decision to seek 
a buyer was a logical progression of events that started in october 
when west points board authorized management to look into a 
possible sale after farleys original bid 
she said the statement urging shareholders not to accept the 
farley offer does not mean farley will not end up with west 
pointpepperell 
once the price is right they really have to think of their 
shareholders she said based on public information a sale price 
of around 55 a share is reasonable she said adding that a 
spirited bidding war is at least a possibility 
in a filing last week with the securities and exchange 
commission pepperells officers had said the company was not for 
sale but they indicated they were talking with third parties that 
might be interested in a purchase 
the pepperell board considered farleys new offer friday and 
decided that values in excess of 52 per share could be realized 
in a sale of the company the pepperell statement said 
jack albertine a spokesman for chicagobased farley was out of 
his office friday and could not be reached for comment on the 
announcement 
west pointpepperell founded in 1866 is the nations largest 
publicly tradd textile company and makes such products as martex 
sheets and towels and gold toe socks it has 41000 employees and 
22000 stockholders 
farley one of the nations largest privately held textile firms

forecasters warn retailers to be 
cautious about 1989 but jean hougard is planning expansion 
renovation and an aggressive advertising strategy for the two 
lazarus department stores she manages 
were not looking at doom and gloom in 1989 she said 
basking in betterthanexpected holiday sales were going to make 
sure were in business to do business 
that means big inventories more advertising and swank additions 
such as a godiva chocolate counter to boost sales for valentines 
day hougard manages two lazarus apparel stores in downtown grand 
rapids and the suburb of wyoming 
jerry gafford senior vice president of corporate affairs for the 
stores part of the cincinnatibased federated retail chain said 
higher levels of stockpiled merchandise in 1989 reflects company 
optimism 
were very very bullish about 89 gafford said not to a 
point of doing anything stupid but well be very aggressive 
increasing the breadth and width of our stock 
gafford said christmas sales met the companys expectations 
which he described as pretty optimistic 
the only thing conservative about lazarus approach to 1989 is 
the traditional latticework decorations that will go up in the 
companys 43 stores in ohio indiana michigan kentucky and west 
virginia 
hougard dismisses the warnings of economic forecasters who have 
predicted sluggish retail sales this year 
you can hear just about anything listening to economic 
forecasters hougard said you have to go forward and do 
business 
lazarus approach to competing for limited dollars is simple 
customer service 
the idea is to combine the large selection and competitive prices 
of a department store with the personal attention a shopper might 
expect to find only at a small boutique the anticipated result a 
loyal customer 
the lazarus emphasis on customer service is something thats 
been highly prioritized in the last two or three years gafford 
said and weve already seen the returns on it thats what the 
customer needs and wants 
lazarus as well as other department stores is plugging its 
personal shopper program whereby a customer can make an appointment 
and have a salesperson help build a wardrobe to fit the customers 
tastes 
the customer can come in before we open and have the whole 
store to herself hougard said the sales associate keeps a file 
on each shopper and can call if something the customer has been 
looking at goes on sale with people being so busy this is 
really catching on 
while many stores conduct customer surveys lazarus likes 
management to talk to customers in person 
four times a year a focus group composed of randomly chosen 
customers lunches with store officials to discuss suggested changes 
in merchandise and service 
hougard hopes the strong performance of her stores during the 
holiday season will put her in good standing when corporate 
executives review proposals from store managers for alterations at 
individual stores 
stores are out there fighting for available dollars its the 
same as government agencies fighting for grants hougard said 
she is requesting that her apparelonly stores be expanded and 
turned into home stores with linens gifts and house wares 
an added plus is a new companywide advertising campaign which 
will distribute a sunday newspaper insert for the apparelonly 
stores as it does for its larger home stores most promotions 
instead of beginning midweek and running through the weekend will 
begin on sunday and continue through the following weekend 
its what the customer wants and thats what its all about 
hougard said

wheat and soybean futures closed moderately higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade in late buying partially 
prompted by a report that the soviet union had ordered the 
evacuation of 20 villages contaminated by radiation from the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear accident 
the wireservice report said residents of the unidentified 
ukrainian farming communities had not previously been informed of 
the radiation leak and had been living and growing crops in highly 
contaminated soil 
the chernobyl incident sparked a sharp rise in us grain futures 
in 1986 on fears of widespread contamination of soviet crops 
no new radiation leakage was reported on friday but when you 
start hearing rumors of leakage of radiation people start thinking 
chernobyl and are we going to have another incident said 
jerry zusel manager of floor operations for balfour maclaine corp 
at the chicago board of trade 
corn futures closed mixed while oats were slightly higher 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 431 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
lower to 1 cents higher with march at 272 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with march at 218 a bushel soybeans 
were 5 cents to 10 cents higher with march at 771 a bushel

a banker who has run advertisements asking consumers if they were 
worried about the safety of savings and loan accounts says bush 
administration criticism of such ads may stir up depositors worries 
rather than quell them 
industry officials in several states report little local concern 
about the ads which the american bankers association says have run 
in texas arkansas and kansas 
locally that ad stirred up nothing whatsoever and was not 
intended to stir up anything says thomas r lee president of the 
union state bank in clay center kan 
white house chief of staff john sununu criticized the ads as 
irresponsible according to an industry official who met 
privately thursday in washington with sununu bush and five thrift 
and bank trade associations 
on jan 24 union state bank of clay center kan placed an ad 
in the daily clay center dispatch asking are you questioning how 
secure your money is with all the stories being published about the 
thrift industry the ad also detailed the banks stability and the 
security of deposits there 
lee said in a telephone interview that he wanted to reassure 
people who had questions about the federal deposit insurance corp 
which insures bank deposits up to 100000 
when youre in a small rural conservative community people 
are very conscious about the security of their money he said 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp which insures 
thrift deposits to 100000 is insolvent because of soaring outlays 
in recent years to compensate depositors in failed thrifts 
depositors apparently ignored the union state ad lee said no 
one in the north central kansas town of about 5000 mentioned it to 
bank officials and many of the banks 22 employees didnt even know 
it ran he said 
im not so sure they bush administration officials havent 
created more excitement about it just by bringing it up locally 
its a dead issue he said 
chuck stones research director for the kansas bankers 
association said he hadnt heard of any similar ads by the states 
589 other banks 
the washingtonbased aba said it could not disclose the names of 
banks that ran the ads the banking industry in past years has run 
its own ad campaigns aimed at differentiating itself from the thrift 
industry in the eyes of consumers 
it is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been under 
siege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who are 
trying to compete with belowmarket rates said maryliz meany an 
aba spokeswoman 
credit unions are now claiming in their ads that they have the 
healthiest insurance fund she said so bankers are extremely 
sensitive and they are likely to continue to be in this case 
she said the association was soon going to communicate the 
concerns expressed in washington to these institutions running the 
ads 
the gist of one of the ads was you sure have read a lot of 
information in the press about thrifts and if you have any 
concerns you should definitely keep your money in a bank said 
ms meany 
fdic spokesman stephen katsanos said the agency has no policy on 
the ad tactics and wasnt aware of them before thursday 
at least one arkansas bank ran an ad recently contrasting the 
security of its deposits with those in thrifts according to state 
industry officials 
that was reported to me but we have 255 banks in this state 
said bo carvill executive director of the arkansas state bankers 
association it did happen but i dont know anything more about 
it 
one thrift official said he was not surprised by the ads 
perhaps those banks feel comfortable in making that 
distinction but many of the banks have not been all that healthy 
said jerry crenshaw sunbelt savings marketing manager in dallas 
any funds institution has to be careful in todays environment in 
talking about another

being a savings and loan customer in texas means 
never being able to say its over 
so far the four sampls and one bank with which ive done business 
have gone through six bailouts buyouts or failures all of them 
have changed names a few twice one branch is now a frozen yogurt 
store with a driveup window 
the tally so far ive lost money only once 
like most people in texas these days my interest in the savings 
and loan crisis goes beyond a casual interest in reading about 
debates in washington to a gut issue whats it mean for me 
in texas the crisis is part of daily conversation 
how do i make the check out now i ask another one of 
those letters came today my wife tells me maybe thats the end 
of it i say hopefully 
not so far 
letters telling us that our accounts had new owners and 
reassuring us that all was well became so frequent that we treated 
them like junk mail 
now i wish i had saved them to show my daughter shell never 
understand why people joke that when you buy a toaster these days 
you get a sampl for free 
i even believe theres a strange sort of charm in driving up to a 
financial institution that has a giant plastic banner across the 
front hiding any sign of its failed past 
one day i pulled up to first texas savings association and saw a 
red sign telling customers the thrift would be closed for four days 
that must be it i thought the end had come 
wrong first texas was closing for the veterans day holiday 
later after it was announced that new york financier ronald o 
perelman had bought the insolvent first texas it had now changed 
names twice in a week i asked a teller how to make out the check 
she had to ask someone 
first texas by the way used to boast we have ways to beat 
the 80s call me a cynic but i think the 80s won 
my wife and i opened a money market account at a somewhat 
notoriously highflying sampl which was paying high rates but had 
already been taken over by the regulators 
maybe thats the end of trouble there we thought not so lamar 
savings was declared insolvent and sold under the southwest plan 
and we got another letter 
we financed a mortgage at an sampl that had already had action 
taken against it by regulators that should be stable we thought 
three days before christmas it was sold to an investor from 
phoenix now we joke about how to make out the mortgage check 
my only loss came from a small investment in an interfirst bank 
bond interfirst was once the largest bank in texas but it was 
crushed by the oil and real estate collapse republicbank another 
texas giant bought interfirst and my bond became a firstrepublic 
bond 
that wasnt so bad until firstrepublic failed too it was 
bought by north carolina national bank 
that wasnt so bad until ncnb decided it wasnt going to be so 
charitable this time the bondholders were wiped out and i was left 
with nothing but a little more wisdom and a loss to declare on my 
taxes 
and probably another piece of junk mail

a customer at osidi a small manhattan boutique 
held a minidebate with herself should she spend 35 on a scarf or 
save the money for a different item of clothing 
marcia massa the stores owner listened to the soliloquy shes 
heard a lot of that kind of secondguessing from customers lately 
people are getting very discriminating in what they are 
buying she said 
customer caution has made it hard for mrs massa to get a handle 
on how business will fare this year but she knows this much if 
customers are playing it safe she had better do the same 
osidi a moderatepriced clothing store named after one of mrs 
massas friends is in manhattans residential gramercy park section 
southeast of midtown the boutiques customers for the most part 
are working women who live in the largely middleclass neighborhood 
mrs massas customers have grown increasingly uncertain about 
the economy over the last two years and shes watched her business 
change dramatically and unpredictably 
1988 was a very bad year for 98 percent of the people i came in 
contact with mrs massa said shortly after new years she 
included herself in the majority 
the holiday spirit seemed to pass osidi by while the season had 
some bright spots business never really took off even in the final 
week before christmas when many other retailers enjoyed a 
lastminute surge 
it was not a good christmas season mrs massa said the 
whole attitude of people was just to get it over with 
yet in the first days of 1989 the mood of her customers seemed 
to pick up and business improved 
several new lines of red black and navy sportswear just about 
blew out the door one woman spent 200 one saturday morning on 
several pieces and returned that afternoon for more 
customers snapped up a rack of handpainted scarves that sold for 
35 apiece mrs massa filled it with new stock that disappeared 
just as fast jewelry cases also had to be refilled 
i have a good feeling about spring she said in midjanuary 
i have the feeling that people are going to start opening up their 
pocketbooks soon 
but two weeks later a slow saturday was a reminder of how fickle 
the retail business can be mrs massa shook her head as she counted 
the days receipts and talked again about the economy 
her outlook appears to move in tandem with sales yet mrs 
massas underlying optimism seems to keep her going even when she 
sensed customers were feeling down during the holidays she knew 
theyd buy again 
you go through a cycle of emotional depression she said 
you withdraw for a while and then you come out 
mrs massas understanding of her customers may be the secret of 
her success and osidis ability to weather uncertainty she gets to 
know the women who enter the store talks with them treats them 
like friends 
people walking into osidi are met with a smile mrs massa asks 
regulars how last nights party went or how work is going one 
woman who had promised to stop by several days earlier but didnt 
was greeted with a concerned where were you 
that kind of rapport keeps them coming back they kept me in 
business this past year mrs massa said of her regulars and it 
helps her gauge how confident shoppers feel and what merchandise 
they might buy 
their caution has led mrs massa to sell a different type of 
clothing than in the past 
she used to buy entire ensembles that would sell for several 
hundred dollars these days accessories and mixandmatch skirts 
sweaters and slacks are her staples osidi offers fewer lines of 
clothing priced lower than the merchandise of past years 
the shift also has led mrs massa to have some merchandise made 
to order shes no stranger to that end of the apparel industry 
having been a manufacturer before she opened her store four years 
ago 
its more economical to do it yourself she said by creating 
the specifications for her own merchandise she is sure to get the 
kinds of fabrics and colors she knows will sell 
the watchword for this venture is caution the same caution 
shes applying to her store 
well see how it goes she said

federal authorities are increasing their pressure 
on traders and brokers in an effort to win cooperation in their 
investigation of fraud in the worlds two largest commodities 
exchanges sources said friday 
the us attorneys office in chicago has shown some futures 
traders evidence of at least one type of trading offense and has 
invited them to share information in exchange for immunity from 
prosecution reduced charges or a recommendation for a lenient 
sentence say attorneys for some of those subpoenaed over the past 
two weeks 
the pressure increasingly applied being to selected traders and 
brokers is helping to sharpen the focus of the governments twoyear 
undercover investigation of the chicago board of the trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange the lawyers said 
it tells me they need cooperation said john troelstrup an 
attorney with a number of clients who have been contacted by the 
us attorneys office 
it tells me that the eerie feeling that theyre not focusing on 
anything more than a routine tradepractices investigation may be on 
the mark he said 
anton valukas the us attorney for the northern district of 
illinois has refused to confirm the existence of the investigation 
which was disclosed by the chicago tribune on jan 19 speculation 
about the purpose of the probe has ranged from rooting out trading 
fraud to documenting the laundering of drug money 
defense lawyers said federal prosecutors have shown some traders 
evidence of bag trading in the illegal technique a floor 
broker conspires with another trader the bag man to sell a 
customers futures contract at the low end of an official price 
range and to buy it back for a different customer at the high end of 
the range 
the transaction produces a profit for the bag man which he 
splits with his trading 
futures are binding contracts for delivery of a commodity at a 
specified price on a specified date producers and consumers of 
commodities use the futures markets to lock in prices in advance 
while speculators use them to bet on price movements 
prosecutors also have told some brokers or their attorneys they 
were prepared to accept proffer letters from people under 
investigation defense attorneys said 
in a proffer letter a potential defendant lays out the 
information he is willing to provide in exchange for immunity a 
lesser charge or prosecutors recommendation for leniency if no 
such deal is struck prosecutors agree not to use the information to 
prosecute the individual 
one lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said proffer 
letters were fairly routine in criminal investigations 
but troelstrup said it was unusual for federal authorities to let 
it be known publicly albeit through unofficial channels that they 
were willing to negotiate plea bargains 
the government also is seeking handwriting samples from some of 
those subpoenaed by asking them to write down the tradingbadge 
numbers of certain other traders at the chicago mercantile exchange 
defense lawyers said 
troelstrup said federal authorities may want to compare the 
handwriting samples with the handwriting on trading cards obtained 
by subpoena futures traders record on trading cards the price 
quantity time and badge number of the opposing buyer or seller for 
each trade they make 
meanwhile the chicago tribune reported friday that chicago board 
of trade officials were drafting a document that would prohibit 
floor brokers from trading both for their own accounts and on behalf 
of customers dual trading which is unique to futures markets has 
been criticized as inviting trading abuse 
board of trade spokesman michael oconnell would not confirm the 
report saying only that dual trading was one of the issues being 
examined by an internal committee formed earlier this week to make 
recommendations to the exchanges board of directors 
in a statement unrelated to the investigation the chicago merc 
said friday it had fined timothy s fox a trader in the standard amp 
poors 500 stockindex futures pit 50000 for making prearranged 
trades

public service co of new hampshire 
disclosed friday it has agreed to pay 2 million to four former 
owners of the seabrook nuclear power plant so that they wont sue 
the utility over its management of the stalled project 
the agreement is part of a deal under which public service which 
sought bankruptcy protection a year ago because of its 36 percent 
seabrook share would assume 30 million in plant payments being 
skipped by the owner of the fourthlargest share massachusetts 
municipal wholesale electric co 
in return for making mmwecs payments which would keep the 
project afloat through may 1990 public service wanted all present 
and former seabrook owners to agree not to sue it public service 
denies mismanaging the project but says it wants to avoid expensive 
litigation over it 
central maine power co which formerly owned 6 percent of 
seabrook and initially refused to waive its right to sue public 
service now has signed on 
but vermont electric cooperative new hampshire electric 
cooperative and hudson power amp light co of massachusetts which 
own a total of about 4 percent of seabrook wont go along public 
service spokesman nicholas ashooh confirmed friday 
public services bankruptcy judge james yacos must approve the 
agreement for assuming the mmwec payments and the utility on friday 
told him how it got central maine and the other former owners to 
sign on 
public service said it would pay 12 million in cash to central 
maine maine public service co bangor hydroelectric co of maine 
and central vermont public service co ashooh said public service 
also would waive 800000 in debt from central maine 
those companies sold their seabrook shares totaling 12 percent 
of the project to a subsidiary of eastern utilities associates of 
massachusetts in 1986 
public service disclosed some details of its seabrook funding 
deal as it asked yacos for another extension of the deadline for the 
projects past and present owners to file claims against it in 
bankruptcy court 
yacos previously had granted three extensions of the deadline for 
claims against public service and said last month there would be 
no further extensions beyond feb 9 but on friday he granted 
one more extension to feb 24 
seabrook its pricetag now 58 billion was completed in july 
1986 but remains idle because of problems with finances and 
evacuation planning 
mmwec which owns 12 percent of seabrook stopped making payments 
of about 15 million a month to the project last summer plant 
officials initially said they hoped to complete arrangements for 
assuming 30 million of mmwecs payments by sept 15 
an interim funding arrangment expired nov 30 plant officials 
say some owners have been making the payments since but they wont 
give specifics 
the federal nuclear regulatory commission ruled in december that 
seabrooks financial problems do not pose a safety concern for 
lowpower atomic tests but appeared to leave the issue open for 
commercial licensing seabrook officials hope to start lowpower 
tests within the next month and gain a commercial license by year

sales of usmade cars and light trucks rose 56 
percent in late january bolstered by a strong performance by ford 
motor co and continued solid truck sales the manufacturers 
reported friday 
one analyst suggested that fords 148 percent increase in sales 
of domestically made cars may stem from latejanuary fleet sales 
fleet customers include all those who buy more than 10 vehicles a 
year such as rental car companies police forces and firms that 
provide employees with cars 
the automakers reported they sold cars and light trucks at a 
daily rate of 41798 vehicles during the jan 2131 period this 
year compared with a rate of 39571 during the same period a year 
ago 
car sales were up 53 percent based on fords performance and 
truck sales rose 63 percent during the period in which there were 
nine selling days both years general motors corps usmade car 
sales rose 21 percent while chrysler corps fell 119 percent in 
late january compared with the same period last year 
i think there might have been a little blip in their number 
from fleets said analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman 
hutton in new york you normally see that in the latter part of 
the year 
sales in december of last year were very strong while the 
carselling market softened somewhat in the first part of january 
there is still a great deal of concern that strong fleet sales 
throughout the fourth quarter may have been masking some possible 
deterioration in the retail marketplace phillippi said 
another analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc in 
new york said fords share of the domestic car market about 307 
percent is nearly the same as it has been lately 
i think if you take the month as a whole the weak early 
january and the late strength i think if you smooth out the last 
few months car sales are a little weaker he said but theres 
so much noise in these numbers that its hard to tell 
industrywide car and truck sales in the united states dropped 5 
percent during january sales of imported vehicles dropped 182 
percent while sales of vehicles made in the united states fell 04 
percent 
ford said its car sales rose 148 percent during the period to a 
daily rate of 8426 during late january this year compared with a 
daily rate of 7339 during the same time last year meantime sales 
of usmade trucks by ford rose 49 percent to a daily rate of 
5115 this year from a rate of 4873 during late january last year 
for the entire month fords car sales have risen 36 percent 
while its truck sales increased 49 percent 
chrysler showed the biggest decline in latejanuary car sales 
dipping 119 percent to a daily rate of 3180 this year compared 
with a rate of 3607 last year 
but truck sales for chrysler led the big three going up 81 
percent in late january 1989 to a rate of 3452 compared with a rate 
of 3193 last year 
for all of january this year chryslers car sales were 67 
percent lower than january last year while truck sales were up 12 
percent 
gm said its car sales rose 21 percent in late january to a 
daily rate of 12899 this year from a rate of 12631 last year 
truck sales rose 41 percent to a daily rate of 5213 this year from 
5009 last year 
for the month gm sold 111 percent fewer cars this year compared 
with last year and 17 percent more trucks

government unemployment report indicating robust economic expansion 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell point or about 
250 per 1000 face amount its yield which moves in the opposite 
direction from its price rose to 883 percent from 880 percent 
late thursday 
analysts said the bond market climbed in afternoon trading after 
an early selloff in response to the labor departments report that 
408000 new nonfarm jobs were created last month well above 
expectations of about 300000 
the report was viewed as a sign of rapid economic expansion 
triggering some inflationary fears analysts said but many traders 
attributed the increase to unseasonably warm january weather that 
created more construction jobs 
the market seems to want to be fairly strong said robert 
chandross chief economist with lloyds bank plc in new york part 
of the rise of employment was excused away because of the weather 
and its impact on construction 
he said the market also was buoyed by rumors that the weekly 
nationwide survey of purchasing managers a key economic indicator 
released on mondays would show a lower reading implying an 
economic slowdown 
but william sullivan director of money market research at dean 
witter reynolds inc said the employment data were strong enough to 
force the federal reserve to raise shortterm interest rates to slow 
the economy as a hedge against higher inflation 
even if you exclude construction you see a very buoyant set 
of labor data and it does suggest the economy is taking a strong 
tick in the new year he said against that data i would look 
for some tightening in credit policy 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell 316 point intermediate maturities fell 316 point

bethlehem steel corp said friday it 
will close its wire rope division in williamsport cutting 250 jobs 
because the federal trade commission would not grant early approval 
for selling the plant to a competitor 
we believe the planned transaction was entirely appropriate so 
that timely clearance should have been granted said robert m 
funk division president 
an authorization by the commission would have permitted an 
orderly transfer of the williamsport plant to bridon american 
this would have allowed bridon to complete the purchase to maintain 
many local jobs and to minimize the impact on our customers and the 
areas economy funk said in a statement 
the commission rejected an early termination of its investigation 
into possible antitrust implications of the deal bethlehem announced 
in september the federal agency has had the proposed sale under 
review since november 
ftc spokeswoman susan tricknor declined comment 
bridon american located in wilkesbarre pa is a division of 
bridon amp small plc of britain the worlds largest producer of wire 
rope and related products it operates in europe canada puerto 
rico and the dominican republic 
bethlehem said it could wait no longer to close the deal because 
it was losing money at the plant and had no indication how long the 
ftc might study the proposed sale 
williamsport has been losing money for a long time said 
company spokesman gary graham we were down to the wire 
also the williamsport plant does not fit bethlehems longrange 
plan to concentrate on basic steel operations the company said 
the plant employs about 250 hourly and salaried employees the 
workforce has been reduced from about 500 people in early 1988 
bethlehem said it plans to continue limited operations at the 
plant for about 60 days so that customers will not be inconvenienced

copper futures prices fell markedly friday the fourth 
significant decline in the last five trading sessions on 
perceptions of easing labor tensions in several copperproducing 
countries and expectations of an increase in supplies 
on other markets preciousmetals futures prices rose 
agricultural futures were mostly higher and energy futures 
retreated 
copper settled 135 cents to 250 cents lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in march at 
13235 a pound 
the spot february contract finished at 134 a pound the lowest 
spot copper price on the commodity exchange since oct 13 and more 
than 30 cents below the record high of 16475 a pound reached on 
dec 8 
the march contract lost nearly 10 percent of its value during the 
past week the setback was largely a reaction to labor settlements 
that averted refinery strikes in chile peru and mexico 
not only were these labor problems resolved they were 
resolved in a very short period of time and that caught a lot of 
people off guard said bernard savaiko an analyst in new york 
with painewebber inc 
the dollars strength during the week effectively raising the 
price of us goods to foreign buyers also weighed on copper 
prices analysts said 
but experts said demand for copper remained strong and at least 
one analyst cautioned that labor tensions in chile and peru have not 
disappeared 
you can always bandage a cut but if you have internal 
hemorrhaging you can still die said george anagnos of thomson 
mckinnon securities inc 
gold and silver futures posted modest gains on the commodity 
exchange in lackluster trading 
gold settled 40 cents to 80 cents higher with april at 39630 a 
troy ounce silver was 12 cents to 13 cents higher with march at 
5875 a troy ounce 
wheat and soybean futures closed moderately higher on the chicago 
board of trade in late buying partially prompted by a report that 
the soviet union had ordered the evacuation of 20 villages 
contaminated by radiation from the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident 
the wireservice report said residents of the unidentified 
ukrainian farming communities had not previously been informed of 
the radiation leak and had been living and growing crops in highly 
contaminated soil 
the chernobyl incident sparked a sharp rise in us grain futures 
in 1986 on fears of widespread contamination of soviet crops 
no new radiation leakage was reported on friday but when you 
start hearing rumors of leakage of radiation people start thinking 
chernobyl and are we going to have another incident said 
jerry zusel manager of floor operations for balfour maclaine corp 
at the chicago board of trade 
corn futures closed mixed while oats were slightly higher 
wheat settled cent to 3 cents higher with march at 430 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with march at 
271 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with march at 
218 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 10 cents higher with 
march at 770 a bushel

maybe somebody should send coke and pepsi to 
their rooms until they cool off 
in the latest volley of the cola wars pepsicola co is running 
a new commercial tweaking diet cokes recent 3d ads and disputing 
claims about how many pepsi drinkers are switching to diet coke 
cocacola co fired back saying its campaign to position 
thirdranked diet coke as a challenger to regular pepsis spot as 
the nations no 2 soft drink apparently has set off a panic at 
pepsi 
weve struck a sensitive chord said michael a beindorff 
vice president for atlantabased cocacola 
thats not the way pepsi sees it spokesman tod mackenzie said 
late friday it appeared that pepsis new ads scored a solid right 
to the corporate chin with its ads attacking the credibility of 
cokes claims 
pepsi has complained about cokes ad claims to the three major 
television networks which are reviewing them cocacola says it 
plans to complain to the networks about pepsis new ad which began 
running thursday night 
jesse meyers publisher of the trade newsletter beverage digest 
said the attention that the two soft drink giants are paying to 
their diet colas illustrates the growing importance of the diet 
segment of the 43 billion retail soda market as the population ages 
and becomes more weight conscious 
diet coke started the latest exchange with commercials on last 
months broadcast of the super bowl football game that took the 
unusual approach of going against regular pepsi rather than diet 
pepsi 
last year nearly two million families stopped buying pepsi and 
more of them moved to diet coke than any other major soft drink 
the ads say 
the campaign theme is the move is on to diet coke and the ads 
employ miami vice star don johnson an expepsi pitchman to 
reinforce the point 
the ads attracted heightened attention because they first aired 
in connection with cokes sponsorship of the super bowl halftime 
show the first live network broadcast in threedimensions 
cocacola bottlers distributed about 20 million pairs of special 
glasses so viewers could get the 3d effect in both the show and an 
ad for diet coke 
pepsi said cocacolas claim was misleading because millions of 
families switch to other brands every year and asked the networks 
to pull the ads or demand modifications 
according to the trade newsletter beverage digest pepsis market 
share fell 01 percentage point to 187 percent in 1988 while diet 
coke and its caffeinefree version rose to 102 percent from 94 
percent in 1987 and diet pepsi and its caffeinefree version rose to 
66 percent from 61 percent 
pepsi also developed an ad that it began airing thursday on 
network tv 
it shows a man making a presentation in a boardroom his back to 
the camera as he gestures at a chart that shows diet coke sales 
rising 
as the presentation proceeds a narrator says last year two 
million families stopped buying diet coke and over a million new 
families started buying diet pepsi so whats giving diet coke such 
a distorted view 
the answer becomes obvious as the man turns toward the camera 
wearing 3d glasses gentlemen i trust we are all seeing this the 
same way he said as viewers see the other executives are also 
wearing the 3d glasses 
meyers said there are elements of truth in both campaigns diet 
cokes market share closed the lead on regular pepsi last year he 
said but by some measures he said diet pepsi has grown more 
rapidly than diet coke 
but he added you cant have cola wars without skirmishes

the resignations of four top executives at 
kidder peabody group inc are a blow to attempts by kidders parent 
general electric co to stem internal problems at the venerable 
investment firm analysts said friday 
michael d madden head of investment banking at the securities 
firm and the highestranking senior kidder executive was among the 
four resignations announced thursday 
kidder sources said more departures were expected at the nations 
15thlargest securities firm 
the latest resignations came less than two weeks after ge named 
one of its own executives to head kidder prompting the resignation 
of 20year veteran max c chapman jr who had been running the 
securities groups daily operations 
in a statement ge said friday the departures were 
understandable because of disagreements over new directions for 
124yearold kidder 
while it is disappointing to note the recent departure of 
several kidder officials employment changes following receipt of 
bonuses is not an unusual occurrence in the securities industry 
said lawrence a bossidy vice chairman and chief executive officer 
of ges financial services unit 
kidder has experienced internal disenchantment corporate 
embarrassment at its involvement in the wall street insider trading 
scandal and a loss of stature and clients since ge bought an 80 
percent stake in the firm in 1986 
the presence of ge and some of the decisions that have resulted 
has contributed to some of the problems said brenda davis mccoy 
who follows the securities industry for painewebber inc theyve 
had numerous management changes and repeated changes in strategy 
the other executives who left thursday are douglas v brown 
cohead of mergers and acquisitions thomas w ostrander a managing 
director who worked on new business development and steven p baum 
managing director of mortgage trading 
madden said in a telephone interview friday he had difficulty 
maintaining confidence among his bankers because of perceived 
inequities in compensation 
the real linchpin of the decision was that i think that 
kidderge can ultimately succeed however there are a number of 
fundamental structural and cultural differences between the two 
organizations that need to be addressed he said 
kidder sources said there is widespread dissatisfaction at the 
firm with reductions in employee bonuses plus a conflict between ge 
management and kidders investment bankers over the departments 
strategy 
analysts said the recent senior management changes by ge 
reflected the parent companys desire to exert greater control over 
kidders daytoday operations as well as ges latest attempt to 
deal with difficulties posed by the firm 
michael a carpenter the former executive vice president of ge 
capital corp who was named kidders president and chief executive 
officer two weeks ago declined to comment directly on the impact of 
maddens departure 
while we regret his decision he leaves behind a strong 
organization that will continue to function as an important part of 
this firm carpenter said in a statement 
kidders reputation was tainted when it became embroiled in the 
ivan boesky insider trading scandal the firm agreed in 1987 to pay 
a thenrecord 253 million to settle civil charges with the 
securities and exchange commission 
ge made a number of highlevel management changes at kidder 
following the settlement in what was seen as an attempt to repair 
what ge perceived as management weaknesses that led to kidders 
involvement in the scandal 
madden said the publicity over insider trading and ge had made it 
more difficult for kidder to sign on new clients 
there comes a point when all the press and all the uncertainty 
over the gekidder situation causes directors to start to question 
the wisdom of management it just wears you down it makes you play 
defense he said

energy futures prices slumped friday amid 
conflicting reports from opec 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil lost 20 
cents to close the day at 1753 a barrel the contract had settled 
22 cents higher on thursday after flipflopping earlier in the week 
other contract months also fell 
heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices were among the refined 
products that declined on the exchange the march contract for 
domestic heating oil settled 024 cent lower at 5031 cents a 
gallon while unleaded gasoline closed down 045 cent at 4917 cents 
a gallon 
analysts said crude prices had risen on thursday spurred by a 
report in an arabiclanguage newspaper that dubai was considering a 
10 percent cut in its oil production starting march 1 
a second report on friday contradicting the earlier statements 
pushed prices down said nauman barakat vice president of energy 
investments at prudentialbache securities inc 
it shows the market is still very prone to rumors barakat 
said 
barakat said thursdays report had been perceived as positive 
because it suggested dubai was willing to cooperate to help 
stabilize world oil prices dubai has refused to cut its production 
since the organization of petroleum exporting countries new quota 
system took effect jan 1 
dubai is one of several emirates in the united arab emirates one 
of the 13 opec nations experts estimate the uae is exceeding its 
quota by about 400000 barrels a day it was assigned a quota of 
988000 barrels out of a total 185 million barrels for the entire 
cartel 
investors have remained skittish despite opecs new agreement 
because in the past the cartel has had problems sticking to similar 
accords although prices have risen fairly steadily since jan 1 
recent reports indicate that several members of the cartel are 
continuing to overproduce 
analysts said the latest reports from dubai provided further 
evidence that opecs agreement remains shaky

the bush administration assured american allies 
friday of the presidents commitment to lowering the us budget 
deficit but no decisions were reached on a new approach to the 
troubling issue of third world debt participants in the discussions 
said 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who was the host for the 
administrations first international gathering said the discussions 
had been productive with participants expressing the general view 
that the global economy is peforming well 
the meetings involving finance ministers and central bank 
presidents of the industrial worlds largest economies the united 
states japan west germany britain france italy and canada 
were billed as a getacquainted session for the new administration 
to present its ideas on international matters 
participants said brady assured the other nations of president 
bushs commitment to lowering the budget deficit promising to 
reduce the deficit by more than 60 billion in the next fiscal year 
which begins on oct 1 
a senior treasury department official briefing reporters on 
condition that his name not be used said brady stressed that bush 
was working to cooperate with congress in finding a successful 
approach to reducing the deficit 
brady told reporters that the effort to better coordinate 
economic policies between countries was working well with the 
participants holding a positive view about the current state of 
the global economy 
brady said that the seven countries also had a thorough 
discussion regarding the 13 trillion third world debt burden 
several ideas were discussed for strengthening the agreedon 
strategy based on the same principles that we consider valid 
brady said 
the meetings lasted for 11 hours over thursday and friday 
canadian finance minister michael wilson told reporters that a 
number of proposals on third world debt had been reviewed including 
recommendations by the japanese and the french for liberalized 
lending policies 
we looked at a number of options that have been put on the 
table wilson said we looked at options today and that will 
continue but no decisions were made 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy briefing reporters 
said that brady gave the group assurances that the new 
administration viewed reducing the budget deficit as very 
important 
the deficit which is expected to reach 161 billion this year 
has long been a source of unhappiness for us allies who blame it 
for siphoning off capital needed for investment in their own 
countries 
brady assured the finance ministers that bush intended to meet 
the grammrudman deficit reduction targets which call for a deficit 
of 100 billion in 1990 declining to zero by 1993 bush will present 
his own budget plans before a joint session of congress next 
thursday 
a canadian official briefing reporters on the condition that the 
officials name not be used said that there was skepticism about 
bushs flexible freeze approach to reducing the deficit through 
spending restraint without the aid of new taxes 
the canadian official said that there were doubts about the 
optimistic economic assumptions underpinning the flexible freeze 
especially projections of sharp declines in interest rates 
officials said that in addition to the us budget deficit the 
finance officials discussed the apparent stall in further 
improvements in huge world trade imbalances 
the united states trade deficit after posting big improvements 
early in 1988 has been frozen over the past six months while the 
japanese and west german trade surpluses have begun rising again 
officials said that the countries remained committed to the 
economic policy coordination process begun by bradys predecessor 
james a baker iii who is now secretary of state in the bush 
administration 
they said that this process still held out the best hope of 
narrowing the trade differences by keeping currency rates from 
fluctuating unlike past sessions of the group of seven as the 
countries are known this weeks meetings were held during a period 
of relative calm in currency markets 
the dollar which has undergone periods of heavy selling pressure 
over the past two years has strengthened and in fact the federal 
reserve and central banks of the other countries have been selling 
dollars to keep it from appreciating too much in value in relation 
to other currencies 
officials indicated that no consideration had been given to 
changing the trading ranges established for the dollar and other 
currencies when the currencies trade outside those ranges central 
banks engage in a process known as intervention the massive buying 
or selling of a currency by a government to influence its price 
on third world debt the countries discussed modifications to the 
socalled baker plan which has governed handling of the 13 
trillion third world debt burden since baker unveiled it in 
september 1985 
the discussions focused on ways to encourage commercial banks to 
voluntarily reduce the debt they hold officials predicted the 
negotiations would continue with the hope that concrete proposals 
could be unveiled at the spring meeting of the international 
monetary fund and world bank scheduled from march 31 to april 4 in 
washington 
bush has pledged to review the american policy on third world 
debt the united states has found itself increasingly isolated on 
the debt issue as political stresses have increased in debtor 
countries suffering declining standards of living as they struggled 
to meet a rising burden of loan repayments

bic corp is confident about plans to 
market a 5 french spritz perfume alongside its ballpoint pens 
throwaway razors and cigarette lighters but some fragrance experts 
think the idea stinks 
bic officially will inaugurate its new product next month in the 
same retailers where it sells the other items and an advertising 
campaign will start in early april bic spokeswoman sharon dupuy 
said friday 
the quarterounce spray perfumes to be called jour and nuit 
will be offered at a price comparable to that of cologne a much 
less concentrated form of fragrance 
bic a subsidiary of societe bic of france launched the perfume 
business a year ago in france with a new 25 million factory 
firmenich one of europes top four fragrance makers is supplying 
the essences for parfum bic 
european sales have been strong according to company officials 
and cosmetic analysts 
in the united states parfum bic will be sold in the usual bic 
outlets drug stores discount stores supermarkets convenience 
stores 
the concept is vintage bic if you as a consumer have an 
opportunity to buy perfume for a price which is less than you might 
spend on toilet water would there be much reason not to said 
david liebowitz an analyst at american securities in new york 
but others had doubts 
jt botindari fragrance buyer at colonial drug in cambridge 
mass calls the planned parfum bic a junky idea he said the 
success of the product will depend on how sophisticated your buyer 
is and whether he wants to buy perfume from a company that makes 
lighter fluid 
jay salzman of goldman sachs amp co the new york investment 
firm said other failed efforts to market lowbudget perfumes 
included one by revlon in the early 1980s he said one of the 
problems is pilferage and another is that 5 may be more than women 
may want to spend for such a product in a supermarket or convenience 
store 
if they are successful they will be the first salzman said 
its been tried its very tough my visceral reaction is that if 
it is ultimately successful it will be an uphill battle it might 
be more expensive than bic thinks 
this is the same thing people told us about shavers dupuy 
responded no one has been able to combine this quality and this 
price and this packaging
