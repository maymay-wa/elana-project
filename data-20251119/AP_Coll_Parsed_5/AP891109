on the hurricanebattered 
island of vieques a practice site for us navy bombing off puerto 
rico residents link their destiny to a centuryold tamarind tree 
on a barren hill 
if the tree survives so will vieques said engineer sixto 
perez after a ceremony to replant the tree which was uprooted by 
hurricane hugo on sept 18 
it has been silent witness to our history nana ortiz de 
castano a retired teacher told schoolchildren gathered around the 
tree 
the us navy has been part of vieques history since world war 
ii 
it owns twothirds of the island and uses it for practice 
bombings and maneuvers in the 1970s vieques was rocked by violent 
antinavy protests similar demonstrations in 1975 drove the navy 
off its sister island culebra although the navy says relations 
have improved in recent years many viequenses as the 8000 
residents are called say hurricane hugo has made matters worse 
vieques was one of the areas hardest hit by the storm 
hugo pounded vieques for 12 hours with winds clocked at 140 to 
200 mph demolishing or damaging virtually all its 3000 homes 
trees were either knocked downed or defoliated leaving the 
onceverdant sunsplashed island with little shade 
it will take 10 years to recover said luiz davila manager 
of a general electric plant that makes electric switches and is the 
islands largest employer with 132 workers 
now we are seeing the devastation davila added in six 
months a year we will see the lack of income people will have 
with their homes and possessions gone and their future 
livelihood in doubt some residents despair officials say two 
people hanged themselves and several others attempted suicide after 
the storm no one in vieques died in the hurricane itself 
there is lot of depression a lot of suicide attempts said 
dr eva almodovar who is in charge of the emergency room at the 
vieques hospital its people who have lost everything they 
dont see a way out 
the navy is helping rebuild roads and restore power and water 
the day after the hurricane the navy put up a roadblock to 
prevent squatters from returning to a disputed area where they had 
set up shacks and burned two navy vehicles in april 
robert ravin a high school history teacher charged that the 
navy acted like thieves in the night taking advantage of the 
hurricane crisis 
but a navy spokesman lt richard boyle said the roadblock was 
put up because the squatters were unauthorized people on navy 
property the shacks had been blown down and were completely 
demolished 
the navy bought vieques land for training during world war ii 
resettling residents in the center of the island which is 20 miles 
long and six miles across most of the navy property is unused and 
hundreds of squatters have moved in over the past year 
rear adm john a moriarty commander of caribbean naval forces 
said relations with vieques residents have been very very good 
but squatter organizer antonio figueroa a carpenter who says 
his movement is rescuing land believes the navy has a master 
plan to stifle development to keep the island to itself 
many viequenses complain that the navys presence has kept the 
island underdeveloped underpopulated and povertystricken 
vieques has a severe housing shortage an unemployment rate of 
70 percent and an annual per capita income of 5281 as opposed 
to the puerto rico average of 8721 the majority of the islanders 
are on welfare 
although its unspoiled beauty has made it the location for 
several movies most recently heartbreak ridge with clint 
eastwood about the 1983 usled invasion of grenada vieques has 
seen little tourism 
the navy occupies twothirds of the island and this prevents 
it from developing to its plenitude because they own the best 
beaches the best land said mayor manuela santiago collazo 
vieques has been losing population for years and is expected to 
lose 2000 of its 8000 inhabitants by the year 2000 
a young viequense who becomes an engineer a doctor or a 
lawyer cant come back because there is nothing to do here said 
figueroa

the first anniversary of california voters 
approval of proposition 103 passed with citizens still waiting for 
insurance rates to be slashed 
its author claims that while victory has been delayed it has 
not been denied 
whats at stake here is democracy and whos in charge the 
initiatives author harvey rosenfield told a press conference 
wednesday at the headquarters of the voter revolt organization 
the proposition which has the force of law called for 20 
percent rollbacks from 1987 auto insurance rates it also said that 
geography should be less important to setting rates than drivers 
records and experience and made the office of insurance 
commissioner an elected position 
the major insurance companies however have not rolled back 
their rates in the wake of a court battle over the referendum an 
estimated 700 companies were affected they also have not begun 
judging rates according to driving records 
the insurance commissioner at least becomes an elected 
position in the november 1990 election 
on the anniversary day rosenfield and conway collis an elected 
state tax official who also is a candidate for the 1990 race for 
insurance commissioner stood behind boxes marked 1000s 
symbolizing the 20 percent rollbacks still in insurers coffers 
they said prop 103s promises would soon be realized if 
supporters keep faith its fair to say that for the first time 
we can see light at the end of the tunnel rosenfield said 
but they acknowledged frustration and rosenfield fired salvos 
at state insurance commissioner roxani gillespie 
we are as frustrated as anybody else is rosenfield said 
it is an absolute outrage that we are basically 11 months behind 
schedule in the provisions of 103 that were supposed to go into 
effect on election day 
voters approved prop 103 on nov 8 1988 on a vote of 48 
million to 46 million the next day insurers filed numerous 
lawsuits against it and a day later the california supreme court 
suspended implementation for a review 
by december the supreme court had lifted the stay on 
implementing most of the measure except for the 20percent 
rollbacks 
to add insult to injury the largest seller of auto insurance in 
california state farm announced in january that it was raising 
rates an average of 96 percent 
prop 103 was upheld by the high court in may but the court 
said the commissioner should exempt a company from rollbacks if it 
would not receive what the court called a fair and reasonable rate 
of return 
in early august the commissioner set the fair rate of return at 
112 percent annually by the end of august that figure had been 
characterized as tentative and could be revised upward 
in the meantime more than 400 insurance companies had filed for 
exemption from rollbacks and the commissioner said three of the 
states largest insurance sellers were among hundreds likely to win 
exemptions 
during summer hearings insurance companies also told gillespie 
she should continue to allow territorial rating systems in which 
prices are set according to neighborhood 
as more rate hikes were announced and confusion over the status 
of prop 103 mounted gillespie on oct 2 ordered rate increases 
frozen for six months and said all issues would be taken up at 
hearings 
collis sought to put the best face on the developments 
its really important for people to realize on this 
anniversary of 103 that rollbacks have been delayed the move away 
from territorial rating system has been delayed but its now in the 
process and if we hang together awhile longer its now going to 
happen collis said 
the insurance companies want people to become apathetic about 
prop 103 rosenfield claimed 
if you talk to the insurance companies they gloat about the 
fact that 71 percent of the people have said they dont ever think 
that they ever have forced the insurance companies to give us those 
rollbacks he said 
asked if he would have done anything differently rosenfield 
said he should have incorporated criminal penalties into the law

life is a thief katharine hepburn tells 
montgomery clift in suddenly last summer but life knew better 
than to steal from kate the great 
the voice tallulah bankhead once likened to nickels dropping 
in a slot machine has grown tremulous with age but nothing can 
daunt that special yankee strength that has seen 80 autumns 
hepburn remains arrogant bossy and tenacious principled 
passionate and clever her viperish wit slices and dices no dont 
mess with kate 
i think im very irritating to some people she once said 
it fascinates me though because im so sweet really 
hepburn celebrated her 80th birthday wednesday not quietly at 
home as some her age would have it but dashing about new york 
visiting ill friends shes being a good samaritan her 
secretary sharon powers said 
who cares about my birthday the actress said recently i 
dont as long as i can get around and think straight 
and she does think about many things she frets about the 
backyard garden of her manhattan brownstone rails at youthful sex 
supports abortion and champions euthanasia for the elderly if it 
exists hepburn has something to say about it 
i think theres sort of a terrible fear of death in this 
country and i just dont think you should fear something that is 
absolutely inevitable she said in an interview with the 
associated press 
ive been extremely lucky ive got money and i can decide to 
work or not work ive been terribly lucky all my life 
hepburn had a scare when a growth was discovered last year on 
her vocal cords a biopsy showed it was not cancerous and she 
recovered nicely from surgery 
from the day rko studio bosses first spotted her on the new york 
stage in an abbreviated tunic playing an amazon queen in the 
warriors husband hepburn has enchanted and seduced a moviegoing 
public 
her first movie a bill of divorcement with john barrymore 
was a success her next was a dud the third the stagey 1933 
production morning glory won her first academy award three 
others came in 1967 1968 and 1981 for guess whos coming to 
dinner the lion in winter and on golden pond 
but after morning glory hepburn made several flops that 
turned her into boxoffice poison the philadelphia story in 
1940 marked her resurrection from hollywoods graveyard with her 
champagney portrayal of a spoiled rich girl who marries and 
remarries the man she loves 
playwright philip barry wrote it for her and the play was a 
smash on broadway 
i bought the movie rights they wanted to buy it for all my 
rivals but i already owned it very clever she said 
then i stayed at metro mgm and did all those pictures with 
spencer ive done things for the honest reason that i like them 
you cant do things just to be successful you have to do things 
that affect you 
spencer was spencer tracy hepburns closest friend for 27 
years she was linked romantically with billionaire industrialist 
howard hughes and producer leland hayward and was married once 
in 1928 to philadelphia socialite ludlow ogden smith they divorced 
in 1934 
hepburn inherited her yankee tenacity from her parents her 
father dr norval hepburn was a urologist who campaigned for 
public awareness about venereal disease her mother katharine 
houghton was a suffragist and a crusader in the birth control 
movement 
their tenacity she said freed her from fear i wasnt afraid 
to pay the price of saying what i thought i wasnt cautious 
at bryn mawr college with its high academic standards and 
mannered students she survived on her wits she almost flunked out 
but buckled down to work so she could act in school plays after 
graduating she plunged into stock and finally landed a bit role in 
a broadway flop 
lately shes done some television work including last years 
laura lansing slept here but mostly she putters about in her 
garden visits friends spends time in her home on the connecticut 
shore and looks for the right movie projects 
its terribly difficult to find interesting roles she once 
said and a poor old thing dying in a rest home is not a terribly 
interesting picture i think its just depressing

an exceptional harvest in vineyards across france 
has wine growers and wine lovers happily anticipating their first 
tastings of this years vintage 
theres even talk perhaps overexcited that 1989 could produce 
some of the best wines of the century 
the enthusiasm stems from nearperfect growing conditions a 
hot dry summer that meant drought for other farmers followed by 
an early harvest free from rain 
weve got sun in the vats said maurice vigier a producer 
of chateau reve dor a bordeaux pomerol and winner of the 
concours agricole wine competition the quality is very high 
hopes are high from alsace in the northeast to bordeaux in the 
southwest and in all the winegrowing regions in between 
its a good year all over france said christian amare 
spokesman for the maison de la vigne et du vin besides the high 
quality production is up in quantity by 5 percent over last year 
he said 
olivier le flaive a grower of pulignymontrachet and a wine 
dealer for the cote dor said the 1989 burgundy whites will be the 
best in a decade 
they are of very very good quality at least equal to the 
good wines of 1978 the acidity is minimal but acceptable id 
grade the whites 19 out of a perfect 20 he said adding that the 
region also will have some exceptional red wines 
but there are reservations as well among wine experts and 
producers many of whom are withholding praise until the first 
corks are popped 
it may be the year of the decade because growers and the 
media want it to be said steven spurrier the founder of 
lacademie du vin in paris and one of the bestknown wine 
connoisseurs in the city 
spurrier said he would wait to see if overripe grapes produce 
a flabby overrich product 
tim johnston coowner of willis wine bar and juveniles in 
paris said it was a great year but people who are hyping the 
harvest havent understood the problems of drought some of the 
whites for example are lacking freshness and acidity 
russell hone of le serbet a wine brokerage firm in burgundy 
said the white wines from his region have finesse with good 
intensity of taste 
but these wines may not be as rich and lush as 1986 nor as 
alcoholic as 1985 for now the white burgundies still have a milky 
quality like grapefruit juice hone said its a good year but 
too early to say if its great 
hone said burgundy suffered hailstorms and frost in june and 
that quality varied according to vineyards up and down the cote 
dor 
there will be plenty of vintage champagne as producers there 
bubble with enthusiasm for a crop that produced 10 percent more 
wine than usual 
weve had an exceptional year said philippe coulon 
director of oenology at moet et chandon the condition of the 
grapes was perfect they reached the ideal maturity were perfectly 
healthy giving a balanced product 
for the final verdict we have to await february and march 
but were predicting a millesime or vintage year coulon said 
the years wines may be memorable for their abundance and 
flavor but they also will be remembered for being more expensive 
than ever before champaign prices are fixed at 13 percent higher 
than last year 
some blame rising labor costs or the expense of improved 
vinification often it simply is a question of supply not meeting 
demand 
and sometimes public relations campaigns have as much influence 
as producers in how a wine is priced wines from regions that are 
hyped bring as much as the market will bear 
a lot of speculators in bordeaux buy it up even before the 
secondary fermentation is finished said mark williamson of 
willis wine bar adding that it is too early to judge the 1989 
bordeaux 
nevertheless he said thanks to this years hype the price 
will probably rise

although high in the andes and far from 
anything else this village of communal farmers has not escaped a 
maoist guerrillas terror campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal 
elections sunday and in the long run the presidential election 
next year 
a column of 30 guerrillas of the sendero luminoso shining path 
movement entered andajes one stormy night and seized mayor heraclio 
segundo four other local officials and a sixth man they accused of 
cattle rustling they then dragged them into the village plaza 
where they killed them with single gunshots to the back of the neck 
as a result no candidates are running for office sunday in 
andajes 
all that people think about is that they will come back that 
there will be more killings said andres zuniga bernabe a young 
farmer 
the wave of assassinations of mayors and other local officials 
in peru has reached levels unprecedented in the shining paths 
9yearold insurgency 
latest available figures show that 263 mayors posts around peru 
are unfilled nearly all of them in small towns and villages with 
little or no police protection 
in junin department in the countrys mining and farming 
heartland 150 miles east of lima only 61 of 122 municipalities 
have mayors 
some 4500 candidates registered to run in the nations nearly 
2000 mayoralty races but an estimated 400 have resigned in fear 
and government officials expect many more to withdraw before 
election day 
so far this year the rebels have slain 45 mayors they also have 
killed 73 local judges clerks councilmen and municipal candidates 
in october 22 local authorities were slain a total of 330 
people died in armed clashes and political violence one of the 
highest monthly tolls since the shining path launched its 
insurgency to topple perus elected government 
shining path seeks to install a workers and peasants state 
patterned on the ideas of the late chairman mao tsetung of china 
political analysts and counterinsurgency experts agree that the 
rebels campaign to disrupt the municipal elections is only the 
first stage of their strategy to block the presidential election in 
april and provoke a military coup 
shining paths strategy then most likely would be to place 
itself in the vanguard of a popular front against a military 
dictatorship 
publicly the populist government of president alan garcia has 
guaranteed that municipal elections will take place throughout peru 
but privately a close garcia aide speaking in lima on condition 
he not be identified said the truth is we are not in a position 
to guarantee the normal course of elections i wonder how many 
people are going to be able to vote 
he said peru would need 300000 policemen not the 75000 it 
has to provide aroundtheclock protection to current authorities 
and all municipal candidates 
national election board officials are focusing their efforts on 
guaranteeing that voting takes place in a normal fashion in lima 
and other major cities where most of perus population of 21 
million is concentrated 
a third of the national territory is under states of emergency 
that suspend constitutional guarantees and give the military broad 
powers to fight guerrillas 
it is in those areas that the elections are most in doubt but 
many critics of government policy say the contested regions cannot 
be written off if peru is going to defend its democratic system 
here in andajes situated on the dome of an 11000foot 
mountain people feel the government has knowingly let them pass 
into the shining paths domain 
andajes is only 90 miles north of lima in a straight line but a 
sixhour ride over bumpy roads that rise from the mistshrouded 
desert coast and climb the empty western slopes of the andes 
with its 2000 inhabitants its narrow cobblestone lanes and its 
mudbrick houses andajes never received much attention in lima 
but now the villagers feel totally abandoned 
the people live with the fear that sendero will return said 
village elder ruben torres 
the 16man police detachment sent to andajes after its officials 
were killed withdrew in june to the town of churin an hours drive 
away at the foot of the mountain 
most people did not sleep that first night said nancy 
jiron a government health worker assigned to andajes they 
gathered in small groups and waited for daybreak they began to 
realize they would have to accept being alone again

an accident at a governmentowned 
nuclear production plant triggered a release of radioactive 
hydrogen wednesday contaminating four workers and sending the gas 
into the atmosphere 
richard neff manager of environmental health and safety at the 
mound nuclear production plant called the release of tritium minor 
but said it was the largest such release at the southwestern ohio 
plant since the 1960s 
he said it was 10 times what is normally released at the plant 
each year 
its a relatively small release neff said at a news 
conference we dont believe we had a significant amount that 
went up 
the tritium was vented into an exhaust stack and released into 
the air taking a projected northwesterly path miamisburg is about 
10 miles southwest of dayton 
plant officials initially estimated that in the worstcase 
scenario a few dozen residents may have been exposed to 12 
millirems of tritium the equivalent of one chest xray 
however plant spokesman howard charbeneau later said an 
investigation revealed that the maximum offsite dosage was 0051 
millirems he said a person flying in a plane across the country 
would be exposed to 3 millirems 
the us environmental protection agencys standard of safe 
dosage is 25 millirems a year 
the plant produces detonators for nuclear weapons and propulsion 
systems for spacecraft 
the accident occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar 
containing tritium shattered workers were evacuated from the 
building 
harold anderson manager of tritium technology and surveillance 
said 52 workers were in the area when the accident occurred he 
said six of them had contamination on their clothing 
of those six four were found to have tritium in their system 
neff said half the tritium will pass through a persons body in 
12 days 
its relatively lowrisk compared to most radioactive 
material he said 
about 2200 workers are employed at the plant operated by egampg 
mound applied technologies for the us department of energy

hay tainted with parts of rabbits caught in 
harvesting machinery caused the deaths of at least 15 horses in 
southern california according to veterinarians 
veterinarians investigating the deaths say the rabbits may have 
been caught in machinery at a farm in utah then shredded and 
pressed into cubes of hay at a processing plant in suburban 
paramount 
toxin secreted by the parts produced a rare strain of botulism 
known as clostridium botulinum type c dr hailu kinde of 
california veterinary diagnostic laboratory systems told a news 
conference at the orange county fairgrounds 
the strain common in aquatic birds mink dogs and cats last 
affected horses 10 years ago in florida kinde said 
the laboratory at the university of california davis made the 
discovery this week while testing hay cubes that were part of a 
batch consumed by the affected horses he said 
seven horses died at the orange county fairgrounds equestrian

tumbleweeds tossed by 50mph winds buried 
houses in this missouri river town and residents struggled to dig 
out of the prickly problem 
the mayor warned residents who had tumbleweeds up to their 
chimneys to clear them to reduce the danger of fire 
the weeds had grown thick all summer along the banks of the 
droughtshrunken oahe reservoir in northcentral south dakota 
winds out of the west tuesday evening sent the weeds rolling across 
the prairie 
people in the west end of town as they were sitting in their 
homes heard what sounded like rocks being thrown against their 
houses larry atkinson publisher of the mobridge tribune said 
wednesday 
they came out this morning to find out that a number of houses 
were buried literally buried with tumbleweeds we had some homes 
with only the roof sticking out 
we had people that could not get out of their driveways 
atkinson said we had streets that were blocked literally 
invaded by tumbleweeds 
mayor darrell bender urged residents to help clean up the mess 
city crews cleared the brush from the streets so vehicles could 
pass the cleanup was continuing today 
its developing into what could be a very dangerous 
situation bender said we need to use extreme caution id 
like to tell people not to drive through those tumbleweeds those 
that have homes that are covered up to their chimneys get those 
weeds cleared so they dont start a fire 
bender said he had asked the us army corps of engineers which 
manages the reservoir system to help in the cleanup 
i personally feel they have a responsibility for those 
weeds he said they have done nothing to control the weeds 
theyre 6 feet tall down there were going to have this problem 
every time we have a west wind i had advised them previously that 
they had large weeds down there and i was worried about what was 
going to happen 
phone calls by the associated press to the corps went unanswered 
late wednesday 
atkinson said removing the tumbleweeds will be difficult 
nobody knows for sure what to do with them he said you 
cant crush them all you can really do is move them around 
he said the corps planned to conduct a controlled burn to remove 
some of the remaining weeds 
it was the strangest thing ive ever seen atkinson said 
weve been buried with snow before up in this area but this is 
the first time anybody can remember being buried with tumbleweeds

l douglas wilders apparent victory in the virginia governors 
race is a watershed in american political history in which black 
politicians have had but a shadowy presence 
wilder would be the nations first elected black governor but 
would not be the first black american to serve as governor 
that distinction belongs to pinckney benton stewart pinchback 
who became governor of louisiana following the impeachment of henry 
clay warmoth in 1872 he served for 43 days until the newly elected 
william pitt kellogg was sworn in 
although any number of candidates could have been drawn from the 
small black middle class that had existed in the nation since its 
founding a black was not elected to office until 1855 when john 
mercer langston was elected clerk of brownhelm township in lorain 
county ohio 
the first blacks ever elected to a legislative body were edward 
g walker son of abolitionist david walker and charles l 
mitchell who won seats in the massachusetts house of 
representatives in 1866 
most of the nations first black elected officials won their 
positions during reconstruction the postcivil war period in 
which southern states were reorganized so they could rejoin the 
union blacks were allowed to vote for the first time and seek 
elected office 
it was a time when robert h wood became mayor of natchez 
miss and joseph h rainey of south carolina became the first 
black in the house of representatives 
hiram r revels a minister succeeded jefferson davis as us 
senator from mississippi on feb 25 1870 thus becoming first 
black in congress but blanche k bruce also from mississippi was 
the first black to serve a full term in the senate 
pinchback the son of a mississippi planter and a black woman 
had been a captain in the union army following the civil war he 
settled in louisiana and joined the republican party which largely 
consisted of newly franchised blacks and sympathetic and liberal 
whites 
a shrewd and ambitious man he was elected to the state senate 
in 1868 and was named president pro tempore when oscar j dunn a 
former slave and the nations first black lieutenant governor 
died pinchback moved to the no 2 spot through constitutional 
succession 
there were other black lieutenant governors during 
reconstruction in mississippi and south carolina but none was ever 
elected governor 
wilder too served as a lieutenant governor in a southern 
state but in virigina at the end of the 20th century he is part 
of the political mainstream 
pinchback was something of a pariah even as an elected 
official he and his family faced racism his children had to be 
escorted to high school to protect them from mobs of bigoted white 
youths and because of his elegance intelligence and ambition 
white politicians considered him dangerous 
his attempt to run for governor was thwarted because whites 
controlled the election machinery and blacks were divided he 
instead ran for the us house of representatives and was elected 
he also ran for the us senate and was elected in 1873 but after 
three years of debate the senate refused to seat him 
i demand simple justice pinchback told the senate i do 
not care so far as i am personally concerned whether you give me my 
seat or not i will go back to my people and come here again but i 
tell you to preserve your own consistency do not make fish of me 
while you make flesh of everybody else 
pinchbacks case drew attention from the national press said 
the new york commercial advertiser pinchbacks presence in the 
us senate is not open to the smallest objection except the old 
bourbon warwhoops of color 
mr pinchback is the best dressed southern man we have had in 
congress from the south since the days when gentlemen were 
democrats

only president bushs promised signature is 
needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade 
following congress lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to 
425 by april 1991 
the measure which includes a subminimum wage for teenagers 
new to the job market cleared the senate on an 898 vote 
wednesday exactly a week after it passed the house by an equally 
overwhelming vote of 38237 
bush who struck the compromise plan with congressional 
democrats last week is expected to sign the bill before 
thanksgiving perhaps as early as next week 
the nineyear logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said after the senate vote the 
working poor are about to receive an increase although it is not 
as much as they deserve 
labor secretary elizabeth dole speaking for the bush 
administration said the 3 million american workers currently on 
the minimum wage will benefit but she said skills training was 
the best way to help the working poor and urged congress to move 
ahead with legislation dealing with that issue 
the minimum wage is not the pulley to pull people out of 
poverty she said 
the compromise plan will push the minimum wage 335 an hour 
since january 1981 to 380 on april 1 and to 425 a year later 
at the same time it will create a new lower wage for 16 to 
19yearold workers who are new to the job market 
democrats and organized labor long have opposed such a 
subminimum training wage but were forced to concede that point 
to bush to strike the deal in return bush agreed to have the 
minimum wage reach 425 nine months earlier than he had proposed 
and also accepted a far more restrictive training wage than he 
sought earlier this year 
labor played down its concessions in calling on bush to quickly 
sign the measure into law 
americas poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a 
raise and this longoverdue step will give them a chance to lift 
themselves and their families out of poverty aflcio president 
lane kirkland said 
even as they praised bush for agreeing to the compromise 
democrats said they would seek another increase heading into the 
1992 presidential elections when bush likely will be seeking a 
second term 
both sides made significant concessions to reach the compromise 
four months after bush vetoed an earlier democratic minimumwage 
plan 
in addition to agreeing to a subminimum democrats and labor 
scaled back their final minimumwage target the measure bush 
vetoed called for an increase to 455 an hour 
the white house under increasing pressure from gop lawmakers 
seeking to avoid another veto battle heading into 1990 elections 
year agreed to a timetable reaching the 425 level nine months 
before bush had proposed 
bush also accepted a training wage that can only be paid to 
workers 16 to 19 years old for their first three months of work 
experience and for another three months if certified training is 
provided the provision allowing the subminimum expires in april 
1993 
under the plan the subminimum wage will be 335 on april 1 and 
361 a year later 
bush wanted to allow the lower wage to be paid to all workers 
regardless of age for their first six months on any new job 
regardless of past work experience 
all eight senators voting against the measure were republicans 
they were sens william armstrong of colorado hatch and jake garn 
of utah jesse helms of north carolina gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire connie mack of florida don nickles of oklahoma and 
steve symms of idaho three senators did not vote max baucus 
dmont spark matsunaga dhawaii and malcolm wallop rwyo

thrift regulator m danny wall is issuing a 
warning to weak savings and loan institutions find a merger 
partner or face regulatory action 
thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave 
jeopardy wall told the us league of savings institutions on 
wednesday in closing its annual convention 
his agency the office of thrift supervision estimates that 800 
of the nations 2600 solvent sampls will fall nearly 20 billion 
short of new more stringent capital standards taking effect dec 7 
the agency believes 223 of the 800 are practically hopeless and 
within a year will join 260 failed institutions already under 
government control another segment of the 800 will meet the new 
standard and stay independent by retaining earnings or selling 
assets wall said 
but about 300 will stay out of the governments hands only by 
seeking a private merger partner wall said his agency stands ready 
to help by finding suitors including foreign firms and commercial 
banks starting with a special conference next week 
we are calling this our arranged marriage program he said 
the new rules require sampl owners to back their lending with more 
of their own capital and are designed to provide a larger buffer of 
private money between sampl losses and government deposit insurance 
funds they are considered the cornerstone reform in sampl bailout 
legislation enacted aug 9 
wall warned weak thrifts not to be too choosy about merger 
offers adding we will not hesitate to take regulatory action 
go with what youve got not with the would have and could 
have or it will be too late to find a merger partner he said 
under the bailout bill thrifts not meeting capital standards by 
the end of 1994 face closure and walls agency is writing rules 
that would permit it to seize an undercapitalized thrift early 
before its owners investment is exhausted 
one sampl executive robert duncan chairman of magnolia federal 
bank for savings of hattiesburg miss said some of his colleagues 
at weaker thrifts havent yet admitted they cant survive alone 
there are a great number of people out there who are unwilling 
to face it but its going to be difficult to face the siren 
call of merger with a commercial bank he said 
wall cited recent interest by canadian and japanese companies as 
evidence of the thrift industrys positive outlook 
the worst is really over we have been through the fire and 
emerged tempered by the experience he said 
in his speech wall did not mention the controversy swirling 
around his agencys handling of the failure of lincoln savings and 
loan association of irvine calif expected to cost taxpayers up 
to 2 billion 
however at a news conference he defended his decision to delay 
seizure of lincoln by nearly two years saying he was legally 
required to keep it open unless it was insolvent the staff of the 
house banking committee disputes that assertion maintaining that 
wall need only have determined that lincoln was operating unsafely 
and dissipating its assets 
we were advised at the time we did not have the legal basis 
to seize lincoln it was the best advice we could find he said

outrage over the exxon valdez oil spill helped 
lead to the houses vote to let the states continue setting 
unlimited liability for oil spill cleanups environmentalists say 
but the oil industry says the measure approved wednesday could 
do more harm than good to the environment and raise consumer fuel 
costs 
it was clear that the exxon valdez was such a national insult 
to the environment that all the lobbying by the oil companies and 
special interests couldnt overcome it said rep george miller 
dcalif 
mike matz of the sierra club said the spill demonstrated there 
were some serious deficiencies in the bill as it was originally 
written 
miller and rep gerry studds dmass successfully inserted an 
amendment into a massive oil liability bill that allowed stricter 
state laws despite strong oil industry opposition and several 
attempts on the house floor to soften the measure the measure 
would track current law which also allows states to set stricter 
liability limits 
the house was scheduled to vote on the entire bill today but 
the key vote was on the millerstudds amendment which passed 
279143 
we are dismayed and distressed that the house has taken this 
gigantic step backward in environmental protection said a 
statement issued by the american petroleum institute after the vote 
unless altered by conference committee action we must 
strongly urge that the president veto this legislation the 
industry lobbying organization said 
the group said that allowing states to go beyond federal limits 
on the amount a company should spend for oil spill cleanup will 
make insurance costs for hauling oil prohibitive 
if the houses plan is adopted into law many responsible 
transporters of oil will likely be driven out of business and 
replaced by less financially responsible and capable shippers 
said the institute 
operators involved in transportation of petroleum products may 
feel its not worth the legal risks rep norman lent rny 
said during debate on the amendment home heating oil may 
suddenly disappear 
a 2 billion price tag has been put on the exxon valdez cleanup 
in alaska that state sets no limits on companies liability for 
repairing environmental damage 
the house bill would limit oil companies liability to 1200 
per gross ton with a minimum of 10 million for large tankers and 
2 million for small tankers however it would let states set 
higher limits the senate has passed similar legislation 
twentyeight states now have their own oil spill liability 
statutes and 19 of them require unlimited liability 
studds accused the oil industry of using scare tactics 
make no mistake studds said when it comes to state 
preemption and the oil industry the battle lines are clearly 
drawn between those who are hurt by oil spills and those who cause 
them between the public interest and a narrow private interest 
between the average citizen and big oil 
environmentalists were surprised at the size of the vote in 
their favor especially on a second miller amendment that makes an 
oil company or carrier liable for unlimited damages in cases of 
simple negligence rather than gross negligence as the original 
measure required that amendment which had been expected to be 
defeated passed 213 to 207 
what it means is that the highpriced lobbyists that the oil 
companies brought in dont always do the trick said joe mehrkens 
of the wilderness society 
the house for 14 years has repeatedly passed bills against 
allowing states to preempt the federal law

abortion opponents acknowledging the issue 
helped democrats win this weeks elections blame their own 
candidates for wavering in their antiabortion positions but 
defections already are beginning 
the lesson that will be learned said david osteen 
executive director of the national right to life committee is 
that prolife candidates cannot waffle and prolife candidates must 
run as aggressively on this issue as proabortion candidates 
an issue that once had democrats on the run abortion emerged as 
a decisive factor in democratic victories following a political 
turnabout that republicans couldnt foresee just a few months ago 
republican national chairman lee atwater conceded the issue 
made a difference in tuesdays elections 
i think the abortion issue helped me considerably democrat 
l douglas wilder said after claiming victory in his bid to become 
governor of virginia against antiabortion republican marshall 
coleman 
sen robert packwood of oregon a leader of the prochoice 
minority in the republican party said the gop faces losses next 
year if it sticks to the antiabortion position in its platform 
i would hope that some of these elections yesterday might 
bring us to our senses and we would understand that the public is 
not on our side on this issue he said after a meeting with 
president bush on the election results 
some republicans already are signing up on the prochoice side 
in massachusetts gop gubernatorial candidate william weld and a 
number of gop state legislators joined democrats in signing a 
petition wednesday seeking a state constitutional amendment 
guaranteeing the right to abortion 
weld predicted differences over abortion could decide the 
primary race against his gop rival state house minority leader 
steven pierce 
osteen said republican losers james courter in the new jersey 
governors race and rudolph giuliani in the new york mayoral race 
sealed their defeats weeks ahead by giving ground in their 
opposition to abortion 
the national right to life committee had abandoned both before 
the election he said 
they flipflopped because they were scared said osteen 
the antiabortion group blamed colemans strategists for failing 
to aggressively defend against wilders ads attacking him on the 
abortion issue and failing to forcefully push his antiabortion 
views in ads of his own 
this is not a loss for the prolife movement it is a loss for 
marshall coleman and the way he handled it said sandra faucher 
director of the right to life groups political action committee 
coleman refused to concede after the unofficial final vote count 
showed him trailing wilder by about 5500 votes out of the nearly 
18 million cast 
abortion rights activists claimed partial credit for the 
election of democrat james florio in new jersey and david dinkins 
victory in new york 
both the new york and virginia races also were caught up in the 
potent and sometimes unspoken political crosscurrents of race 
dinkins and wilder are black and while winning electoral 
majorities ran well behind what polling had indicated 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said there was no question that wilder 
would not have won without the abortion issue 
she said courters candidacy never got off the ground because of 
his antiabortion position and that his attempts to soften his 
opposition further hurt him 
voters yesterday proved that choice is a winning issue in 
america michelman said to politicians everywhere we say with 
conviction if youre out of touch with the prochoice majority 
youre out of office 
if george bush and members of his party remain beholden to the 
antichoice minority they will pay a tremendous price at the 
polls she said 
political analysts said the apparent turnaround on abortion was 
the direct result of the supreme courts decision in july in the 
webster case in it the court gave states broader discretion in 
regulating abortion and created the impression that major reversals 
of abortion rights were possible 
the courts action invigorated supporters of abortion rights and 
created an opportunity for prochoice candidates to exploit concern 
about a retreat in abortion rights

six people have been executed in the southwestern 
city of chengdu for participating in riots in june when the 
government crushed the prodemocracy movement a local official 
said today 
the executions brought to at least 18 the number of people put 
to death following the military crackdown on demonstrators in 
beijing and other cities two people already had been reported 
executed in chengdu for roles in three days of rioting that began 
june 4 when troops killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in beijing 
and police in chengdu tried to break up a student sitin 
an estimated 30 people died in the chengdu violence and an 
entire city block including a large department store was burned 
down it was the worst outbreak of violence in any city outside 
beijing 
the six in chengdu were sentenced to death at a public rally 
tuesday and immediately executed said an official of chengdus 
foreign affairs office 
three were charged with beating smashing looting and 
burning during the violence the other three were charged with 
theft and murder 
at least 12 other people have been put to death for direct 
involvement in antigovernment demonstrations and riots throughout 
china last spring 
none of the previous 12 were students and it was not clear 
whether there were any students among the six executed in chengdu 
this week 
chinas press rarely reports arrests or court cases involving 
the studentled prodemocracy movement reports that student 
leaders and soldiers who refused to cooperate in the military 
crackdown in beijing have been executed cannot be confirmed 
executions in china are usually by a bullet to the back of the 
head as the person sentenced kneels on the ground

shortline railroads bus service feeder 
airlines and maybe a ferry or two could be possible under 
longrange strategy mapped out in an agriculture department report 
on rural transportation 
but massive new federal aid to help finance such ventures none 
was mentioned in the report cooperation at all public and private 
levels was urged as the key to transportation development 
martin f buzz fitzpatrick jr head of the departments 
office of transportation which issued the report wednesday said 
the findings and recommendations were based on regional meetings 
going back two years and a national conference in omaha neb in 
aug 1988 
from the very beginning this initiative has been a 
cooperative activity involving a wide range of public and private 
agencies seeking solutions to the transportation problems of rural 
residents he said 
fitzpatrick added the report will give rural transportation 
organizations a practical guide to help in planning and policy 
development at national state and local levels 
although no specific mode was recommended over another the 
report referred to passenger transportation generically 
meaning it could include rail bus or air travel depending on the 
circumstances 
the report said cooperation between public and private sectors 
is essential if rural passenger transportation is to meet the 
mobility needs of rural residents and that new approaches must be 
found 
in mobilizing support for rural passenger transportation the 
report said a national plan for rural communities to maintain and 
expand passenger transportation should be a top priority for action 
communities are an essential source of financial and volunteer 
support for rural passenger transportation providers the report 
said effective community participation can generate support for 
continued intercity bus service and provide financial and volunteer 
support for rural public providers 
the report said rural passenger needs are so diverse that a 
single source of funding cannot be relied upon 
funding needs to be a joint federal state and local 
government effort in conjunction with private industry it said 
utilizing a broad range of funding sources and allowing greater 
flexibility in mixing available funding can provide more mobility 
to more rural residents

total us vegetable output this year is up 
from the droughtreduced 1988 production an agriculture department 
report said 
the overall increase is due mostly to a 29 percent boost in 
processing vegetable tonnage and a 3 percent larger potato harvest 
production of processing vegetables is estimated at nearly 15 
million tons while potato output is estimated at around 370 
million hundredweight the output of fresh vegetables in 1989 is 
expected to be up 1 percent mushrooms 14 percent sweet potatoes 
7 percent and dry edible beans 29 percent 
despite the strong increase in us vegetable production the 
value of us vegetable imports is expected to be up by about 5 
percent to a record level the report said wednesday 
growth in imports during 1989 stemmed from continued strong 
prices at the wholesale and retail levels and continued strong 
consumer demand the report said most of the imports are fresh 
vegetables which are brought in during the winter months when us 
production is limited to the southerntier states 
per capita use of total vegetables rose to an estimated 336 
pounds in 1988 up one pound despite droughtreduced domestic 
supplies in general increases in fresh vegetables potatoes and 
mushrooms offset declines among processed items 
fresh vegetable use reached 100 pounds per capita for the first 
time because of larger use of lettuce and onions the report said 
potato use rose from 49 pounds in 1987 to 55 pounds in 1988 
this gain can be attributed entirely to large carryover stocks of 
fresh potatoes the report said use of frozen potatoes dropped 
4 percent to 44 pounds as record exports reduced the domestic 
supply

a comparison of the voting records in 
environment cases of judges appointed by presidents carter and 
reagan supports the theory that a presidents most lasting impact 
may result from his judicial selections 
law professor william e kovacic said his findings may be 
especially significant if president bush chooses judges of the same 
cast of mind as those appointed by reagan in eight years reagan 
named 347 or 47 percent of the nations active federal judges 
who serve life terms 
by the end of bushs term in 1992 kovacic noted reaganbush 
nominees could account for as many as 75 percent of all federal 
court of appeals judges 
when reaganbush judges constitute that big a majority kovacic 
noted they might be inclined over time to endorse more extreme 
positions in writing majority opinions because they wont feel 
compelled to achieve consensus with more moderate judges 
in a telephone interview wednesday kovacic said everyone knows 
about the impact of a presidents choices for supreme court 
vacancies but the same kind of effects though not quite so 
dramatic can result from whom he picks for the district and 
circuit courts 
of all the tools at a presidents disposal this is an 
important one he said if you want to make your policies 
outlive your administration this is one of the most important 
means for doing that 
kovacics analysis was published by the washington legal 
foundation a conservative research organization kovacic teaches 
at george mason university in virginia 
he studied how appeals court judges voted on environmental cases 
arising from enactment of the clean air and clean water acts 
in 162 cases in which reagan and carter appointees cast 254 
votes he found that carters judges voted 54 percent of the time 
to increase the regulatory burden on those whose pollution emission 
or discharge activities were under consideration judges appointed 
by reagan voted that way 43 percent of the time 
on the key district of columbia circuit court of appeals often 
called the countrys second most important court the differences 
were sharper carter appointees voted 48 percent of the time to 
increase the pollutionfighting burden of parties before the court 
while reagan judges voted that way only half as often 
the results are not entirely clearcut kovacic concluded 
noting that when carter and reagan judges sat on the same panel 
they rarely disagreed it nonetheless appears that the reagan 
appointments on the whole succeeded in bringing less 
interventionminded judges to the courts of appeals 
the tendencies of judges are particularly important kovacic 
said in regulatory issues where congress often gives an 
administrative body like the environmental protection agency 
broad authority to implement comparatively general statutes and the 
courts find themselves overseeing their work 
other studies have reached the same conclusion about the 
longterm impact of judicial selections sheldon goldman political 
scientist at the university of massachusetts wrote last summer 
that the real impact of reagans appointments will reach into the 
21st century and likely will be reinforced by bushs judges 
for civil libertarians this means that when the country 
celebrates the bicentennial of the ratification of the bill of 
rights in 1991 the courts will be dominated by those hostile to a 
liberal reading of those rights goldman wrote for judicial 
conservatives this means a healthy return to government by the 
elected representatives of the people 
kovacic noted speculation that substantial numbers of 
reaganappointed judges younger than average and often with 
collegeage children may quit the bench for the higher earning 
potential of law practice especially if congress doesnt raise 
judges salaries 
the real test of whether the reaganbush appointments will 
have longlasting effects depends on whether the people they have 
selected will remain in those jobs he said

facing a jan 1 deadline the bush 
administration is planning to carry out a key personnel change 
required by the panama canal treaties without violating its policy 
of avoiding contact with the panamanian government officials say 
the treaties say that as of the new year the us government 
commission which runs the canal must be headed by a panamanian for 
the first time in the 75year history of the waterway 
they also specify the panamanian government must nominate the 
administrator and the us president appoint him subject to senate 
confirmation 
but the administration has refused to consider the nominee of 
the panamanian government carlos duque he was the official 
presidential candidate in the may elections that were annulled by 
panamanian authorities amid widespread allegations of fraud 
the administration while promising to abide by the treaties 
has made it clear that it wont consider any nominee proposed by 
panama on grounds that the country has no legitimate government 
the administration doesnt recognize francisco rodriguez the 
handpicked crony of gen manuel antonio noriega who was sworn in as 
unelected president sept 1 
us officials said the dilemma is expected to be resolved by 
allowing the deputy administrator of the panama canal commission 
fernando manfredo to take charge jan 1 
as the officials see it the ploy does not follow the letter of 
the treaties but complies with the spirit in that manfredos 
accession ensures that management of the canal will be in the hands 
of a panamanian 
in effect the post of administrator would be unfilled and 
manfredo would serve as acting chief until an elected government 
takes office in panama the administration plan was first disclosed 
in a sunday new york times column by flora lewis 
administration congressional and diplomatic sources all 
insisting on anonymity gave manfredo high marks for his 
performance in his 10 years as deputy administrator 
his ability to run the canal is unquestioned said one 
congressional source 
what is not clear is whether manfredo will go along with a plan 
that not only departs from the letter of the treaties but that also 
could leave him open to charges by noriega of acquiescing in an 
antipanamanian gambit 
administration and congressional sources said manfredo has been 
approached about taking over as acting administrator but has not 
responded 
he is a former commerce minister under the late panamanian 
strongman omar torrijos and is said to harbor antinoriega 
sentiments 
the current administrator of the canal commission is dennis 
mcauliffe a former commander of us military forces in panama who 
has held his present job for 10 years 
he will step down by jan 1 consistent with the treaties and 
an american will be appointed to the deputy administrators post 
the transfer of power to panama will be completed at the end of the 
century when panama assumes full control of the canal 
noriega who is wanted in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges has said the us campaign against him is part of a plot 
to evade compliance with the canal treaties

the national endowment for the arts is 
refusing to pay 10000 in previously promised support for a new 
york city gallerys aids art show on the ground that it might 
violate a new federal antiobscenity law 
artists space the private manhattan arts institution that is 
sponsoring the exhibition notified nea chairman john e frohnmayer 
on wednesday that its 23member board had unanimously rejected his 
request to relinquish the taxpaid grant 
in response frohnmayer said the endowment will withhold the 
10000 in grant money pending a legal opinion from the justice 
department 
we havent paid out the funds and we dont intend to do so 
frohnmayer said in a telephone interview 
he also moved to disassociate the nea from the aids show in a 
nov 3 letter to susan wyatt executive director of artists space 
frohnmayer asked the gallery to publish this disclaimer the 
national endowment for the arts has not supported this exhibition 
or its catalog 
ms wyatt said the gallery board was taking a stand against 
censorship and selfcensorship in refusing to relinquish the 
grant 
all of the works in the show are valid artworks she said in 
a telephone interview from new york we believe this is a show 
that should be funded by the endowment 
the gallerys application for an endowment grant for the 30000 
show was approved in may by the nea which notified the gallery of 
the award in july 
that was before congress passed the antiobscenity law last 
month at the urging of sen jesse helms rnc helms and other 
congressional conservatives had protested two previous endowment 
grants totaling 45000 for exhibitions of controversial art by 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano 
in response to the new york gallerys decision frohnmayer said 
in a telephone interview that the 10000 grant would be withheld 
because a review of the exhibition catalog made clear that the 
nature of the show had changed from an artistic focus to a 
political focus 
ms wyatt denied the charge this is not a show about 
politics she said its a show about aids 
the 30000 show which is scheduled to open at artists space on 
nov 16 features works by 23 painters sculptors and photographers 
that attempt to portray the effects of aids on the artistic 
community 
ms wyatt said the show includes a few images of male and female 
nudity and deals with sexuality in the context of aids 
although that is not the primary emphasis some of it might be 
homoerotic but i dont know she said 
the new law forbids federal support for works that may be 
considered obscene by the chairman of the endowment an 
independent federal agency that spent 156 million in tax funds 
last year in the form of matching grants to 4600 artists and arts 
institutions 
frohnmayer said he primarily objected to portions of the shows 
catalog which he said contained very hostile angry and 
accusatory statements and very politically pointed commentary 
about helms and other critics of controversial art and the aids 
cause 
in his letter to ms wyatt frohnmayer said that given our 
recent review and the current political climate i believe that 
the use of endowment funds to exhibit or publish this work is in 
violation of the spirit of the congressional directive 
he said that certain texts photographs and other 
representations in the exhibition may offend the language of the 
new law 
because of the recent criticism the endowment has come under 
and the seriousness of congress directive we must all work 
together to ensure that projects funded by the endowment do not 
violate either the spirit or the letter of the law frohnmayer 
wrote 
the message has been clearly and strongly conveyed to us that 
congress means business

retired air force maj gen richard secord 
awaiting sentencing on his guilty plea to an irancontra charge 
promises to cooperate with the prosecution of other defendants such 
as john m poindexter 
secord pleaded guilty wednesday to one count of lying to 
congress and agreed to cooperate fully with prosecutors in 
later cases in exchange for a government promise to seek dismissal 
of 11 other criminal charges against him 
poindexter whose criminal trial is to begin jan 22 is accused 
of conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of 
making false statements 
secord has not yet spoken with government prosecutors and it 
remains to be seen what information he has to offer said 
prosecutor reid weingarten the secord case was to have gone to 
trial on monday 
secord the irancontra middleman enlisted by national security 
council aide oliver north admitted to us district court judge 
aubrey robinson that he made a false statement on june 10 1987 
when he denied to congressional investigators that he gave anything 
of benefit to north 
poindexter has said he met with gen secord i guess my whole 
time in the white house maybe three or four times 
one of those times was in january 1986 when poindexter said the 
two discussed secords role in assisting upcoming arms shipments to 
iran 
just two months earlier secord had been involved at norths 
request in the ciaassisted shipment of hawk missiles from israel 
to iran the presidential finding legalizing the cias involvement 
in the shipment was written after the hawks were transported 
it is unclear whether secord and poindexter discussed the 
previous shipments in january 
poindexter the former national security adviser is accused of 
lying by telling members of congress in a closed meeting that he 
didnt learn until january 1986 that the november 1985 shipment 
contained hawks 
north had sent poindexter a status report on the november 1985 
shipment just before it took place 
regarding assisting the contras i was aware that dick secord 
was going to essentially set up and run a private logistics 
organization poindexter told congress 2 years ago 
poindexter said he knew that overcharges on the sale of arms to 
iran would go into one of the accounts that gen secord had that 
he would then use to purchase arms to support the contras 
but poindexter said that when he met with secord it was for 
mainly what i would categorize as handholding col north 
was always telling me that he thought dick was losing money 
secord paid the bill in 1986 for a security system at norths 
home 7000 in cash and 9000 drawn on a us bank from profits 
of the enterprise the maze of companies and secret swiss bank 
accounts secord and his business partner albert hakim used in the 
irancontra affair 
hakim is charged with two counts involving gratuities that were 
to be paid to north as well as alleged conspiracy government theft 
and wire fraud 
secord could face up to five years in prison on the false 
statement plea the judge who asked both sides for court filings 
on whether maximum fines applicable under the law are 10000 or 
250000 set no date for sentencing 
to date four people including secord have pleaded guilty to 
various crimes in the irancontra affair north is appealing his 
jury conviction of three felonies and trials are pending for 
poindexter secords business partner hakim and former cia station 
chief joseph fernandez

after technically violating its own rules for 
years the house is moving to give its speaker full access to the 
nations most sensitive secrets in files and hearings of the house 
intelligence committee 
under house rules no classified information can be given to 
anyone who is not a member of the intelligence panel without a vote 
of the committee and without a record being kept of the information 
and to whom it is given 
but over the years speakers of the house who are not members 
of the committee have apparently been given informal briefings on 
government secrets said rep henry hyde of illinois the senior 
republican on the committee 
of course because those rules were not adhered to few 
members of the committee were aware of some of these instances and 
perhaps no one knows how many times this has occurred hyde said 
in testimony tuesday before the rules committee 
the rules panel moved to change the rules and give house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash and his successors blanket access to the 
intelligence committees business the matter is expected to come 
before the full house next week 
hyde said he favors the rules change which has been proposed by 
committee chairman anthony beilenson dcalif 
the issue was given prominence last year when former speaker jim 
wright dtexas disclosed to reporters that the central 
intelligence agency had sought to foment civil unrest in nicaragua 
to undermine the political stability of the leftist sandinista 
government 
sources later said that the information had come to the 
intelligence committee and had been relayed to wright through an 
informal briefing 
the matter has arisen again in connection with the publication 
of a new book on wright the ambition and the power by 
washington writer john barry which is due in bookstores this 
month the book refers to a nicaraguan political assessment of 
congress intercepted by us intelligence and disclosed to the 
house intelligence committee 
the book asserts that wright learned of the document in a 
briefing from rep louis stokes dohio then the chairman of the 
intelligence panel 
hyde mentioned the passage from the book when he testified 
before the rules committee and argued for additional changes to 
toughen security his suggestions included shrinking the committee 
from its current 19 members to 13 requiring members and staff to 
take a secrecy oath and requiring both members and staff to 
undergo security clearances 
all of hydes suggested changes were rejected by the panel 
mostly along party lines 
foley who took an active interest in intelligence matters when 
he was a member of the panel as house majority leader ran into 
problems when he sought to continue his contacts with the committee 
after he succeeded wright as speaker earlier this year 
republican members objected that a foley staff member michael 
j oneil was being given full access to intelligence information 
and feared it would lead to other requests for access outside of 
house rules 
i think the speaker has a constitutional right to any 
information that is in the possession of any member of congress or 
any committee of congress foley said tuesday he said he 
believed when he was a member of the panel that it was his 
obligation to provide wright with any information he requested 
if there is any member of congress who should be fully 
informed on matters within the purview of the intelligence 
committee it is the speaker first foley said

the governors of 16 states are being told to 
tighten state air quality requirements and bring 36 urban areas 
into compliance with federal clean air standards 
the directive stems from findings earlier this year that 
revealed the 36 areas were in violation of federal air quality 
standards bringing the number of such areas exceeding the 
standards to 102 
under the federal clean air act states are responsible for 
developing air quality plans so that urban areas meet federal ozone 
and carbon monoxide pollution standards 
the list of urban areas found in violation were released last 
july 
in a letter to the 16 governors the epa said the states would 
have one year to develop a first phase improved air quality 
compliance plan this could include tighter enforcement of existing 
state pollution control regulations and the adoption of additional 
regulations already planned but not yet put into effect said epa 
spokesman dave ryan 
the agency noted these actions should be pursued despite an 
expectation that congress will soon enact a new federal clean air 
law that likely will impose stiffer pollution control requirements 
the 16 states contacted with urban areas non in compliance in 
parenthesis were 
new york albanyschenectadytroy area buffaloniagara

be in moscow in january one in a us city in the spring leading 
to an exchange of pageant queens 
it is being organized by the slavic american cultural 
association in new york

a new debate over the use of vouchers for 
childrens programs is ensnarling a lastditch effort by house and 
senate negotiators to salvage a child care bill before congress 
adjourns this year 
sen orrin hatch rutah insisted wednesday that states be 
allowed to issue vouchers to parents for both a new preschool 
education program and new before and afterschool care services 
that would be established in the legislation 
hatch who has encountered wrath from the bush administration 
and conservative groups for joining with liberals on child care 
standards also wants governors to have more discretion on how the 
new money is spent 
this is it for child care he told house negotiators if 
we cant put this together then its going to go down the drain 
the vouchers which are supported by the administration would 
effectively allow a portion of the new aid to flow through parents 
to churches and parochial schools which provide child care services 
most liberal democrats with support from unionized teachers and 
other public employees want the money to instead go directly to 
care providers they succeeded in getting a large portion of the 
funds in both senate and house versions devoted to making public 
schools become day care centers for socalled latchkey children 
of working parents 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif an adamant opponent of 
vouchers reluctantly agreed to allow a limited use of them in 
subsidizing only day care services for prekindergarten children 
and no one else 
both the house and senate have approved separate measures to 
double the 15 billion to 2 billion now spent annually on direct 
subsidies for child care services they also would provide 11 
billion to 135 billion in new tax credits over the next five 
years to lowincome families with children and require states to 
regulate care providers 
but the senate version would give governors much more discretion 
than the house measure on how the new direct aid is spent it would 
also allow them to dedicate a portion of the funds for issuing 
vouchers that parents could use to pay the care provider of their 
choice 
the house version has no provision for vouchers but upon 
passing the bill last month democratic house leaders instructed 
their negotiators to accept a limited use of them

amnesty international said today that nicaraguan 
troops have summarily executed dozens of unarmed peasants during 
operations against the contras while abuses by the usbacked 
rebels against civilians have dropped 
the international human rights group said in a report that the 
sandinista government has imprisoned some soldiers for unlawful 
killings of civilians pledged to investigate other such killings 
improved legal protection for detainees and freed more than 2000 
political prisoners since 1986 
it also said however that since an april 1988 ceasefire there 
has been no sign of a decline in noncombat killings and 
disappearances of civilians blamed on security forces 
president daniel ortega suspended the 19monthold truce last 
week but government and contra delegations were to begin meeting 
today in new york for the first direct peace talks since june 1988 
on ending the 8yearold conflict 
the contras are supposed to disband and leave their honduran 
camps voluntarily by early december under an aug 7 agreement 
signed by nicaragua and four other central american governments 
the rebels were not a party to the agreement and so far most have 
shown no inclination to lay down their weapons and return home 
amnesty said the fate or whereabouts of scores of civilians who 
disappeared after being arrested still have not been clarified 
army units allegedly have killed dozens of unarmed civilians in 
provinces bordering honduras and costa rica and in indiandominated 
regions on the atlantic coast where fighting against the contras 
once was intense the report said 
in many cases the victims allegedly were singled out in 
punishment or reprisal for no other reason that their suspected 
sympathy or support for the insurgent forces it said 
witnesses also have alleged that unarmed peasants have been shot 
to death while fleeing army patrols seeking to enforce military 
conscription it said 
it appears that following the withdrawal of contra forces 
some military units are resorting to killings during operations 
to identify or neutralize networks of suspected contra supporters 
and sympathizers the report said 
punitive action by the government while indicating that it 
does not condone such abuses has so far been insufficient to halt 
them it added 
it said the precise circumstances of the killings are often 
difficult or impossible to establish because there are no 
independent witnesses 
the authorities contend that in some cases soldiers acted in 
selfdefense because victims were suspected of being armed hostile 
or dangerous military investigations have suggested other killings 
were criminal acts involving personal quarrels or the reckless 
firing of weapons by drunken soldiers 
amnesty said reports persist of forced recruitment torture and 
executions of civilians by the usbacked rebels but said such 
abuses have dropped significantly in the past year 
preventive measures reportedly adopted by these forces to 
improve the conduct of their troops appear to have had little 
effect the report said but the number of reported abuses has 
declined significantly since the winding down of military activity 
in 1988 and 1989 
the report documents 56 cases of unlawful executions by 
nicaraguan troops between 1987 and 1989 
in three separate cases in which 10 civilians were killed the 
government sentenced 17 military and police personnel to prison 
terms ranging from six years to the maximum 30 years the report 
said 
in other cases investigations either have been suspended or are 
incomplete it said 
it described how the mutilated bodies of five catholic lay 
preachers were found a day after they were allegedly abducted by 
troops searching for suspected contras in the village of apantillo 
on march 21 1988 a military commission cleared army troops in 
nearby matiguas of involvement but villagers insisted the troops 
were responsible 
amnesty said it based its findings on three visits to nicaragua 
and its sources included relatives of those killed disappeared or 
imprisoned 
nicaragua lifted a state of emergency in january 1988 restoring 
many civil and political rights that had been suspended for nearly 
six years the report said

available to all other americans including representation in 
congress 
house members in response are setting up an unofficial 
congressional task force on overseas americans to provide a forum 
to air the complaints 
andrew p sundberg director of american citizens abroad and a 
resident of geneva switzerland told a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on wednesday that us citizens living overseas could 
be a great asset to their native land 
and yet in many ways we find that the us government is at 
war with those of us who live abroad and it is a war which we are 
losing he said 
we view our overseas citizens as a threat and as a liability 
that needs to be carefully controlled sundberg told the 
international operations subcommittee 
sundberg and other witnesses complained the united states is the 
only country which taxes its citizens on income earned abroad 
exposing them to double taxation since they are also subject to the 
tax codes of the countries in which they work 
he said that such countries as west germany france and japan 
provide schools for their citizens living in other countries but 
the united states does not 
sundberg noted france also allows overseas citizens to 
participate in the nations legislative process setting aside 12 
seats in the french senate for members elected by the overseas 
french community 
many federal programs do not reach beyond the waters edge 
sundberg said contending more than 100000 americans abroad are 
denied medicare benefits even though they have paid for them 
through their taxes 
he said there is a health benefit available to veterans but it 
cuts off at age 65 because medicare is supposed to start 
it doesnt overseas sundberg said noting the health 
benefits for veterans terminate anyway 
sundberg also said a provision of us law cuts off monthly 
supplemental social security benefits for people who live outside 
the united states for more than 30 consecutive days 
and he said children born to americans living abroad are often 
denied us citizenship in their own right 
sundberg endorsed legislation introduced earlier this year by 
rep bill alexander dark to permit americans residing overseas 
to be represented in congress by a nonvoting delegate to the house 
of representatives 
he also endorsed bills introduced by alexander to expand the 
types of income earned abroad which may be excluded from us taxes 
and to make it easier for americans abroad to pass on their us 
citizenship to their children 
witnesses for other organizations including the american 
chambers of commerce abroad contended that improving the tax 
status of overseas americans would help reduce the us trade 
deficit by making american companies more competitive with their 
overseas rivals

nbc news president michael g gartner says his 
passion for openness drove him to wage an expensive 
littlepublicized legal battle against the voice of america the 
governments radio station 
as a result gartner says voa has changed its policies giving 
americans more access to editorial material it broadcasts in 43 
languages around the world the voices charter prohibits it from 
broadcasting inside the united states 
theyve changed their position on three fundamental issues 
said gartner who built a file a foot thick in a fight that began 
in the early 1980s when gartner was editor of the des moines 
register and tribune 
i think that means there is more freedom of the press in this 
country and im intensely interested in that he said in a 
telephone interview 
voa officials challenge gartners contention theyve shifted 
positions but acknowledge they have taken steps to ensure voa 
employees properly implement existing policies 
gartner was drawn into the case by gil cranberg the registers 
former editorial page editor cranberg thought it would be 
interesting to see what kind of editorials voa was sending abroad 
over the airwaves 
when a register staffer went to check the editorials he ran 
into severe obstacles recalled cranberg now a journalism 
professor at the university of iowa we were told they 
editorials could not be disseminated 
cranberg told his boss about the situation mike was pretty 
incensed he said 
after years of trying to get the policy changed gartner filed a 
lawsuit against the us information agency voas parent in 
june 1988 in des moines federal court 
the lawsuit was filed in iowa because gartner a lawyer also is 
editor and coowner of the daily tribune in ames iowa a newspaper 
with a circulation of about 10500 
although judge donald e obrien dismissed the lawsuit last 
month gartner said a funny thing happened on the way to the 
ruling namely the voa now allows the following he said 
americans may publish any information they receive from voa 
only usia employees are barred from disseminating the information 
the general public not just special interest groups like 
reporters members of congress and historians is allowed access to 
voa materials such as editorials 
anyone can copy the information although they arent allowed 
to photocopy it 
summing up the changes gartner said one is i can print it 
two is the average guy can look at it and three is any of us can 
copy and thats a big big change in my view 
alberto mora voas general counsel disputed gartners 
statements in general thats not true the court points to 
no evidence that weve changed any interpretation of the statute 
he said 
mora said however that gartner may have received some 
confusing sorts of statements about policies from lowerlevel 
employees gartner said the voice is simply diplomatically 
defending their change of position 
meantime gartner said he considers his effort well worth his 
time and money joining gartner in the lawsuit were ralph 
rosenberg an iowa state representative and partnership 
independent press inc the daily tribunes parent company 
i have this passion for openness and for freedom of speech and 
for democracy said gartner who became president of nbc news in 
august 1988 
while battles have been won the war is not over 
gartner intends to push congress to change voas legislation so 
the public may photocopy editorials instead of having to copy them 
by hand

closerthanpredicted margins in virginias 
gubernatorial election and new yorks mayoral contest may have a 
simple explanation some pollsters say survey respondents lied 
that could explain why black candidates in the two races ran 
less well tuesday than expected the theory is that voters who 
opposed them hesitated to say so for fear of appearing bigoted 
it even has a name the bradley effect for los angeles 
mayor tom bradley a black democrat who led in the polls in his 
1982 race for governor only to lose narrowly to his white opponent 
george deukmejian 
i think a lot of people cast their votes on race and its 
something thats not easily measured by polls pollster brad 
coker said wednesday people are not going to freely admit 
theyre racists to strangers 
in unofficial returns black democrat l douglas wilder led 
white republican j marshall coleman by about 5500 votes for 
governor of virginia and black democrat david dinkins won new 
yorks mayoralty by just 2 points 
both led by greater margins in preelection surveys and even in 
surveys of voters leaving their polling places tuesday 
did some of those voters lie to the pollsters 
you bet said steve shaw poll director for media general 
inc in richmond va theres a socially acceptable answer that 
some people feel they should give but when it comes down to making 
a decision they tend to vote using other criteria 
other pollsters argue that the answers are more complex and 
that most preelection polls were not that far off in virginia 
the last three polls before the election put wilders support at 45 
percent 52 percent and 48 not that far from the roughly 50 
percent he received 
what they understated was colemans support estimated at 36 41 
and 44 percent respectively he also received about 50 percent in 
the end 
in new york similarly dinkins had 51 percent in a final 
preelection poll by the gallup organization about what he 
received white republican rudolph w giuliani however was polled 
at 37 percent he got 48 percent 
the undecideds or the people who werent saying broke 
heavily for the republican said gallup pollster larry hugick 
those people almost all of them whites may have been 
uncomfortable saying they opposed the black candidate hugick said 
but he also raised another possibility they truly hadnt made up 
their minds 
indeed in many previous elections pitting a black and a white 
the people who are undecided have traditionally moved toward 
the white candidate said kathleen a frankovic a pollster at 
cbs news if polls on tuesdays election reflected that she 
suggested they would have been near the mark 
i think that people are choosing to ascribe an easy 
explanation ie lying when there other methodological 
explanations available frankovic said theyre just harder to 
write about harder to talk about and the words are longer 
still coker who polled in virginia saw no other explanation 
for his exit poll result tuesday it found a 5545 percent victory 
for wilder among voters leaving their polling places far 
overstating the black candidates showing and understating the 
whites but on two other races in which there were no black 
candidates cokers results proved almost exactly correct 
the history of exit polling and other polling has been that 
when theres no racial issue involved theyre pretty accurate 
when there is youre never quite sure said coker you can 
only go with what the people tell you

portauprince haiti ap most businesses and schools 
remained closed on the second day of a widely observed 48hour 
strike to protest the arrest and apparent being in police custody 
of three opposition leaders 
transportation in portauprince and all other major cities in 
haiti was paralyzed wednesday the second day of the strike 
government trucks providing free transportation were virtually 
empty 
almost all the estimated 15000 factory workers at the 
industrial park on the north side of this city of 1 million did 
not report to work 
no violence was reported 
the success of the strike will give the army food for thought 
human rights and the constitution have got to be respected 
conservative politician francois latortue said in an interview 
the goverment on nov 2 accused jeanauguste mesyeux coleader 
of haitis largest union evans paul and etienne marino of 
conspiring to assassinate haitian ruler lt gen prosper avril and 
superior officers and to blow up the presidential palace 
the three were displayed on state television that night with 
swollen faces bandaged heads and bloodied shirts apparently 
resulting from beatings 
the aim of their appearance on television was probably to 
terrorize the population said latortue a former justice 
minister and presidential candidate 
we thought we had put an end to such police brutality in 
1986 when dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled into exile in 
france he said 
outraged by the television display nearly 100 human rights 
political civic and neighborhood groups rallied to the strike 
called by mesyeuxs union the autonomous central of haitian 
workers 
it is a strike of the revolted conscience communist party 
leader rene theodore said 
avril has no credibility left to govern with he must release 
the three prisoners and he must resign said conservative 
political leader louis dejoie 
haitis bishops in a statement broadcast by the roman catholic 
churchowned radio soleil tuesday night expressed shocked at the 
resurgence of police brutality and urged respect for human rights 
the three men began a hunger strike at the national penitentiary 
monday lawyers and relatives have been refused permission to visit 
them private radio haiti inter said 
paul is leader of the confederation for democratic unity party 
and marino is a member of the popular organization of september 17 
which was inspired by the september 1988 soldiers coup that ousted 
lt gen henri namphy and brought avril to power 
the three were arrested nov 1 allegedly in possession of 
weapons and explosives a day after cosigning a communique of the 
national assembly a coalition of 20 leftist and conservative 
groups calling for a month of antigovernment marches

trucks and railcars are hauling garbage into 
americas breadbasket and then carrying food on the way back with 
little or no cleaning in between according to testimony on capitol 
hill 
witnesses told a house panel of trucks that carry meat and solid 
waste on alternate trips trailers that haul food along with 
insects left from garbage runs and diesel fuel from one shipment 
seeping into flour in the next cargo 
would you like your bacon and eggs delivered on any of these 
trucks rep christopher smith rnj asked the house energy 
and commerce subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials 
on wednesday 
the subcommittee is considering legislation on hazardous 
materials safety including a ban on socalled backhauling of 
garbage to midwestern dumps after shipments of food to the east 
the need to dispose of waste at long distance landfills 
coincides with the desire of trucking companies to obtain a 
backhaul from the east said bernard gaillard of the interstate 
commerce commission 
the icc traced the activities of one refrigerated truck trailer 
that was seen at a poland ohio landfill and a newark nj waste 
transfer station investigators found that of 29 loads it carried 
over three months eight were meat cargoes six were solid waste 
and 15 others were listed as miscellaneous shipments 
gaillard said that at a hubbard ohio truck washing station 
investigators found one truck that hauled avocados from california 
before picking up a load of trash still reeked of garbage after the 
washing 
he said truck trailers were routinely rinsed with hot water not 
exceeding 100 degrees and with no detergent or other cleaning agent 
terri moore president of hoosiers opposed to polluting the 
environment said maggots survived the cleaning of nonrefrigerated 
trailers that made what she described as a midwest garbage run 
to the private center point ind landfill 
when one truck driver was questioned if this was a standard 
cleaning job he replied yes once the liquid is absorbed into 
the wood the maggots crawl into the moist cracks and the flies 
later hatch she said 
moore whose group has a dump patrol that monitors the 
landfill said she also witnessed shippers use the same tarpaulin 
to cover garbage and shipments of produce she said there was 
evidence of medical waste being hauled and one trucker allegedly 
was stuck by a needle and contracted aids 
aldan h fitch of the washington state department of agriculture 
contaminated loads have caused serious economic consequences 
he said in one case more than 1 million worth of dairy cattle 
died and milk had to be dumped for four weeks when a rail car 
bringing an arsenic compound to a tacoma smelter took on a load of 
feed grain afterward 
after some state residents complained of oilytasting biscuits 
fitch said inspectors discovered that two boxcars of flour were 
hauled in a car that had carried barrels of diesel oil 
in another case fresh market potatoes got a green coating when 
leadbased paint pigment was not cleaned from a car carrying the 
tubers he said

energy department advisers are casting doubt 
on suggestions that a linear accelerator may be a cheaper and safer 
way of making tritium a key nuclear warhead ingredient than new 
nuclear reactors now on the drawing board 
an advisory panel to energy secretary james d watkins said in a 
draft report released wednesday that a main problem with an 
accelerator is that large amounts of electricity would be needed to 
run the facility 
the energy research advisory board was meeting today to review 
the report 
watkins has strongly supported a plan prepared by his reagan 
administration predecessor to build two new nuclear reactors to 
make tritium they would replace government reactors in south 
carolina that are nearing the end of their useful lives the new 
reactors are estimated to cost at least 68 billion 
the department has said it needs to get started on replacements 
for the south carolina reactors soon so it would rather pursue the 
relatively simple reactor option instead of the accelerator 
technology which is not fully developed 
but scientists at two energy department laboratories concluded 
earlier this year that a linear accelerator would be cheaper and 
safer than a new reactor and could be ready sooner in august 
watkins asked his advisers to study how soon an accelerator might 
be feasible and at what cost 
an accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic 
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a 
target in this case lithium clad in aluminium the resulting 
collision produces tritium 
in a separate report wednesday the advisory panel said claims 
for the discovery of a new nuclear process called cold fusion 
are too weak to justify special government research efforts 
the group told watkins it found no persuasive evidence that the 
cold fusion process first claimed by university of utah scientists 
last march would produce useful sources of energy if such a 
process could work on a large scale it would make possible 
limitless supplies of cheap energy 
nuclear fusion at room temperature would be contrary to all 
understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century 
it would require the existence of an asyetundiscovered nuclear 
process the report said 
the advisory board said a chief concern about the accelerator is 
that it would require 800 megawatts of continuous power nearly 
the equivalent of the entire output of a large commercial power 
station 
the board called this power requirement an amount that is not 
only costly but may not be readily available in the time frame of 
the years 2000 to 2040 when the accelerator would be working 
it said a new power station possibly a nuclear reactor might 
have to be built just to provide electricity for the accelerator 
it may be simpler in fact to use a nuclear reactor to 
produce tritium directly rather than have it or a fossil 
plant produce electricity to operate the accelerator the report 
said 
the boards report said this and other issues would be 
considered in greater detail before next february when a final 
report is due to watkins

a jewish soldier who says he saved his 
battalion by singlehandedly shooting to death more than 500 
japanese soldiers may soon receive the medal of honor he believes 
was denied because of his religion 
marshaling the support of a us senator an authenticated 
photograph taken from the body of a japanese soldier and 
affidavits from two former commanders david s rubitsky thinks he 
has enough evidence to win official recognition 47 years after the 
deed 
rubitsky 72 believes he was nominated for a medal of honor 
during world war ii but denied the award because of the actions of 
an antisemitic commander he has vowed to keep fighting for the 
award 
if i give up im beaten and im a fighter rubitsky said in 
an interview last year if i lose the jewish people lose and 
then im going to let them down 
according to rubitskys story the heroic deed took place dec 
12 1942 in a new guinea swamp known as the triangle during 
an attack by japanese troops on rubitskys 128th infantry unit 
the former communications sergeant jumped into a machine gun 
fortification after it was abandoned by other soldiers and fired 
nearly 3500 rounds of ammunition on the japanese during 21 hours 
officials investigating rubitskys complaint said a photograph 
discovered this spring has brought strong credence to his claim 
they officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
rubitsky came across the photograph in march while visiting an 
army companion in mesa ariz the photograph reportedly taken from 
the pocket of dead japanese soldier shows a group picture of a 
japanese military unit 
a handwritten message in japanese on the back said the pictures 
bearer had decided to commit suicide after he and other officers 
sent men into a battle in which 600 fine japanese soldiers died 
because of a solitary american soldier 
sen herbert kohl dwis began working on rubitskys behalf in 
january and had the photograph examined this spring 
the secret service confirmed the photo was printed on paper from 
1942 and the writing was from ink produced in 1942 the note on the 
back was interpreted by the library of congress 
based on my review of the evidence as well as the contacts my 
office has had with mr rubitsky i have concluded that he earned 
the medal of honor kohl said 
maj joe padilla of the army awards branch in washington dc 
said a review of rubitskys case began in january 1988 and a 
decision should be issued by the end of the year 
under title 10 of the us code all recommendations for a medal 
from world war ii had to have been submitted by may 1951 thus 
investigators must determine whether a recommendation was made for 
rubitsky and if so whether antisemitism played on role in the 
denial of the award padilla said 
he said the investigation into the medal must prove 
incontestable evidence this is very difficult to do after nearly 
half a century 
rubitsky has declined interviews recently saying he wants to 
wait for the armys decision 
but in an editorial he wrote for the milwaukee sentinel last 
year he said he was told in 1986 that his former commanding 
officers had nominated him for a medalrubitsky said he then began 
investigating why he hadnt received it 
joseph stehling a retired brigadier general who lives in beaver 
dam signed an affidavit outlining rubitskys actions and 
confirming he nominated rubitsky for the honor retired gen 
herbert smith who died in september signed a similar affidavit 
another affidavit signed by a military messenger said col john 
mott now dead had denied rubitsky his medal because rubitsky was 
jewish 
in the 1988 interview rubitsky said he had received numerous 
antisemitic phone calls and threats after deciding to fight for 
the medal 
its not really the medal he said it is the 
antisemitism that existed then and still exists now i want people 
to know there is still discrimination

brian swierczeks recovery from leukemia is being 
aided by a computer that keeps him in touch with classmates and his 
fourthgrade teacher who transmits assignments from 3000 miles 
away 
two months after brian was diagnosed with leukemia in june the 
family temporarily moved from media pa so the 9yearold could 
undergo a bone marrow transplant at fred hutchinson cancer research 
center 
electronic mail from friends as well as daily school 
assignments arrive via a computer service offered by prodigy 
services co a joint venture of ibm and sears 
forget the classwork says brian whos more interested in 
keeping up with his pals and playing games on the computer with two 
younger brothers who have joined him for his recovery at an 
apartment near the hospital 
with the extra attention being shown brian his mother june 
has used the computer to begin her christmas shopping and brians 
father tim relied on prodigy to reserve airline tickets for the 
familys dec 23 trip back to the philadelphia suburb 
ibm loaned the family a computer sears loaned brians 
elementary school a computer and prodigy donated the software and 
three free months of the service to both parties said george 
twiss seattle branch manager for prodigy 
the white plains nybased service allows users to communicate 
with subscribers across the country using local phone lines it 
offers services such as news weather movie reviews and stock 
prices for a 995 a month 
brians mother said shes hoping her sons communications with 
the school will prevent him from repeating the fourth grade just 
as important she said is keeping brian in close touch with his 
classmates 
mrs swierczek said the computer service helps brian feel closer 
to his classmates 
theyre dont really talk on the phone at this age mrs 
swierczek said but his friends are all very interested in the 
computer and frequently leave messages even the girls she said 
it definitely makes him feel more in touch mrs swierczek 
said 
the family came to seattle after chemotherapy treatments in 
philadelphia failed to cure brian and the wait for a bone marrow 
transplant there was too long mrs swierczek said 
swierczeks bone marrow was found to be the closest match to his 
sons and on sept 9 it was transplanted during a 10hour 
operation 
brian has made it past the point where he would have an acute 
rejection of the transplant mrs swierczek said but doctors must 
wait 100 days after a transplant before they know if brian needs 
treatment with steroids to maintain his bodys acceptance of his 
fathers bone marrow she said 
brian was released from the hospital oct 4 but since his 
immune system is still weakened from the transplants and 
chemotherapy he mainly stays in the house to avoid contracting 
illnesses

a large sign lists all masses in 
polish but the hundreds of ethnic germans headed for the 
mountaintop monastery in this former german region are coming to 
pray in their mother tongue 
franciscan monks have allowed celebration of sunday mass in 
german since june and word has spread quickly among the thousands 
of ethnic germans scattered throughout southwestern poland 
although gasoline is in short supply worshipers often drive 
more than an hour each sunday to gather at one of the few churches 
in poland to offer services in german 
a tightlyknit community ethnic germans in poland are estimated 
by the international red cross to number 80000 most are 
concentrated in the former german territories of silesia and east 
prussia 
ethnic germans had hoped for a large turnout on sunday when 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany was to attend a 
germanlanguage mass at the mount st ann monastery known in 
german as annaberg 
the trip to the monastery was scratched however because the 
government was uncomfortable over a visit to the area the site of 
a fierce battle in 1921 between polish and german partisans over 
whether the area would go to poland or germany 
polishgerman relations in the region have been strained since 
the nazi invasion of poland in 1939 and warsaw authorities 
apparently feared a visit by kohl who arrived in the country today 
for a fiveday visit would stir ethnic tensions 
more than onethird of presentday poland was formerly german 
territory and millions of germans were expelled after the regions 
were awarded to poland after the war 
an alternate site for kohl to meet ethnic germans was found at 
krzyzowa known as kreisau in german a town where opponents of 
hitler met to map out resistance plans 
some of the kreisau circle members were later involved in the 
abortive july 20 1944 plot to kill hitler at an east prussian 
bunker now located in northern poland 
ethnic germans blamed the polish government for conflict over a 
visit to gora sw anny and say they plan to make a strong showing 
by organizing buses for the openair mass at krzyzowa 
about 500 people who attended mass in german on sunday were 
urged by the priest a franciscan friar to go to krzyzowa and then 
provided with detailed instructions on how to get there 
the poles are afraid of us we dont want to hurt the poles 
but we want to feel german said richard urban one of the 
leaders of the german friendship circle the group maintains close 
links with groups of silesians in west germany 
as long as they can prove german heritage ethnic germans in 
poland can automatically receive west german citizenship if they 
decide to emigrate but the germans at gora sw anny said they want 
to remain in poland 
we want to stay here we have been here for 600 years this is 
our homeland said urban but he added we want our children to 
learn german and we want our own schools and churches 
all prayer books and guides sold at the monastery are in polish 
but down near the parking lot one elderly germanspeaker did a 
brisk business selling copies of the days service and hymns in 
german for about 65 cents 
like many other social and ethnic groups the german minority 
was forbidden to form independent associations under the previous 
communist government that leadership has been replaced with a 
solidarityled government 
ethnic germans benefited from a law passed earlier this year 
allowing the official registration of independent groups at least 
two associations for the promotion of german culture have been 
formed

mayor edward i koch whos talked freely and 
for free while in office has lined up another paying position to 
offer his words

middle school students near the town 
where an 11yearold boy was abducted last month are sending 
letters to students around the country asking for help in finding 
him 
if somebody would see it and they might see jacob said 
11yearold david brinkman they might be able to alert 
somebody added cary gottwald 13 
paynesville is 30 miles southwest of st jospeh the town of 
3000 people where jacob wetterling was kidnapped oct 22 while 
riding bikes with two friends 
paynesville middle school principal mike lund said some children 
are afraid to go outside alone and others have told of nightmares 
we had a lot of our middle school students really concerned 
much more than expected we were surprised by how affected they 
were lund said 
on monday and tuesday students made white yarn bracelets that 
they will distribute to remind people to look for jacob the 
children gethered in the gym wednesday and formed circles held 
hands and listened to a girls choir sing somewhere out there 
many of the children tied white ribbons around their ankles or 
wore white clothing some carried signs or wore tshirts saying 
jacobs hope 
i think it helps get rid of some of that tension and fear 
lund said i think it helps them feel they are doing something 
positive for jacob 
each of the 430 fifth sixth seventh and eighth graders at the 
school wrote a letter to a middle school somewhere in the nation 
the main body of each letter was already typed students filled 
in information about themselves and included pictures of jacob and 
of a van that may be involved in the abduction 
we are concerned that as each day goes by jacobs abductor 
may be taking him further and further from his home the letter 
says each of the students in our school is trying to help out by 
sending these flyers to schools in other areas of the united 
states

chinese senior leader deng xiaoping has 
resigned as chairman of the powerful central military commission 
his top remaining formal leadership post a semiofficial news 
agency reported thursday 
deng was replaced by his latest protege communist party chief 
jiang zemin in a personnel switch approved thursday by a party 
central committee meeting in beijing the hong kong china news 
agency said 
deng 85 has been seeking to retire from all his top positions 
to make way for a new generation of leaders centered around jiang 
president yang shangkun who reportedly had sought the 
chairmanship over dengs objections was named first vice chairman 
of the commission the report said 
deng is expected to remain chinas paramount leader even after 
stepping down from the commission because of his stature as 
architect of chinese policy over the past decade and his 
connections 
diplomatic sources in beijing have said there was a power 
struggle in the party hierarchy centering on the military 
commission which sets policy for the armed forces 
yang who had been permanent vice chairman of the commission 
reportedly sought to solidify his place in the postdeng era by 
winning the position but other senior party members felt the post 
should be automatically assigned to the party general secretary 
jiang 62 was named party chief june 24 after zhao ziyang was 
purged from the post for his tolerance of the prodemocracy 
movement which the military crushed on june 4 killing hundreds of 
unarmed civilians in central beijing 
deng has named jiang who lacks a national power base to lead 
the country as head of the next generation of chinese leaders 
the news agency report which could not be independently 
confirmed immediately said liu huaqing formerly deputy secretary 
general of the commission was named the other vice chairman of the 
commission 
yang baibing the political boss of the peoples liberation army 
and yang shangkuns younger brother was named secretarygeneral of 
the commission the news agency said 
deng was purged twice by radicals during the 196676 cultural 
revolution then staged a comeback that turned china around he 
transformed a country dominated by ideological battles into one 
with pragmatic marketoriented economic policies 
living standards have improved for millions of chinese but the 
modernization drive led to serious problems of inflation and 
corruption 
the communist leadership is now seeking to remedy those 
problems with the central committee expected to approve an 
economic austerity program during its current session 
deng wears a hearing aid and smokes heavily but is not known to 
have any serious health problem

an accident during an experiment at a 
plant that produces nuclear detonators caused its heaviest 
discharge of tritium gas in at least 20 years and contaminated four 
workers officials said 
no evacuations were necessary 
about 37 grams of radioactive tritium was released wednesday at 
the mound nuclear production plant 10 miles southwest of dayton 
the accident released about 10 times the gas normally discharged 
from the governmentrun plant each year and was the largest at the 
plant since the 1960s said safety director richard neff but he 
characterized it as a minor leak 
we dont believe we had a significant amount that went up 
neff said 
the plant produces detonators for nuclear bombs and propulsion 
systems for space vehicles 
plant officials initially estimated that no more than a few 
dozen residents could have been exposed to a maximum of 12 
millirems of tritium the equivalent of one chest xray 
but plant spokesman howard charbeneau later said the maximum 
offsite dosage was 0051 millirem a person taking a plane across 
the country would be exposed to 3 millirems he said 
the us environmental protection agencys standard of safe 
dosage is 25 millirems a year 
the accident occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar 
containing tritium shattered the tritium a radioactive isotope of 
hydrogen was vented into an exhaust stack 
plant workers had been engaged in a measurement process in which 
a laser beam is passed through the quartz to aid the movement of 
tritium charbeneau said 
he would not comment on the purpose of the experiment but said 
weve done that before its not a new process 
neff said the energy department the ohio emergency management 
association and the city of miamisburg were notified 
neff said four of the 52 workers in the building where the 
accident occurred tested positive for tritium the levels were 
relatively low he said but the exact dosage wont be known until 
further testing 
neff said tritium was relatively lowrisk compared to most 
radioactive materials 
about 2200 workers are employed at the plant which is operated 
for the energy department by egampg mound applied technologies

the tokyo stock exchanges key index gained 
slightly after nervous ups and downs today while the dollar fell 
against the japanese yen for the second consecutive day 
the dollar closed at 14270 yen down 027 yen from wednesdays 
close of 14297 yen it opened at 14333 yen and ranged between 
14267 yen and 14333 yen the dollar fell by 066 yen on wednesday 
on thursday it was falling on news that us banks had cut 
their prime lending rate currency traders said lower interest 
rates tend to make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors 
despite the narrowing interest rate gap between japan and the 
united states the dollar has been bullish because of persistent 
demand among japanese investors said mitsuhiko kinugasa a daiwa 
bank trader 
thats mainly because investors have been buying the us 
money prior to the auction of us treasury securities he said 
an estimated 671 billion changed hands today down from 
wednesdays 776 billion 
on the stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 
6183 points or 017 percent closing at 3565742 
the index fell in the morning and slipped further in the early 
afternoon as investors including solomon brothers sold spot 
issues for technical adjustments said kazuhiro nomura a dealer 
with new japan securities co 
the nikkei rose back when investors started to pick up issues 
whose prices had fallen he said 
buying from foreign securities firms mainly goldman sachs and 
morgan stanley for option trading also boosted the index nomura 
said today was the last day for november options 
but todays major players were securities dealers who tend to 
buy and sell back issues frequently according to the fluctuation in 
the index nomura said 
thats why the nikkei went up and down so nervously he said 
trading was fairly active with first section volume estimated 
at 800 million shares unchanged from the previous day 
among gainers were shipbuilding electric power plant and steel 
issues

president bush will nominate john bartlett a 
former executive of a massachusettsbased government contractor to 
manage the energy departments highlevel nuclear waste program 
congressional and other sources said 
the selection comes amid growing criticism on capitol hill of 
delays in the departments efforts to build a permanent dump for 
radioactive waste from nuclear power plants 
bush is expected to nominate bartlett for the waste job later 
this month the sources said wednesday speaking on condition they 
not be identified if confirmed bartlett would fill a void in the 
waste program that has plagued the energy department for two years 
the current head of the waste management office sam rousso 
holds the job on an interim basis 
bartlett would become a central figure in the federal 
governments bitter struggle with nevada over efforts to build the 
nations first permanent dump for highlevel nuclear waste 
nevada gov bob miller has blocked the departments efforts to 
begin studying yucca mountain about 100 miles northwest of las 
vegas as the only candidate site for the proposed underground 
dump the standoff with other problems is expected to force 
watkins to announce a further delay in the target date for opening 
a permanent waste dump the current target date is 2003 
watkins is drawing increasing criticism on capitol hill for his 
failure to break the waste impasse 
in a letter released earlier this week four influential house 
members told watkins they were appalled the waste management 
office has been without a director for two years and that watkins 
appeared to be planning major changes in the waste program without 
consulting congress 
the letter dated oct 17 was signed by reps john d dingell 
dmich morris k udall dariz james v hansen rutah and 
philip r sharp dind 
sources who declined to be identified said watkins has decided 
to bring bartlett into the department as a special adviser until 
routine fbi background checks are completed and he is confirmed by 
the senate 
both the white house and the department declined to confirm the 
bartlett selection saying there would be no comment until a 
nominee was announced 
the company at which bartlett had worked for the last decade 
the analytic sciences corp is an engineering contractor to various 
government agencies including the energy department bartlett was 
manager of the companys office of nuclear engineering until he 
quit earlier this fall company officials said 
the company declined to specify the work it had performed for 
the energy department available department records list five 
contracts all expired with bartletts former employer but they 
include no description of the work done 
the total value of the contracts was 22 million the most 
recent one valued at 491840 was retired june 30 according to 
the department records 
jim kelly director of business development at the reading 
massbased company said in a telephone interview wednesday he 
could not comment on bartletts work there beyond confirming that 
he had quit and that he did a good job for us 
efforts to reach bartlett this week were unsuccessful in a 
telephone interview last month bartlett said he had discussed the 
waste job with watkins and white house officials but that he had 
been given no firm commitments

an 11yearold girl who was repeatedly 
raped as part of a gangs initiation may have been forced into the 
ordeal by a friend a 17yearold female member of the gang police 
said 
five members of the gangster disciples were charged wednesday 
with raping the girl saturday night but jefferson county sheriffs 
deputy charles buchannon said as many as 10 or 20 young men may 
have been involved 
the young men apparently considered the rapes to be a rite of 
initiation for the girl making her their queen said deputy 
tony pippen queen describes a girl who has been initiated by 
having sex with all of a gangs members he said 
gang members usually try to entice a girl normally someone they 
know into participating willingly in the initiation pippen said 
in this case he said the girl apparently did not participate 
willingly but was too afraid to resist 
the incident started while the girl was staying at the home of 
her 17yearold friend a gang member police said they said the 
older girl tried to talk her friend into going outside for a walk 
the girl didnt want to but her friend dragged her out even 
though she knew what was waiting for that little girl buchannon 
said the girl was taken by her older friend and the gang members 
to a park where the rapes took place he said 
the gang members let the girl go when they started worrying 
about whether theyd get caught buchannon said at least one of 
the boys threatened to kill her if she told anyone he said 
the girl returned to her friends house after the rape and did 
not call authorities or her parents buchannon said 
residents who heard about the rape flagged down pippen and his 
partner during their patrol sunday and told them about it the 
deputies found the girl still at her friends house and questioned 
her the five gang members were arrested later sunday 
antonio jones 18 was charged as an adult and the four others 
were charged with being juvenile deliquents accused of rape 
buchannon said three are 17 and one is 14 
he said that to his knowledge none of the five all students at 
brighton high school had been in trouble before he described them 
as being from middleclass families

a judge has banned testimony about the victims 
criminal record in the case of a miami officer who shot and killed 
a black motorcyclist sparking three days of racial disturbances 
dade county judge joseph farina ruled wednesday that clement 
lloyds previous drug convictions and defense contentions that he 
was collecting drug proceeds the day of his death were irrelevant 
to the case 
roy black an attorney for suspended miami officer william 
lozano said the ruling hurt his effort to defend the 30yearold 
policeman against manslaughter charges the defense wanted to show 
lloyd was desperate and drugged enough to try to run over lozano 
hes excluded our entire defense black said lloyd was a 
drug dealer out collecting his profits he didnt want to be 
stopped 
farina did allow evidence that lloyd 23 had 55 grams of 
marijuana and 1500 dollars in cash on him at the time of the 
shooting in his blood lloyd had alcohol and high levels of thc 
the active ingredient in marijuana evidence which also can be 
introduced in court 
the judge banned any mention of similar evidence concerning 
allan blanchard 24 lloyds passenger who died when the motorcyle 
crashed after the shooting 
lozano faces two manslaughter counts in the deaths 
during the hearing prosecutors told the judge the defense 
should not be allowed to put lloyd and blanchard both black on 
trial instead of lozano 
lead prosecutor john hogan remained cautious about his victory 
in pretrial motions were happy with some of them unhappy with 
others hogan said but obviously we won some motions that were 
important to us 
farina allowed the prosecution to use testimony about miami city 
police regulations to prove lozano acted negligently and 
unprofessionally when he shot and killed lloyd on jan 16 
those regulations are much more restrictive than floridas 
fleeing felon law which the defense argued should be the 
standard to judge the officer 
lozano fired one shot hitting lloyd in the head and killing 
him as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer lozano 
contends the motorcycle was heading straight at him prosecutors 
say miami police policy dictated that he should get out of the way 
and should not have fired at a moving vehicle 
in the riot that followed the shooting one person was killed 
11 were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were burned down in 
predominantly black neighborhoods 
the defense on wednesday also sought to introduce statements 
contending the prosecution was racially and politically motivated 
and that some prosecutors had privately acknowledged that but the 
judge denied that testimony

interest from us and filipino prosecutors for its ties to former 
philippine president ferdinand marcos drew only one bidder at a 
foreclosure auction 
real estate developer morris bailey led a group of investors who 
bought herald center a 10story vertical mall across the street 
from macys flagship store for the minimum bid of 25 million 
wednesday 
marcos and his wife imelda allegedly bought the mall and three 
other manhattan properties with money looted from their homelands 
treasury 
marcos died in exile in hawaii in september leaving his wife to 
face numerous lawsuits in the united states and philippines

the current 45 tenants 
but bailey was optimistic about its future 
herald center is the premier retail location in the country 
today he said if properly directed we are going to have some 
good response 
bailey said his group would announce its plans for the center 
soon 
the auction of herald center was part of a foreclosure action by 
the propertys mortgage holder security pacific mortgage and real 
services money from the sale will go toward a 5865 million 
foreclosure judgment awarded security pacific by us district 
judge pierre leval 
leval who presides over one of the philippine lawsuits allowed 
the sale of three of the buildings and said any proceeds left over 
would be held by the court pending the outcome of the litigation 
one of the other buildings 40 wall st was sold for 1086 
million at auction in august but the sale collapsed when the buyers 
failed raise the money by the oct 10 closing date that building

a man whose defense hinges on his 
claim of involvement in a plot to kill pakistans former leader is 
an internationally known heroin dealer trying to avoid prison 
prosecutors said 
you would create any sort of story you would say anything 
assistant us attorney kevin oregan said wednesday as he began 
crossexamining mushtaq malik 
the 41yearold defendant has testified that his involvement 
with an accused drug dealer was merely an effort to track down a 
man who doublecrossed him in a plot kill pakistani president gen 
mohammed zia ulhaq the plot malik has said was orchestrated by 
officials in the pakistan peoples party whose current leader is 
prime minister benazir bhutto 
zia died in a mysterious plane crash aug 17 1988 a pakistani 
official has denied the assassination plot 
oregan reeled off a string of alleged heroin smuggling acts in 
which he said malik was involved including a doubledipping 
scheme with a german official in which malik dealt heroin and then 
tipped off the official to the shipment thereby reaping the sale 
and reward 
malik called the allegations baseless 
the defendant appeared to be at odds with his attorney stephen 
ferrarone frequently telling the defense attorney to sit down when 
he tried to raise objections to the prosecutors crossexamination 
malik who said hes of royal blood and known as the black 
prince in pakistan has stopped short of saying he was involved 
in the plane crash that killed zia 
bashir riaz an adviser to bhutto has told the associated press 
that maliks claim of an assassination plot was another attempt 
by the drug mafia to discredit the government because of benazir 
bhuttos campaign against the drug trade 
pakistani officials including those who served zia at first 
blamed the plane crash on soviet and afghan agents operating 
against pakistan and the united states for their support of afghan 
mujahedeen after bhutto came to power zias son ejaz ulhaq and 
some opposition rightwingers blamed her ruling pakistan peoples 
party 
malik in early 1985 was convicted in pakistan and served more 
than two years in prison for heroin trafficking he said those 
charges were politically motivated

stress or injury from hurricane hugo 
probably contributed to the death of the sole male red wolf in a 
wildlife refuge but four pups of the endangered species appear 
healthy the refuge manager said 
the 7yearold wolf had been released on bulls island part of 
the cape romain national wildlife refuge on the atlantic coast 
with a female adult in an attempt to reintroduce the species which 
had become extinct in the wild 
the male adults carcass was discovered saturday about three 
weeks after the animal died said george r garris the refuge 
manager 
were not sure of the cause garris said he probably 
sustained injury during hugo or the stress was too much for him 
the carcass was not found earlier because trees felled by hugo 
on sept 21 blocked island roads until last week the hurricane 
with 135 mph winds came ashore at charleston about 20 miles 
southwest of bulls island 
the four 6monthold female pups appear healthy and could be 
transferred to alligator river national wildlife refuge in north 
carolina within several months once they learn hunting techniques 
garris said a cape romain employee is tracking them and giving 
them food 
born in a zoo the male adult and a female adult were released 
on bulls island in 1987 an alligator killed the female less than a 
year later and the male raised their two male pups the pups later 
were transferred to the north carolina refuge where they still

a second female wolf was introduced on bulls island last winter 
the pair produced five female offspring in the spring days later 
an alligator killed the mother and one pup later was killed by 
another alligator 
the red wolf once ranged from texas east to the atlantic coast 
and north to the ohio valley but began disappearing because of 
their inability to adapt to changes in the land and predator 
control 
in 1973 after the passage of the endangered species act the 
entire red wolf population in southeast texas and louisiana was 
captured to prevent its extinction 
the red wolf is smaller than the grey wolf with females 
weighing 4060 pounds and males weighing 6080 pounds 
the blackfooted ferret is the only mammal that is rarer than 
the red wolf in the united states

what a blast sheriffs deputies attacked 
the drug problem by blowing up mounds of dirt before marijuana 
could be replanted in them 
there was no pot planted tuesday when bomb experts rigged 20 
charges one for each handrigged mound erected on a swamp about 10 
miles east of the city but dave bristow a spokesman with the 
manatee sheriffs office explained on wednesday 
weve had an ongoing problem at this location wed spot the 
pot eradicate it and a few months later wed go back and the 
mounds were replanted 
so we came up with the idea of using explosives to get rid of 
the mounds to discourage people from replanting now they cant 
bristow said the method was inexpensive quick and effective

interview in this weeks us magazine 
i just let it run its course and tried to be as fairhanded as 
i could be he said jade had her rebellious moment which was 
pretty quiet compared to mine which lasted about 15 years

babies born to refugees from southeast asia are at 
high risk of catching hepatitis b and should be routinely 
vaccinated against the dangerous virus us health officials 
recommended today 
longtime carriers of the virus have an increased risk of liver 
cancer and chronic liver disease the younger people are when they 
catch the hepatitis virus the more likely they are to die of these 
diseases 
since 1975 nearly 1 million people have moved to the united 
states from southeast asia where infection with the hepatitis b 
virus is extremely common 
in todays study doctors from the us centers for disease 
control found that the children of southeast asian immigrants have 
a substantial risk of catching the virus even if they are free of 
it at birth 
the research directed by dr adele l franks was published in 
the new england journal of medicine it was based on 196 refugee 
families with 257 children who were born in the united states 
the virus is frequently passed from mother to child before 
birth in the families studied 55 percent of the children born to 
mothers with infectious disease had the infection however 7 
percent of the children whose mothers were free of the infection 
also had the virus 
the researchers concluded that childtochild transmission was 
responsible for at least some of the hepatitis b infections 
under current guidelines vaccination is recommended only for 
newborns of mothers with infectious disease the researcher said 
this should be expanded to include all newborn children of refugees 
from southeast asia 
in an accompanying editorial dr jay h hoofnagle of the 
national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases 
agreed with the proposal 
this advice is sound he wrote and if followed will 
contibute materially to the good health of the children of these 
firstgeneration americans

exposure to radiation even during infancy can 
significantly increase womens risk of breast cancer when they 
reach adulthood a study published today confirms 
the research was based on a longterm followup of women who 
were given xray therapy shortly after birth for treatment of 
enlarged thymus glands such treatment was common until the late 
1950s when doctors realized that seemingly enlarged thymuses were 
actually normal 
by age 36 the study found that those who had received the 
treatment were nearly four times more likely to get breast cancer 
than were sisters who did not receive the radiation 
the researchers said their work suggests that irradiation of 
the female breast at a very early age can have harmful effects that 
do not appear until many years later 
experts have long recognized that breast tissue is extremely 
sensitive to the damaging effects of radiation until recently 
they believed that only those who received radiation during 
adolescence or adulthood would be harmed however recent followup 
of japanese girls exposed to radiation from atomic bombs during 
world war ii found they also had an increased risk of breast cancer 
later in life 
the latest study directed by dr nancy g hildreth of the 
university of rochester school of medicine and dentistry was 
published in the new england journal of medicine 
the doctors followed 1201 women who received xray treatment 
for enlarged thymuses and 2469 of their sisters who did not get 
radiation there were 22 cases of breast cancer among the radiation 
group and 12 among the sisters 
another study in the journal conducted by dr anthony b miller 
of the national cancer institute of canada followed 31710 who 
received repeated diagnostic xrays for tuberculosis 
this study found the greatest risk of breast cancer among those 
who got the xrays between ages 10 and 14 the risk fell with 
increasing age

poles rushed to sell hoarded dollars after 
officials predicted the polish zloty could be convertible by years 
end sending the us currency into a tailspin on the unofficial 
market 
the dollar has lost nearly 30 percent of its value in legal 
private trading over the past week and has dropped by 50 percent 
over the past month 
on wednesday banks and commercial traders were paying between 
4800 and 5000 zlotys per dollar down from more than 10000 in 
early october and from 6300 on monday 
dollar dumping has accelerated with predictions that the 
commercial rate will soon be brought into line with the official 
rate for foreign business transactions now at 2800 zlotys per 
dollar 
panic selling ensued after the prosolidarity daily gazeta 
wyborcza reported the discussion at a monday cabinet meeting of 
fixing a uniform conversion rate of 3500 zlotys to the dollar by 
years end 
officials contend the dramatic fall of the dollar on what used 
to be the black market could be a step toward stabilizing the 
polish monetary system and encouraging farmers to put up more of 
their produce for sale 
but millions of poles who amass dollars to control their buying 
power in times of spiraling inflation are seeing their personal 
wealth devasted 
i have to buy a car so i am forced to sell my dollars said 
jerzy oblencki an engineer among more than 100 people lined up at 
a national bank of poland office in central warsaw early wednesday 
like many poles saving for expensive items oblencki had been 
buying dollars on the commercial market for months assuming the 
dollars would hold their value better than the troubled zlotys 
inflation currently estimated at over 600 percent annually has 
undermined public confidence in the polish currency 
the selling rush of the past few days has overwhelmed private 
traders who have run out of zlotys and have been forced to suspend 
buying dollars 
if i had zlotys to sell i could buy 100000 to 200000 just 
today said wojciech kujawa director of a currency exchange on 
bustling pulawska street kujawa is one of dozens of private 
traders operating in warsaw 
in a transition to a more marketoriented economy the 
government in january gave official sanction to private 
moneytrading in hopes of luring dollars from people reluctant to 
put their money in the bank 
the private traders determine conversion rates based on the 
daily demand from government and industry for hard currency to 
purchase goods abroad 
even the wisest man cannot foresee what will happen in poland 
or whether the dollar will go up or down said jozef daczewski a 
department head of the polish state savings bank 
the true value of the dollar in poland at present is between 
6000 and 7000 zlotys according to ewa kaweckawlodarczak the 
banks foreign exchange manager her calculation was reported in 
wednesdays edition of the government newspaper rzeczpospolita 
uncertainty in the fledgling money market has forced those 
saving for big purchases to gamble on when to trade in their hard 
currency 
some people are panicking because they want to buy their 
apartments before jan 1 when the price per square meter is 
expected to go up marian socha explained as he waited in line at 
the bank 
dozens of other poles who crowded around to add their thoughts 
on the money situation said that without sufficient goods and 
produce on the market to soak up the zlotys the dollars tumble is 
artificial and will soon correct itself 
tomasz sikorski an agricultural specialist said farmers are 
holding back grain in hopes of being able to sell it later when 
prices and the value of the zloty are more stable 
economists are hoping that western aid expected to arrive over 
the next few weeks will boost food supplies stabilize prices and 
engender public confidence in the zloty

ayodhya india ap tens of thousands of militant hindus stood 
guard today with tridents and bows and arrows as priests broke 
ground for a temple at a religious site claimed by both hindus and 
moslems 
more than 1000 hindu pilgrims stood solemnly as four 
consecrated bricks passed over their heads and were placed on the 
ground as a symbol of the foundation they say they will begin 
digging friday 
hundreds of security troops surrounded the disputed shrine 
watched from rooftops and lined the roads leading to ayodhya a 
town of 35000 people some 325 miles southeast of new delhi 
the massive police and paramilitary presence indicated the 
lengths the government has taken to prevent violence between 
members of the two faiths 
at least 290 people mostly moslems have been killed in 
religious riots across other parts of india because of plans to 
build the temple 
if ever completed the temple would engulf a disputed 17th 
century shrine claimed by followers of both religions 
moslems who comprise 11 percent of indias 880 million people 
say the shrine is the babri masjid or mosque of the moghal emperor 
babar 
hindus who comprise 82 percent of the population claim the 
mosque was built over the birthplace of the lord ram an 
incarnation of vishnu one of the supreme trinity of gods 
the dispute over the squat white buildings with three domes 
dates back to the 19th century but erupted afresh in august after 
the militant vishwa hindu parishad or world conference of hindus 
announced plans to build a new temple 
the ceremony prompted the government to put police and the army 
on a state of alert across northern india additional forces were 
patrolling cities with significant moslem populations including 
new delhi home ministry officials said on condition of anonymity 
the issue also has become a focal point for indias general 
elections scheduled for nov 22 24 and 26 
asked if construction would begin before the elections surya 
krishna joint secretary of the vishwa hindu parishad replied 
within a month 
prime minister rajiv gandhi who faces a strong challenge for 
reelection from an opposition coalition is unwilling to risk 
alienating the majority hindus he is equally unwilling to risk the 
minority moslem votes which traditionally have gone in favor of 
his congress party 
vishwanah pratap singh leader of the opposition coalition has 
also avoided taking sides on the dispute 
both have urged moderation and tolerance by members of both 
faiths without giving any specific suggestions on how to resolve 
the problem 
singh had planned to be in ayodhya on today to try to keep 
tensions from boiling into violence however he remained in the 
town of faizabad about four miles away 
asked why he replied this is part of ayodhya

kitty dukakis struggling against alcoholism was 
hospitalized for severe reactions to rubbing alcohol which she 
drank while exhausted because of flu and depression her doctor 
said 
the wife of gov michael dukakis had been taking 
antidepressants prescribed by her psychiatrist but tests showed 
the rubbing alcohol caused her hospitalization said dr gerald 
plotkin the family physician 
some specialists in treating alcoholism characterized mrs 
dukakis action as a desperate cry for help 
the dukakis family removed all alcoholic beverages from their 
home after mrs dukakis entered a treatment program for alcoholism 
last february said mindy lubber the governors spokeswoman 
plotkin did not comment wednesday on whether mrs dukakis had 
knowingly tried to hurt herself or was seeking the effects of 
alcohol when she drank a small amount of the poisonous substance 
monday 
the former democratic presidential candidate spent monday and 
tuesday at his wifes side canceled all appointments and refused 
to comment 
mrs dukakis who turns 53 next month was taken by ambulance to 
the hospital on the eve of the first anniversary of her husbands 
presidential defeat 
autumn has been a particularly bad season for her said 
plotkin kitty has suffered from chemical dependency and 
struggled with depression for many years these two problems often 
are related 
she was admitted to the intensive care unit at brigham and 
womens hospital complaining of what a spokeswoman said were 
flulike symptoms on wednesday she was moved to a private 
room 
lubber said wednesday night she did not know how long mrs 
dukakis would be hospitalized 
rubbing alcohol is normally about 70 percent isopropyl alcohol 
which is much more toxic than ethanol or drinking liquor said 
alan woolf director of the massachusetts poison center at 
childrens hospital in boston 
isopropyl alcohol can damage the stomach and about 10 ounces of 
it could be lethal woolf said 
it is not uncommon for alcoholics to drink rubbing alcohol if 
nothing else is available but specialists in alcholism treatment 
said such behavior was more likely to be seen among impoverished 
street alcoholics than affluent drinkers 
usually its somebody with a severe alcohol problem said a 
woman at the alcohol abuse 24hour hotline who declined to give her 
name theyll drink anything even hair spray 
others said mrs dukakis behavior could hardly be interpreted 
simply as an effort to get a drink 
it seems like a desperate cry for help really said janice 
okeefe director of an alcoholism detoxification program at andrew 
house 
in february mrs dukakis entered a rhode island alcoholism 
treatment center for four weeks of therapy she previously said she 
overcame a 26year addiction to diet pills 
in october mrs dukakis participated in an outward bound 
rafting and camping expedition in colorado a great experience 
that suggested falsely that this fall might not be so bad 
plotkin said 
he said she had been keeping a hectic public speaking schedule 
and was exhausted when she returned from indiana a week ago today 
others said mrs dukakis may have stretched her nerves by making 
too public a recovery from her problems 
i think its very difficult to try to manage a recovery in the 
public spotlight said dr domenic ciraulo substance abuse 
consultant at the new england medical center in boston 
the dukakises were married in 1963 and have always lived in 
suburban brookline where they grew up they have three grown 
children and a granddaughter 
dukakis 86yearold mother euterpe also was hospitalized 
monday she was in satisfactory condition wednesday at beth israel 
hospital where she was admitted after a bout of fainting spells 
dukakis has faced a difficult season aggravated by the 
dissolution of what had been touted as the states economic miracle 
as dukakis visited his wife wednesday night weary legislators 
had their hands full debating cuts into an already lean state 
budget to offset a 720 million shortfall 
his fouryear term ends in 1991 he has said he wont seek 
reelection

the twin cities newspaper guild approved the pact wednesday 
night hours after their second strike deadline passed in as many

percent in the fifth year and 30 percent in the sixth year union 
officials said 
union leaders said they recommended approval because other 
unions at the plant were reluctant to support a strike many guild 
members feared they would be replaced in a prolonged strike they 
said 
its a bad deal its a rotten deal said jay weiner vice 
chair of the workers negotiating committee 
it simply doesnt meet the needs of people trying to keep 
their standard of living intact said steve brandt strike 
coordinator for the minneapolis unit of the guild 
john dennison vice president of labor relations for the star 
tribune said the company succeeded in its goal to freeze wage 
scales for three years but he said the company also made an 
effort to accommodate some key needs of the guild 
sometimes you have a feeling you didnt get everything you 
wanted dennison said but both sides can walk away with their 
head up 
for top scale reporters photographers copy editors and 
district circulation managers the bonuses will be 2000 in the 
first year 1750 in the second and 1500 in the third brandt 
and dennison said 
the pay raises for topscale employees will amount to about 26 
a week in each of the last three years they said 
weiner said the package averages out to a 16 percent annual 
increase in pay scales over six years he called it worse by 
far than the deal struck by guild employees at the st paul 
minn pioneer press dispatch earlier this year 
for the first three years of the new pact top minimum weekly 
salaries for guild members will remain at 31550 for copy aides 
74250 for circulation district managers 812 for reporters 
photographers copy editors and promotion personnel and 89575 
for some editors 
the minneapolis unit has been working without a contract since 
its threeyear pact expired july 31 the unit covers about 300 
newsroom employees and about 60 circulation and promotion workers

senate democrats are attacking the bush 
administrations willingness to accept automatic budget cuts that 
would force the defense department to reduce the nations armed 
forces 
it would be a disaster if congress and the administration 
decide to go over the cliff sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the senate armed services committee said wednesday as pentagon 
officials described the impact of automatic reductions on the four 
military branches 
the 21 million active duty armed forces would have to be 
reduced by about 229000 in fiscal 1990 under the cuts with the 
air force cut by 80000 the navy by 76000 the army by 62000 and 
the marine corps by 11000 
military contracts for such bigticket items as the 
multiplewarhead mx nuclear missile and the advanced tactical 
fighter would also have to be renegotiated the pentagon said 
the automatic budget cuts are necessary because of congress 
failure to pass a deficit reconciliation bill aimed at complying 
with the budgetcutting requirements of the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law 
president bush has said he would be willing to live with the 
cutbacks in fiscal 1990 rather than accept a budget reconciliation 
bill that does not result in real deficit reductions the president 
is seeking 14 billion in cuts congress has indicated a 12 
billion cut is possible 
house and senate negotiators are still thrashing out 
reconciliation legislation 
without the legislation federal programs would suffer 161 
billion in automatic cuts with half targeting the defense 
department 
the senate armed services committee invited pentagon officials 
to capitol hill to describe the impact of the automatic budget 
cuts at the session however members of the panel fell into 
partisan bickering 
sen james exon dneb said he could not believe that bush 
the great defender of america would accept the defense 
reductions that would be absolutely devastating to the military 
the effect of this decision would be to take us back to the 
readiness levels of the mid1970s said sen albert gore jr 
dtenn who indicated that the zillions of dollars spent 
during the reagan and bush administrations on building up the 
nations defense would be for naught 
but sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the 
committee said congress must share some of the blame 
were in this hearing because congress failed to do its job 
warner said weve got a lot of faults we didnt come into this 
with clean hands 
in the house rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican 
on the budget committee shrugged off the concerns expressed by 
senate democrats and told reporters the bush administration is 
not paralyzed with fear like the last administration was over 
the automatic cuts 
rep jerry lewis rcalif said that if defense had more 
flexibility he would favor the required budget cuts 
during the session the defense departments comptroller sean 
okeefe and representatives of the army navy air force and 
marine corps described the steps they would have to take in 
response to the 43 percent acrosstheboard cuts 
okeefe urged congress to approve a pentagon request that would 
give them the authority to move money around to minimize the effect 
of the automatic budget cuts 
nunn said he supports that request but indicated other 
congressional committees oppose the pentagons call and the 
likelihood of approval is slim 
defense secretary dick cheney will comply with the budget cuts 
however painful that may be okeefe said

senior leader deng xiaoping today resigned from 
his last communist party post as head of the powerful military 
commission and cleared the way for his chosen successor to assume 
undisputed power 
deng 85 was replaced by the protege 63yearold communist 
party chief jiang zemin as head of the central military commission 
the move was approved by the ruling partys central committee in a 
meeting that ended today 
the committee also issued a communique warning that china must 
go through at least two more years of economic austerity to 
overcome current problems of inflation excessive growth and 
corruption 
the official xinhua news agency announced dengs resignation 
the architect of chinese policy for the past decade deng has 
been seeking to make way for a new generation of leaders centered 
around jiang though apparently meeting some resistance from 
president yang shangkun and his allies 
deng who has served chinas communist cause for six decades 
resigned from the partys ruling politburo and other top party 
posts in 1987 but is still recognized as the ultimate source of 
power in the country 
in a nov 7 letter to the politburo carried by xinhua he said 
giving up the last post while still healthy was his 
longcherished desire 
in the letter deng expressed his confidence in the new party 
chief saying party leaders had in june elected a leading nucleus 
headed by comrade jiang zemin and it is now already carrying out 
its work effectively 
he said he would now seek to resign from the less important 
government body whose functions parallel the party military 
commission which sets policy for the armed forces 
president yang 82 was named the party military commissions 
first vice chairman a job left vacant when former party chief zhao 
ziyang was stripped of all leadership posts for tolerating the 
prodemocracy movement 
the committees communique did not mention zhao who has been 
under house arrest there had been speculation that the plenum 
might recommend criminal charges against zhao or remove zhao 
supporters from their offices 
the changes for now end the power struggle diplomatic sources 
have reported between yang who had been the commissions vice 
chairman and younger party leaders 
yang a hardliner reportedly sought to solidify his place in 
the postdeng era by winning the chairmanship but other senior 
party members apparently felt the post should be given to jiang 
yang was one of the principal leaders behind the decision to 
declare martial law in beijing and bring in troops to crush the 
prodemocracy movement soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed 
civilians in a june 4 assault 
yangs younger brother baibing the political boss of the 
peoples liberation army was named secretarygeneral of the 
central military commission 
the armys chief of staff chi haotian is said to be yangs 
soninlaw and there has reportedly been opposition to what 
appeared yangs attempt to establish a family dynasty within the 
military 
liu huaqing formerly deputy secretary general of the commission 
and former head of chinas navy was named the commissions second 
vice chairman 
basically it looks like a compromise a hong kongbased 
diplomat said of the changes with deng getting his way regarding 
the chairmanship and yang getting his way regarding his brother 
when asked if jiang could use the position to develop a power 
base in the military the diplomat said if deng dies he jiang 
has no chance i dont think the position makes any difference 
whatsoever 
jiang was named party chief june 24 with dengs backing he had 
been party boss of shanghai the countrys largest city but lacks 
a national power base 
the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said the new 
commission lineup indicates nothings been really resolved in 
the struggle to succeed deng there is no clear sign one way or 
the other 
xinhua said deng declared our cause of reform and opening to 
the outside world has just started we have arduous tasks ahead and 
there will be some twists and turns on our way of advance but i 
firmly believe that we will be able to overcome various 
difficulties and carry forward the cause pioneered by our 
predecessors from generation to generation 
deng was purged twice by radicals during the 196676 cultural 
revolution then staged a comeback that turned china around 
beginning in 1978 
under deng living standards have improved for tens of millions 
of chinese he also opened the country to the west as part of his 
drive for modernization 
but the harsh suppression of the spring prodemocracy movement 
showed that deng was not willing to loosen the partys firm grip on 
politics

complaints about homeless people at the nations 
busiest airport have prompted a plan to move them to shelters but 
advocates for the homeless are criticizing the idea 
the strategy still in its formative stages would clear the 
homeless out of ohare international airport through nightly sweeps 
i wouldnt go said a diminutive whitehaired woman who 
gave her name as jean its no solution its too shortterm 
because youre only there for a short time and then youre back on 
the street and i know about these things 
one of about 200 who live at the airport jean said wednesday 
night she hustles baggage carts to make money she sneaks up behind 
airline passengers waits for them to take the bags off their 
rented carts then sneaks off to return the rental 
each returned cart makes her 25 cents ten carts buy her a hot 
dog 
see that guy hes been doing it 11 years she said 
pointing out an older man who slipped into a side entrance of a 
terminals cafeteria as the lights were turned off for the evening 
a chicago policeman closed the door behind him 
the city offers them free housing and programs downtown 
but they can make a ton of money out here by returning carts 
stealing luggage and recruiting passengers for limousine services 
said the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
milton wilson a 24yearold former fastfood restaurant worker 
who began living at the airport two weeks ago when he lost his 
apartment disagreed 
theres a lot of people here who dont have a place to go 
he said at least at a shelter theyll have a bed and a hot meal 
i know i want to go somewhere not just stay here 
complaints provoked chicago aviation commissioner jay franke to 
set aside 500000 out of the 350 million annual airport 
operations budget to deal with the homeless problem 
ideas include closing the airport for a short time in the early 
morning hours rounding up those who appear to be homeless and 
taking them to a shelter in the surrounding suburbs 
airports all over the country routinely close in the middle of 
the night for a variety of reasons sometimes for the removal of 
liveins franke said wednesday but theres no plan in place 
no dates no deadlines no nothing 
elsewhere efforts have been tried to clear the homeless from 
public property 
for example in new york city recently as the number of 
homeless people and the number of complaints about them have 
continued to rise officials have adopted codes of conduct in 
public spaces and erected barriers that close off areas frequented 
by the homeless 
the ohare plan endorsed by mayor richard m daley needs city 
council approval 
but suburbs surrounding ohare have denounced a plan to build a 
shelter or to bus the homeless there 
everybody complains about the homeless at ohare and the 
minute you go to develop a program people complain about that 
franke said it appears its impossible to please everyone 
the american civil liberties union historically opposed to 
random sweeps of any kind said it is monitoring the issue and 
would examine the plans legality when it is proposed 
and advocates for the homeless say the plan could be 
discriminatory 
itll all be based on what somebody looks like said mitch 
snyder who heads the community for creative nonviolence in 
washington dc 
still snyder praised those who want to take the homeless to a 
shelter rather than just evict them 
its better than saying why dont we drive these people out 
of here he said its a more progressive response

a state appeals court threw out a 50 
million judgment won by a farmer who said a bank defrauded him by 
enticing him to borrow millions and then cutting off credit when 
his business went sour 
in a ruling seen as a victory for banks on the issue of lender 
liability the court wednesday said robert stanghellini failed to 
prove the bank of america committed fraud 
a jury in 1987 awarded stanghellini his elderly mother and aunt 
20 million in compensatory damages and 30 million in punitive 
damages the award was reduced by 3 million the amount 
stanghellini owed the bank 
stanghellini had argued that the bank got him to borrow heavily 
to expand and then cut him off after his tomatogrowing business 
suffered heavy losses in the early 1980s 
the appeals court cited errors by the trial judge and misconduct 
by richard murphy stanghellinis lawyer 
murphy had tried to vilify the bank unfairly both in and out 
of court make his case through sources beyond properly 
admissible evidence the court said 
murphy was unavailable for comment a spokeswoman said wednesday 
recent decisions by appeals courts have reversed several rulings 
against banks that abruptly cut off credit to longstanding 
customers who began losing money

president fw de klerk today told 
leaders of two white extremist groups that he rejected their 
proposal for a whitesonly homeland and will continue to pursue 
powersharing with blacks 
the meeting was the first ever between a south african head of 
state and eugene terreblanche leader of the neonazi afrikaner 
resistance movement it is the countrys most powerful 
whitesupremacist group 
terreblanche who wore a khaki uniform to the hourlong meeting 
was accompanied by robert von tonder head of the boerestaat party 
both organizations advocate creation of a whitesonly nation in 
the northeastern third of south africa to be controlled by the 
afrikaners who make up 60 percent of the countrys 5 million white 
population 
i dont think the proposals of those two parties are realistic 
or very workable de klerk also an afrikaner told a news 
conference after the meeting i sincerely believe eugene 
terreblanche does not represent a substantial number of people in 
south africa 
terreblanche declined comment and left the presidents office in 
the company of 10 bodyguards in khaki uniforms bearing the 
movements swastikalike emblem he was expected to talk about the 
meeting at a speech scheduled for tonight in boksburg a 
johannesburgarea industrial town controlled by the farright 
conservative party 
the president said terreblanche did not warn that his movement 
might take up arms against the government but should 
revolutionary forces be allowed to take over they would take up 
arms de klerk said 
he said terreblanche and von tonder also expressed concern about 
the possible consequences of releasing prominent black security 
prisoners such as jailed african national congress leader nelson 
mandela 
the meeting was requested by terreblanche a charismatic orator 
who often ends his speeches with hitlerstyle salutes 
de klerk who took office in midaugust has offered to meet 
leaders across the political spectrum he conferred last month with 
three prominent antiapartheid church leaders including anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu 
in bloemfontein provincial capital of the orange free state 
seven members of terreblanches movement went on trial today for 
allegedly tarandfeathering mayor gus gouws of the town of welkom 
because he permitted a multiracial foot race 
also today leaders of the african national congress said 
government reform moves are being undercut by action against the 
news media and a threat to suspend a leading antiapartheid 
newspaper 
home affairs minister eugene louw has accused the new nation 
newspaper of promoting the public image of the anc and warned 
the newspaper it could face a suspension of up to three months 
the weekly newspaper published by the southern african catholic 
bishops conference was shut down for three months in 1988 but 
maintained an aggressive antigovernment stance after returning to 
newsstands 
the south african government is mounting a campaign against 
the press said andrew mlangeni one of seven anc leaders 
released from prison last month 
such a crackdown will undermine any government attempt to create 
a climate that can make meaningful negotiations possible 
mlangeni said on behalf of the anc leaders 
under state of emergency regulations the government has wide 
powers of censorship and may close publications for up to three 
months without having to justify its action in court

doomed he said referring to the democratic turnhalle alliance

turgut ozal premier for the past six 
years was sworn in as president today in a parliament ceremony 
boycotted by opposition parties he named yildirim akbulut speaker 
of parliament as the new premier 
in his inaugural address ozal said one of turkeys main aims 
should be to occupy its distinguished place in the european 
community and he called for reform he said is necessary to 
become an ec member 
all 155 opposition deputies also stayed away from the 450seat 
parliament when ozal was elected president oct 31 all but 20 of 
the 283 deputies of ozals motherland party voted for him 
ozal 62 swore to be free of all bias and to uphold the secular 
republic all its laws and democracy cannons fired 101 salvos to 
mark his inauguration 
ozal proposed that a standing committee on human rights be 
established in the parliament and that judicial reform be 
undertaken 
the appointment of akbulut a member of the governing motherland 
party who has served as speaker since 1987 came as a surprise he 
had not been mentioned among the frontrunners for the job 
parliament must approve the appointment and is likely to vote next 
week 
ozal appointed the 54yearold lawyer apparently because he was 
hardpressed to find a candidate acceptable to all factions of the 
party that includes liberals moslem fundamentalists and 
ultranationalists political analysts said 
the premierdesignate is considered a moderate and exteremely 
loyal to ozal he served as interior minister in one of ozals 
cabinets before the 1987 general election 
ozal succeeds kenan evren leader of a 1980 military coup in a 
speech at a second ceremony evren proposed that the constitution 
be changed to allow voters to elect the president directly 
ozal sought and won the presidency at a time when popular 
support for his freemarket policies had plummeted to about 17 
percent according to recent public opinion polls 
the opposition which includes the social democrat populist 
party and the centrist true path party led by former premier 
suleyman demirel contended that ozal lacked a popular mandate and 
could not be the nonpartisan president required by the constitution 
the presidency is a highly respected post but has little 
executive power he can veto legislation but parliament can 
overturn his vetoes he can refuse to appoint cabinet ministers 
suggested by the premier but this authority has been used 
sparingly in the past 
however ozals successor as premier is handpicked and he 
remains the power in turkey 
ozal served as premier after his motherland party won the 1983 
general elections that ended three years of military rule he is 
credited with the success of turkeys 1980 economic rescue program 
and liberalization that brought exportled growth

moslem fundamentalists scored a major 
victory today in jordans first general election in 22 years 
capturing at least 26 seats in an 80member parliament former 
government officials faired poorly 
the islamic fundamentalists who call for stricter moslem laws 
and the elimination of israel swamped their opponents in districts 
throughout the country according to early results 
the victory appeared to be a setback for king hussein who had 
appealed to voters to separate religion from politics islamic 
activists and leftists easily outnumber declared progovernment 
deputies 
among the victors was mansour murad convicted in greece of 
participating in the 1969 grenade attack by palestinian guerrillas 
on the athens office of israels state airline el al that killed 
a child and wounded 14 other people 
greece freed him in 1970 to win the freedom of 55 hostages 
aboard a hijacked olympic airways jetliner 
murad edged a member of the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood to 
win the seat in ammans 3rd district reserved for circassians a 
group of 19th century caucasian refugees who settled in jordan 
most results had been officially reported this afternoon but 
those for several large districts remained unclear 
official announcements gave the moslem brotherhood 19 seats and 
they were expected to pick up another five when all results were 
tallied 
independent islamic activists some allied with the brotherhood 
won seven seats and were expected to pick up about three more 
although parties have been banned in jordan since 1957 the 
government allowed the brotherhood to operate as a charitable 
organization in part to counter the influence of leftist groups 
radical leftists won only four to five seats and leftist arab 
nationalists at least nine progovernment figures tribal leaders 
and centrists got about 20 seats and were likely to pick up a few 
more 
more than 62 percent of the 877000 eligible voters cast 
ballots interior ministry spokesman salameh hamad said the 
elections involved 647 candidates including 12 women who were able 
to vote and seek office for the first time none seemed likely to 
win 
womens rights activist toujan faisal who won international 
attention when islamic fundamentalists filed a lawsuit accusing her 
of abandoning her faith was trounced 41 by a moslem brotherhood 
candidate 
several prominent progovernment figures were defeated 
including former public works minister shafiq zawaideh and former 
industry minister hamdi tabaa 
by far the biggest winners appeared to be brotherhood candidates 
the people want islam and it is not strange for our country 
and our people to have such a large number of moslem candidates 
winning said brotherhood spokesman ziad abu ghanimeh 
the last nationwide election occurred in april 1967 two months 
before israel captured the west bank represented by half the 
deputies in the old parliament 
it was the first nationwide election since jordan renounced 
claims on the west bank in favor of the palestine liberation 
organization 
the parliament must pass all laws and budgets and can reject 
cabinets something previous legislatures have done several times 
in the past 
the king remains the center of authority he can dissolve 
parliament at any time and for 22 years has ruled by martial law

former crewmen of a oildrilling ship 
that capsized during a typhoon said the flatbottomed vessel was 
not fit for rough weather the ships us owners blamed faulty 
weather forecasting 
the 5373ton panamanianflagged seacrest operated by unocal of 
los angeles overturned friday as typhoon gay rolled through the 
gulf of thailand killing more than 300 people 
the storm was the worst to hit the country in 35 years 
only six of the 97 people aboard seacrest are known to have 
survived the typhoon twentyfive bodies have been found but the 
rest of the crew remains missing all seven american crew members 
were feared dead 
that drill ship was made for moderate tropical waters it was 
never designed to withstand the sort of excessive seas that it took 
on friday said douglas whittaker a crewman on the seacrest for 
10 years 
he said he was called to help in the rescue operation because of 
his knowledge of the ships layout 
whittaker another seacrest crewman and relatives of men lost 
aboard the ship also accused unocal of disregarding weather 
forecasts and of failing to mount effective rescue efforts 
the bangkok newspaper the nation reported today that some 
relatives of missing or dead crewmen were considering legal action 
against unocal 
unocal has denied the seacrest was unseaworthy senior company 
executives have cited poor weather forcasting as a reason for the 
loss of the ship and admitted some shortcomings in rescue attempts 
john f imle jr chairman of unocal thailand said at a news 
conference wednesday no company boats were able to approach the 
seacrest until about eight hours after it capsized 
the nation quoted kriangkrai korwattana head of the 
meteorological center in the southern port of songkhla as saying 
unocal had ignored repeated storm warnings 
they had three days to decide what to do he was quoted as 
saying 
the other former seacrest crewman a relative of a man missing 
in the disaster accused unocal of being complacent about weather 
conditions in the normally calm gulf 
if this was the north sea the safety standards would be very 
different he said 
the seacrest capsized in the platong field one of several being 
explored for natural gas by unocal

the sandinista government enters 
bargaining with the contras today with an offer to free all 
political prisoners but only after half the rebel force is 
dismantled and all sandinista captives are freed 
the leftist governments revised plan for disbanding the 
usbacked rebels offers few new elements it goes part of the way 
toward meeting contra demands but carries a threat of renewed war 
at the heart of the talks is a 3monthold regional pact to 
demobilize the contra force about 12000 fighters based in jungle 
camps in honduras by dec 5 president daniel ortega of nicaragua 
is determined the deadline be met 
national elections are scheduled for next feb 25 and could be 
at risk if fighting resumes after 19 months of relative quiet 
the negotiations are taking place at un headquarters in new 
york and include a joint unorganization of american states 
commission as well as sandinista and contra delegates 
the commission was set up by the aug 7 peace accord signed in 
tela honduras by ortega and four other central american 
presidents its mission is to supervise and verify the 
demobilization 
in miami today the contras announced the formation of a new 
civilianmilitary commission to act as the governing body in 
place of the old directorate several of whose members have 
returned to nicaragua 
contra spokesman alejandro acevedo said the un negotiating 
team headed by the contras military commander enrique bermudez 
has recognized the new commission which includes only one of the 
former directors aristides sanchez 
as part of the peace accord in exchange for the dissolution of 
the contras ortega moved up the election date from 1991 and 
pledged free and fair campaigning and balloting under the 
supervision of international observers 
the most significant items in the sandinistas new 15point 
proposal were an offer to release all political prisoners and a 
statement guaranteeing the contras their human and civil rights 
even so these offers are conditional the political prisoners 
would be released only after half the contra force has been 
demobilized and after all nicaraguans claimed by the sandinistas to 
have been kidnapped by the rebels have been freed 
similarly the human and civil rights guarantee is for those 
rebels who lay down their arms and return to nicaragua 
contra leaders say they distrust sandinista promises they 
demand an unconditional general amnesty and so far have made no 
move to demobilize 
among nine point in the sandinista proposal that are not new is 
one urging the us congress to put toward contra demobilization 
the nonlethal aid it has approved to maintain the rebels as a 
fighting force 
if the contras dont accept this plan they will be voting for 
war ortega told a news conference 
the sandinistas also have offered to suspend arms imports until 
april 25 
the soviet union said in may it stopped shipping arms to 
nicaragua at the end of 1988 but paul wolfowitz a us defense 
department undersecretary said last week that other soviet bloc 
nations and cuba have continued sending weapons 
the sandinistas have also offered to reinstate the ceasefire 
ortega suspended on nov 1 and to withdraw the huge military 
machinery the government has since deployed so contras in nicaragua 
can return to honduras 
the reverse of this offer is that if the contras dont agree to 
demobilize the sandinistas could launch an offensive to wipe out 
the 6500 contras the government says are in nicaragua 4000 of 
whom are said to have infiltrated in the past month 
stepped up fighting could make campaigning for the elections 
difficult if not impossible in many places and disrupted balloting 
could fuel opposition claims that the sandinistas were never 
serious about free elections 
the un security council is sending a 625member border patrol 
force to stop the contra infiltration from honduras and to 
interdict shipments of nicaraguan and cuban weapons the state 
department says are being made to leftist rebels in el salvador 
the pact that ortega and the presidents of honduras el 
salvador guatemala and costa rica signed calls for the 
voluntary demobilization of the rebels force but the contras 
were not a party to the agreement 
honduras the only party that could force the contras off its 
territory rejected ortegas invitation to take part in the 
negotiations saying it never has recognized the contras legally as 
an insurgent force 
it later relented and sent a delegation to the talks but only 
as observers 
by attending only as an observer honduras apparently hopes to 
project an image of cooperation in the regional peace effort while 
avoiding a decision on the contras and possibly angering its ally 
the united states 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the roman catholic archbishop of 
managua also was to attend as an observer he is the only figure 
in nicaragua whose moral authority is recognized and respected by 
both sides 
ortega has told his negotiating team it must not leave the un 
meeting without a signed accord

a consumer health group today asked congress 
to revoke an agreement between a cigarette manufacturer and the 
national archives which the group says smears the bill of rights 
with the blood of all americans killed as a result of smoking 
the august agreement makes philip morris companies inc part of 
an archives campaign to commemorate the bicentennial of the bill of 
rights 
a nationally televised public service announcement that is a 
part of the campaign includes the voices of president kennedy and 
martin luther king over images of the bill of rights and scenes 
from civil rights demonstrations the announcement identifies 
philip morris as the sponsor 
this joint venture smears the bill of rights with the blood of 
all americans killed as a result of smoking marlboro and other 
philip morris cigarettes said sidney wolfe director of public 
citizen health research group in a letter to sen jeff bingaman 
bingaman a new mexico democrat heads the government affairs 
committees subcommittee on government information which has 
jurisdiction over the archives 
the campaign has nothing to do with cigarettes its about the 
celebration of the bill of rights guy l smith vice president 
of corporate affairs for philip morris said today 
we are only identified at the very end of the announcement and 
we consciously separated the identification of the company from the 
messages about the themes of the bill of rights smith said 
were just sponsoring the messages and the archives is helping us 
to make sure theyre historically accurate 
smith added that as of this morning 200056 people had 
requested a copy of the bill of rights offered by philip morris 
the bill of rights belongs to everybody said smith 
likening his companys sponsorship of the campaign to that of 
american express raising money to refurbish the statue of liberty 
efforts to reach national archivist don wilson by telephone were 
unsuccessful 
the agreement is the first such cooperative effort and 
launches the national archives endeavor to engage the corporate 
world in supporting events related to americas documentary 
heritage wilson said in a nov 1 announcement 
the agreement with philip morris allows the company to obscure 
its deadly role in american and worldwide society and should be 
reversed said wolfe who founded the health research group in 1971 
with consumer advocate ralph nader 
under the agreement philip morris donates 600000 to the 
national archives trust fund and is permitted to publish or 
broadcast announcements as part of the bill of rights bicentennial 
commemoration using voices of prominent americans such as former 
presidents 
what would martin luther king or harry truman think if they 
knew their voices were being made available by the national 
archives in order to improve the image of a company with the deadly 
record of philip morris asked wolfe in his letter 
wolfe said archives staff have told him 475000 of the 
companys contribution will go to build an exhibit gallery in the 
national archives building and the remaining 125000 will give the 
company the first charter membership in an association yet to be 
established that will solicit corporate donations to do the work 
of the archives

california has ordered deodorant 
makers to give up smogforming aerosol propellants or find a way to 
reduce the pollution they create 
this landmark action requires manufacturers to use more 
environmentally acceptable substitutes if they choose to continue 
selling aerosols and will likely set a precedent for other consumer 
product actions that follow jananne sharpless chairwoman of the 
state air resources board said in a statement 
manufacturers and industry experts said the move against 
underarm sprays could open the door to restrictions on other 
aerosol products such as hair spray and prompt some manufacturers 
to pull their products out of california 
hydrocarbons are used as a propellant to spray many products 
they became popular after 1978 when chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
were banned in the united states because of their danger to the 
ozone layer hydrocarbons cause no known damage to the ozone but 
combine with other pollutants to create smog 
the air resources board on wednesday gave manufacturers of 
antiperspirants and deodorants until 1992 to reduce smogcreating 
hydrocarbons by 20 percent the order also calls for an additional 
60 percent cut by 1995 
manufacturers will be given the option of providing a plan to 
comply with the ruling by 1999 using yettobe developed products 
that spray without polluting the delay will allow time for safety 
testing 
the board suggested the use of substitute propellants and such 
mechanical features as pumps 
the order could lead manufacturers to concentrate on sales of 
rollon and solid antiperspirants and deodorants which account for 
75 percent of sales in california 
there already are more environmentally acceptable alternatives 
for aerosol deodorants that are being purchased by three out of 
every four californians ms sharpless said 
manufacturers said they were not sure of the rulings impact but 
suggested board members were opening the way for restrictions on 
other products 
their intention is to ban aerosols this is step no 1 the 
only reason they arent putting an outright ban is because there 
would be a hundred lawsuits said george c dietrich president 
of diversified cpc international a manufacturer based in illinois 
edward haiden an economic consultant from washington said some 
manufacturers may simply decide not to do business in california 
most companies couldnt have a twoproduct distribution system 
one for california and another for the rest of the nation he 
said 
deodorant makers had earlier appealed to the board because they 
felt the restrictions would cost millions of dollars and have 
little effect on pollution 
we believe the emission reduction is so small that it doesnt 
warrant this kind of treatment said ralph engel of the chemical 
specialty manufacturers association 
the board has authority over the quality of californias air 
and its order on aerosols does not need the legislatures approval 
the action was taken in conjunction with the first phase of a 
20year threepart plan approved in august to help smoggy southern 
california meet federal cleanair requirements the first phase 
also will include a ban on barbecue lighter fluid and restrictions 
on smokestack emissions 
spray underarm deodorants and antiperspirants release about five 
tons of pollutants into the air statewide every day the board said

when the orange sunset glows on the white 
wood frame houses along ninth street most of the neighbors of 
crack alley know its time to get off the streets 
but federal drug czar william bennett didnt see the area of 
northcentral wichita at its worst during his visit today the 
tiredlooking but homey neighborhood seems quiet during daylight 
hours 
bennett met with law officers and substance abuse experts at 
city hall where police chief rick stone boasted you spend about 
1 million in this community and well show you what hometown 
usa can do to clean up its own act 
the nations drug policy chief gave assurances that the 
government is devoting more money to fighting drugs but he said 
i didnt bring my checkbook with me im not the secretary of 
treasury im in charge of drug policy 
during the day here the old twochair barber shop operates and 
dilapidated paintstarved turner drug with its 1950s soda fountain 
decor is open for business a few residents visit with each other 
outdoors kids gather on the playground at dunbar school 
its a different world after dark 
as soon as night falls the neighborhood begins its deadly 
transformation children are whisked into homes by their parents 
laidback corner dwellers abandon the sidewalks and the shadows 
that congregate near no loitering signs dont promise comradery 
during the past year several blocks on either side of ninth 
street have become a freefire zone for dealers and buyers of crack 
cocaine during the past three months four people have died from 
gunfire there three people were wounded last week 
police investigating assaults and homicides are sometimes 
frustrated because the number of fresh and old shell casings on the 
ground make it difficult to sort out usable evidence 
there is shooting every night said larry phillips 34 a 
lifelong wichitan who still hangs around the area to visit friends 
they dont always hit somebody sometimes they just shoot up in 
the air to scare people 
phillips said he was nearby when 20yearold lisa lang was 
struck by a stray bullet oct 28 while visiting with friends lang 
who was eight months pregnant died her baby was delivered by 
caesarean section but died four hours later 
the 18yearold suspect is charged in another crack alley 
shooting two days earlier at the same intersection the teenage 
victim told police he was walking away from an argument between a 
drug dealer and some women when the dealer shot him in the arm and 
leg 
it used to be a good fun place where you could go hang with 
your partners not any more said a woman who was with larry 
phillips on tuesday night i come down here to get my honey but 
i stay away from whats going on 
there was fear in her voice when a white reporter who had 
offered the black couple a ride started to drive toward one of the 
local hangouts a liquor store with scantily stocked shelves and 
wire and wroughtiron protected windows 
if youre going this way im going to duck down because they 
see me driving around with a white man i might get shot as a snitch 
next time im out on the street she said 
police have increased patrols in the area for months but the 
violence continues last weekend a 60yearold man who was 
awaiting trial on drug charges was stabbed to death 
most of the cocaine is brought in by dominicans who control much 
of the crack trade in new york city police say wichita has seen 
drugs before but never such drugrelated violence 
an 80yearold woman who has lived in the neighborhood since the 
1930s said she hears gunfire sometimes at night after she turns off 
her television 
i just try not to pay attention to it because the more i 
think about it the worse i feel she said asking not to be 
identified for fear of reprisal 
i dont feel too afraid unless somebody comes knocking on my 
door or something but i dont answer my door

west german chancellor helmut kohl arrived 
today for a sixday visit that will take him to auschwitz and the 
ethnic german region of krzyzowa 
it marked the first visit to poland by a west german leader 
since 1977 and kohls first meeting with new prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki kohl brought a 1 billion aid package that the first 
noncommunist government in the east bloc hopes will help secure 
democratic reforms 
mazowiecki the former solidarity editor elected two months ago 
and several other top polish government officials greeted kohl at 
warsaws okecie airport 
kohl exchanged words with school children in the welcoming party 
before leaving for talks with mazowiecki 
earlier today sources disclosed that kohls visit to the 
auschwitz concentration camp had been changed because the head of 
west germanys jewish community heinz galinski said he could not 
join the event on the sabbath 
among the 4 million victims of the holocausts most infamous 
concentration camp were 25 million jews 
polish and west german officials arranging the trip held an 
emergency meeting today and agreed that kohl and the others would 
go to auschwitz on sunday 
emotional sensitivity still runs high in both nations which have 
yet to overcome memories of old territorial disputes and the legacy 
of the nazi era 
polish discomfort over a visit by kohl to gora sw anny known 
in german as annaberg the site of a bloody battle in 1921 over 
whether the area should go to poland or germany forced a search for 
another place for kohl to meet with ethnic germans 
so instead kohl will travel on sunday to krzyzowa a silesian 
town where nazi resisters met during the war jaroslaw szczepanski

congressional leaders agreed today to allow 
the senate to debate president bushs proposed capitalgains tax 
reduction but there appeared little chance it would clear congress 
the agreement was announced by house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash he said the house would pass in a new bill the 
capitalgains cut that it approved on sept 28 as part of a 
deficitreduction plan 
senate republicans would offer their own capitalgains cut as a 
substitute for the house plan and the debate would center on the 
gop proposal 
however neither proposal is likely to become law this year 
because most senate democrats are opposed it would take 60 votes 
to cut off a democratic filibuster against a capitalgains cut and 
even senate republican leader bob dole acknowledged today that 
chances of getting that many votes are iffy 
bush and republicans failed in earlier attempts to attach a 
capitalgains cut to the senate deficitreduction bill and to a 
measure raising the governments borrowing authority some 
lawmakers feared that if they engaged in a lengthy debate those 
bills could be jeopardized 
in next weeks debate capital gains will not be tied to any 
other issue dole noted that excuse will be gone he said 
either they are for or against capital gains no more excuses 
present law taxes capital gains which are profits from the sale 
of investments at the same rates as wages and other incomes 
during his campaign last year bush proposed a lower tax on capital 
gains as a way to spur investment and economic growth 
democratic leaders oppose a capitalgains tax cut on grounds 80 
percent of the benefits would go to those with incomes above 
200000 a year they also say that restoring a preferential tax 
rate for capital gains would begin the unraveling of the landmark 
1986 tax overhaul 
with the backing of 64 democrats bush was able to win a 
reduction in the house but the effort stalled in the senate 
the housepassed proposal would exempt 30 percent of capital 
gains from taxation until 1992 starting in 1992 the system would 
be indexed so that the portion of gains caused by inflation 
would not be taxed 
the plan proposed by senate republicans would allow an exemption 
based on how long an asset was held if property was owned for more 
than a year 5 percent of the profit would be taxexempt the 
exempt portion would increase by 5 percentage points each year to a 
maximum of seven years thus 35 percent of profit from the sale of 
an asset owned more than seven years would escape taxation 
the gop plan also includes an expansion of individual retirement 
accounts unlike present iras which provide tax deductions for 
some workers at the time a deposit is made the gop iras would 
offer no tax benefit until the money is withdrawn for retirement 
or education or medical expenses

victorious black democrats toured the capitol 
today and l douglas wilder said his triumph in the virginia 
governors race proved americans have come of age republicans 
were debating whether their 1989 election debacle was an ominous 
sign about their prospects for the much heavier ballot slate in 
1990 
during a meeting with senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine wilder joked about the narrowness of his margin a 
majority his republican opponent still questions 
turning to david dinkins the mayorelect of new york city 
wilder congratulated him and other democrats some of whom had 
landslide victories like i did 
wilder was asked if racism was the reason he ran behind other 
democratic candidates for statewide office and he replied it 
says i had a very negative campaign being waged against me and my 
ticketmates didnt 
americans have come of age wilder said what was preached 
and practiced for some time has come full cycle 
i dont think doug is saying that racism is not a factor in 
elections said dinkins but i do believe that tremendous 
progress has been achieved but things are not perfect in our land 
to be sure its racism on the wane its not as great as it 
was 
democrats were jubilant as they tallied gains that included the 
governors mansion in new jersey as well as the state assembly and 
the election of blacks as governor of virginia and mayor of new 
york city 
analysts of political trends among blacks hailed not only the 
results in virginia and new york but also in such cities as 
seattle new haven conn cleveland and durham nc as a new 
direction 
democratic party chairman ron brown appearing with wilder and 
dinkins said he believes the election demonstrated that the 
republican partys stance on abortion is an untenable position 
he said he believes president bush has painted himself into a 
corner by taking a strong antiabortion position 
brown said tuesdays election results show the democratic party 
is not only alive and well but strong and getting stronger 
standing between wilder and dinkins the chairman praised the two 
blacks as men who projected themselves as mainstream democrats 
whose appeal transcended race 
weve built tremendous momentum he said we think its an 
important building block as the party looks to the 1990 
congressional elections and the 1992 race for the white house 
in virginia republican j marshall coleman said the outcome of 
the governors race was still in doubt he said that if the 
official vote tally due in four more days shows wilders victory 
margin in the governors race is as narrow as expected he will ask 
for a recount 
the unofficial tally showed wilder leading coleman by about 
5500 votes out of a total of 178 million cast virginia law 
authorizes recounts if the difference is less than one half of 1 
percent 
theres no way for the republican party to find any silver 
lining at all in what happened yesterday brown said wednesday 
no time in my lifetime do i ever remember waking up the 
morning after an election where one party had won everything all 
over the country 
the democrats are on a roll said rep beryl anthony of 
arkansas the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee we have recruited better candidates our candidates 
have better mainstream messages and the voters are responding 
many republicans followed the lead of party chairman lee atwater 
in brushing off gop losses with the comment that all politics is 
local 
its hard to see a message said rep mickey edwards of 
oklahoma chairman of the house republican policy committee 
but house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia saw the 
results as a clear warning 
any republican who looks honestly at yesterdays results has 
to be very sobered up and has to be willing to rethink exactly what 
were going to do in 1990 if were going to have a successful 
year said gingrich after a white house postmortem on the 
elections 
sen bob packwood of oregon one of the republican partys 
strongest supporters of abortion rights emerged from the meeting 
and said that if abortion is an issue in 1990 we will just get 
the bejabbers kicked out of us 
gingrich called abortion a very small part of the equation 
we as a party were not big enough we dont run aggressive 
enough campaigns we dont stay in the game fulltime said the 
georgia congressman 
defections on the abortion issue already are beginning in 
massachusetts republican gubernatorial candidate william weld and 
a number of gop state legislators joined democrats in signing a 
petition seeking a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the 
right to abortion 
kate michelman director of the national abortion rights action 
league said the results demonstrated that if george bush and 
members of his party remain beholden to the antichoice minority 
they will pay a tremendous price at the polls 
the lesson that will be learned is that prolife 
candidates cannot waffle and prolife candidates must run as 
aggressively on this issue as proabortion candidates said david 
osteen executive director of the national right to life committee 
bush campaigned for the losers in virginia new jersey and new 
york city his only comment on wednesday was wait till next 
year 
roman popadiuk a white house spokesman who normally specializes 
in foreign affairs handled political questions in the absence of 
press secretary marlin fitzwater and told reporters suffice it 
to say this elections over with were pleased with the victory 
that our candidates have achieved in certain elections and were 
looking forward to the 1990 elections were looking forward 
optimistically to 1990

president bush gave a warm welcome to 
philippines president corazon aquino today and predicted that their 
countries will be able to reach a new agreement governing us 
access to military bases in the philippines 
with mrs aquino standing at his side during a rainspattered 
arrival ceremony on the white house south lawn bush said we are 
confident well mold a new and mutually beneficial longterm 
security partnership in the future 
mrs aquino has remained silent on the issue refusing to say 
whether she believes a continued us military presence in the 
philippines is desireable 
she made no reference to the base issue in her arrival 
statement indicating that the focus of her talks would be on 
economic issues 
asked by reporters about the base issue later while posing for 
photographers with bush mrs aquino noted only that preliminary 
talks begin next month 
in her formal remarks she said we will raise particularly 
the means by which the philippines and the united states can 
cooperate in more ways to our mutual economic benefit we shall 
explore the means to increase trade between two countries with long 
historic ties and deep cultural affinities 
bush spoke warmly of mrs aquinos success in helping restore 
democracy to the philippines after long years of authoritarian rule 
during the marcos era 
he called the philippines a beacon of democracy worthy of 
imitation throughout the world 
after her meeting with bush mrs aquino planned to attend a 
luncheon hosted by secretary of state james a baker iii and meet 
with house and senate leaders she is the guest of honor at a white 
house state dinner tonight 
the two main themes during her visit which ends saturday night 
will be trade and investment 
us support for mrs aquino remains strong but she is not 
expected to match the tumultuous reception she had in 1986 when she 
visited seven months after leading the successful fight to depose 
president ferdinand marcos 
she so charmed congress that lawmakers rammed through a 200 
million aid package for the philippines in record time 
since then the mutual confidence of the two countries has been 
shaken somewhat by acrimonious negotiations last year over the 
terms for the continued us military presence in the philippines 
also contributing to the sense of unease is mrs aquinos 
refusal to rule out the possibility that she might ask united 
states soldiers to leave once the existing agreement on us 
military bases expires in 1991 
mrs aquinos ambivalence reflects the existence of an 
influential minority in the philippines which believes the 
continued us presence at the bases infringes on filipino 
sovereignty 
talks on a new base agreement open next month and us officials 
believe that after considerable wrangling they will conclude with 
agreement that the bases remain 
we think that theres a logic that both parties will see at 
the end that is to say that these facilities do in fact serve 
the interests of both countries in very important ways said a 
us official who briefed reporters tuesday on condition that he 
not be identified 
and i think that will be the compelling fact that will assert 
itself and i think we will have an agreement 
the two principal installations are subic bay naval base and 
clark air base they are considered among the most important us 
military facilities abroad 
congressional attitudes towards the philippines are somewhat 
more tightfisted than before because some lawmakers believe 
economic reform and increased trade would improve living standards 
there more than additional economic aid 
still mrs aquino commands a considerable measure of good will 
both in the united states and in other western democracies 
one example is the commitment among donor countries to provide 
the philippines with 14 billion in aid over five years 
during her stay mrs aquino is expected to stress her 
accomplishments since 1986 including the consolidation of 
democracy the failure of five coup attempts a restoration of 
economic growth and a leveling off of the threat of the marxist 
insurgency

a construction company said thursday it has 
designed a 500story skyscraper for tokyo although there are no 
immediate plans to build it 
the designers would need 25 years and 3262 billion to build 
the 6669foottall aeropolis 2001 said yasuyuki kimura a 
spokesman for ohbayashi corp 
this includes the money necessary to reclaim a 56squaremile 
island in tokyo bay he added 
the project was made possible by japans advanced techniques to 
protect buildings in earthquakes he said 
the tallest building in earthquakeprone japan is the 60story 
sunshine city building in tokyo the 110story sears tower in 
chicago is the worlds tallest building 
yukihisa tokunaga a city planning official of the construction 
ministry said the 500story building is one of a number of private 
plans by major construction firms to meet tokyos growing need for 
office and apartment space 
i understand that none of the plans including what they call 
waterfronts geofronts undergroundpolis and aeropolis has 
been submitted for any government approval tokunaga said 
the ohbayashi building would be able to accommodate 300000 
people aside from office space and residential units it also 
would have space for hotels hospitals parks and convention 
centers 
the design envisions elevators that would reach the top floor in 
15 minutes 
the building is shaped like a triangle becoming smaller at the 
top to help it absorb shock waves it would have a number of 
tunnels to let typhoon winds pass through rather than hitting the 
building with full force 
the japanese archipelago in the worlds most active seismic 
zone is hit each year by some 1000 tremors strong enough to be 
felt three times this century in 1923 1946 and 1948 quake 
deaths have climbed into the thousands the great kanto earthquake 
of 1923 leveled vast areas of tokyo and yokohama killing 140000 
people 
about 25 typhoons develop in the region annually 
in the early 1960s japan developed a technique of building 
flexible structures to replace the rigid construction techniques 
favored for decades 
under the old concept engineers built structures of up to 11 
stories using ferroconcrete solid pillars and walls to absorb 
shock and sustain the buildings weight the new concept called for 
making walls of slabs of reinforced concrete with several slits on 
the surface 
using the new method tokyos 36story 482foottall 
kasumigaseki building was completed in 1968 
tokyo has about 200 buildings of 12 stories or more all erected

the end of deng xiaopings official career leaves 
china without a paramount leader for the first time since he rose 
from disgrace after mao tsetungs cultural revolution to 
undisputed power a decade ago 
deng 85 announced at a communist party meeting thursday he is 
leaving his last party post chairman of the powerful party central 
military commission he also will resign soon as head of the state 
military commission a job with overlapping functions 
his departure was accompanied by a carefully crafted compromise 
that bolsters at least for now the political stature of dengs 
appointed successor new party chief jiang zemin 
jiang 63 was named to succeed deng on the military commission 
a vital post in a nation where the army wields considerable 
political clout his rival for the job hardline president yang 
shangkun becomes first vice chairman 
in another concession to yang a mastermind of the june army 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement his younger brother yang 
baibing an army political commissar was appointed 
secretarygeneral of the military commission 
although deng described jiang a former shanghai party boss with 
a weak power base in beijing as the nucleus of the new 
leadership generation many believe the party leaders political 
fortunes are inextricably tied to dengs physical health 
deng is certain to remain the ultimate authority as long as he 
remains healthy and will protect jiang an economic moderate and 
political conservative 
a diplomat in hong kong said however that if deng dies jiang 
has no chance 
he said jiangs new post on the military commission together 
with the promotion of yangs brother looks like a compromise 
but nothings been really resolved there is no clear sign one 
way or the other 
in a power struggle likely to follow dengs death jiang could 
be trapped between the conservatives led by yang and premier li 
peng and the reform camp now in retreat but capable of a comeback 
one indication the reformers are not yet out was the failure of 
the party meeting to condemn zhao ziyang the reformminded party 
leader who was purged in june after being accused of supporting the 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
there had been speculation the party would recommend criminal 
charges against zhao who has been under house arrest since the 
crackdown the lack of further criticism indicates he still has the 
respect of many party leaders including deng 
the paramount leader has nurtured such reformers as zhao who 
carried out his bold ideas on economic reform but deng also has 
managed to keep the old ideologues at bay by adopting a 
conservative line on political dissent 
in the past two years deng has permitted the dismissal of two 
proteges the late party chief hu yaobang and zhao to keep his 
reforms intact 
in perhaps his last balancing act the man deng has put on the 
tightrope this time is jiang a relatively obscure politician with 
the formidable task of avoiding political disarray while leading a 
nation of 1 billion people toward economic prosperity

should blaze the trail to poland

45 years twothirds of this city are slums as in all of poland 
twothirds should be demolished and rebuilt all the cars should be 
replaced they shouldnt be used so in america where is there 
business opportunity there or here but first clear the trail 
clear it like columbus and then there will an influx of

in advance and i will in fact be there only symbolically and to 
be free and to get the health insurance so i can go to the doctor 
but if it is going to be as hard plowing as it is now then i

on his influence on the government 
no i dont have it and i dont want to have it i have been 
building and i am building political pluralism and if there is an 
elected government it should do its own work the last time i 
allowed myself to be used manipulated into posing for pictures 
with all the solidarity candidates for the elections that was 
the last time i will not allow that again it politics should be 
based on a program if i have been criticizing this government and 
i have done it a few times it is for not speeding up completion of 
political pluralism that makes it difficult to create new and 
better programs i dont criticize them for other things because 
they are new they are learning but it must complete political 
reforms and the sooner the better

on solidaritys influence 
today we are building things and pluralism and there is no one 
else to build them and tomorrow we will make demands just like 
other unions and we will be not loved just like other unions 
arent and maybe we should not be called solidarity anymore 
we needed solidarity to fight for reforms to unite us and to 
share the burden but later on in our work we should take down 
this banner fold it preserve it and put it in a trunk so that 
our children when things get bad again can take it out and fight 
against us 
that is what i think but will democracy allow me to do it 
because what we are building is against us because i should be 
striving so that everything is controlled by solidarity the 
party the government the economy everything solidarity led by 
walesa but that is not what its all about i cannot replace one 
monopoly with another one so whatever i build it will be against 
me because pluralism and democracry are guided by their own rules 
it takes some ideas away and it is pushing me and us more and more 
to the side it is tough but that is how it has to be

on whether the communist system is finished 
a long time ago but it all depends on what we understand by 
communism if you understand the monopoly of one party 
monopoly over everything then that has been over for a long time 
it cannot be maintained but certain slogans in different 
conditions can still do a lot of things and they may be very 
popular but there can be no limitation of freedom and pluralism 
anymore if communism corrects these two things and a few other 
minor things then it will not be entirely a stupid ideology 
someday when people forget about all its sins

yes but it is not important to me i am supposed to fight with

i dont really want it but i have been using it because i 
would be stupid not to my stomach aches when i am in a syrenka an

rapid and radical change in the soviet union 
and eastern europe has divided nato and could lead to a looser 
alliance in the next decade the former chairman of the us joint 
chiefs of staff said thursday 
the picture today is muddier than ive seen it in my 25 years 
of experience with nato retired adm william j crowe jr said 
at a congressional joint economic committee hearing on future 
national security needs 
crowe said the western alliance is sharply split between 
cautious response and the desire of some to undertake headlong 
reductions in military might us efforts to spread defense 
costs more equitably among alliance members will likely have little 
effect he said 
the countries of western europe are going to spend less on 
defense no matter what we do crowe told the panel ultimately 
nato will probably remold itself into a looser arrangement 
probably with reduced us participation 
such an outcome also would reduce american influence over 
european affairs crowe said 
the rapid restructuring occurring in the soviet union and the 
political and economic reforms it has touched off in countries such 
as poland and hungary are stunning said crowe who retired 
last month as the nations top military officer 
i never thought it would happen in my lifetime 
its too early to say what impact the changes will have on 
ussoviet relations crowe said calling the situation a very 
uncertain strategic transition the future aint what it used 
to be 
us planners should be very cautious about making any 
sudden cut in military spending he said 
we should use the first rule of wing walking said crowe 
referring to the barnstorming acrobats of decades past never let 
go of something until youve got ahold of something else 
crowe said it was too soon to pronounce the cold war over but 
said it could happen if the united states and the soviet union 
reach arms control agreements on strategic nuclear weapons and 
conventional forces in europe 
but even if those trends play out successfully he said the 
soviets will still have a 4 million member military force 
we have to fashion some kind of security relationship with the 
soviet union he said 
as such a relationship is forged regional instabilities around 
the world will assume a greater role in us calculations of 
security needs he said mentioning the persian gulf the middle 
east and latin america

galileo fired its thrusters today to 
start the first of about 30 course corrections the craft will make 
during its sixyear 24billionmile journey to jupiter 
so far everything is going just fine said neal ausman 
galileo mission director at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
during the threeday maneuver which started at 831 am pst 
galileo will fire its thrusters in pulses of no more than two 
minutes each 
the maneuver is meant to aim galileo for its flight past venus 
in february the spacecraft will swoop by venus once and earth 
twice so the planets can act as gravity slingshots to propel 
galileo toward jupiter during the 19 billion mission 
galileo was launched from space shuttle atlantis on oct 18 
in 1995 it will separate into an orbiter and a probe the 
orbiter will circle jupiter for 22 months and the probe will 
plunge into the planets atmosphere to take measurements for 75 
minutes until it is crushed by intense pressure 
galileo was about 455 million miles from earth today and 585 
million miles from venus it was traveling at 60376 mph relative 
to the sun

its too cold here and sometimes i work until three oclock 
in the morning id have no place to keep my children said marlso declining

informal tent camp in town to the red cross shelter three miles up 
routeia 
hernandez a 152 
the other six people sanchez brought from the quake victims 
camp at callaghan park to see the shelter also said no 
too far from work one said no privacy inside the fairgrounds 
gym said another too cold in the tents scattered across the 
grounds said a third 
its their prerogative sanchez said id like to see them 
come out here but im in no position to force them 
their refusal highlighted the challenges relief workers and city 
officials face in trying to provide for an estimated 480 people in 
this largely hispanic city still displaced from the oct 17 quake 
about 150 of them have refused to leave their informal tent city 
in callaghan park distrustful of authorities div for meals

us rep arthur ravenel jr today 
dismissed speculation he is quitting the gop for the democratic 
party 
if i was going to switch parties i would hold a press 
conference and i would tell the people at home i was switching 
parties and why the lawmaker said i wouldnt make a switch 
unless i had a compelling reason 
the state newspaper in columbia today quoted unidentified 
sources as saying the 62yearold twoterm congressman feels out 
of step with the republicans and is considering becoming a democrat 
but wants assurances he can keep his committee assignments 
in a telephone interview with the associated press from his 
washington office today ravenel said he is frustrated because he 
has been unable to obtain a seat on the merchant marine and 
fisheries committee he called the appointment extremely 
important to the health and wealth of his district 
ravenel said if he is rebuffed in his effort to get on the 
committee certainly i would consider my options 
he declined to say what those options might be but when asked 
if they would include defecting to the democratic party he said 
i wouldnt go that far 
in an interview earlier this week ravenel whose coastal 
district includes hilton head beaufort and charleston and was 
battered by hurricane hugo in september expressed disenchantment 
with the gop the state reported 
he said he had been criticized by conservatives in south 
carolina for his recent support of funding for abortion in cases of 
incest or rape and for backing some spending measures 
im just not a rightwinger im a moderate and it just 
drives some of the republicans back home up the wall ravenel was 
quoted as saying i could just as easily be a democrat as a 
republican 
but ravenel said today those comments were a lot of old stuff 
ive been saying for a long time 
the congressman said that he draws on support from democrats as 
well as republicans at election time his district had been 
historically democratic before it went for ronald reagan in 1980 
if ravenel switched parties it would be a coup for the 
democrats in part because it would happen in gop national 
committee chairman lee atwaters backyard 
a switch by ravenel also would come on the heels of the 
democrats sweep of tuesdays major elections in new jersey 
virginia and new york city

two dozen americans held posters lighted candles 
and heard speeches outside the us embassy in a protest of the 
us governments abortion policy that drew puzzled looks and 
laughter from soviet passersby 
its incomprehensible its absurd one elderly woman said 
after stopping to read a poster that said in russian return my 
body 
the americans who are studying russian or working in moscow 
called the demonstration in advance of more than 1000 rallies and 
other events by abortion rights activists in 150 us cities 
scheduled sunday 
the protesters assembled on the sidewalk outside the embassys 
main entrance an area crammed with armenians and jews who want to 
emigrate to the united states the timing of the protest during 
the evening rush hour also drew curious passersby 
one woman stopped to ask what the protest was about and when 
told it concerned restrictions on abortions in the united states 
she said with a laugh and smile come to us well do it 
abortion is the primary form of birth control in the soviet 
union and each woman has an average of nine abortions 
one speaker said that like americans soviet women have been 
deprived of the choice to have an abortion here the woman said 
soviets must have abortions because they have no contraceptives 
soviet police guarding the embassy entrance watched without 
trying to stop the protest 
laurie essig 24 a protester who studies at the pushkin russian 
language institute said the rally was held outside the us 
embassy so government representatives inside could see the 
opposition to the bush administrations abortion policies 
with demonstrations common in moscow on issues ranging from 
democracy to emigration one woman remarked after stopping by the 
abortion protest its become so interesting here you never get 
bored

a trial judge who accused an attorney 
of crying to win a jurys sympathy was justified in erasing a 1 
million judgment in a slipandfall case an appeals court found 
a jury in pensacola returned the verdict against the winndixie 
supermarket chain last year in a lawsuit filed by jim allen nash 
and his wife janice over injuries suffered in a 1986 fall at the 
winndixie store in gulf breeze 
a threejudge panel of the 1st district court of appeal on 
wednesday upheld circuit judge joseph tarbucks decision to throw 
out the verdict 
in particular we note that the amount of the verdict cannot 
be sustained by any view of the evidence and apparently resulted 
from the jury being improperly influenced by passion or 
prejudice the appeal court concluded 
tarbuck said crying by lawyer lefferts mabie who denied 
shedding tears during his closing argument was one reason for his 
decision 
mabie submitted sworn statements from all six jurors saying they 
didnt see him cry and he again denied the allegation thursday 
mabie said he will ask the appeals court to reconsider its decision 
and if that fails the case will be retried

officials thursday hunted for 
every available space including ships and an air raid shelter to 
house the deluge of east german refugees heading into west germany 
the chaos is growing larger and larger said hermann 
heinemann the social services minister of north rhinewestphalia 
state 
the west german government issued a caution to any more east 
germans planning to join the flow of more than 200000 who have 
headed west this year 
every refugee must figure that he will have to live in 
inadequate housing for a fairly long time and will probably be 
living much worse than if he had stayed home said interior 
minister wolfgang schaeuble 
but schaeuble in a speech to parliament said the federal 
government has no intention of turning back any east germans 
amusement parks and vacation apartments are next on the list in 
west germany for possible emergency shelters which already have 
been set up in military barracks camping places and gymnasiums 
refugees also are being housed in hotels temporarily 
the shell oil company said it was making available the 
administration building of a closed plant in the town of monheim 
along the rhine river to provide temporary shelter for 100 refugees 
most of the east germans stay in the shelters or hotels until 
they can move in with relatives or find an apartment in an 
increasingly tight and costly rental market 
there have been increasing predictions of difficulties in 
absorbing the newcomers 
but opposition leader hansjochen vogel said it would be 
erroneous for orthodox communists in east berlin to think they 
could spark a rightwing backlash in west germany by encouraging 
the exodus 
compounding the housing difficulties are the 300000 ethnic 
germans from other parts of eastern europe and the 90000 asyslum 
seekers who have reached west germany so far this year 
the influx also has created problems in finding jobs while 
strapping social services across the country 
heinemann the north rhinewestphalia social services minister 
said the organizational difficulties of handling the east german 
refugees can hardly be overcome 
the social services minister said in duesseldorf the state 
government is hoping to rent eight ships to house 1000 east german 
refugees each while amusement parks and vacation apartments were 
also being targeted 
in the port of bremen social services director hanschristoph 
hoppensack said city officials would set up a temporary shelter in 
an underground air raid shelter 
hoppensack said the east german refugees would move in within 
the next few days but declined to outline specifics 
hanover mayor herbert schmalstieg who also serves as the 
president of west germanys league of cities warned that local 
authorities nationwide would soon be unable to accept either east 
german refugees or ethnic germans 
hanover may soon be forced to take this step schmalstieg 
told reporters on thursday 
but in the southern city of munich officials had another idea 
police say they would like to hear from any refugees who were 
members of the volkspolizei the east german police force 
munich police say they would be happy to consider signing up the 
former vopos as they are called to switch uniforms and start 
patroling the streets of the bavarian capital

two soviet men who came to town to see the 
unveiling of a russian mural have defected 
we have received two asylum applications from soviet citizens 
those applications are pending ronald b swan officer in charge 
of immigration and naturalization service in milwaukee said 
wednesday 
he declined to identify the men but said they defected late last 
week 
they will be allowed to stay in the united states pending a 
review of their applications which could take weeks swan said 
the baked clay mural brought here as part of an art exchange 
program was unveiled last week at the milwaukee art museum 
the two men who defected were not part of the delegation of 
artists and musicians who arrived here by ship with the russian 
mural said jim ohlschmidt a milwaukee participant in the 
ussoviet exchange 
the men flew here for the unveiling at the invitation of two 
women ohlschmidt said 
the men had played host to the women when a delegation from 
milwaukee presented a mural to the residents of leningrad in july 
and the women were returning the favor officials said 
we had no idea this was going to happen it took us by 
complete surprise ohlschmidt said 
joel pfeiffer organizer of the art exchange was quick to 
distance the men from the project 
they are two grown men who made a choice pfeiffer said 
they were not part of the project it should have absolutely no 
effect on the project

the six cases were among 17 people who came down with 
pneumonialike symptoms after the gathering at the best western cow 
palace inn in lamar 
health department spokesman ann lockhart said the department is

cases of legionnaires the four others with confirmed 
legionnaires cases recovered 
two other persons got the disease after staying at the motel 
prior to the reunion sept 2224 however health department 
officials today said they did not include those cases in the 17 
because they cannot be directly linked to the motel 
legionnaires is believed to be caused by bacteria that are 
found in soil and grow in water favoring such places as air 
conditioning ducts storage tanks and rivers 
the disease takes its name from an outbreak at a pennsylvania 
american legion convention held at a philadelphia hotal in 1976 
thirtyfour people died in that outbreak 
epidemiologists took air and water samples from guest rooms and 
common areas of the cow palace last weekend results are expected

the vatican is holding the first exhibit of 
russian religious icons outside the soviet union in what a soviet 
official thursday described as a sign of the rapprochement between 
moscow and the holy see 
pope john paul ii will inaugurate the exhibit friday three 
weeks before his scheduled meeting with president mikhail s 
gorbachev the first between supreme leaders of the vatican and 
kremlin 
the exhibit of 107 medieval icons seven ancient russian 
embroideries and three sculptures was presented to reporters 
thursday by officials of the vatican museums and js melentev 
minister of culture for the russian republic 
we consider this exhibit a concrete step on the road to 
greater mutual understanding with the vatican melentev said 
to underline the improved ties he read the text of a nov 4 
soviet politburo communique which he said would have been 
unthinkable one or two years ago approving the oct 20 meeting 
in moscow between gorbachev and a top vatican foreign ministry 
official archbishop angelo sodano 
gorbachev is scheduled to meet with the pope at the vatican 
during his nov 29dec 1 visit to italy john paul has often 
expressed the wish to visit his flock in the soviet union and 
church officials say the talks with gorbachev could clear the way 
for such a trip 
melentev who will present the exhibit to the pope friday said 
he hopes a papal visit to the soviet union can take place in the 
not too distant future 
the ministers speech was filled with comments indicative of the 
more open attitude toward religion in the officially atheist soviet 
union he spoke of the countrys spiritual roots the improvement 
in eastwest relations and gorbachevs vision of a common 
european home 
we are on the threshold of a new era the third millennium 
since the birth of christ in the name of this fragile common 
home people are ready to abandon old stereotypes and ways of 
thinking melentev said 
he quoted a phrase from author rudyard kipling oh east is 
east and west is west and never the twain shall meet and said 
kipling probably made a mistake because now it is necessary 
for east and west to meet and find a common path step by step not 
only states and governments but all people are moving in this 
direction we should get used to this 
melentev even quoted from the bible a time to scatter stones 
and a time to gather 
the minister also linked last years 1000 anniversary of the 
introduction of christianity in what is now the soviet union with 
tuesdays ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the bolshevik 
revolution 
celebrating the millennium we realized that the october 
revolution was a rupture in our history and we wouldnt want there 
to be a rutpure with our great cultural and spiritual heritage 
he said 
the exhibit at the braccio de carlo magno in st peters 
square opens to the public on saturday and runs through jan 30 
many of the precious works dating from the 13th to the 18th 
century and displayed in various soviet museums were restored in 
moscows grabar center 
the icons represent faces of christ the madonna and child 
saints and scenes of christmas and other religious celebrations

although he gave up most official titles in 
recent years paramount leader deng xiaoping retained ultimate 
power and fashioned a decade of economic reform 
deng 85 resigned thursday from his last formal communist party 
post head of the central military commission an action delayed 
according to reports by the prodemocracy movement crushed in june 
reports indicated deng had hoped to step down after the visit in 
may of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the end of a 30year 
estrangement between the communist giants would have been the 
crowning achievement of dengs career 
the studentled demonstrations for democracy overshadowed the 
gorbachev visit however and led to the bloody military crackdown 
at least among educated chinese deng is likely to be remembered 
more as the hardliner who ordered the army to suppress the 
democracy movement than as the reformer who created economic 
modernization 
deng was born aug 22 1904 as kan zegao son of a wealthy 
landowner in southwest sichuan province and changed his name when 
he joined the communist party more than six decades ago 
he was purged and rehabilitated three times after one purge he 
was jailed called a capitalist roader and paraded through 
beijing wearing a dunce cap 
in 1978 at age 74 he won the power struggle that followed the 
death two years earlier of chairman mao tsetung 
under deng china established normal relations with the united 
states worked out agreements to regain hong kong and macao and 
achieved an unprecedented relaxation of tensions with taiwan seat 
of the rival nationalist government 
he reduced the bloated peoples liberation army by 1 million 
men cut military spending and presided over the first codification 
of civil and criminal law 
the economy grew enormously under dengs stewardship central 
controls were eased and foreign capital flooded in but rapid 
growth created inflation and bribery became commonplace 
political corruption spread and deng was linked to it through 
his son deng pufang who was associated with a company accused of 
tax evasion and other questionable practices 
outrage over corruption by bureaucrats and party functionaries 
culminated in the studentled protests that began in april 
workers intellectuals and pensioners joined in often chanting 
xiaoping step down

president bushs spending request for the strategic defense 
initiative in fiscal 1990 
by a vote of 236172 lawmakers approved legislation that 
provides much of bushs request for landbased nuclear missiles and 
restores some funds for two conventionalarms programs the 
president sought to kill 
the bill provides 38 billion for sdi also known as star wars 
in the fiscal year that began oct 1 about 279 million less than 
the amount spent in fiscal 1989 
the spending level represents the first reduction in the sdi 
program in its sixyear history 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said this budget represents the last deficitdriven 
defense budget what were likely to face next year is the first in 
a series of soviet president mikhail gorbachevdriven defense 
budgets 
but rep ronald dellums dcalif said reductions in the us 
defense budget in response to efforts toward democracy in eastern 
europe should occur this year 
the warsaw pact is crumbling before our eyes and were 
building weapons of destruction said dellums a member of the 
house armed services panel 
the legislation which still must be approved by the senate 
includes approximately 11 billion for the railbased mx 
multiplewarhead missile and the truckbased midgetman 
singlewarhead missile about 150 million less than bush had 
requested for the two nuclear weapons 
the bill also includes house language imposing a 50missile cap 
on the mx 
the bill provides 43 billion for the b2 stealth bomber 
program 430 million less than the adminstration requested it 
provides money for the purchase of two stealth bombers in fiscal 
1990 and components for five of the batwinged aircraft in fiscal 
1991 
the legislation restores some money for the two 
conventionalarms programs bush sought to cancel the marine corps 
osprey tiltrotor aircraft and the navys f14d tomcat 
the osprey an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but can 
fly like a plane will receive about 255 million in research and 
development money but no funds for procurement the future of the 
program would be tied to commercial use of the plane 
the legislation also includes a provision calling for the 
purchase of 18 f14d fighters in fiscal 1990 however the bill 
requires the manufacturer of the f14d grumman corp of new york 
to sign a contract to end future production of the plane

a coalition of national health groups launched 
a campaign thursday to raise awareness of glaucoma especially 
among blacks for whom the disease is the leading cause of blindness 
glaucoma is the secondleading cause of blindness among 
americans overall after diabetic retinopathy but blacks are four 
to six times as likely to get the disease as whites medical 
experts said at a news conference 
awareness is essential because glaucoma has few if any early 
symptoms and if it is detected early blindness can be prevented 
said dr roger mason an associate professor at the howard 
university school of medicine 
an estimated 2 million americans have glaucoma at least 1 
million have lost some sight and 80000 are blind because of it 
the national society to prevent blindness announced a new effort 
to reduce blindness from glaucoma by focusing screening and public 
education on highrisk groups the program will try to get 
physicians to identify those at risk and refer them for complete 
eye exams 
congress designated nov 1218 as national glaucoma awareness 
week 
blacks the elderly diabetics people who are nearsighted and 
those with a family history of glaucoma are at high risk for 
developing the disease caused by a buildup of fluid pressure 
inside the eye the fluid buildup eventually damages nerve cells in 
the eye 
a recent gallup survey found that a majority of adults 
incorrectly believe that a feeling of pressure in the eyes is a 
sign of glaucoma and that eye damage from the disease can be 
corrected 
medical experts say that when detected early the disease 
usually can be controlled and vision loss prevented with drugs in 
the form of eye drops laser treatment or surgery however 
whatever vision is lost cannot be restored 
the disease usually has no early warning signs though it 
sometimes causes loss of side vision difficulty in adjusting eyes 
to the dark and a frequent need for new glasses in its later 
stages glaucoma can cause eye pain blurred vision seeing halos 
around lights nausea and vomiting 
mason said a study he conducted found glaucoma occurs in blacks 
at four to five times the rate in whites while a survey by dr 
harry quigley of johns hopkins university school of medicine found 
the rate as much as six times as high in blacks 
neither study identified the reason blacks are at higher risk 
than whites 
mason said the best way to detect glaucoma is through a 
comprehensive eye exam measuring fluid pressure in the eye the 
most common test used in glaucoma screening doesnt always detect 
the disease he said 
the coalition launching the campaign includes the national eye 
institute national council on the aging national medical 
association american diabetes association lions club

californias board of education today 
bowed to christian fundamentalists and unanimously adopted new 
guidelines on the teaching of evolution that take note of the 
theory of creation 
the board voted 90 to approve the guidelines for science 
textbooks in the biggest school system in the nation with 46 
million students 
the old guidelines said evolution must be taught in schools and 
they offered no guidance to teachers or administrators on dealing 
with questions from students about the biblical theory of creation 
as a result of todays vote the new guidelines hold that some 
people reject the theory of evolution purely on the basis of 
religious faith and that such personal beliefs should be 
respected and not demeaned 
however the new document unlike the old gives evolution a 
central place in science education arguing in detail the 
importance of teaching evolution 
its very clear in the document that evolution will be taught 
and creationism will not said bill honig state superintendent 
of instruction 
the board has been at the center of a struggle with national 
implications that pits religious groups against science teachers 
and administrators who say the theory of evolution is no more 
controversial than gravity or electricity 
in 1985 california education authorities successfully demanded 
that publishers devote more space to evolution and those revised 
textbooks are now being used in schools across the country 
in september the original guidelines were declared a national 
victory for science over dogma by micheal hudson western states 
director for the washingtonbased people for the american way a 
civil liberties group 
the board of education voted on the guidelines after they were 
amended wednesday by the boards policy and planning commission 
eugenie scott executive director of the national center for 
science education said the policy adopted by the commission was 
slightly weaker on evolution than a draft prepared in september 
by a state panel 
its a concession to board members who are knuckling under to 
rightwing religious pressure scott said 
honig said the wording was changed from an earlier draft to make 
it less offensive to those who believe god created the universe 
specifically a sentence was struck that read there is no 
scientific dispute that evolution has occurred and continues to 
occur this is why evolution is regarded as a scientific fact 
the rev louis sheldon of the traditional values coalition said 
creation theory supporters were given crumbs from the table in 
the amendments 
evolution may no longer be called fact directly in the document 
but it says that in other ways he said 
the guidelines provide a detailed explanation of how science 
should be taught in california schools the framework does not 
mandate course content which is determined by local school boards 
but sets standards and goals and influences textbook publishers

calling discrimination against aids patients 
absolutely unacceptable secretary of health and human services 
louis sullivan issued a new call thursday for antidiscrimination 
legislation 
sullivan speaking at a conference on aids and minorities said 
the bush administration is committed to seeing acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome covered under legislation pending in congress 
the americans with disabilities act 
this administration is committed to enacting legislation to 
prohibit such discrimination he said 
sullivan said aids has become a special problem of the 
nations poor and minorities but added this sort of 
usversusthem thinking this is dangerous 
the secretary was on friendly turf at the conference which was 
sponsored by the morehouse school of medicine sullivan an alumnus 
of morehouse college was founding president of the medical school 
before he was appointed to the cabinet by president bush 
sullivan said part of the onus of stopping aids transmitted 
chiefly through sex or drug paraphernalia rests with individuals 
to think and behave in a more constructive way with 
moderation selfcontrol and discipline 
he called for a new ethic of personal responsibility a new 
culture of character not just for aids but for other problems 
such as teen pregnancy and homicide it cannot be brought about 
by federal mandate he said 
he also addressed the overload of aids patients at medical 
facilities from coast to coast 
aids has not caused a crisis in our health care system he 
said aids has simply revealed the preexisting cracks in the 
system 
we have not yet made health care sufficiently available to all 
american citizens we must work to put our entire health care 
system in order

the african national congress an 
antiapartheid organization outlawed in south africa opened an 
office here thursday trying to improve relations with the united 
states 
thabo mbeki the ancs director of international affairs said 
the washington office would seek to persuade the bush 
administration to impose additional economic sanctions against 
south africa 
mbeki told reporters the bush administration in marked contrast 
to its predecessor believes the existing sanctions have already 
forced the south african government to liberalize its policies 
toward the countrys black majority 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen said recently that 
while the administration opposes harsher sanctions at this time it 
would be willing to consider them if no progress is made toward 
blackwhite negotiations in south africa by next summer 
mbeki said the bush administration differs with its predecessor 
on another point clearly the bush administration has moved away 
from the notion that the south african government must be pacified 
pampered pleased he said at a news conference 
while bushs meetings with prominent antiapartheid leaders such 
as archbishop desmond tutu and albertina sisulu are important 
mbeki said the greatest contribution bush could and should make 
is further sanctions 
the sanctions were imposed in 1986 by congress after it 
overrode a veto by former president reagan 
the anc opened a similar office in moscow last year and already 
has about 40 representatives abroad mbeki said 
mbeki whose father govan mbeki was one of seven top anc 
officials released from prison last week after 25 years in 
captivity said the united states appears committed to pushing for 
an end to the racial discrimination policies in south africa 
he said the anc had been encouraged by administration officials 
to open its office here because they know we are central to the 
solution of the south african problem 
the anc is concerned the united states may let up pressure on 
newly elected president fw de klerk who has been liberalizing 
his governments policies toward blacks but has rejected giving 
them the vote and maintains wide powers of arrest and censorship 
if that turns out to be the case mbeki said we have to 
resurrect the pressure 
conservatives in congress contend the anc is funded by the 
soviet union and that its armed wing is supplied by the soviet 
bloc mbeki said there would always be those who dont like us 
but that the question of soviet support was not an issue with 
the administration 
in 1987 thensecretary of state george shultz met with anc 
leader oliver tambo regular meetings have been conducted with the 
groups representatives ever since

east germany said today it was opening its borders 
to the rest of the world and that its citizens can travel or 
emigrate anywhere including through the 28yearold berlin wall 
guenter schabowski a member of the ruling politburo said that 
those who want to visit other countries and then return would still 
need a visa but that the visa requests would be handled without 
delay 
the stunning announcement comes on the heels of a remarkable 
series of events that has shaken this once rigidly controlled 
communist nation 
earlier today new leader egon krenz and schabowski both called 
for free and democratic elections the main demand of a widening 
opposition movement 
earlier this week krenz ousted the politburo and replaced aging 
hardliners with reformers in a desperate move to counter daily 
public unrest and the mass flight of tens of thousands of east 
germans to the west 
communist leaders also decided today to consider even more 
changes in the government hierarchythe communist partys central 
committee set a party conference for dec 1517 
a party conference a forum for making major changes in party 
policy was last held in 1956 the official adn news agency said 
the conference would discuss personnel changes in the 163member 
central committee 
the move to open the borders comes after decades of fencing east 
germans in to prevent their flight to the west the berlin wall has 
divided berlin and the two german nations since 1961 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said free 
travel for east germans would be a very positive development 
that the united states would welcome 
weve been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a 
basic human right weve been talking a long time about open 
borders weve been talking a long time about the importance of 
seeing the wall come down baker said 
schabowski said those who want to emigrate can go to west 
germany directly without having to go through a third country more 
than 50000 east germans have fled through neighboring 
czechoslovakia since saturday and about 200000 have fled this year 
schabowski told reporters in east berlin that the decision was 
made during a central committee meeting he said the decision means 
all east germans can travel over all east german border 
checkpoints 
while stunning changes have taken place at the top daily street 
protests have continued almost unabated for the last several weeks 
about 40000 people demonstrated wednesday night in neubrandenburg 
and near karlmarxstadt for free elections and an end to 
authoritarian oneparty rule adn said 
in the first official soviet comment since krenz reshuffled the 
countrys top leadership foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov told a news briefing in moscow today that it was clear 
east germany was undertaking a renewal of socialism 
theyre improving the situation in the sense that theyre 
moving toward perestroika on their own terms he told a news 
briefing referring to the kremlins current program of reforms 
krenz touched on the volatile topic of multiparty elections in a 
speech to the central committee that was published today in state 
newspapers he called for a new election law that ensures free 
democratic general elections with a secret ballot 
he proposed public supervision in every stage of the 
balloting 
krenz did not say whether he was urging a true multiparty system 
in east germany officials already say elections are democratic 
even though the system guarantees the communists virtually 
unanimous approval 
krenz also promised new laws on freedom of assembly assocation 
and the press but gave no details 
however he did say independent groups might have a role in the 
nations politics as east germany tries to recover from the shock 
of losing more than 200000 mostly young skilled workers to the 
west this year 
schabowski said earlier today that the communists were ready to 
go into free elections without any limits 
if we profess free elections here then we are professing free 
elections without any limits and with all risks that are 
connected schabowski told west germanys westdeutsche rundfunk 
radio 
east germanys prodemocracy opposition groups have made free 
elections their main demand although krenz has repeatedly said 
that any changes cant jeopardize the communist partys leading 
role party dominance also is embodied in the nations 
constitution and a constitutional change would be required to 
abolish it 
guenter hartmann leader of the small national democratic party 
that previously had closely followed communist policy also called 
for free elections today writing in the partys national zeitung 
newspaper he questiioned whether the constitutional article that 
guarantees the partys leading role could still stand 
meanwhile a group of 15 prominent east berlin communist 
intellectuals and officials wrote a letter to the central committee 
suggesting the berlin wall be torn down in the near future 
it is also imaginable even in the foreseeable future that 
the wall will become a relic of the past if an agreement is 
signed with west germany that would prevent damage to the east 
german economy the group said 
the letter appeared today in the berliner zeitung a newspaper 
of the citys communist party organization among those who signed 
it were heinz albrecht secretary for economy with the east berlin 
party leadership and rolf reissig a member of the academy of 
social science of the central committee 
communist authorities built the berlin wall in 1961 to stop an 
exodus to west germany it became a symbol of the differences 
between east and west differences that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev has sought to erase by urging reforms in the soviet bloc 
krenz who assumed power just three weeks ago on wednesday 
purged much of the old guard from the communist partys ruling 
politburo the 21member body was reduced to 11 
the leadership reshuffle swept aside nine aging politburo 
members and brought in four new ones including dresden party chief 
hans modrow seen as a reformer modrow was proposed as the new 
premier when the 44person cabinet resigned en masse tuesday

us officials suspect the soviets of shooting 
lasers at american planes in the pacific recently damaging the 
eyesight of an air force crewman in one of four incidents pentagon 
officials said thursday 
an agreement signed last summer by top us and soviet military 
officials is designed to avoid such military encounters but it 
does not go into effect until jan 1 pentagon officials said 
privately they were dismayed that such incidents could be 
continuing in the meantime 
at a pentagon briefing spokesman pete williams said two soviet 
vessels may have aimed lasers at us aircraft on oct 17 oct 
28 and in two separate incidents on nov 1 over waters off hawaii 
asked whether the matter affected ussoviet ties which have 
been improving the spokesman said only i will not characterize 
the incident beyond describing it 
meanwhile other pentagon officials said the matters are being 
investigated and some expressed irritation that such activity may 
be continuing despite the agreement that is about to take effect 
one senior pentagon official commenting on condition of 
anonymity said laser activity is suspected because of past 
incidents and because of descriptions provided by the military 
personnel involved in the most recent cases 
williams said he could not identify a soviet vessel involved 
pentagon sources said however that it was a military ship that 
was in the waters where soviets have traditionally observed the 
splashdowns for their missile tests 
us planes traditionally observe the movements of such soviet 
ships the sources said 
lasers are sometimes used as rangefinders to target enemy 
aircraft 
the afflicted us crewman a loadmaster aboard an hc130 
aircraft suffered disruption of his color vision headaches and 
other visual problems and is under medical evaluation the pentagon 
sources said 
the crewman had been wearing laser eye protection gear at 
the time and us officials are also investigating why the damage 
could occur despite that equipment the sources said 
in 1987 the copilot of an air force wc135 suffered vision 
problems when she observed a nearby us navy reconnaissance 
aircraft illuminated by a laser that was determined to have 
come from the soviet ship chukotka the vessel was operating off 
hawaii near the target zone of a soviet missile test 
the air force said at the time the crew members vision was 
affected for about 10 minutes and that the damage was not believed 
permanent 
williams noted that it is now standard procedure for us 
personnel in such areas to wear protective eye gear in order to 
avoid damage from the intense beams of light 
he offered these details of the most recent incidents 
on oct 17 the injured crewman aboard an hc130 experienced 
what may have been possible laser illumination about 1200 
miles southwest of hawaii as the plane was observing a soviet ship 
on oct 28 the flight crew of a navy p3 observation plane 
again reported the possible laser illumination from the same soviet 
vessel then about 1800 miles southwest of hawaii no injuries 
were reported from that sighting 
on nov 1 another air force hc130 flying about 1000 miles 
west of hawaii again reported possible laser illumination from a 
soviet vessel a few minutes later a similar report was received 
from an air force wc130 a fourengine weather observation plane 
located 780 miles south of the first aircraft again no injuries 
were reported 
the fourth incident was connected with the soviet ship involved 
in the first two incidents but a second soviet ship may have been 
involved in the initial nov 1 illumination pentagon officials 
said 
the hc130 hercules fourengine turboprops are often used for 
surveillance purposes 
the pentagon sources said that because no official determination 
has yet been made that lasers were involved and since the new 
ussoviet agreement is not yet in effect no protests have been 
filed with soviet officials 
one official noted that following the similar type of incident 
in 1987 a protest was filed under a 1972 incidents at sea 
agreement 
the pact that takes effect jan 1 worked out in nine months of 
negotiations covered four points and was designed to allow for 
communications to avoid and resolve military incidents between 
superpower military forces 
the agreement dealt with the accidental straying of military 
units into the other nations territory hazardous use of laser 
range finders that could blind the other countrys soldiers or 
sailors hampering the other countrys military operations in a 
tense area such as the persian gulf and interfering with command 
and communications networks of the two militaries 
pentagon officials said the pact included lasers because of the 
1987 incident

missile carriers generators and mobile barracks 
will go up for grabs in a moscow park this month at the soviet 
unions first equivalent of a military rummage sale organizers 
said thursday 
the exhibit which opens nov 28 is aimed at selling off 
reusable parts of intermediaterange nuclear missile installations 
that were dismantled under a 1987 superpower treaty 
it is also meant to pave the way for broader sales of equipment 
that will no longer be needed as the soviet union cuts its military 
forces and future treaties rule out other types of weapons said 
elvin kalinin one of the fairs organizers 
the money the fair is expected to bring in this year will go in 
part to help support servicemen who are discharged as a result of 
the cutbacks kalinin said 
the soviet union is in the process of reducing troops and tanks 
in europe and asia and it has shifted from aggressive armsrace 
rhetoric to espousing a doctrine of reasonable sufficiency 
it has already destroyed 297 of its 654 ss20s under the 1987 
treaty and the rest are due to be scrapped over the next two years 
the united states keeping pace has eliminated 486 of its 846 
rockets covered by the treaty 
the proceeds from the military sale will also be used to raise 
the living standards of soldiers remaining in the army and to 
charity said kalinin who heads intellect a foundation aimed at 
encouraging creativity among youth that is one of the charities to 
benefit from the sale 
foreigners will be allowed to buy most of the military goods on 
sale at moscows sokolniki park and some of the offerings will be 
put up for auction 
the several hundred items at the fair will include the 
heavyterrain vehicles used as missile carriers radio and 
electrical elements generators measuring devices frames pipes 
condensers and other miscellanea 
kalinin said the missile carriers could be used to transport 
construction cranes or vats of fertilizer on farms and the mobile 
living units that housed the missile installation crews could be 
used by geologists in the field 
the pipes and electrical supplies are assured plenty of soviet 
buyers because of the widespread shortage of construction 
materials kalinin noted 
much of the equipment which was part of the nuclear missile 
installations has never been used he added 
if it had been we wouldnt be sitting here he said

nato on thursday put final touches on a 
plan that it said would curb conventional arms in europe and ease 
the path of warsaw pact countries that decide to leave the soviet 
bloc military alliance 
negotiators for the north atlantic treaty organization said the 
proposals contained several new provisions placing more emphasis on 
individual countries within the two military alliances 
the nato negotiators who spoke outside the opening session of 
the winter round of eastwest nonnuclear arms talks said the new 
western package defined the talks as between groups of states 
instead of the nato and warsaw pact alliances 
this is a development away from alliances and toward 
individual states at the 23nation talks said chief delegate 
ruediger hartmann of west germany 
a western delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity 
acknowledged the change of emphasis was in anticipation of possible 
future moves by some warsaw pact countries to leave the sovietled 
alliance of seven nations 
several hungarian leaders have suggested in recent months that 
their warsaw pact country might opt for neutrality in the 
foreseable future as part of its reform process transforming it 
from communist rule to multiparty democracy 
the delegate indirectly acknowledged hungarian developments 
influenced the new language of the nato proposals he said some 
countries contemplating a move away from the warsaw pact would be 
reluctant to sign a treaty binding them to an alliance they could 
soon be outside of 
hartmann in the same vein said that some eastern nations now 
are not ready to assume responsibilities for the whole east 
bloc 
the nato package thus proposes countrybycountry limits on 
weapons categories instead of only two ceilings one for nato the 
other for the warsaw pact said the delegates 
it also would permit any individual country belonging to one of 
the two alliances to unilaterally withdraw from a conventional arms 
treaty if its supreme interests were jeopardized 
chief soviet negotiator oleg a grinevsky told another news 
conference he was reluctant to comment on the nato proposals before 
seeing them but he appeared cool to the group of states 
concept 
its possible to have some quotas for each country he said 
when asked about individual country limits as opposed to alliance 
ceilings but the agreement should be between the two 
alliances 
the nato proposals were to be presented at thursdays opening 
round but a western delegate said lastminute disagreement among 
the 16nation atlantic alliance on their language meant they would 
likely be submitted next week 
while the proposals remain confidential nato negotiators said 
they contained modified versions of suggestions made by the western 
side since the talks opened in march including 
limiting the size of military exercises to no more than 40000 
troops per bloc 
mandatory advance notification of major mobilization of 
reservists and of large troop movements 
mandatory easy access to specific weapons depots with up to 
onefifth of each sides arsenals and simplified surveillance of 
equipment in units with a low level of readiness 
the east already has agreed to the 40000person limit on 
maneuvers but has sought to limit such large exercises to once 
every three years instead of once every two years as proposed by 
nato earlier

proposed federal tax restrictions have 
halted and may collapse plans to build a tunnel under berthoud pass 
to this ski resort 
the berthoud tunnel authority had hoped to sell 247 million in 
taxexempt bonds in december for planning and construction of the 
4mile tunnel which would spare motorists from having to drive a 
fearsome zigzag road over the 11315foot gap 
but ronald drake authority president said wednesday that a 
budget bill passed by the house in october requires that 85 percent

sink 
witnesses said parts of the ferrys dance lounge were hanging

the senate on thursday sent president bush a 
bill to save congressional newsletters reversing a previous vote 
to ban the mailings that had touched off a congressional civil war 
the compromise negotiated earlier in a bitter housesenate 
conference was adopted by voice vote and will halve the number of 
unsolicited mass mailings from sixtothree per lawmaker 
on sept 7 in an action that enraged the house senators voted 
887 for an amendment to ban the mass mailings and give the 
estimated 45 million in savings to a treatment program for 
pregnant women with drug addictions 
but senators knew that vote was preliminary and faced with 
nearly identical language thursday they voted 6629 to kill the 
proposal by sen pete wilson the lawmakers then adopted the 19 
billion appropriations bill for congressional operations that 
includes the compromise mail provisions 
the mailings in question usually newsletters are addressed to 
postal patrons rather than individual constituents and increase 
greatly during election years 
the september senate vote to ban the mailings led to ruffled 
feelings that saw members of each house threaten and back off 
from proposals to change the others rules 
senators didnt like the idea that only their rules require 
disclosure of mailing costs by each member and sought to force 
house disclosure 
house members threatened to retaliate by trying to end senators 
use of money from honoraria political action committees and party 
campaign committees for office expenses house rules prohibit such 
expenditures 
in the end the compromise sent to the white house includes a 
package of reforms in the congressional mail system 
the measure would establish for the first time separate house 
and senate mail accounts limit the size of newsletters to two 
sheets of paper establish a voluntary procedure for keeping mail 
costs within their budget and strictly enforce a prohibition 
against postal patron mailings 60 days before an election 
the compromise would budget 1002 million for mailings 
including 445 million for the house 239 million for the senate 
and the remainder to pay the postal service for mailings that 
exceeded the fiscal 1989 mail budget 
wilson rcalif arguing for the ban on mailings told 
colleagues to ask themselves how often youve been begged for a 
newsletter 
no wonder the public grows cynical when they see us putting 
our perks above their needs he said they did not elect us 
to put junk mail ahead of treatment for pregnant women 
addicted to drugs 
wilson said the government only spent 45 million during the 
last fiscal year for the treatment and would have added 45 
million in savings from the mailing ban however those opposing 
wilson noted that congress already has approved 85 million for the 
program in the current fiscal year 
sen harry reid dnev sponsor of the compromise that was 
adopted said the house would never accept the mailing ban and 
would back away from the other mail reforms if the senate changed 
the agreement 
the result he said would be no congressional mail reforms 
its the best were going to get he said

the contras announced a new militarydominated 
commission wednesday to lead the nicaraguan rebels but ousted 
civilian leaders immediately denounced the move as a coup 
the formation of the civilianmilitary commission as the 
group calls itself came as the contras and sandinista government 
opened talks at the united nations aimed at ending the civil war in 
nicaragua 
the new contra leaders include three military commanders and 
aristides sanchez a civilian holdover from the old sevenmember 
directorate 
the commission was formed by military commanders because 
of the disintegration of the the old directorate contra military 
spokesman alejandro acevedo said 
three of the seven civilian directors have returned to 
nicaragua the us has cut off funds to the old directorate and 
most of the contra supply and demobilization effort is already in 
the hands of the military he said 
acevedo added that the contras un negotiating team has 
recognized the new commission 
but two of the civilian directors who were elected by the 
nicaraguan resistances 54member legislative assembly quckly 
denounced the body as a power grab that violated the contras 
internal rules 
the intervention of the military in civilian matters has 
always been a great problem in our country said adolfo calero 
who was a leader of the resistance since it was formed in the early 
1980s i want respect for insitutions and for the military to 
keep in their headquarters and do their duty 
calero blamed the takeover on the state department which he 
said had undercut the directorate to favor military commanders 
they have a short memory on how the military has screwed up 
before he said 
the state department did not immediately return calls from the 
associated press 
in san jose costa rica wilfredo montalvan another civilian 
director said the new commission was supposed to work under the 
directorate not replace it 
the disbanding of the directorate would violate the statutes 
of the assembly and i consider that a coup which creates a serious 
precedent said montalvan 
members of the new commission however defended the body and 
said it was necessary because the directorate had ceased 
functioning 
commander franklin the contras military chief of staff and a 
member of the commission issued a statement saying the goals of 
the movement had not changed he and the other two military 
leaders commanders ruben and dimas are known only by their 
battlefield psuedonyms 
the new leaders will do everything necessary to fulfill the 
historic goals of our organization achieving peace and national 
reconciliation through the full democratization of nicaraguan 
society franklin said 
asked about the old directors acevedo noted that if military 
commanders agree there is an option to expand the commission to 
seven members and it is possible former directors could join 
calero however rejected the possibility 
i would be doing a disservice to democracy if i approved and 
i will not he said

the white house said today a decision by the 
east german government to allow its citizens to travel freely was 
an important step toward democratic reform 
we have always called for and supported freedom of movement 
said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the east german decision would be an important step in the 
direction of peaceful and evolutionary democratic reform it would 
seem to be a positive response to the wishes that the east german 
people have voiced so strongly in the last few months fitzwater 
said 
secretary of state james a baker iii said free travel for east 
germans would be a very positive development that the united 
states would welcome 
weve been talking a long time about freedom of travel being a 
basic human right weve been talking a long time about open 
borders weve been talking a long time about the importance of 
seeing the wall come down baker said 
he spoke to reporters after hosting a luncheon for philippines 
president corazon aquino 
east germany said today it was opening its borders to the rest 
of the world and that its citizens can travel or emigrate anywhere 
including through the 28yearold berlin wall 
fitzwater said the country appears to have been moving in 
that direction but i think it was a surprise when it happened at 
least we had no advance warning 
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine ssaid the east german decision amounts to the symbolic 
destruction of the berlin wall 
mitchell urged east germany and gorbachev to take the final 
step and tear that wall down 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the berlin 
wall and all that it represents are crumbling even as the 
communist state which built it crumbles too 
he said the united states should make clear its desire that the 
east german people achieve freedom and that the countrys communist 
government be replaced by a functioning democracy 
but we should not do anything at this point which might 
needlessly add fuel to the fire dole said 
fitzwater said providing food clothing and housing for the 
refugees does present problems 
i think all the countries of the world certainly the allied 
countries stand ready to watch and help as necessary but at this 
point that hasnt been required said the white house spokesman 
so far he said the west german government has been managing 
this exodus into their country pretty well he said bush and 
chancellor helmut kohl have talked previously about the situation 
we have always urged movements toward democracy president 
reagan called for tearing down the berlin wall we have been 
supportive of the border release of its citizens and we think those 
are important moves

border issues spurred by dramatic 
developments in east germany and a conflict over chancellor helmut 
kohls visit to auschwitz dominated the first day of his historic 
visit to postcommunist poland 
kohls talks with solidarity prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
upon arrival for a sixday visit were extremely open and 
wideranging according to spokesmen for both governments 
but the increasingly topical issue of eventual german 
reunification appeared to be the focus of the nearly two hours of 
discussion between kohl and mazowiecki 
certainly poland is now looking more seriously on the 
possibility of this said polish government spokesman henryk 
wozniakowski the horizon of possible reunification is more 
visible than a few months ago 
the chief polish government spokesman malgorzata niezabitowska 
and kohls information minister hans klein made clear that border 
issues dominated the talks 
polish officials have been concerned about discussion among west 
german conservatives of the possibility of seeking reunification 
within the 1937 borders of the german reich which would involve 
large areas now part of poland 
the west german parliament wednesday proposed a resolution that 
appears to recognize the areas of upper silesia and east prussia as 
permanent parts of the poland 
polish officials expressed satisfaction with that but in an 
indication the issue remains sensitive they pressed the west 
german visitors for more concrete assurances that bonn does not 
covet the territories now a part of poland 
klein a member of the archconservative christian social union 
said kohl tried to explain to mazowiecki the continuing 
sensitivities among germans expelled from their homelands in 
territories awarded to poland after world war ii 
it is necessary to win these people over klein said 
referring to those still unwilling to recognize the permanent loss 
of their homelands 
ms niezabitowska said mazowiecki stressed that polish people 
must have certainty that the question of borders be settled 
permanently 
a 1970 treaty between west germany and poland recognizes the 
oder and neisse rivers as the western boundary of poland but does 
not commit an eventually reunified germany to those terms 
kohl also met with solidarity leader lech walesa 
kohl is bringing a billiondollar economic package that is 
crucial for the solidarityled government to make the difficult 
transition toward a marketoriented economy 
the new government and walesa have argued for massive western 
economic aid saying it is needed to secure the fragile democratic 
process under way 
west germany is polands largest western trading partner and 
kohl has brought business leaders with him to start developing 
joint projects 
earlier thursday sources disclosed that kohls visit to the 
auschwitz concentration camp had been delayed because the head of 
west germanys jewish community said he could not take part in the 
event on the sabbath 
west german officials with the kohl delegation said before the 
chancellors arrival for a sixday summit that the visit originally 
set for saturday was delayed because of objections by heinz 
galinski head of the west german jewish community council 
galinski a member of the official delegation told the west 
german government that in accordance with jewish religious customs 
he would not be able to travel saturday the sources said 
on thursday polish and west german officials responsible for 
arranging the trip in warsaw held an emergency meeting to resolve 
the delicate problem before kohls arrival 
jaroslaw szczepanski deputy director of the government press 
office said there was mutual agreement to make the change 
klein and ms niezabitowska said it appeared the trip could not 
be fit in until tuesday 
kohl already is committed to a visit sunday to krzyzowa a 
silesian town where nazi resisters met during the war for a 
meeting with ethnic germans 
polish and west german leaders hope the visit will mark a new 
beginning in relations between the former world war ii adversaries 
but the trip has been marred by controversy 
memories of old territorial disputes and the legacy of the nazi 
era still cast shadows over efforts at reconciliation 
polish anxiety over a planned visit by kohl to gora sw anny 
known in german as annaberg the site of a bloody battle in 1921 
over whether the area should go to poland or germany forced 
officials to find another place for a meeting with ethnic germans 
polish officials apparently feared that a visit by kohl to the 
once disputed city could fuel ethnic tension in the area 
west germans have expressed concern that the rights of the 
ethnic german minority are not being respected by poland

with a superficial scratching of earth and 
placement of four bricks hindu fundamentalists thursday reaffirmed 
their intention to build a temple that has stirred a religious and 
political storm 
outnumbered by police and paramilitary troops surrounding the 
site about 2000 hindu holy men politicians worshipers and 
youthful unarmed guards mobbed a patch of earth considered sacred 
by hindus and moslems 
tens of thousands of other hindu faithfuls streamed by behind 
the ceremony site outside a police barricade hindus planned a 
formal start to dig the foundation on friday 
at least 290 people have died in hindumoslem clashes since 
august when hindu fundamentalists announced they would build a new 
temple to the god ram on the site of an existing 17th century 
mosque 
the vishwa hindu parishad which is behind the temple program 
maintains the mosque was built atop an ancient hindu temple marking 
the spot where the group says ram was born 900000 years ago 
most of the deaths occurred late last month in bihar state next 
to ayodhyas uttar pradesh state as bricks for the temple were 
borne by hindu processions to this dusty town on the saryu river 
there have been no reports of deaths in ayodhya and there was 
no sign of violence in the town of 35000 on thursday the ayodhya 
case has become a major campaign issue for prime minister rajiv 
gandhi as he seeks to return his congress party to power in 
elections that will be conducted nov 22 24 and 26 
but neither he nor the man trying to replace him vishwanath 
pratap singh of the national front coalition has offered a 
solution they are fearful of alienating the vote of hindus who 
make up 82 percent of indias 880 milliion people although hindus 
traditionally have voted for secular parties the candidates also 
want the moslem vote which usually has gone heavily to the 
congress party 
singh had planned to visit ayodhya on thursday to cool religious 
tensions but changed his plans and made a short stop in faizabad 
about four miles away 
in faizabad singh said the hindumoslem dispute over the 
ayodhya site cannot be decided by the courts he declined to 
say how it should be decided 
the question of proprietorship at ayodhya has been dragging 
through the courts for four decades 
so far the only thing legally clear is that the initial 
foundation for the new temple is slated for a 25footby23foot 
plot owned by a hindu this tiny plot could hold little more than 
the front steps of the proposed temple 
the rest of the envisoned twostory threedomed structure would 
engulf land whose ownership is under dispute including the 17th 
century mosque 
we will not break down this structure said ashok singhal 
referring to the the building moslems call the babri masjid or 
mosque of babar hindus call it the ram janambhoomi or rams 
birthplace 
it can be lifted honorably lifted and moved so this 
mosque if it is a mosque is not destroyed said singhal a 
senior trustee of the committee to build the new hindu temple 
singhal said he hoped to make such an attempt and begin 
contruction within a month leaving the impression that it would be 
deferred until after a new government is chosen

the nations roman catholic bishops thursday 
called upon the united states to press for middle east talks 
leading to an independent palestinian homeland the statement drew 
immediate criticism from jewish leaders 
on the last day of its fall meeting the national conference of 
catholic bishops also approved a statement on aids that rejects 
condom education in public schools and the distribution of clean 
needles to drug addicts 
the bishops unanimously approved a statement on the middle east 
that declares palestinians have a right to participate as equals in 
negotiations affecting their destiny and a right to territory 
the statement called upon the arab states and palestinians to 
recognize israels right to exist and said there must be limits 
negotiated on palestinian sovereignty to protect israels security 
the bishops urged the administration to increase talks with 
palestinians clearly express its support for a palestinian 
homeland press arab states to normalize relations with israel and 
urge all foreign nations including syria and israel to withdraw 
from lebanon 
cardinal bernard law of boston said the statement is a sorely 
needed invitation to dialogue for the cause of peace in the middle 
east 
but it drew criticism from american jewish groups including the 
synagogue council of america which said the bishops report 
prejudges what can only be achieved through the process of 
negotiations 
rabbi a james rudin and judith h banki of the american jewish 
committee said the bishops call for sovereignty removes 
incentives for flexibility and accommodation on the part of 
palestinian leadership 
the aids statement approved in a 2194 vote by secret ballot 
rejected the bishops conferences earlier conditional support for 
condom education in public schools urging that youngsters be 
taught chastity instead 
we caution young people not to be trapped into the safesex 
myth which is both a lie and a fraud said archbishop roger 
mahony of los angeles chairman of the committee that drafted the 
statement 
the statement also opposes universal mandatory aids testing 
calls for increasing federal funds for aids research and denounces 
violence and discrimination against aids patients 
the statement said it builds on a 1987 document approved by the 
conferences administrative board but it drops a controversial 
assertion in the earlier document that the church could tolerate 
education about condoms in public school aidsprevention classes 
as long as sexual abstinence outside marriage was presented as the 
only morally correct and medically sure way to prevent the 
deadly disease 
some bishops said the assertion could be misinterpreted as 
condoning extramarital sex and artificial birth control 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati newly elected 
conference president said in an interview that priests could still 
counsel condom use in individual cases if it seemed the only 
recourse but the bishops decided against a general statement 
on similar grounds the bishops said supplying clean needles to 
drug addicts to prevent infection from contaminated needles could 
encourage drug abuse 
jay blotcher a spokesman for the aids coalition to unleash 
power in new york said not giving youngsters information about 
condoms is abandoning them to death 
much of the debate thursday focused on whether god should be 
thought of as having a role in determining who gets aids in the 
end the bishops rejected several proposed amendments on the matter 
without condoning selfdestructive behavior or denying 
personal responsibility we must reject the idea that this illness 
is a direct punishment by god the bishops said 
in other business thursday the prelates voted 17512 to give 
bishops the discretion to allow laypeople to assist at marriages 
where priests or deacons are not available 
earlier in the week the bishops approved a rite allowing 
laypeople to conduct sunday services though not mass in the 
absence of a priest both rules still must be approved by the 
vatican 
also earlier in the week the bishops 
approved a strong antiabortion resolution making a special 
plea to catholic legislators to work to eliminate legalized 
abortion and saying that no catholic could responsibly take a 
prochoice position 
approved a statement on food policy that decried the loss of 
the family farm said the growing concentration of farmland in the 
hands of large corporations threatens the common good and called 
for more rights for farmworkers and less use of chemical 
fertilizers and pesticides 
endorsed a plan to increase the participation of black 
catholics in the church 
elected pilarczyk who had been confererence vice president to 
a threeyear term as president archbishop william keeler of 
baltimore was elected vice president

the chief us negotiator at talks with the 
soviet union said thursday that progress has been made on 
verification procedures and that there is a good chance two 
neverratified arms control treaties can be initialed at the 
ussoviet summit meeting planned for next summer 
ambassador c paul robinson told the senate foreign relatons 
committee that the negotiators have an excellent foundation for 
completing our work in time for the summit next year 
the two pacts the 1974 treaty on the limitation of underground 
nuclear weapon tests and the 1976 treaty on underground nuclear 
explosions for peaceful purposes were signed by the united states 
and the soviet union but have never been voted on by the senate 
opponents of the treaties as originally negotiated contend that 
verification provisions in the treaties are insufficient to 
guarantee against cheating 
the two treaties would limit the maximum yield of nuclear test 
explosions to 150 kilotons 
but now robinson said verification technology has advanced to 
the point that a supplemental agreement on verification procedures 
appears to be within reach 
another us official said however that the united states will 
block an attempt by 41 other nations to amend the 1963 limited test 
ban treaty to establish a comprehensive permanent ban against all 
nuclear weapons testing 
kathleen c bailey an official of the arms control and 
disarmament agency said the united states will exercise its treaty 
rights to prevent the transformation of that treaty into a 
comprehensive test ban in the belief that testing is essential to 
ensure the reliability of the nations nuclear deterrent 
test ban advocates disagreed saying that testing is not needed 
to make sure nuclear weapons are reliable and asserting that such 
tests result in the production and deployment of more destructive 
nuclear arms 
the us position on nuclear testing is clear dr bailey 
said nuclear testing is indispensable to the maintenance of the 
credible nuclear deterrent that has kept the peace for 40 years 
testing is necessary to ensure the reliability of our nuclear 
deterrent and improves the safety security and survivability of 
our weapons 
she said a comprehensive test ban can be contemplated only when 
deep and verifiable strategic and conventional arms reductions have 
been achieved 
but the committees chairman sen claiborne pell dri said 
that if a complete test ban goes into effect the weapons are less 
likely to be reliable and therefore less likely to be used

suspected of causing 17 illnesses and three deaths after a class 
reunion has scarred the image of this agricultural community as a 
wholesome convention site 
theres concern grave concern over what this will mean to 
the community said darlene hamilton manager of the chamber of 
commerce of lamar population 8600 which depends heavily on 
tourism and conventions 
city administrator roy lauricello said the town still was 
reeling from a decision by a bus manufacturer to lay off 200 people 
last year 
eightyfive people were laid off monday when the best western 
cow palace inn closed voluntarily while health officials took more 
than 200 samples from air conditioning ducts water and the cooling 
system breeding grounds for the bacteria that cause the disease 
the samples are being analyzed at the federal centers for 
disease control in atlanta which expects to have preliminary 
results next week health officials expressed confidence that the 
cow palace will then reopen after any sources of the bacteria are 
sterilized 
more than 250 people from 21 states attended a lamar high school 
reunion sept 2224 held for classes of 1941 and earlier at the 
cow palace the motel has about 300 guests per night and brings an 
average of one convention a week to lamar a highway crossroads 
town 220 miles southeast of denver 
six cases of legionnaires disease have been confirmed among 17 
people who came down with pneumonialike symptoms after attending 
the reunion three of those stricken have died and two of the 
deaths involved confirmed cases of legionnaires the other four 
people with confirmed legionnaires disease recovered 
two other people got the disease after staying at the motel 
prior to the reunion however health department officials said 
thursday those cases cannot be linked directly to the motel 
health department spokeswoman ann lockhart said all of the cases 
are suspected to involve legionnaires disease but the health 
department has to await laboratory confirmation 
the health department canvassed those who attended the reunion 
or worked at the motel but is not trying to track down other cow 
palace guests 
dr dan rodrigue of the state health department said hundreds of 
people may have been exposed but only those with compromised 
immune systems such as the elderly catch the disease 
symptoms usually appear in two to 10 days and include fever 
headache appetite loss muscle aches coughs abdominal pain and 
fluid in the lungs which sometimes leads to the disease being 
misdiagnosed as pneumonia a doctor must confirm the diagnosis with 
a blood test 
dave edelman manager of the motel said he has lived there for 
14 years and neither his family nor employees became ill neither 
have local civic leaders who attended meetings at the motel 
nevertheless the motel sat vacant this week the indoor pool 
and hot tub empty a pale green light streamed in through a 
skylight on dozens of empty tables set for guests 
i dont know what were going to do i dont know if we can 
survive this said edelman 
hamilton said the business and professional women of colorado 
canceled its convention after news of the disease broke costing 
lamar the money that would have been spent by 250 people she is 
worried about the colorado cattlemens association and state 
convention of the knights of columbus next spring but those groups 
say they have made no decisions to cancel 
hamilton said the town is considering an expensive advertising 
campaign to rebuild its image 
these things stick in peoples minds hamilton said its 
not going away next week or next year 
the damage is already done no matter what the outcome of the 
investigation the damage is done 
rodrigue who worked without a mask while collecting samples in 
the motel said he would not be afraid to stay there once the 
source of infection is discovered 
dr timothy mastro of the cdc said a contamination usually is 
neutralized with heat or chlorine but may require continuing 
periodic treatment 
the bacterium is found in soil and grows in water such as 
airconditioning ducts storage tanks and rivers legionnaires 
disease takes its name from an outbreak at a pennsylvania american 
legion convention in philadelphia in 1976 that killed 34 people 
this was the first case in colorado the health department said

hungary has completed the dismantling 
of the electronic barrier along its westernmost border an official 
said thursday 
hungary began dismantling the electronic signaling devices and 
barbed wire fencing along its 220mile border with austria on may 
2 physically dismantling part of the iron curtain between east and 
west 
brigadiergeneral janos szekely the national commander of the 
hungarian border guards told representatives of 14 political 
groups that the electronic signaling devices had been removed 
completely the state mti news agency reported 
it was not clear from the brief report whether the barbed wire 
and other fencing has also been removed completely the removal of 
all barriers originally was scheduled to be completed by dec 1 
1990 
hungarys move to dismantle the border barriers followed 
legislation allowing hungarians to travel freely this summer tens 
of thousands of east germans used the open stretches of border to 
flee to the west until budapest announced it would allow the east 
germans to cross legally

israeli soldiers fatally shot an armed 
palestinian in a roundup of the red eagles guerrillas thursday and 
killed a masked arab activist during violent protests that erupted 
after the raid the military command said 
fifteen other arabs were shot and wounded in demonstrations as 
palestinians marked the end of the 23rd month of a revolt against 
israeli rule in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip 
a general strike called by underground uprising leaders 
paralyzed business and traffic and shut schools throughout the 
occupied lands 
the army command said a military force on routine duties in the 
west bank town of nablus spotted a suspicious movement near a 
house in the jneid neighborhood before dawn thursday 
israel media said troops surrounded the onestory house and used 
a loudspeaker to order the suspects to come out when they refused 
soldiers broke in through a metal door 
there were six young men inside and one pulled out a pistol 
he was shot and killed and the others were arrested and taken for 
interrogation an army statement said 
the army said the victim iman mohsein al ruzeh and the 
detainees belonged to the red eagles a guerrilla group backed by 
the radical syrianbased popular front for the liberation of 
palestine a plo faction that opposes yasser arafats peace 
initiative 
the army said al ruzeh 23 was wanted for alleged involvement 
in the assassinations as well as for firebomb attacks kidnappings 
and violent interrogations of suspected collaborators 
it said jaber mohammed suleiman fuash 19 wanted by security 
forces for involvement in the killing of eight arabs was among the 
detainees 
the red eagles are believed responsible for the slayings of nine 
nablus palestinians suspected of moral offenses or assisting 
israeli authorities as well as of other attacks against israeli 
troops the army said 
the nine were killed after severe torture including killings 
by axes and knives the statement said 
nablus has been the site of a large portion of slayings of arabs 
accused of helping the israeli authorities since the uprising 
began of 143 arabs killed on such charges 23 were slain in 
nablus with most of the slayings blamed on the red eagles or 
another guerrilla group the black panther brigades 
israeli officials claim some of these gangs operate under direct 
orders of the plo but palestinians say at least some of the 
murders were carried out in defiance of arafats orders 
the raid was followed by violent clashes in nablus in which one 
palestinian was killed and four others wounded an israeli border 
policeman suffered moderate injuries in a stonethrowing attack 
after which the army clamped a curfew on the city of 120000 the 
largest in the west bank 
eleven other palestinians were shot and wounded in gaza 
hospital officials said 
thursdays deaths brought to 613 the number of arabs killed by 
israeli gunfire in the uprising forty israelis have also been 
slain

the democratic party establishment on capitol 
hill stood beaming thursday with l douglas wilder and david 
dinkins clearly pleased to have mainstream elected officials 
moving into a spotlight once held exclusively by jesse jackson 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash and the entire democratic leadership of 
congress smiled broadly as wilder and dinkins stepped forward at a 
news conference in an ornate room off the senate floor 
americans are prepared to accept candidates on the basis of 
their individual talent said mitchell 
wilder and dinkins needed strong support from white voters and 
they got it by concentrating on running campaigns that stressed 
mainstream positions on issues both campaigned as fiscal 
conservatives who were tough on law and order questions 
and both kept jesse jackson at arms length 
never totally comfortable with jackson establishment democrats 
dive for cover when he becomes involved with leftwing leaders 
around the world only a week before the 1989 elections president 
daniel ortega of nicaragua called jackson to ask him to intervene 
with president bush to obtain support for disbanding the contra 
forces 
democratic party leaders can rest easy aware that neither 
wilder nor dinkins is likely to get any phone calls from ortega 
other 1989 election winners were present house members who won 
contests throughout the year to fill vacancies but most of the 
attention was on wilder and dinkins who scored racial 
breakthroughs on tuesday 
while his republican opponent had yet to concede and a recount 
was likely wilder was claiming victory in the race for governor of 
virginia a triumph that would make him the first black elected 
governor of any state 
dinkins is the first black elected mayor of new york city 
in both cases the margin of victory was smaller than many polls 
had predicted a result that prompted speculation that race remains 
a potent issue in american politics 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown the first black to 
head a major party dismissed the speculation as ridiculous 
all the questions now are why didnt wilder do better and 
why didnt dinkins do better its a ridiculous question he 
said the fact is that we have elected a democratic mayor of the 
city of new york who happens to be black and weve elected a 
democratic governor of the state of virginia who happens to be 
black 
even as wilder and dinkins celebrated their triumphs talk 
turned to what impact their emergence would have on jackson the 
twotime presidential candidate who has been largely unchallenged 
as the most prominent black in politics 
jackson campaigned for dinkins in the new york city democratic 
primary but made few appearances for him during the general 
election campaign and stayed clear of virginia where he and wilder 
agreed his presence would hurt more than help 
after the election jackson sounded resentful of the emphasis 
being placed on the distance wilder and dinkins put between him and 
their campaigns 
we stepped back strategically said jackson speculating 
that if greeks had risen to prominence in the party after michael 
dukakis 1988 presidential campaign no one would be trying to 
find the disconnection because the connection would be so very 
apparent 
if were members of the same team does it matter who scored 
the touchdown said jackson as he made the rounds of 
postelection interview shows if were members of the same team 
if we win the championship all of us get the ring 
brown who worked briefly on the jackson presidential campaign 
said the victories of wilder and dinkins have little to do with 
whether jesse jackson is going to be a preeminent spokesman i 
think jesse jackson will be a significant factor in the politics of 
this country for as long as he wants to be 
eddie williams president of the joint center for political 
studies a think tank that concentrates on studying political 
trends among blacks said he doubted wilder or dinkins would be in 
a position for some time to challenge jackson for preeminence as a 
national figure 
as a governor and as mayor of the nations largest city they 
are on a different track than jackson said williams

a san francisco attorney criticized for his 
onetime membership in a club that excludes women told senators 
thursday he fought to ease that restriction and vowed to be fair if 
confirmed as a federal judge 
i am more sensitive now than i was about the need for a 
federal judge to conduct the courtrooms of the united states in a 
way to insure fairness vaughn walker told the senate judiciary 
committee 
the vow came at a hearing into the longstalled nomination of 
walker as a judge in the northern district of california 
walker has been fighting for confirmation for almost two years 
while critics have argued that his former membership in the 
exclusive olympic club should disqualify him 
sen alan cranston dcalif has asked the committee not to 
recommend confirmation of walker who has strong support from sen 
pete wilson rcalif 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio and the acting chairman of the 
committee told walker he has doubts as to whether the resignation 
from the olympic club dated feb 15 came soon enough to indicate 
walker really disapproved of discrimination practiced by the club 
until 1968 the club barred blacks from membership critics say 
it now has few blacks among its 4700 active members it still 
refuses to admit women to full membership 
supreme court justice anthony m kennedy was a member but 
resigned when his name was mentioned as a possible nominee for the 
high court 
in testimony before the committee judge diane wick of municipal 
court in san francisco called walker a fair thoughtful and 
compassionate human being 
judge ina gyemant of superior court in san francisco said walker 
helped her with her first campaign even though her opponent was a 
republican man 
i have never found him to be unfair and i do believe that he 
would be unbiased she said 
metzenbaum questioned walker closely on why his resignation 
letter was not marked as received by the olympic club until april 
15 when he said that it was dated feb 15 walker said he gave the 
letter to a former club official david dawson to deliver and 
never saw it again 
republican senators expressed dismay at the two years that the 
walker nomination has been pending 
sen alan simpson rwyo said the questions about when 
walkers nomination became effective were to me just 
extraordinary 
whats going on here is unethical its unfair and its just 
dirty politics sen gordon humphrey rnh declared

advisers told energy secretary james d 
watkins on thursday that they have found a possible major drawback 
to using a linear accelerator instead of nuclear reactors to make 
tritium a key ingredient in nuclear warheads 
the 12member energy research advisory board said in an interim 
report to watkins that the need for huge amounts of electricity to 
run an accelerator could offset the machines environmental safety 
and possible cost advantages over nuclear reactors 
the panel is still studying the matter and is due to issue a 
final report next february 
if substantiated the panels interim finding could add weight 
to the bush administrations argument challenged by some members 
of congress that new nuclear reactors not an accelerator are 
the best answer to the nations tritium needs the administration 
has proposed spending 68 billion to build two new reactors 
a linear accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which 
subatomic particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash 
into a target in this case lithium clad in aluminium the 
resulting collision produces tritium a radioactive gas used in 
nuclear weapons to boost the warheads explosive power 
governmentowned nuclear reactors at the savannah river site in 
south carolina are the only source of tritium for us nuclear 
warheads those reactors built in the early 1950s have been idled 
for repairs and safety improvements and they are not expected to 
last much beyond 2000 
the administration says new production capacity is needed to 
assure the readiness of the us nuclear arsenal although some 
nuclear scientists dispute that 
in the face of the administrations opposition to the 
accelerator option scientists at the brookhaven and los alamos 
national laboratories and at westinghousehanford co in washington 
state said earlier this year that an accelerator could produce 
needed amounts of tritium more cheaply quickly and safely than new 
reactors 
watkins then asked the advisory board for an independent 
assessment of an accelerators potential 
in its report the board said one of its chief concerns is that 
a linear accelerator would require between 800 megawatts and 900 
megawatts of continuous power roughly equal to the entire 
electric output of a large commercial power station 
the board called that an amount that is not only costly but 
may not be readily available in the time frame of the years 2000 to 
2040 when the accelerator would be working 
it said a new power station possibly a nuclear reactor might 
have to be built just to provide electricity for the accelerator 
in that case the evironmental and safety advantages of an 
accelerator would be totally submerged the panel said 
it may be simpler in fact to use a nuclear reactor to 
produce tritium directly rather than have it or a fossil 
plant produce electricity to operate the accelerator the report 
said

increasing winds thursday blew more 
tumbleweeds into town while the us army corps of engineers 
contemplated how to stop an invasion that buried homes and blocked 
streets 
theyre still coming said police chief brooks johnson 
the wind is picking up theyve been baling this morning but 
theyre losing ground now 
johnson said some streets that were blocked by tumbleweeds were 
cleared thursday officials were worried about fires from the 
tinderdry brush and traffic accidents but johnson said none had 
been reported 
most of the people slow down and let the thistle blow across 
the road before they drive through he said 
two years of drought exposed the banks of the nearby oahe 
reservoir providing a perfect spot for the russian thistle 
commonly known as tumbleweed to flourish high winds tuesday night 
launched the invasion thursdays forecast called for northwest 
winds gusting to 35 mph 
crews have been trying to bale the weeds already in town but 
corps officials said thursday theyre not sure how to battle the 
brush left along the reservoir 
one option is a controlled burn but the extent of the weeds and 
the cool windy weather could pose problems said mike george a 
natural resource specialist with the corps 
another is to chop the stringy weeds so they wont wrap around 
one another into mounds that grow snowballfashion as theyre 
tossed across the prairie 
he estimated that several hundred acres of weeds remain on the 
banks of the missouri river 
george said a combination of weather and geography led to the 
flurry of tumbleweeds which buried some homes in the northcentral 
south dakota town of about 4000 people 
they grow all summer long and at the first frost they die 
he said they break off right at ground level and get blown 
around by the wind 
other town need not worry he said adding mobridge is fairly 
unique in that it sits right on the river 
george said the weeds first appeared in the united states during 
the late 1800s in south dakota the scrubby tumbleweeds have a 
prairie charm that captivates the imaginations of tourists he said 
we get visitors to the lake all the time and the two things 
they just freak at are prairie dogs and tumbleweeds he said 
only in south dakota would you have a town taken over by 
tumbleweeds

former treasury secretary donald regan told a 
house panel thursday that a planned bill to limit computerdriven 
stock trading doesnt go far enough and suggested a ban on one form 
of the market strategy 
he targeted index arbitrage in which speculators try to take 
advantage of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets 
by simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other 
critics claim index arbitrage widens price swings and drives 
small investors out of the market 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee plans to introduce 
legislation to restrict program trading during times of extreme 
market turbulence 
but regan the former head of merrill lynch amp co said the 
proposal is more of a partial solution to the problem and if 
enacted may not cure it 
he told the subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee that the problem is stock index futures futures 
contracts tied to the performance of large groups of stocks 
regan suggested doing away with the commodity aspects of index 
futures to lessen volatility or making the stock market 
derivatives have the same rules as stocks 
regan who now heads the alexandria va investment firm of 
regdon associates told the panel there are just a few traders 
who are selfishly rigging the market for their own benefit said 
regan head of merrill lynch amp co before becoming treasury 
secretary under thenpresident reagan was part of a panel of 
investment company executives that called for restraining program 
trading 
the witnesses split in their recommendations of what action 
congress should take 
the problem were addressing is volatility not the program 
trading problem philip j purcell chairman of dean witter 
financial services inc said 
although his firm has halted index arbitrage for customer 
accounts purcell noted the public should recognize that any 
steps taken to curb program trading will not cure volatility 
program trading almost instantaneous transactions through 
computerized buy and sell programs has been a topic of dispute 
for years but the debate heated up after the oct 13 stock market 
slide 
when the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped more 
than 190 points last month many critics said the situation was 
worsened by program trading especially index arbitrage 
the panel members agreed that market volatility scares investors 
out of the market making it more difficult for us companies to 
raise capital through the sale of securities 
most of wall streets large investment houses recently have 
revised their policies on index arbitrage 
and the new york stock exchange has called on large

three weeks after its launch from a 
shuttle the galileo spacecraft fired its thrusters thursday to 
begin the first of about 30 course changes needed for its 
roundabout sixyear trip to jupiter 
weve started the first trajectory correction maneuver 
mission director neal ausman said after the threeday series of 
thruster ignitions got under way at 831 am pst 
during the maneuver galileo is firing four of its 12 thrusters 
in a series of pulses he said no individual pulse exceeds two 
minutes each set of pulses takes about 45 minutes and the entire 
maneuver will be completed saturday night 
two other thrusters may be used to correct the spacecrafts rate 
of spin and the direction toward which it points said ausman of 
the national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the trajectory change is meant to aim galileo for its flight 
past venus in february the spacecraft launched from space shuttle 
atlantis on oct 18 will swoop by venus once and earth twice so 
the planets can act as gravity slingshots to propel galileo 
toward jupiter during the 19 billion mission 
on thursday galileo was about 31 million miles into its looping 
24 billionmile journey to the solar systems largest planet 
ausman said it was about 46 million miles from earth and 585 
million miles from venus traveling at 60376 mph relative to the 
sun 
in july 1995 galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe 
the orbiter will circle jupiter for 22 months starting in december 
1995 the same month the probe will parachute into the jovian 
atmosphere making measurements for 75 minutes until it is crushed 
by intense pressure 
about 30 course corrections involving thruster firings spread 
over 135 days will be required en route to jupiter ausman said 
galileo has ignited its 35 inchlong thrusters on other 
occasions but those firings were to adjust spin or direction 
ausman said the threeday maneuver that started thursday is 
galileos first trajectory correction he added 
ausman said the west germanbuilt thrusters have to fire in 
pulses to avoid contaminating sensitive parts of galileo the 
thrusters are attached to the spinning part of galileo and can 
fire only when they are not above sensitive areas on the 
nonspinning section of the spacecraft 
the thrusters also are fired in pulses because nasa fears 
continuous firing might make them overheat and burn through a 
problem that developed on the same type of thrusters on two 
satellites in recent years ausman said

turgut ozal was sworn in as turkeys 
second civilian president thursday and named a loyal follower to 
succeed him as premier in an apparent attempt to maintain control 
from his new weaker post 
ozal named parliament speaker yildirim akbulut just hours after 
he was inaugurated 
elected by parliament ozal assumed power from kenan evren 
leader of the 1980 military coup who completed a sevenyear 
presidential term and by law could not run for reelection 
the choice of akbulut was dictated in part by fear that 
factional fighting could disintegrate the governing motherland 
party that has been held together by ozals leadership political 
analysts said 
akbulut quickly announced a cabinet almost identical to the 
previous one two state ministers were left out and seven new ones 
were added 
the 450member parliament where the motherland commands a 
majority of 283 seats will have a vote of confidence on the new 
government sometime next week the legislature will also elect a 
new speaker 
included in the cabinet were just about anyone likely to mount a 
campaign for party leadership which is to be decided in a 
convention nov 17 
ozal 62 was elected turkeys eight president on a third ballot 
oct 31 with the votes of 263 motherland deputies 
opposition social democrat and centrist true path parties 
boycotted the inauguration ceremony just as they did the parliament 
sessions for the election of the president 
the opposition has maintained that ozal blamed for 75 percent 
inflation two years running and his popularity shrunken in the wake 
of charges of nepotism and corruption in government ranks lacked a 
clear mandate necessary for the presidential post 
they also claim he would transform the job with little executive 
power into an imperial presidency running the motherland party 
from behind scenes in violation of the constitution 
in the presidential oath accompanied by a 101salvo cannon 
salute ozal pledged to be free of bias he said later in an 
inauguration address that he would be true to his oath at the 
cost of my life if necessary 
ozal first acquired political fame as deputy premier of the 
military government when he initiated the 1980 economic rescue 
program he became premier in 1983 general elections restoring 
civilian rule and turkey enjoyed exportled growth under his 
freemarket economic policies 
but high inflation the price of the boom has made economic 
planning difficult the poor have become poorer and the middle 
class has shrunk 
when he was elected president ozals public support was around 
17 percent according to public opinion polls 
akbulut 52 served as interior minister in one of ozals 
cabinets until he was elected parliament speaker following 1987 
general elections 
the premierdesignate is known as a moderate in the party which 
includes liberal moslem fundamentalist and ultranationalist 
factions 
akbulut raised the number of ministers to 30 from previous 25 
adding five more state ministerships

workers have dredged a 14mile river to 
open iraqs largest port to major commercial traffic from the 
persian gulf for the first time since the war with iran began in 
1980 an official said thursday 
millions of tons of silt were removed from the shattalbasra 
river to make it navigable for medium and smallsize vessels from 
the southern port city of basra to the gulf said sami ajmi kadum 
directorgeneral of the governmentrun almuthana irrigation co 
he said cargo ships with hulls up to 33 feet deep will be able 
to navigate the waterway beginning nov 15 opening up the 
warbattered south to expanded trade under iraqs postwar 
reconstruction drive 
the waterway which connects with the 30milelong khor 
alzubair river that leads to the gulf is an alternative to the 
disputed and stillblocked shattalarab waterway iraqs main 
outlet to the gulf before the war it is also about half the 
distance 
the 12 million project was launched in october 1988 in a drive 
to reopen basra to commercial shipping two months after the 
ceasefire in the 8year war with iran the port was shutdown when 
the war began in september 1980 
kadum said millions of tons of silt have been dredged from the 
channel between basras maqal port and khor alzubair to the south 
there the waterway links with the khor alzubair river that runs 
into the northern waters of the gulf through umm qasr near the 
kuwaiti border 
kadum said the shattalbasra was widened to 315 feet and its 
depth increased by 19 feet it is fed by the euphrates river and 
iraqs southern marshes 
iraq has demanded the iranians allow the shattalarab the 
southern boundary between the two countries to be reopened under a 
united nations ceasefire resolution 
but iran has refused to do so until iraq agrees to abide by a 
1975 treaty that draws the border down the middle of the waterway 
which is still blocked by war debris 
iraq says it abrogated the treaty a few days before war broke 
out and insists that the border runs down the eastern iranian 
shore

a senior iranian official said thursday 
that washingtons decision to release 567 million in frozen 
iranian assets was not a sign of us good will 
since the repayment was ordered by a claims tribunal it has 
nothing to do with the us administrations good will mahmoud 
vaezi deputy foreign minister for european and american affairs 
said in iranian news reports monitored in cyprus 
iran has linked any effort to help free 18 westerners held 
hostage by islamic groups in lebanon to the us releasing iranian 
assets frozen since 1979 
the assets which washington said monday that it would release 
are only a small portion of what iran claims president bush said 
tuesday he hoped the action will prompt iran to obtain freedom for 
us hostages though administration officials said the decision to 
transfer the money was unrelated to the hostage issue 
iran says the assets frozen a decade ago are up to 12 billion 
including the value of weapons purchased before the 1979 islamic 
revolution but never delivered 
the assets were frozen after militants stormed the us embassy 
in tehran nov 4 1979 and held american diplomats and other 
personnel hostage fiftytwo captives were released 444 days later 
earlier thursday in the first public reaction to the us 
decision the tehran times newspaper said in an editorial that the 
release was insufficient 
the newspaper which is close to iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani did not elaborate on the goodwill iran is seeking 
before mediating a release of the hostages held by shiite moslem 
zealots 
rafsanjani leader of the socalled pragmatists in iran told a 
news conference last month that iran would help secure the release 
of the captives including eight americans if washington unblocks 
iranian assets 
the money was held in a fund to guarantee american bank claims 
against iran most of those claims were settled in the past few 
weeks us officials said 
in addition to the americans the hostages in lebanon are four 
britons two swiss two west germans an irishman and an italian

the earthquake that tore through northern 
california has been a postgraduate school for veteran red cross 
worker al green who says the disaster has produced a different 
kind of clientele 
this has been a real learning experience for me said green 
who runs an army base shelter that opened after the oct 17 
earthquake 
shelters normally are designed to close quickly said green 64 
a volunteer from camden ohio who has worked on 24 disasters 
we figure a shelter will be closed in four days he said in 
his office at the presidio while children played on the barracks 
porch more than three weeks have passed since the 71magnitude 
quake struck killing 66 people and causing an estimated 7 billion 
damage 
in other disasters said green the victims belonged to 
families where their houses were destroyed they received 
temporary shelter and then were gone here its also people who 
lived in hotels apartments maybe on the streets some keep coming 
back 
red cross officials estimated about 6000 people needed help 
after the quake there are about 300 people now at the three 
shelters on the army base and fewer than 200 in a downtown shelter 
while green talked a woman wearing a robe walked down the hall 
apparently after washing her hair outside a man his wife and 
another woman watched children playing 
the scene was almost pastoral compared to the more tense 
atmosphere in the red cross shelter in downtown san francisco 
where single men are housed and were shouting matches and even 
brawls are not unknown 
we only have men here shelter manager norma brandt said 
the bed count is now 125 down from a top of 300 some of the 
people we helped have gotten jobs and everyone staying in the 
shelter has been verified as a quake victim 
no questions were asked in the immediate aftermath of the quake 
said red cross spokesman bob page 
we just helped anyone one who needed it said page a few 
days ago we started to limit shelter to those who could prove they 
lived in a residence before the quake then again your home before 
the quake could have been a park bench 
as if to underscore the new limit on who may live there a man 
who had recently been told to leave yelled at page as page walked 
to his car telling him it would be smart to check under the 
hood for explosives 
other men outside ticked off a list of complaints ranging from 
the food to the lack of showers 
michael mccabe 37 has lived in the shelter since oct 25 when 
he returned from a trip to find his marina apartment destroyed 
i lost everything even my car said mccabe taking notes 
for a book on the earthquake 
mccabe said some of the mens gripes were legitimate 
we had just cold cereal for breakfast this morning last night 
it was chicken patties we get lots of potatoes even had them 
three times a day once 
san francisco had a homeless problem before the quake and 
officials have warned that unless lowincome housing wrecked in the 
disaster is replaced the situation will only get worse 
an estimated 80 percent of the housing left uninhabitable was 
marked for the poor brad paul deputy mayor for housing said 
1170 housing units were declared unsafe and 3000 more were found 
to need repairs 
worse still city spokesman erik shapiro said the earthquake 
destroyed a good part of the citys homeless program 
the program paid for a nights lodging for transients at certain 
hotels shapiro figured the quake demolished 25 percent of those 
hotel rooms 
it isnt as if san francisco hasnt gone through this before 
the massive quake in april 1906 left far more homeless 
by winter some 25000 people still lived in tents around the 
city the army corps of engineers eventually designed wooden 
earthquake shacks 
why not again 
for one thing a lot in 1906 cost only 250 
the opportunities for finding cheap land are much reduced from 
those days when many parts of the city were totally undeveloped 
said paul

a consumer health group asked congress on 
thursday to cancel immediately a contract that makes philip morris 
companies inc part of a national archives campaign to celebrate 
the 200th anniversary of the bill of rights 
this joint venture smears the bill of rights with the blood of 
all americans killed as a result of smoking marlboro and other 
philip morris cigarettes said sidney wolfe director of public 
citizen health research group in a letter to sen jeff bingaman 
dnm 
bingaman heads the government affairs committees subcommittee 
on government information which has jurisdiction over the archives 
guy l smith vice president of corporate affairs for philip 
morris said in a telephone interview the campaign has nothing 
to do with cigarettes its about the celebration of the bill of 
rights 
don wilson archivist of the united states said in a brief 
written statement the dialogue regarding our relationship with a 
private corporation is a prime example of why the bill of rights is 
important 
wilson said he entered into the agreement because he wanted to 
make this charter of freedom available to all americans and 
philip morris could support the educational effort 
philip morris smith said his company already has gotten more 
than 200000 phone requests for copies of the document which philip 
morris will provide 
wolfe who founded the health research group in 1971 with 
consumer advocate ralph nader said the national archives 
decision to formally join philip morris effort to wrap itself in 
the bill of rights and obscure its deadly role in american and 
worldwide society must be reversed 
the campaign gives philip morris the opportunity to be back on 
the air again despite a government ban on broadcast 
advertisements for tobacco products he said at a news conference 
he acknowledged the campaign doesnt include explicit advertising 
under the agreement philip morris will donate 600000 to the 
national archives trust fund and be allowed to publish or broadcast 
announcements and promotional materials referring to the archives 
the archives will assist by providing recordings of famous 
americans voices to be used in the campaign 
a nationally televised public service announcement that is a 
part of the campaign includes the voices of the late president 
kennedy former sen barry goldwater and the late martin luther 
king jr over images of the bill of rights and scenes from civil 
rights demonstrations the announcement identifies philip morris as 
the sponsor 
we are only identified at the very end and we consciously 
separated the identification of the company from the messages about 
the themes of the bill of rights said smith 
what would martin luther king or harry truman think if they 
knew their voices were being made available by the national 
archives in order to improve the image of a company with the deadly 
record of philip morris asked wolfe in his letter 
wolfe said archives staff members have told him 475000 of the 
companys contribution will go for an exhibit gallery in the 
national archives building and the remaining 125000 will give the 
company the first charter membership in an association as yet to 
be established that will solicit corporate donations to do the 
work of the archives 
wolfe criticized commercialization of space in the building 
which houses the symbols of our nation and said the formation of 
a national archives corporate boosters club raises questions 
about the importance congress places on the basic documents of 
american history if it wont provide adequate public funding for 
the work of the government repository

deng xiaoping chinas senior leader passed his 
last formal leadership post to his chosen successor thursday and 
the communist party laid out an austere economic plan for the next 
two years 
deng 85 resigned as chairman of the partys powerful central 
military commission in favor of party chief jiang zemin he still 
heads the state military commission a virtual mirror of the party 
group but said in a letter released thursday he also would leave 
that job 
the move solidifies jiangs position and appears at least to 
suspend a reported power struggle between him and president yang 
shangkun jiang 63 had not held a national post until his 
elevation to party leader after the prodemocracy movement was 
crushed in june 
in washington richard solomon the assistant secretary of state 
for east asian affairs said the united states was not surprised by 
dengs move and added i suspect he will remain an influence 
you could say that the change wouldnt have occurred if there 
wasnt a certain element of stability there solomon commented 
foreign diplomats and chinese sources agree deng is likely to 
remain the leading voice in party and government affairs as he has 
been since leaving the politburo and central committee in 1987 
yang an 82yearold former general with strong army 
connections was named vice chairman of the central military 
commission which sets military policy he is reported to have 
sought the chairmanship to consolidate his power base 
in another concession to yang a mastermind of the june military 
crackdown his younger brother yang baibing an army political 
commissar was appointed secretarygeneral of the commission 
although deng described jiang a former shanghai party boss with 
a weak power base in beijing as the nucleus of the new 
leadership many feel the party leaders political fortunes are 
tied to dengs physical health 
xinhua the official news agency quoted dengs resignation 
letter dated wednesday as saying as early as 1980 i proposed 
reforming the leadership system of the party and state and 
abolishing the lifelong tenure of leading posts 
i have insisted on not taking up daytoday affairs and have 
been looking forward to completing the succession of the older 
generation by the younger generation as soon as possible and 
realizing my aspiration of completely retiring from the leading 
posts 
the central committee praised deng as the chief architect in 
all aspects of the partys and armys works 
a lengthy communique said he was an outstanding marxist a 
staunch communist a brilliant proletarian revolutionary statesman 
and military strategist and a longtested leader of the party and 
state 
it said economic reforms deng began a decade ago would continue 
but for at least two years the people must lead a thrifty life 
to fight inflation of nearly 20 percent annually toorapid growth 
and corruption 
the party outlined goals of lower consumption tighter financial 
control realigned industrial structure and increased production 
dengs letter in turn lauded jiang who became head of the 48 
millionmember party after zhao ziyang was dismissed in june zhao 
dengs former protege was accused of being too close to the 
prodemocracy movement 
of the party leadership deng said it had created a leading 
nucleus headed by comrade jiang zemin and it is now already 
carrying out its work effectively 
although it is possible yang has been shunted aside his strong 
military ties are important because the armys power was enhanced 
by the brutal june crackdown in which hundreds of people were 
killed 
in addition to having his brother beside him as the military 
commissions secretarygeneral he has an ally in the army chief of 
staff chi haotian said to be his soninlaw 
during the studentled protests that began in april deng and 
yang were the party military commissions chairman and junior vice 
chairman respectively they prevailed over zhao the first vice 
chairman in having martial law declared and ultimately sending in 
troops 
such a graphic illustration of how leaders could summon the army 
to support their policies gave the commission new eminence in the 
party power structure 
in the southwestern city of chengdu on thursday an official 
said six people had been executed for participating in riots in 
june the executions brought to at least 18 the number of people 
put to death in china after the prodemocracy movement was crushed 
at beijing university which was a center of protest students 
with party membership were summoned to a meeting thursday and 
ordered to tell classmates not to use dengs resignation as an 
excuse for rash action a student said 
no incidents were reported on campus 
we admire deng xiaoping but its good that hes stepping 
down since hes so old said a student who was active in the 
protests hes a skillful statesman we dont hate him because 
he wants reform in his heart even though he took such harsh 
measures back in june 
he said of jiang we dont dislike him hes more like the 
lesser of two evils

afghan guerrillas on thursday said 
the afghan government resurrected a 9yearold list of executed 
political prisoners as a ploy to distance themselves from their 
marxist predecessors 
lord nicholas bethell a british member of the european 
parliament turned over a copy of the list to officials of the 
insurgents afghan governmentinexile in pakistan 
bethell said afghan president najib gave him the list containing 
thousands of names on a visit to kabul last week where he secured 
the release of three rebel prisoners 
an afghan rebel spokesman in pakistan najibullah lafrey said 
the list was first published in 1980 im not sure what the 
purpose of this is except to try to distance themselves from the 
past he said 
it contained names of thousands of people secret police executed 
in the 20 months after the april 1978 coup that brought communists 
to power it included two former prime ministers noor ahmad 
etimadi and mohammad musa shafiq 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 they 
installed a new leader then remained to help fight a growing 
anticommunist insurgency before withdrawing this year 
afghanistans first communist leaders were nur mohammad taraki 
and hafizullah amin of the khalq faction of the peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan both eventually were assassinated 
the soviets replaced amin in 1979 with rival babrak karmal of 
the partys parcham wing najib of the same faction became head 
of secret police for the next five years 
najib was installed as party chief in 1986 after karmal stepped 
down for health reasons 
when karmal issued the list of secret police victims in february 
1980 it was seen as an attempt to discredit karmals predecessors 
it is still available in kabul bookshops 
lefrey charged the list was being resurrected to further 
distance najib from his partys communist revolutionary roots 
the kabul government in recent years has attempted to shed its 
marxist taint in favor of islam afghanistans dominant religion 
in an effort to broaden its support 
but the guerrillas have fought bitterly to topple it and 
establish an allmoslem government 
bethell told the associated press that said some kabul lawmakers 
mentioned there had been a list of 11000 in the early years of 
the revolution but he did not know whether his was a carbon copy 
of the earlier one 
while najib was head of khad he did much worse than what was 
on that list lefrey charged some think the number of people 
who have been executed is 70000 to 80000 in the past 10 years

the absence of federal seafood inspection puts 
us fishermen at a competitive disadvantage and leaves consumers 
unsure about the quality of fish witnesses told a congressional 
hearing thursday 
house democrats representing coastal districts are pushing the 
bush administration to back a plan for federally funded inspections 
to provide consumers the same quality assurances available for 
chicken and beef 
administration officials told the subcommittee on fisheries and 
wildlife conservation and the environment that they have reached no 
decision on the issue 
the administration has not come to the conclusion that it is 
not needed right now said james brennan of the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration but he added the administration 
has not come down on a position on what it wants to do 
brennans comment drew a sharp rebuke from the subcommittee 
chairman rep gerry studds dmass who said i dont think 
weve had a matter of consequence before this committee on which 
the administration has had a position 
the cost of a federally funded seafood inspection program could 
range from 50 million to 80 million according to lester crawford 
of the agriculture departments food safety inspection service 
currently the seafood industry pays about 6 million as much as 
100000 per year for an individual company for seafood 
inspections 
brennan said one reason for the administrations reluctance to 
provide financing is that seafood inspection is a direct benefit to 
the industry because it promotes consumer confidence 
in essence were talking about how to promote the us 
industry and whether the us industry should pay for it brennan 
said 
studds said that the beef and poultry industries benefit from 
governmentfinanced inspections while fishmermen must pay for their 
own 
over eight years the subcommittee said consumption of 
commercial seafood rose by 20 percent a year to a record high in 
1987 of 154 pounds per capita

up from 1144 forecast in october and 846 bushels in 1988 but 
still below the record of 1194 bushels per acre in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop it is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products

percent from last years output and 2 percent below the september 
estimate of 123 million bales the new estimate was up about 1 
percent from october the cotton record was 189 million bales in 
1937 
no new estimates of 1989 production of wheat and other crops 
harvested earlier were included in the report 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 198990 marketing year that 
began on sept 1 is expected to be about 7625 billion bushels 
including domestic and export requirements an increase from 75 
billion forecast in october 
with demand exceeding 1989 corn production that will mean a 
further drawdown of us stockpiles to about 19 billion bushels 
left over by next sept 1 down from inventories estimated at 193 
billion bushels at the beginning of the marketing year 
still that represents only a slight dip in the us corn 
stockpile compared to last seasons decline when it plummeted 
from 426 billion bushels on sept 1 1988 to the 193 billion 
bushels on hand this sept 1 
analysts said total corn use in the coming year will be boosted 
by larger exports than had been anticipated about 215 billion 
bushels instead of the 2 billion that was forecast last month 
larger imports by the soviet union are expected to account for a 
much of the increase 
the report said us corn prices may average in the range of 2 
to 240 per bushel in the 198990 marketing year down from 254 
last season the october forecast was 185 to 225 per bushel 
other 1989 crop estimates based on oct 1 indications compared 
with 1988 output included 
sorghum 6289 million bushels and an average yield of 598 
bushels per acre compared with 5776 million and 638 in 1988

the military government on thursday 
stepped up security to curb a wave of crime that opposition leaders 
say is a serious threat to next months elections and the countrys 
transition to democratic rule 
police patrols were reinforced in this capital of 5 million 
people especially in areas where banks and shops are concentrated 
police carrying submachine guns and wearing bulletproof vests were 
seen in santiagos center 
police said all vacations and days off were temporarily 
suspended in the 29000member force 
the governments reaction came after a series of often violent 
robberies of banks supermarkets shops and private residences and 
several incidents of violence related to the current campaign for 
the presidential and congressional elections scheduled for dec 14 
patricio aylwin the opposition presidential candidate highly 
favored by most polls to win suggested radical progovernment 
groups may be behind the crime wave 
an atmosphere of violence and unrest only serves those who 
know are going to lose the election aylwin said in southern 
chile where he is campaigning 
the election will mark the restoration of civilian rule in 
chile which has been ruled by an authoritarian military regime 
since the 1973 coup led by rightwing president gen augusto 
pinochet 
police records show violent incidents have occurred almost daily 
for five weeks on wednesday two armed men wearing ski masks 
entered the home of enrique silva a leading opposition politician 
severely beat his wife and fled 
wilson tapia silvas soninlaw said the men first demanded 
money and jewels but then fled with only a box containing family 
documents and souvenirs tapia said the men did not look like 
common criminals 
earlier this month similar incidents occurred at the homes of 
two wellknown television journalists 
in the most serious political incident jecar neghme leader of 
a radical leftist group was assasinated sept 30 no arrests have 
been reported 
after the incident at silvas residence opposition leaders said 
the series of violent crimes may be part of an effort to interfere 
in the election campaign 
the coalition of 17 parties supporting aylwin said in a 
statement these criminal actions constitute a suspicious pattern 
of provocations and an apparently wellplanned effort to scare and 
alarm citizens 
mario astorga vice president of silvas radical party claimed 
his party has information that members of the governments secret 
police are operating in this situations he did not elaborate 
former finance minister hernan buchi the progovernment 
presidential candidate said the incident at silvas home is more 
than just a common crime it can be interpreted as an attack on the 
process of democratic restoration 
he said the government has the obligation of investigating 
and arresting the attackers 
the government said it will ensure the countrys tranquility 
and security and will maintain public order during the campaign 
and until the inauguration of the new government next march 11 
col cristian labbe the governments secretary general accused 
the opposition of trying to make political gains from a situation 
that worries the entire country 
pinochet was obliged to call the election after last years 
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend 
his rule until 1997

aerosol deodorants will be banned in 
california within six years unless their makers can find 
alternatives to harmful air pollutants emitted by the spray cans a 
state regulatory agency ruled 
the decision wednesday by the air resources board was its first 
step in adopting a plan to reduce pollution from a variety of 
consumer aerosol products the board ordered an 80 percent cut in 
hydrocarbons found in spray cans by jan 1 1995 
this landmark action requires manufacturers to use more 
environmentally acceptable substitutes if they choose to continue 
selling aerosols and will likely set a precedent for other consumer 
product actions that follow board chairwoman jananne sharpless 
said in a statement 
hydrocarbons one of many sources of smog and other pollution 
that scientists say harm human lungs are used as a propellant in 
many spray products 
only a very few hydrocarbons are known to harm the earths 
ozone they became popular after 1978 when chlorofluorocarbons or 
cfcs were banned in the united states because of their danger to 
the ozone layer 
representatives of the aerosol industry attacked the decision 
saying it would force them to withdraw some products from the 
california market 
other new regulations under consideration for household products 
and for fuels and industrial processes include a proposed 
regulation to control smoke from wood stoves in homes 
aerosol products from hair spray to pesticides will come under 
board scrutiny in coming months sharpless said wednesdays 
decision applied to deodorants 
the agency is not attempting to pass a judgment on any 
particular type of product or put manufacturers out of business 
she said 
sharpless called higher prices that could result from the 
regulation the price consumers must pay for a safe environment 
the board heard from a number of industry representatives who 
said the deadlines were unrealistic and that some companies may 
have to take their products out of the california market 
the board nonetheless voted 62 to adopt the 
deodorantantiperspirant regulation the dissenters dr eugene 
boston of fullerton and mayor roberta hughan of gilroy said they 
were voting no because they wanted a tougher regulation 
the 1995 ban is part of a complex regulation that would allow 
exceptions for manufacturers to keep some polluting aerosol 
products on the market until 1999

house speaker thomas s foley said thursday 
that congress will consider giving itself a pay raise even if it 
fails to resolve the budget crisis that has the pentagon 
threatening tens of thousands of layoffs 
but other lawmakers said passing the pay raise and ethics reform 
package is already a politically dicey proposition and could fail 
unless congress first puts the governments fiscal affairs in 
better order 
foley dwash has been meeting with leaders of both parties in 
an effort to push through a pay raise this year as part of a 
package that also would tighten congressional ethics regulations 
including clamping down on accepting fees for speeches to interest 
groups 
foley and house republican leaders have been working with the 
white house to craft a package acceptable to the senate and to 
president bush last week bush spokesman marlin fitzwater 
indicated the presidents willingness to look at such a proposal 
but the president himself was silent 
i think when the time comes the president will be 
forthcoming in his support foley said 
members of congress are paid 89500 a year a plan to boost 
salaries by 51 percent was killed earlier this year after a storm 
of public protest 
the house leadership has been briefing members this week on 
their new plan which includes a pay raise of about 8 percent to go 
into effect january 1 and another 25 percent boost a year later 
the raise would apply to members of congress federal judges and 
top executive branch officials 
foley said he thought the package could be brought before the 
full house as early as next week he said it would move forward 
even if congress has failed to address governmentwide spending 
cuts ordered last month because lawmakers have failed to reduce the 
federal deficit 
that is a separate matter i dont think we are likely to 
see any direct connection between the two foley said 
those cutbacks required by the grammrudman law cut many 
domestic and military programs pentagon officials testified this 
week that the 21 million active duty armed forces would have to be 
reduced by about 229000 in the next year 
the democraticcontrolled congress and the president are 
currently in negotiations over a deficitreduction bill which would 
cancel those cutbacks house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dwash said he hoped to produce a bill by the end of 
next week 
if that effort fails he said he thought passage of a pay 
increase was unlikely 
whether people like it or not the two issues are tied very 
closely together he said 
what could become untied in the future is the salary of house 
and senate members 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and republican 
leader bob dole rkan said this week the senate would accept 
perhaps without even a vote a costofliving adjustment 
which is what the house leaders are calling the 8 percent raise 
next january 
senators generally are wealthier than house members and their 
rules allow them to keep more speaking fees than their colleagues 
across the capitol 
theres not a lot of support in the senate for a pay raise 
mitchell said 
if the congress approved a pay raise for the house and not the 
senate it would be odd said sen gordon humphrey rnh who 
said he supports raising senate salaries and eliminating the 
acceptance of honoraria 
but it would not be unprecedented from dec 21 1982 through 
july 1 1983 house members were paid 69800 and the senate 
60662

a bush administration official testified 
thursday against a proposal that the government issue work 
authorization cards on request both to citizens and to aliens 
eligible to work in this country 
such cards would be used largely by immigrants distinguishing 
those who are in this country legally from those who are here 
illicitly 
this could lead to discrimination against those individuals 
who do not have the card said paul w virtue acting general 
counsel for the immigration and naturalization service 
he added that such a card might be viewed as a national identity 
card which congress has forbidden 
rep bruce a morrison dconn who sponsored the proposal for 
a work authorization card said that social security cards are used 
much like identity cards 
morrison said the card he proposed would help prevent fraud and 
discourage employers from discriminating against various groups 
they spoke at a hearing of the subcommittee on immigration 
which morrison chairs the subcommittee is part of the house 
judiciary committee 
opposition to morrisons idea also came from the general 
accounting office an investigative agency of congress and from 
the american civil liberties union 
but there was favorable comment from the national restaurant 
association

the agriculture department said thursday that 
the soviet unions 1989 grain harvest turned out larger than 
predicted but that moscow still must import huge amounts of grain 
in the year ahead 
currently the department expects the soviet harvest to total 
208 million metric tons an increase of three million tons from the 
previous forecast 
that would compare with 1951 million tons in 1988 and would be 
the fifth largest soviet harvest on record exceeded by 2374 
million tons in 1978 2238 million in 1976 2114 million in 1987 
and 2101 million in 1986 
production of rye barley oats corn sorghum and millet 
socalled coarse grain was indicated at 1055 million tons up 
25 million from the previous forecast in october wheat output was 
unchanged at 89 million tons but miscellaneous grain was increased 
by 500000 tons to 135 million 
total grain imports by the soviet union in the 198990 trade 
year which began july 1 were estimated at 37 million tons up 
three million from earlier that would still be short of the 39 
million tons imported in 198788 and the record 555 million in 
198485 
no specific breakdown showing us shares of the soviet trade 
was included but the report noted that moscow was recently cleared 
to buy 16 million tons of us grain in 198990 under a longterm 
agreement 
however the agreement year began on oct 1 so the comparisons 
are not exact in 198889 the soviets bought a record of 217 
million tons of us wheat and corn and so far this year have 
purchased 81 million tons for 198990 delivery

a congresswoman thursday questioned the navys 
decision to make the skipper of the uss iowa eligible for another 
major command in light of inquiries into the battleship blast that 
killed 47 sailors 
rep mary rose oakar dohio said she was asking navy secretary 
lawrence garrett iii to explain the alleged selection of capt 
fred p moosally for sequential major command 
the navy investigation concluded that gunners mate clayton 
hartwig of ohio most likely caused the april 19 explosion by 
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one 
of the ships 16inch guns 
members of congress hartwigs family and shipmates have 
criticized the report oakar has asked the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress to review the navys 
findings 
the navy screening board that took the action on moosally 
includes rear adm richard milligan who headed the services 
investigation into the explosion oakar said 
i realize that consideration and possible selection of capt 
moosally does not commit the navy to consider him for sequential 
major command but i question the propriety of such action while 
there are several congressional and navy investigations ongoing 
oakar said 
moosally oakar said received a nonpunitive letter of 
admonition oct 3 after an administrative hearing on the iowa 
explosion 
a sequential major command for a navy officer would be a move 
from commanding a cruiser or battleship to another similar command 
navy officials said 
the selection or nonselection of an individual is predicated 
on his or her past performance and an individuals entire career 
and his or her performance during that entire career is 
considered said cmdr craig quigley at the pentagon 
if someone is selected that means they are just eligible 
quigley said 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of a house armed 
services subcommittee thats reviewing the matter cited an fbi 
report that said its laboratory inquiry was inconclusive about what 
caused the explosion 
the senate armed services committee will question milligan 
moosally and robert j powers who heads the criminal division of 
the naval investigative service at a hearing nov 16

bushs choice to be ambassador to barbados saying the nominees 
only qualification was that she made large contributions to the 
republican party 
im out to put an end to this ambassadorial spoils 
system sen paul sarbanes dmd told the senate foreign 
relations committee about the nomination of joy silverman 
there are no qualifications for this lady sarbanes said 
theres nothing there theres no there there 
sen rudy boschwitz rny defended the nomination saying 
bush made it because of his friendship with mrs silverman not 
because she was a large gop contributor 
sarbanes exercising his rights under the rules of the senate 
foreign relations committee blocked committee action for at least 
a week but some republicans said they feared the senate might be 
prevented from acting at all because the current session of 
congress is nearing an end 
sarbanes said mrs silverman and her husband jeffrey gave 
about 300000 to the national republican party in 1987 and 1988 
that figure he said didnt include other large contributions to 
gop candidates in new york state and new york city 
jeffrey silvermans company ply gem industries inc of new york 
city made other large contributions to republican causes many of 
which have not been identified sarbanes said 
the silvermans also arranged a 100000 corporate loan in 
december 1988 to president bushs inaugural committee about the 
same time mrs silverman was making clear her interest in an 
ambassadorship sarbanes said 
the interestfree loan which had been solicited with about 200 
others for seed money to plan and arrange inaugural events was 
repaid a month later sarbanes said 
the silvermans are members of team 100 people who have 
contributed 100000 or more to the republican national committee 
sarbanes said the many prominent figures who wrote letters 
urging that mrs silverman be named an ambassador cited no other 
qualifications than her abilities as a gop fundraiser 
in her submission to the senate foreign relations committee 
mrs silverman said she was qualified for the post because she had 
assisted my husband by planning and hosting corporate functions 
sarbanes has opposed several of bushs nominees on grounds they 
had no apparent qualifications except their large political 
contributions 
he said there are 41 women in the senior service of the us 
foreign service all highly qualified and experienced none has 
been named by bush as an ambassador

one woman crawled to the polls some 
people waded across rivers others camped overnight at polling 
stations as namibians displayed a fierce determination to vote in 
their first open elections 
namibians have peacefully endured hours of searing heat wind 
and dust in milelong lines to vote for an assembly that will write 
a constitution paving the way for independence from south africa 
perhaps i can hopefully in the end of this exercise say 
that this has been the most democratic elections in the world 
un special representative martti ahtisaari said thursday after 
touring polling booths in northern namibia 
the united nations is supervising the independence process in 
the territory which south africa has ruled for 74 years no date 
for independence has been set but independence is expected to be 
early next year 
by thursday the third day of 5day elections more than 60 
percent of the 701483 registered voters had cast ballots 
according to ahtisaari and territorial officials 
ahtisaari flew to the northern ovambo district namibias most 
populous area and was told that 75 percent of those registered in 
the region already had voted 
i think it indicates how dedicated the namibians are how 
anxious they have been to use their democratic right in this 
election he remarked 
namibias south african administrator louis pienaar predicted 
wednesday the voter turnout would be nearly 100 percent by the time 
polls closed saturday 
lines were much shorter thursday but the queues snaking along 
sandy village and township roads during the previous two days 
showed the variety of peoples who populate the territory 
diminutive bushmen claycovered himba women with animalskin 
aprons tall herero women in victorianstyle dresses and city 
dwellers in tshirts declaring my vote is my secret all stood 
in line quietly patiently and with good humor 
no reports of serious political violence and few instances of 
intimidation emerged election code violations have occurred such 
as anonymous smear pamphlets aimed at discrediting the southwest 
africa peoples organization the election favorite 
swapo president sam nujoma said before voting began that the 
organization would accept any outcome certified by the united 
nations 
the key election issue is whether swapo will win twothirds of 
the vote necessary to write a constitution without consulting the 
other nine parties 
polling stations in the northern region have no electricity or 
phones some were set up by teams flown in by helicopter water 
trucks and candles were brought in 
near oshakati a lame woman who had come without friends crawled 
toward the polling booth wednesday in another ovambo village a 
crippled man pushed himself along with his hands 
a un official in the northeastern town of rundu said voters 
crossed the okavango river in small canoes or waded across it 
people who live in neighboring countries can vote if they or 
their parents were born in namibia or if they resided in the 
territory for four years 
un regional director linda cohen said the kavango people most 
of whom havent voted in a century of colonial rule began arriving 
at the rundu polling station more than eight hours before it opened 
they were just excited they wanted to be the first she 
said theyve been waiting a long time for this to happen

east berliners reacted with astonishment to the 
announcement thursday that their communist government was allowing 
them to travel freely to the west for the first time in decades 
is it really true asked mario schmidt 
show me the adn report the 18yearold demanded seizing a 
copy of the news as reported by east germanys official news agency 
why dont they just tear the wall down right away said 
student birgit grosspetzsch 18 referring to the berlin wall built 
in 1961 by east germany to keep its citizens from going west 
late thursday about 100 east germans gathered at the 
brandenburg gate the huge monument just over the berlin wall in 
east berlin 
open the gate open the gate they chanted 
two sisters whose last trip west was to the funeral of their 
grandmother in west berlin in 1966 were so happy that tears of joy 
brimmed in their eyes 
were going to the friends in west berlin as soon as we can 
said the older sister aged 56 really great added her 
44yearold sister 
west german police said about 100 east germans had already 
crossed through berlin wall crossing points while other east 
germans apparently waited for police offices that issue visas to 
open in the morning the government announcement came after the 
offices closed 
guenter schabowski a member of the ruling politburo announced 
that east germanys heavily fortified frontier with west germany 
would be opened as a provisional step until a law is passed to 
allow greater freedom of travel 
the decision means all east germans can travel over all east 
german border checkpoints including through the berlin wall 
schabowski told reporters in east berlin 
schabowski did not say when the law would be passed 
several young people thought the news would help to stem the 
mass exodus to the west more than 200000 have fled for the west 
so far this year including 50000 who have escaped through 
czechoslovakia since saturday

who have fled west in recent weeks through hungary and 
czechoslovakia

underwear to her 19yearold son who fled to west berlin through 
prague last week she was carrying the garments in a plastic bag 
ready to mail off when she heard the news

they cant cope any more thomas said 
west german officials have said their reception centers are 
overflowing with the east germans who have come west just since 
their communist government allowed them out through czechoslovakia 
last friday 
although relaxing travel restrictions would satisfy one of the 
central demands of dissatisfied east germans others remain 
demonstrators have demanded free elections and the end of the 
communists 40year monopoly on power 
one party thats a dictatorship and nothing will change 
said an 80yearold widow we need a multiparty government 
weve got to get the right people in there then we can start 
talking said wolfgang karek 50 a newspaper vendor and 
parttime musician 
communist leader egon krenz on thursday urged a new law ensuring 
free and democratic elections but he did not say whether he was 
urging a true multiparty system 
despite the jubilation over the prospect of free travel east 
berliners remain skeptical of promised reforms having heard too 
many promises from the communists before to believe in fundamental 
change now 
the changes are not yet really what we want said a canteen 
worker in his 50s we need completely new people weve seen 
where it led with the old lot 
you can forget him a 70yearold retired trade worker said 
of krenz just a puppet like all the rest of them for the 
moment hes the only man possible but he wont last

three scientists including former space 
shuttle astronaut sally k ride on thursday challenged the bush 
administration argument that nucleartipped sealaunched cruise 
missiles cannot be detected on vessels 
in an article in science magazine the scientists endorsed a 
soviet argument that a total ban on those missiles could be 
verified under a proposed strategic arms reduction treaty start 
now under superpower negotiation 
the verification of arms control limits on nucleararmed slcms 
sealaunched cruise missiles does not present insuperable 
problems and can be accomplished at a level of both effectiveness 
and intrusiveness which is likely to be characteristic of the 
other verification provisions of start said the article by ride 
and fellow physcists george n lewis and john s townsend 
ride left the shuttle program and is a professor of physics at 
the university of california at san diego 
matt murphy a spokesman for the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said officials were studying the article and 
had no immediate comment 
navy officers in particular have opposed including the missiles 
in start because they do not want soviet inspectors aboard us 
submarines and because they say it would be easy to circumvent a 
ban or reduction 
the article contested that contention proposing a detailed plan 
to inspect missiles at their point of origin tag and seal them 
and provide for inspections no more intrusive than others 
envisioned under start 
last september the soviets withdrew their insistence that the 
sealaunched cruise missile ban be included in start but said they 
wanted a separate slcm deal 
bush administration officals have said a start pact to reduce 
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent might be 
ready by the time of a planned summit next spring or summer 
the united states has approximately 370 nuclear and 1670 
longrange tomahawk sealaunched cruise missiles that can be fired 
from about 70 us surface ships and submarines and have a range of 
about 1600 miles the article said 
the soviet union has an estimated 400 shortrange nuclear slcms 
and has deployed a smaller number of nuclear ssn21 missiles with 
a range of about 1800 miles it said 
the article said that such missiles cannot be readily or 
safely moved about or hidden on such ships 
furthermore conversion of a tomahawk from conventional to 
nuclear although technically feasible would be a complex and 
timeconsuming operation that pratically speaking could be 
performed only at a factory it said 
considerations such as these taken together suggest that 
slcm verification is not the intractable problem it is often 
presented to be and that effective monitoring of slcm deployments 
is possible without an unprecedented degree of intrusiveness it 
said 
inspecting tagging and sealing of slcms would be carried out 
in a special verification facility it said 
at each facility superpower inspectors would assure that 
missiles were not nuclear and could not be changed at sea gamma 
ray levels from nucleararmed slcms are sufficient to alert 
inspectors to deception it said 
additionally it said scientists at the us sandia national 
laboratory had developed a tag that could give each missile a 
distinctive fingerprint that would be read by shining a light 
at it from different angles 
similarly it said a tamperproof seal consisting of optic 
fibers had been developed to allow inspectors to assure that a 
missile had not been armed with a nuclear warhead 
to break the ban it said a potential cheater would have to 
build a secret production facility conduct clandestine tests and 
covertly transport and deploy the missiles 
each of these steps would involve risks collectively they 
would represent a substantial level of activity which would be 
difficult to hide it said 
moreover it said the military significance of covertly 
produced nuclear slcms should not be exaggerated nucleararmed 
slcms would need to be hidden on land rather than at sea and in 
a rapidly developing crisis covert slcms would not be available 
for use 
there would be little incentive to attempt such cheating 
since doing so would provide little in the way of reliable 
available military capabilities that are not already provided by 
other weapons it said

the army said thursday that it had grounded 
its fleet of ah64 apache attack helicopters after a flaw was 
discovered on two of the gunships during maintenance inspections 
the army said in a statement released at the pentagon that the 
grounding of the 526 choppers expected to last a few days was a 
precautionary measure because a cracked retention nut was found on 
the two helicopters 
the apache is the armys newest and most sophisticated 
helicopter gunship 
army spokesman maj barry bomier said no accidents had been 
reported because of the problem adding that it was the fourth 
grounding of the entire apache fleet 
the fleet based throughout the united states and europe was 
grounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accident 
in which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunships rotor blade 
the grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of the 
part is completed at the us army aviation systems command in st 
louis mo the analysis should result in information to identify 
the proper procedure for maintenance crews to follow bomier said 
the part known as the main rotor hub retention nut holds the 
rotor onto the shaft of the aircraft bomier said 
the copilot of an army nation guard ah64 was killed and the 
pilot seriously injured in a june 29 crash in northern florida when 
the tail rotor came off the aircraft 
the army said its investigation found that a piece of sheet 
metal used to help secure a door had been improperly stored and 
that the piece of metal became dislodged and flew into the ah64s 
tail rotor system 
the choppers built by mcdonnell douglas formerly hughes 
helicopters cost about 13 million each 
the gunship was commissioned to replace the cobra as the armys 
primary attack helicopter the twinengined apache designed to 
destroy enemy tanks carries hellfire and hydra 7 missiles and a 
30mm cannon

wholesale prices rose 04 percent in october 
as the biggest spurt in food costs in 22 months offset the positive 
effects from moderating energy prices the government reported 
thursday 
while the increase in the labor departments producer price 
index was double what economists had been expecting most of them 
stressed that they saw no reason for worries that inflationary 
pressures are threatening to get out of hand 
the 04 percent october rise was down from a giant 09 percent 
september increase and many economists predicted that the news on 
inflation will continue to improve in coming months as a slowing 
economy takes more pressure off prices 
for the first 10 months of this year prices at the wholesale 
level have been rising at an annual rate of 52 percent compared 
to an increase of 4 percent in 1988 
stacy kottman an economist at georgia state university said 
that he looked for wholesale inflation to return to an annual rate 
of 4 percent in 1990 
assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable 
we expect further moderation in prices he said we dont see 
any reason for prices to vault upward 
virtually all of the price pressure last month came from a sharp 
14 percent jump in food costs reflecting a 189 percent surge in 
vegetable prices that analysts blamed on weather problems in 
california and florida fruit pork and fish prices also took a 
jump upward 
the overall food advance was the biggest since a 15 percent 
spike in january 1988 but analysts noted that food costs had 
actually dropped in three of the previous four months they called 
the october increase a temporary aberration and not a signal of 
spiraling food costs ahead 
energy costs which had soared 65 percent in september 
moderated in october posting a modest 02 percent advance 
gasoline prices rose 23 percent but the cost of natural gas fell 
25 percent while home heating oil prices edged down 05 percent 
wholesale prices excluding energy and food costs were up a 
tiny 01 percent in october many analysts consider this figure a 
better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures because both food 
and energy prices are volatile from month to month 
new car prices fell by 14 percent in october as the new models 
were introduced reflecting efforts by automakers to overcome 
sluggish demand by keeping a lid on price increases 
economists said the october wholesale price report provided 
support for the decision this week by the federal reserve to lower 
interest rates in an effort to spur the economy 
while the bush administration has been pressuring the central 
bank to lower rates in order to keep the country out of a 
recession the fed had been resisting those moves because of fears 
that inflationary pressures were still too high 
but many private economists said they believed the feds rate 
reduction this week was appropriate given widespread evidence of 
economic weakness particularly in the us manufacturing sector 
and reports showing that inflation is moderating 
however federal reserve board governor wayne angell said 
thursday that he believed that inflation needs to be reduced 
further calling the current rate of increase in consumer prices 
too high 
he called for consumer price increases to be shaved to the range 
of 3 percent saying this goal would be acheived in the first half 
of 1990 so far this year consumer prices have been rising at an 
annual rate of 44 percent 
analysts said that angells comments indicated that the fed may 
be prepared to wait awhile before following this weeks interest 
rate cut with further reductions 
the producer price index reflects the cost of goods one stop 
short of retail before adjusting for normal seasonal variation 
the ppi stood at 1148 in october meaning that a marketbasket of 
goods costing 100 in the base year of 1982 would have cost 11480 
last month up from 10940 a year ago

the new us ambassador to malta said 
thursday she does not believe that visiting libyans in malta pose 
any special security risk for next months superpower summit 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are 
scheduled to hold shipboard meetings off malta on dec 23 
ambassador sally novetzke who presented her credentials 
thursday to president vincent tabone also said she considers it 
unlikely any meeting would be arranged between bush and libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi during the summit 
the socialist party leader and former prime minister karmenu 
mifsud bonnici on wednesday called on the government to try to 
arrange a bushgadhafi meeting in an effort to reduce tensions 
between the two countries 
the bush administration has said previously it was not prepared 
to hold talks with libya it said last month that libya is still 
providing funds weapons haven and training facilities to 
terrorists 
bonnici was the prime minister in april 1986 when malta gave 
libya advance warning of the us air raids on the libyan cities of 
benghazi and tripoli 
however libya apparently did not act on the information 
thenpresident reagan said the bombing raids were intended to 
punish libya for its alleged support of international terrorism 
the socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16 years in power 
and the conservative government of prime minister eddie fenech 
adami has moved closer to the united states and western europe 
mrs novetzke said the fact that libyans are allowed to freely 
visit malta does not pose any special security risk for the summit 
it is not a worry she said

about 1000 protesters burned 
effigies of president corazon aquino and uncle sam on thursday and 
carried banners reading yankee go home in demanding that the 
countrys six us bases be closed 
the protest in front of the us embassy took place before mrs 
aquino met president bush in washington for two hours of talks that 
included the future of the military bases whose lease expires in 
1991 
us and filipino negotiators are expected to begin talks in 
manila next month on extending the bases mrs aquino refuses to 
say whether she wants a new agreement 
sen wigberto tanada a member of the proaquino coalition told 
the rally that even if mrs aquino supported a new agreement the 
senate would disapprove it 
the constitution requires approval of any bases agreement by 
twothirds of the 23member senate tanada told the crowd 10 
senators were committed to dismantling the bases in 1991 and he 
expected up to five more to support closure 
when cory and bush hold hands that will be the climax of 
corys betrayal of the filipino people said one leaflet by the 
new patriotic alliance the may first movement and the league of

a federal judge thursday approved a 235 
million settlement for 117 female flight attendants who sued pan 
american world airways for using stricter weight standards for them 
than for men 
us district judge thelton henderson said the settlement was 
fundamentally fair and highly favorable to the attendants despite 
objections from six women whose damage claims were fully or 
partially denied 
the settlement will be shared by 117 women who were suspended 
fired or denied promotions because of the weight policy said 
kathleen king an attorney for the independent union of flight 
attendants 
pan am also agreed to liberalize weight standards for current or 
future employees 
the former policy used a 1959 insurance company table of heights 
and weights but judged men under the standard for large frames and 
women under the standard for medium frames a 5foot7 woman was 
allowed to weigh 139 pounds under the medium standard but would 
have been allowed to weigh 150 under the large standard 
the flight attendants union sued pan am in 1984 and won a 
ruling from henderson three years later in a nonjury trial that 
the policy was biased 
the ruling was the first to find discrimination by an airline 
that had weight policies for both men and women pan am attorney 
richard schoolman said at the time 
henderson ordered the airline to use a largeframe standard for 
all employees hired while the policy was in effect through the end 
of 1984 
pan am appealed hendersons ruling denying it had 
discriminated the appeal is being dropped as part of the 
settlement without any admission of discrimination 
the settlement retains hendersons previous order on weight 
standards and also increases some of the standards adopted by the 
airline in 1985 when it started setting weight requirements 
according to an employees individual build in addition women 
hired after 1985 get another threepound allowance at ages 35 45 
and 55 
although 25 million was less than the women might have gotten 
in individual damage claims henderson said it was reasonable in 
light of the time an appeal would have taken and the risk that the 
entire amount would have been thrown out on appeal

defense secretary dick cheney has approved a 
proposal from the top us commander in panama to cut the number of 
military dependents in the troubled region the pentagon announced 
thursday 
cheneys decision means that the majority of us service 
personnel in panama will not be accompanied by family members and 
that only about 300 to 500 men and women in socalled key and 
essential positions will be allowed to bring dependents 
the withdrawal of dependents began last spring following a 
series of incidents including harassment and assaults against 
americans 
but the new military commander in the region gen maxwell 
thurman suggested a further speedup in the withdrawal following 
the failed coup attempt on oct 3 against gen manuel antonio 
noriega the panamanian leader 
specifically thurman recommended that tour lengths for us 
servicemen and women be shortened and that those without families 
be given the shorter tours thereby reducing the number of 
dependents 
the changes were made to reduce the number of families in 
panama by reducing the number of personnel authorized to bring 
family members with them this action was recommended as a force 
protection measure to ensure the security and quality of life of 
all us military members and their families in panama said 
pentagon spokesman pete williams 
last may us officials began evacuating military dependents 
as of july 1 some 6300 defense department personnel had either 
been sent home or relocated onto us bases in panama 
but there are still roughly 11000 american dependents in the 
country 
the united states has 10000 soldiers permanently assigned to 
panama 2500 military personnel there on temporary duty 7700 
military dependents 2700 us civilian pentagon employees and 
3300 civilian dependents 
the 30month tour for those service personnel accompanied by 
families has been shortened to 24 months while those without 
dependents will now serve a 12month tour instead of 24 the 
statement said 
thurman reportedly recommended the change to heighten the sense 
of military readiness among his troops in panama where the united 
states has pressed for the removal of noriega who is wanted in the 
united states on indictments charging drug trafficking 
williams said he did not know when the new rotations would 
begin but a pentagon statement said the tour lengths of those 
already stationed in panama will be adjusted on a pro rata basis 
by the services 
in a statement issued later in the day the pentagon said it 
expected to have the number of service personnel with families 
reduced to 300 to 500 level by mid1990 but that several hundred 
families should be able to leave within the next month 
the statement said there is no accurate way to determine how 
many dependents might be in the country if only 300 to 500 service 
personnel accompanied by family members were allowed to be in 
panama 
it added that the new policy only affects military dependents 
but that a plan is under review that would also apply to the 
dependents of civilian employees of the pentagon stationed there

the soviet government broke its silence thursday 
on the rapid changes convulsing east germany with praise for its 
allys leadership shakeup and its first steps toward sovietstyle 
reforms 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said that 
although it was not the soviet unions place to comment on another 
countrys internal affairs it was clear east germany was 
undertaking a renewal of socialism 
theyre improving the situation in the sense that theyre 
moving toward perestroika on their own terms he told a news 
briefing referring to the reforms president mikhail s gorbachev 
began on coming to power in 1985 
millions of soviets learned in tv radio and newspaper reports 
of the dramatic overhaul of east germanys ruling politburo and new 
leader egon krenzs promises of democratic reforms 
the official news agency tass quickly reported that the east 
german government had thrown open all borders and that its citizens 
could travel or emigrate anywhere 
vyacheslav mostovoy a correspondent reporting on soviet 
televisions widely watched nightly news program vremya said east 
germanys central committee had begun mapping political and 
economic reforms in a program which the whole country awaits and 
on which the future of the republic largely depends 
mostovoy reporting from east germany stressed the elevation of 
reformers to the politburo he quoted krenz as saying in a speech 
that the east german communist party leadership had earlier taken a 
negative approach to changes in the soviet union and other 
socialist countries 
krenzs predecessor erich honecker had been cool to 
gorbachevs reforms and resisted implementing them in his own 
country but krenz told gorbachev in a telephone call last month 
that there are important lessons to be learned from soviet 
perestroika in the german democratic republic 
during a visit to moscow krenz discussed possible applications 
in east germany of sovietstyle reforms 
we wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of 
perestroika in the soviet union he told reporters adding he 
especially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism more 
attractive 
in its reports on east german developments radio moscow focused 
on that governments plans for a party conference and krenzs call 
for more democracy 
tass issued at least four reports one report said the changes 
the central committee is discussing came from the street and 
that the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern 
tass ran excerpts of krenzs 86page speech wednesday to the 
central committee highlighting his remarks on the former 
governments hostility toward the soviet reforms 
it quoted krenzs condemnation of the old politburos negative 
waitandsee attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude to 
processes taking place in the soviet union and other socialist 
countries 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia also gave readers 
details of krenzs speech and reported the continuing mass exodus 
of east germans 
on wednesday vremya showed mostovoy standing against the 
backdrop of an outdoor public protest in berlin and describing the 
exceptionally important political events in east germany this 
week 
the process of reform and renewal that started just a few 
weeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness mostovoy said in 
a report of about three minutes that came halfway through the 
45minute show 
mostovoy praised the east german press for covering events in 
detail and objectively and noted that thousands of people left 
the country in the past day as part of the continuing exodus to 
west germany 
pravda carried a brief report on east germany listing the new 
composition of the politburo and noting the governments appeals to 
citizens to keep the country functioning normally

in south carolina unlike puerto rico much of 
the death brought by hurricane hugo came at the peak of the storms 
impact a us government report concluded thursday 
the national centers for disease control looked at 29 injury 
deaths associated with hurricane hugo as reported by officials in 
25 south carolina counties thirteen of those deaths the cdc said 
occurred during the impact phase of the storms assault on the 
state sept 2122 
the pattern was different in puerto rico where the storm struck 
days earlier there only two of nine deaths occurred during the 
storms impact most of the deaths were electrocutions among repair 
workers after the storm 
the cdc said however that in both puerto rico and south 
carolina the historical hurricane pattern of death by drowning in 
storm surges did not hold the cdc reported just one stormsurge 
drowning in south carolina a 60yearold woman who died in her 
mobile home 
five other people drowned while trying to bring boats inland at 
charleston 
the other impactphase deaths in south carolina included four 
people crushed in mobile homes one person killed in the collapse 
of a house and two killed by falling trees 
most of the 16 injury deaths after the storm involved nine 
people who were killed in five separate house fires the fires were 
blamed on the use of candles during power outages 
four people were electrocuted during cleanup and repair work 
two people were killed by falling trees and one died in a chainsaw 
mishap 
with the south carolina deaths in mind the cdc on thursday 
recommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areas 
about the hazards of candles the need to evacuate mobile homes and 
the hazards of boating during the approach of a killer storm 
after the deaths in puerto rico the cdc last month recommended 
greater precautions for electrical workers repairing hurricane 
damage

a former fda official said thursday current 
proposals to revise food nutrition labeling requirements dont go 
far enough and would omit labels on more than 60 percent of the 
food americans eat 
sanford a miller former director of the center for food safety 
and applied nutrition at the food and drug administration told a 
food industry group the proposed legislation doesnt cover 
restaurant food or meat and poultry 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio and rep henry waxman dcalif 
have introduced the nutrition labeling and education act of 
1989 and hearings on the bill are scheduled to begin next week 
in the senate 
i am most concerned because the bill simply does not go far 
enough said miller dean of the graduate school of biomedical 
sciences at the university of texas health science center at san 
antonio 
essentially the bill ignores twothirds of the foods we eat 
regularly many of which are high in fat and sodium two of the 
nutrients for which many people have concern he told a luncheon 
sponsored by the chocolate manufacturers association 
metzenbaum in an interview defended the legislation saying 
our bill deals with practically all the foods on your grocery 
shelves everything from misleading claims on cereal boxes to the 
saturated fat content in potato chips 
it does not address labeling of meat and poultry but we hope 
the agricultural committees will follow our legislative lead he 
added 
twentythree groups including the american cancer society and 
the american heart association have endorsed the proposed 
legislation 
one consumer group said the chocolate manufacturers wants to 
derail or dilute a proposed requirement to include a detailed 
breakdown of foods fat content 
the cma doesnt want the disclosure of saturated fats said 
bruce silverglade director of legal affairs for the center for 
science in the public interest 
we believe that there should be nutritional labeling on meats 
and poultry as well as food under fda jurisdiction but attempting 
to acccomplish all that in a single congressional session would 
cause the bill to collapse under its own weight he said 
a lot of the industry concerned are looking to try to make the 
bill weaker said waxman but were going to fight to keep this 
bill as a strong consumer information and protection bill 
the legislation would require that nutrition labeling on all 
processed food under the fdas jurisdiction list the serving size 
number of servings per container total calories and a breakdown of 
calories by total and saturated fat also required would be amounts 
by servings of fats total saturated and unsaturated 
cholesterol sodium complex carbohydrates protein dietary fiber 
and other nutrients 
any health claims on labels would have to be sustantiated by a 
consensus of scientific reasoning and use terms defined by the 
secretary of health and human services

the automobile industry can meet gasoline 
mileage standards proposed for the mid1990s and beyond but doing 
so would disrupt plans to improve vehicle performance and size the 
department of energy says 
in a letter to sen richard bryan dnevada the department said 
the domestic new car fleet could meet or exceed a 328 miles per 
gallon average by 1995 and the 382 mpg average by 2001 those are 
the standards bryan seeks in a bill that would update federal 
fueleconomy requirements 
this certainly puts the gloom and doom comments of the 
industry into perspective bryan chairman of the consumer 
subcommittee of the senate committee on commerce science and 
transportation said thursday the automobile industry may have 
cried wolf one too many times 
tim mccarthy federal liaison director for the motor vehicle 
manufacturers association said he had not seen the energy 
department letter told of its contents he said it appeared to 
support the industrys contention that implementing the bryan 
standards would require a major overhaul of production plans for 
the next decade 
the problem with the bryan approach is when youre trying to 
produce a full line of vehicles that meet various industry and 
family needs it becomes difficult if not impossible to achieve 
his standards mccarthy said if you want to produce 10 million 
tiny cars a year they do have a niche in the market but its not a 
huge niche 
bryans bill would require each manufacturer to improve its 
average fuel economy by at least 20 percent beginning with the 1995 
model and 40 percent by the year 2001 
in a sept 6 letter to the energy department bryan posed a 
series of questions about the industrys ability to comply 
industry spokesmen contend the proposed standards are unrealistic 
in its response signed by deputy undersecretary linda g 
stuntz the department said domestic vehicle manufacturers could 
achieve an average of 32 to 33 mpg for new passenger cars by 1995 
if they modified product plans to make maximum use of available 
technology and return to 1987 levels of vehicle size performance 
and luxury 
while it is theoretically feasible we do not believe it is 
practical to return to the earlier 1987 levels of performance and 
size by 1995 the departments letter said 
to do so would greatly disrupt current product plans and 
lessen manufacturers ability to apply the available fuel economy 
technology and at the same time achieve emissions safety and 
possibly alternative fuels goals the letter said

the navy conceded thursday that its employees 
violated regulations in accepting free training from ibm corp 
a house subcommittee which has been investigating mismanagement 
of the navys automated data processing service said at least 128 
navy officials were improperly trained by ibm in san jose calif 
from 1985 to 1987 
the disclosure came just one day after the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress and the defense 
department testified that the navy showed partiality toward ibm in 
awarding millions of dollars of computer contracts 
its as if all the laws and regulations are being evaded and 
that we have very serious problems in terms of having open and fair 
competition in government procurement rep john conyers jr 
dmich chairman of the house government affairs subcommittee on 
legislation and national security said thursday 
it is my opinion that acceptance of the ibm vendor training 
was not in accordance with the controlling regulations roger t 
mcnamara assistant general counsel on ethics at the navy told the 
house subcommittee 
consequently government travel funds should not have been 
authorized in the first instance for such a purpose however they 
were he said 
specifically he said ibms selection of employees to attend the 
training program violated defense department and navy rules on 
accepting free vendor training 
the training represented an impermissible gratuity mcnamara 
said 
alvin f easter program manager for ibms data processing 
management institute defended its program saying none of the 
companys executive education offerings were devised for the 
navy or any other particular customer or set of customers 
easter said federal employees including the navy made up but 
a small fraction of the attendees at these san jose executive 
education classes during the entire period being considered by the 
committee 
the house subcommittee gao and defense department inquiries 
were prompted by a november 1988 letter from six ibm competitors in 
which they said they had been frozen out of much of the navys 
multibilliondollar computer market 
the companies complained to thendefense secretary frank 
carlucci that navy officials had tailored the bid specifications so 
that only ibm could win although many of the companies offer 
clones or duplicates of ibm systems at lower prices

a federal judge thursday refused to bar the 
navy from starting construction on a submarine acoustical testing 
facility in a prime fishing and recreation area in southeastern 
alaska 
us district court judge joyce green denied a motion for a 
preliminary injunction by the tongass conservation society and six 
other organizations to stop the navys planned southeast alaska 
acoustic measurement facility known as seafac in ketchikan 
gateway borough 
the navy plans to build measurement sites in the center of 
western behm canal northwest of back island and shore facilities 
on back island 
the navy anticipates tests would be under way for up to 75 days 
a year and during these periods access to some areas of behm canal 
would be restricted or prohibited 
the organizations argued that the project will threaten the 
environment of the behm canal area and threaten sport and 
commercial fishing and recreational activities in the area 
they said the navy failed to meet the requirements of the 
national environmental policy act of 1969 which requires an 
assessment of the projects impact 
green ruled that the navy fulfilled the mandate of nepa by 
giving serious consideration to the socioeconomic impacts of 
seafac and that national security interests would be compromised by 
issuing a preliminary injunction 
the judge noted that the navy has taken a number of steps 
including scheduling testing for times that avoid major fishing 
events the navy also has agreed to notify the community in advance 
of testing dates to allow people to plan around the restrictions 
the navy is having increasing difficulty monitoring noise levels 
of submarines at the two existing facilities serving the pacific 
fleet carr inlet in washington and santa cruz island in 
california 
the navy says it cannot adequately monitor the trident class of 
nuclear subs because of increasing surrounding noise levels in the 
areas and because the subs are quieter than earlier models

venezuela and guyana have moved closer 
to solving a 157yearold territorial dispute following a meeting 
between presidents of the neighboring south american nations state 
radio said thursday 
guyanas desmond hoyte and venezuelas carlos andres perez 
agreed wednesday in caracas to appoint a mediator to settle the 
dispute that involves 60 percent of guyanas land including all of 
its mineralrich western region 
since 1832 11 years after gaining independence from spain 
venezuela has laid claims to the territory 
venezuela said the british who first made claims on the land 
that became guyana in the late 16th century had taken territory 
that had belonged to the spanish empire for decades the dutch who 
had a competing claim in the region ceded the territory to britain 
in 1814 
tense relations attributed to the land claim did not subside 
with guyanas independence from britain in 1966 and only began to 
improve when hoyte came to power in 1985 
hoyte and perez chose alister mcintyre vice chancellor of the 
university of the west indies as mediator 
before returning home later this week hoyte was expected to ask 
venezuela to resume shipments of oil on credit to guyana venezuela 
suspended shipments earlier this year citing guyanas unpaid 25 
million bill

the state department barred the leader of the 
contra rebels from holding a news conference on thursday citing 
legal constraints on use of federal funds that bought his ticket to 
washington 
israel galeano who goes by the nom de guerre commander 
franklin had scheduled an afternoon press conference to discuss 
the rebels position on elections in nicaragua and their decision 
to fight back against attack by the ruling sandinistas said greg 
mueller a conservative activist who set up the news conference 
but franklin was told by a lawyer at the state department there 
that he could not go to the news conference participants said 
the reason given was that his trip was being paid for by 
taxpayer funds which cannot be used to influence public opinion 
according to franklin and to state department officials who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
but mueller accused us officials of trying to muzzle 
franklin out of fear he might say something to jeopardize talks 
between contra representatives and the sandinistas that began 
thursday at the united nations 
a state department official said the caution on use of us 
funds stems from revelations in the irancontra affair that changed 
the climate for trotting out the usbacked contras to present 
their points of view 
irancontra changed the entire approach to these kinds of 
activities the official said 
a department lawyer cited the law as prohibiting use of taxpayer 
funds to influence public opinion said the official 
dave hirschmann research director for the conservative council 
on interamerican security said his nonprofit lobbying 
organization had offered to pay for franklins ticket but that the 
administration blocked that offer 
some 25 reporters who showed up at the news conference were 
informed by an associate of franklin that he could not come because 
he had to take a call from those involved in the talks at the 
united nations in new york said mueller 
that was not the case franklin said through hirschmann 
the state department has a history of constantly trying to gag 
them mueller said he said franklin had planned to release a 
letter which he delivered to vice president dan quayle later the 
letter stated the contras throught it would be foolish to lay 
down their arms before the scheduled nicaraguan elections next feb 
25 because they need to defend themselves against attack by the 
leftist sandinistas 
in new york at the first direct talks between the contras and 
sandinistsa in more than a year the sandinistas said they would 
meet contra demands for a truce and amnesty if the rebels agree to 
begin disbanding by the end of the month

east germany opened the berlin wall and its other 
borders thursday and its cheering citizens crossed freely to the 
west for the first time since 1961 
late thursday exultant east germans began passing through 
berlin wall checkpoints and others entered west germany at other 
border crossings jubilant people pranced and danced atop the 
berlin wall a sight unthinkable only hours earlier 
hundreds were seen on the friedrichstrasse subway to west 
berlin and east germans also were allowed for the first time at 
checkpoint charlie the famed friedrichstrasse crossing run by the 
allied military 
many hugged and kissed total strangers while cars packed with 
east germans and others paraded down the streets of west berlin in 
a carnivallike atmosphere 
its crazy its crazy yelled one young man as he sat in 
the back seat of a car with his parents after a brief trip through 
the onceimpenetrable berlin wall 
his parents said they just wanted to see the west and then 
drive back they declined to give their names 
we heard it on tv we just decided to go over and have a 
look said the young mans father we want to show our son a 
little bit of kurfuerstendamm 
the kurfuerstendamm is one of europes most elegant shopping 
strips for decades east germans locked up behind the 
nowcrumbling iron curtain could only dream of seeing it 
all apparently were arriving without visas although visas 
technically were necessary under regulations announced earlier in 
the day a spokesman for the west german border police in 
braunschweig said the east germans had been allowed over the border 
there without visas 
about 100 east berliners gathered at the brandenburg gate just 
inside the wall and chanted open the gate open the gate 
with decades of fortified frontiers apparently at an end the 
wall that symbolized eastwest division for decades may become a 
mere monument to the cold war 
since it appeared during an august night 28 years ago and east 
germanys borders were sealed 191 people are known to have died 
while fleeing to the west 
egon krenz east germanys new leader also advocated a law 
thursday that would ensuring free and democratic elections in his 
communist nation which has been disrupted by proreform 
demonstrations and weakened by mass flight to the west 
the central committee scheduled a communist party conference for 
dec 1517 party conferences are forums for making major changes 
in policy and the last one was held in 1956 
more than 200000 east germans nearly 1 percent of the 
population have left so far this year 50000 since saturday 
alone most are young skilled workers vital to the economy 
hundreds of thousands of people who stayed home have filled the 
streets to demand democratic reforms and an end to 40 years of 
rigid oneparty rule 
as the news spread the number of east germans heading for 
bavaria through czechoslovakia rose dramatically the official east 
german news agency adn reported up to 4000 per hour entering 
czechoslovakia at the schoenberg crossing 10 times the number of 
people entering bavaria a few hours earlier 
guenter schabowski a member of the ruling politburo said the 
borders were being opened until a law was passed to allow east 
germans greater freedom of travel 
schabowski did not say when the law would be passed he also 
said east germany was not yet ready to remove all its barriers 
the central committee decision means all east germans can 
travel over all east german border checkpoints including through 
the berlin wall schabowski told reporters 
he said those seeking to emigrate could go to west germany 
directly without having to pass through a third country east 
germans have fled through hungary poland and czechoslovakia 
anyone merely wanting to visit the west would need a visa 
schabowski said but they should be issued quickly he did not 
mention limits on time that could be spent abroad 
offices that issue travel visas had closed for the night by the 
time schabowki made the historic announcement so no further 
information was available 
east germans reacted with astonishment and jubilation 
is it really true asked mario schmidt 18 
now i no longer feel locked in here said uwe landgraf 28 
who hoped to travel to paris 
i think that even some of those who left recently will come 
back now said a 25yearold electrician who identified himself 
only as thomas 
erich honecker the 77yearold leader krenz replaced last 
month supervised the building of the wall before he became 
communist party chief every us president since john f kennedy 
has urged that it be torn down 
president bush called thursdays announcement a dynamic 
development clearly a big development in terms of human 
rights 
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell said the 
decision amounts to the symbolic destruction of the berlin 
wall and urged east germany to take the final step and tear 
that wall down 
the wall is the most tangible symbol of the failure of 
communism he said 
west german leaders hailed the decision chancellor helmut kohl 
on an official visit to poland said we will be in contact with 
the east german leadership shortly after my return and i would like 
to meet very soon with mr krenz 
fifteen prominent communist intellectuals and officials in east 
berlin wrote to the central committee suggesting the wall be torn 
down 
it is also imaginable even in the foreseeable future that 
the wall will become a relic of the past if an agreement is 
signed with west germany that would prevent damage to the east 
german economy they said the letter was published thursday in 
the berliner zeitung a party newspaper 
as protest and flight gathered momentum this week the 
leadership took increasingly desperate steps in an attempt to turn 
the tide 
on wednesday krenz purged the old guard from the party 
politburo and slimmed it down from 21 members to 11 
an adn dispatch said the party conference next month would 
consider personnel changes in the 163member central committee 
krenz 52 touched on multiparty elections in a speech to the 
central committee that official newspapers published thursday he 
recommended a new election law that ensures free democratic 
general elections with a secret ballot and proposed public 
supervision in every stage of the balloting 
he did not say whether he wanted a true multiparty system in 
east germany but has said previously the supremacy of the 
communist party is not open to debate officials define the current 
election system which guarantees the communists virtually 
unanimous approval as democratic 
the new leader also promised laws on freedom of assembly 
association and the press he gave no details but said independent 
groups might have a role in politics 
east germanys prodemocracy opposition has made free elections 
its main demand plans have been reported to legalize new forum 
the largest group

thousands of 22caliber semiautomatic pistols 
called scorpions which may switch without warning to an automatic 
function are being recalled by the manufacturer under an agreement 
reached with federal authorities the government announced thursday 
a flawed part used in the manufacture of the scorpion 22 
semiautomatic pistol may cause the gun to malfunction including 
turning the semiautomatic into an automatic bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms director stephen e higgins said in a 
statement 
in a semiautomatic weapon a separate pull of the trigger is 
required for each shot in an automatic weapon one pull of the 
trigger can dispatch numerous shots congress in 1986 banned sales 
of automatic weapons made on or after may 15 1986 to all 
purchasers the armed services and law enforcement agencies 
the scorpion is manufactured by intratec usa a miamibased 
firearms firm according to atf spokesman jack killorin 
the company says it has sold about 20000 of the guns and has an 
additional 27000 in a warehouse the atf will supervise the recall 
and repair to make sure the guns are working properly before they 
are allowed back on the market atf spokeswoman dot koester said 
the bureau became aware of the problem several weeks ago when 
consumers began to complain koester said adding that she did not 
believe the malfunction had caused any injuries 
a guy takes it out into the backyard to shoot a can and all of 
a sudden his garage door falls apart she said giving an example 
of the type of complaint he atf received on the gun which generally 
sells for about 200 
after the complaints started coming in the atf sent some of 
our agents out to buy them off the shelves to test them and we 
found the same thing koester said some of them may be all 
right but nobody knows for sure 
atf has obtained an agreement from intratec to recall the 
scorpions and to repair them the bureau said in a statement 
dealers and owners were advised to contact the manufacturer 
concerning the recall 
the malfunction in the gun stems from not using enough heat 
when they tempered one part of the firearm koester said 
according to our firearms technology people this can be easily 
remedied 
intratec had given blueprints of the gun to atf before it began 
producing them in april 1988 she said adding that such an action 
went beyond government regulations and was not required 
unfortunately their blueprint did not take into account this 
flaw of the heat she said 
negotiations with the firm that resulted in the recall took two 
days wednesday and thursday she said 
asked if the guns occasional automatic firepower might make it 
attractive to criminals who would try to buy it koester said we 
hope not 
the gun really is a danger because it does malfunction she 
said its not dependable that it will shift into automatic it 
really is a broken gun so it would be really stupid of them to do 
that 
the same company manufactures the tech 9 another semiautomatic 
pistol that is equipped with a threaded barrel for silencers 
thats the one the jamaican posses for example like 
the company is located at 12405 130th street miami

an austrian paleontologist and 
anthropologist said thursday that his studies confirmed a skull 
long assumed to belong to composer wolfgang amadeus mozart was 
authentic 
gottfried tichy a professor at salzburg university said that 
in 3 years of study he found no indications the skull was not 
mozart 
the skull has been kept in the mozarteum school of music in 
salzburg since early this century and was assumed to be that of the 
composer 
tichy said he carefully examined not only the skull but 
contemporary portraits of mozart historical accounts of his life 
medical reports and correspondence 
tichy told the associated press he came up with many pieces of 
evidence and found no excluding reasons for it not to be 
mozarts skull 
he said the skull belonged to a man aged 30 to 40 and had 
specific characteristics seen in portraits of mozart tichy said it 
also showed signs of a hemorrhage that could have explained 
headaches mozart reportedly complained of in his later letters 
mozart died at age 35 in 1791

operators of a governmentowned nuclear 
production plant said thursday that area residents were exposed to 
virtually no tritium as a result of an accidental release of the 
radioactive gas 
richard neff manager of environment safety and health at the 
mound nuclear production plant said offsite air samples showed a 
slight increase over normal levels of tritium which is radioactive 
hydrogen 
but the maximum dose to each of the 2400 residents under the 
radioactive cloud from wednesdays release was 000012 millirems 
he said the us environmental protection agencys standard of 
safe dosage is 25 millirems a year 
youre getting down to a range where it is essentially 
nothing said neff adding that such levels are difficult to 
measure the chance of a person getting cancer from this is 
roughly equivalent to smoking 14 cigarettes 
neff said that of the 52 workers evacuated from the building 
six had shown low levels of radiation in their systems but he said 
further testing revealed that those levels may have been the result 
of the workers regular handling of tritium 
we dont have any concentrations greater than what we would 
expect from normal operations he said we dont see any 
workers who we feel have any significant exposure from this event 
jim morley daytonarea manager for the us department of 
energy said doe will investigate the incident 
the radioactive gas was released into the air and fell over a 
threemile area northwest of the plant extending over a section of 
downtown miamisburg and the great miami river 
the plant enriches tritium gas which is used in combination 
with plutonium to act as a trigger for nuclear weapons a total of 
37 grams of tritium was released through an exhaust vent about 10 
times what the plant normally releases in a year 
the release occurred when a quartz window in a bell jar 
containing tritium shattered during a laserdrilling operation 
about 2200 workers are employed at the mound plant which is 
operated for the energy department by egampg mound applied 
technologies

former indian activist robert 
satiacum was ordered deported to the united states on thursday 
hours after he was convicted of fondling a 10yearold girl in an 
unrelated case 
the us government has been trying to extradite the former 
chairman of the puyallup indian tribe in washington state for 
several years on embezzlement and racketeering convictions 
i am bound in law to issue you with a deportation order 
said immigration adjudicator garry braunwarth i have no 
alternative the law permits no discretion 
satiacum 60 who contended he was persecuted in the united 
states lost his bid for refugee status in canada nov 2 allowing 
the deportation proceedings to reopen 
the deportation hearing did not deal with satiacums conviction 
for sexual touching satiacum is to be sentenced on that charge 
nov 17 he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years 
lawyers for the canadian government and satiacum argued thursday 
over whether he should be deported before he served his sentence on 
the sex charge 
satiacums lawyer mark hilford said the deportation hearing 
should be adjourned pending a decision from the supreme court of 
canada on satiacums claim for refugee status 
its improper for immigration canada to be seen as attempting 
an endrun around the supreme court of canada he said 
satiacum who fled to canada in 1982 faces a lengthy jail 
sentence in the united states his problems began with his battle 
over selling taxfree cigarettes on indian land and escalated from 
there 
he was originally granted political asylum in canada in 1987 but 
the decision was overturned this year 
satiacum who has diabetes and a bad heart spent three years in 
jail while he fought efforts to extradite him 
thursday morning county court judge cathy ryan convicted him of 
touching a person under 14 for sexual purposes this verdict is 
worse than the verdict of murder a wearylooking satiacum said 
it takes away my whole future 
satiacum continued to maintain his innocence saying he did not 
touch the girl in april 1988 while he was staying at a house in 
suburban richmond owned by her grandmother he said he may appeal 
the verdict 
the girl testified she awoke to find satiacum with his hand 
beneath her underwear satiacum testified he had tripped over the 
girl who was asleep on the floor and fell partly on her but did 
not molest her 
i reject mr satiacums evidence as untruthful the judge

killing 27 people mostly children when he slammed into a church 
bus with his pickup truck 
carroll county circuit judge charles satterwhite dismissed two 
people during jury selection in the trial of larry mahoney 36 
after they said they had lost relatives to accidents involving 
drunken drivers 
three other prospective jurors said they had relatives who had 
been in legal trouble for driving under the influence they were 
not immediately released from the jury pool 
obviously thats going to be a very great topic for 
individual questioning said defense attorney william summers 
before the trial summers said he would look for jurors who had an 
understanding of the widespread incidence of drunken driving 
the 1988 accident was considered the deadliest in us history 
to be blamed on drunken driving 
prospective jurors were also asked about previous jury service 
in the second day of jury selection in this county seat about 40 
miles northeast of louisville other questions included whether 
they were related to anyone involved in the trial and issues 
expected to be raised during the trial 
some jurors were dismissed for such routine reasons as a family 
sickness or fulltime student status 
attorneys plan to interview prospective jurors privately next 
week

a justice department official resigned in 1988 
following an investigation of suspicions that he disclosed 
classified information to a foreign government said a report 
released thursday 
the annual report of the departments office of professional 
responsibility said a counterintelligence investigation did not 
produce sufficient evidence to prosecute the official but 
determined he should be dismissed 
the report did not identify the official but roger pilon 
former head of the justice departments office of asylum policy and 
review confirmed he was the subject of parallel investigations by 
the fbi and the office of professional responsiblity in 1988 
justice department and fbi officials refused to comment on the 
case but a source who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed 
that pilon had been the subject of an fbi counterintelligence 
investigation 
pilon insists that he is innocent of the allegation that he or 
his wife juliana passed a secret state department document about 
communist influence in south africa to the south african government 
and pilon produced a 1988 letter from a senior justice 
department official stating that he was being reinstated after the 
investigations 
no implication adverse to you should be taken from the 
investigations said the letter by dee v benson then the 
principal associate deputy attorney general 
pilon said he accepted reinstatement at the department which 
restored his security clearance but he then left to join the cato 
institute a libertarian think tank where he is now a senior fellow 
something is going on and it stinks if people like us can be 
dragged through the mud said pilon its been a nightmare a 
kafkaesque nightmare 
pilon said fbi agents showed him the state department documents 
while his wife was undergoing a fbi background check for 
appointment as an assistant secretary of the interior 
the agents plopped this document on my desk and said that 
document is now in the hands of south africa you gave it to your 
wife your wife gave it to the south africans 
pilon said he and his wife then an analyst at the heritage 
foundation both passed government polygraph tests commonly called 
lie detector tests but the investigation dragged on and his wife 
was never nominated for the job at the interior department 
the jan 8 1987 document in question was a secret assessment 
of the influence of communism in south africa produced by the state 
department pilon had worked at state as policy director of the 
bureau of human rights before joining the justice department in 
march 1987 
pilon said he suspects the fbi had monitored a conversation 
between his wife who studied united nations affairs and an 
official of the south african mission in new york 
the phone calls with chris camp a public affairs attache at the 
south african mission took place in january or february of 1987 
pilon said 
she had been trying to get documents from him about communist 
activity at the united nations he wanted material she had been 
working on 
undoubtedly there was a conversation about an exchange of 
documents pilon said who insisted his wife never passed along 
he document fbi agents had shown him 
pilon said the fbi is apparently still investigating what 
happened to the document two of the same fbi agents had recently 
approached a friend pilon said and asked about the document 
i can only speculate as to whats going on here i really 
dont know pilon said

the soviet government advised the west on thursday 
to dismiss any speculation about a reunified germany now because 
that is out of the question 
in the first government comment on the changes convulsing the 
soviet unions ally foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov praised east germany for its leadership shakeup and its 
first steps toward sovietstyle reforms 
he told a news briefing that although it was not the soviet 
unions place to comment on another countrys internal affairs it 
was clear east germany was undertaking a renewal of socialism 
gerasimov called east germany an important one might say 
strategic ally of the soviet union and said moscow is closely 
following events there 
in its account of the briefing the official news agency tass 
reported 
commenting on deliberations in the western press about the 
possible reunification of germany gerasimov said 
specifically that this matter cannot be viewed apart from the 
overall situation in europe which is as of yet split into two 
alliances 
he appraised the deliberations in the press as an occupation 
not related to practical policy 
gerasimov said if we remain on real ground any unification 
of germany is out of question now 
germanys division into communist east germany and capitalistic 
west germany followed the collapse of adolf hitlers nazi germany 
in world war ii east germany now is being shaken by mass demands 
for more democracy and by an exodus of east germans to west 
germany prompting the changes there this week 
gerasimov said thursday that the east german leadership is 
improving the situation in the sense that theyre moving toward 
perestroika on their own terms referring to the reforms 
president mikhail s gorbachev began on coming to power in 1985 
millions of soviets learned in tv radio and newspaper reports 
of the dramatic overhaul of east germanys ruling politburo and new 
leader egon krenzs promises of democratic reforms 
tass quickly reported that the east german government had thrown 
open all borders and that its citizens could travel or emigrate 
anywhere 
vyacheslav mostovoy a correspondent reporting on soviet 
televisions popular nightly news program vremya said east 
germanys central committee had begun mapping political and 
economic reforms in a program which the whole country awaits and 
on which the future of the republic largely depends 
mostovoy reporting from east germany stressed the elevation of 
reformers to the politburo he quoted krenz as saying in a speech 
that the east german communist party leadership had earlier taken a 
negative approach to changes in the soviet union and other 
socialist countries 
krenzs predecessor erich honecker had been cool to 
gorbachevs reforms and resisted implementing them in his own 
country but krenz told gorbachev in a telephone call last month 
that there are important lessons to be learned from soviet 
perestroika in the german democratic republic 
during a visit to moscow krenz discussed possible applications 
in east germany of sovietstyle reforms 
we wholeheartedly support the revolutionary process of 
perestroika in the soviet union he told reporters adding he 
especially wanted to explore its aim of making socialism more 
attractive 
in its reports on east german developments radio moscow focused 
on that governments plans for a party conference and krenzs call 
for more democracy 
tass issued at least four reports one report said the changes 
the central committee is discussing came from the street and 
that the party must admit its mistakes or lose its right to govern 
tass ran excerpts of krenzs 86page speech wednesday to the 
central committee highlighting his remarks on the former 
governments hostility toward the soviet reforms 
it quoted krenzs condemnation of the old politburos negative 
waitandsee attitude and partly dogmatic and haughty attitude to 
processes taking place in the soviet union and other socialist 
countries 
the soviet government newspaper izvestia also gave readers 
details of krenzs speech and reported the continuing mass exodus 
of east germans 
on wednesday vremya showed mostovoy standing against the 
backdrop of an outdoor public protest in berlin and describing the 
exceptionally important political events in east germany this 
week 
the process of reform and renewal that started just a few 
weeks ago is continuing with unusual quickness mostovoy said in 
a report of about three minutes that came halfway through the 
45minute show

governors meeting with bush administration 
officials said thursday that work on national education goals is on 
a very very fast track and they are now ready to work with 
congress 
the meeting between leaders of the national governors 
association and white house officials was a followup to the 
education summit between president bush and the nations governors 
in september 
congress and educators had been excluded from the twoday 
discussions in charlottesville va that concluded nationwide goals 
are needed to improve learning 
the involvement of the congress is essential in my opinion 
and in the opinion of the white house and others as we seek to 
form a true coalition between the congress the states and the 
executive branch of the white house in trying to build a consensus 
to improve education in the country said south carolina gov 
carroll campbell after the white house meeting 
not only will congress be courted but the governors decided to 
seek the advice of experts and recommendations from educators and 
business executives communities at a dec 7 meeting 
iowa gov terry branstad nga chairman said congress will be 
asked to begin immediately to work on legislation that would bring 
more flexibility to what is now considered rigid regulations 
attached to many federal programs 
loosening restrictions on federal funds was one target chosen at 
the charlottesville meeting 
other summit goals were to improve early childhood programs 
reorganize school systems to make educators more accountable keep 
drugs out of schools bolster onthejob education improve 
literacy and reduce dropouts 
branstad said thursdays meeting with chief of staff john 
sununu roger porter the presidents domestic policy adviser 
richard darman director of the office of management and budget 
and education secretary lauro cavazos was very constructive and 
weve agreed that were going to continue to work to develop the 
national goals for education 
after the dec 7 task force on education meeting the governors 
will hold state hearings and discussions in their respective states 
in december and january said nga vice chairman booth gardner of 
washington state

i have returned to the united states in a world much changed 
by startling events in central europe the men of iron vision are 
loosening peacefully their long grip on power 
recalling her own countrys revolution she said the memory 
of that stirring event is engraved in the heart of all filipinos 
who lived through it and deeply impressed in the memory of the 
world 
the philippines is a small country and cannot claim to affect 
directly events beyond its borders certainly not across half the 
world in europe yet it is not too much to say that the images of 
heroism spawned by our people power revolution gave dominated 
peoples throughout the world a glimpse of certain possibilities 
that they are now exploring the possibility for example that 
armor and infantry do not exhaust the varieties of power that 
perhaps people by peaceful numbers and unshakeable resolve may 
sometimes tilt the balance in their favor as they saw it happen 
in my country and as it has happened in other parts of the world 
since then 
for the first time in a long time something different has 
happened in the world and perhaps the philippines had something to 
do with it if so then we have simply returned the favor for the 
support we received from friends of liberty throughout the world 
anything new is fragile and i share the apprehension of 
president bush that on this bright new age of tolerance and 
freedom the darkness may yet fall abruptly it has happened in one 
country we must remain prepared for that dark contingency yet 
we must do everything prudent possible and prudent to encourage 
those who are working for change 
in this desire for constructive change and movement toward 
democracy we are one with the united states we look to the united 
states as the natural leader in this great movement she has ever 
been in the forefront of the modern struggle for both peace and 
freedom 
referring to bush she said as a man who lived through war 
he knows the price of peace as i who lived through tyranny know 
the irreplaceable value of freedom 
this sense of new possibilities must inform the future 
relations of the united states and the philippines and guide the 
discussions we shall have it is time for something new to happen 
in the world and we are all so privileged to be a part of it

islamic fundamentalists stunned 
progovernment candidates by taking 34 of the 80 seats in 
parliament in jordans first general election in 22 years 
according to results reported thursday 
fundamentalists rolled up huge totals in wednesdays election 
while powerful former government officials struggled to win and 
sometimes failed 
the outcome appeared a setback for king hussein who urged 
voters not to mix religion with politics 
it also was a disappointment to jordanian women who ran and 
voted in their first national election none won of the 12 women 
among 647 parliamentary candidates won 
victors included men once imprisoned on political grounds and 
one convicted in an attack on an israeli airline office in athens 
the new parliament seems certain to be more assertive than the 
often passive legislature dissolved last year hussein retains 
ultimate power however and martial law in effect since the 1967 
arabisraeli war continues 
parliament must approve all laws and can dismiss governments 
but the king can dissolve the legislature and rule without it as 
he has done for much of the past 15 years 
israeli officials who regard hussein as a moderate arab leader 
expressed some concern about the election results one said on 
condition of anonymity what we are speaking about is a 
substantial opposition to the king from the right this might 
bring a problem for the king 
in the vanguard of the fundamentalist campaign was the moslem 
brotherhood its 26 declared and several allied candidates called 
for social justice stricter islamic morality and the destruction 
of israel 
the people want islam and it is not strange to have such a 
large number of moslem candidates winning brotherhood spokesman 
ziad abu ghanimeh said 
fundamentalists often have allied themselves with hussein a 
descendant of the prophet mohammed against secular leftists but 
have pressed him for restrictions on westerntype entertainment 
more social welfare programs and greater separation of the sexes 
final results gave 22 seats to brotherhood candidates other 
islamists won 12 seats and some of the 20 or so progovernment 
figures also had links to the islamic movement 
leftists arab nationalists tribal leaders and others took the 
rest of the seats 
parliaments makeup gives the varied opposition a clear majority 
over royalists in their campaigns many winners demanded 
prosecution of former officials accused of corruption and because 
of the nations 83 billion foreign debt of economic 
mismanagement 
the 80 seats are divided among 20 districts and more than 40 
candidates ran in some of them 
three men who resigned powerful posts to run barely made it 
former deputy premier taher masri edged out a brotherhood 
candidate in his amman district but finished far behind the leader 
another fundamentalist 
thouqan hindawi former head of the royal court won a seat in 
irbid but got only half as many votes as the top candidate a 
member of the brotherhood abdulraouf al rawabdeh former mayor of 
amman finished eighth in the same race just enough to win a place 
in parliament 
those losing included hamdi tabaa the former trade and industry 
minister and the former public works minister shawfiq zawaideh 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
applauded the renewal of the electoral process in jordan 
we fully support the process of poliitcal reform that 
accompanies it we note that the polling proceeeding peacefully and 
in a fair and orderly fashion he said 
he added that the united states looks forward to working with 
the new government in jordan once it is installed 
after four days of price riots in southern jordan in april 
hussein moved up the election date and increased personal and press 
freedom 
although political parties are banned the government did not 
enforce the prohibition and many ran slates of candidates openly 
one new member of parliament is mansour murad convicted in 
greece of participating in a 1969 attack on an athens office of 
elal the israeli airline in which a greek child was killed and 
11 people were injured 
greek authorities freed mansour in 1970 in an exchange for 55 
hostages on a hijacked olympic airways jetliner 
the election formalized jordans separation from the west bank 
which held half the seats in the parliament elected two months 
before israel captured the territory in 1967 last year hussein 
renounced jordans claims to the west bank in favor the palestine 
liberation organization

six airplanes and eight helicopters on wednesday ferried the 
agents to the cattle ranching town of san ramon 250 miles 
northeast of la paz where they arrested 17 people and raided and 
destroyed 11 clandestine laboratories for producing cocaine 
hydrochloride police said

1986

cocaine producing operations said don ferrone us drug 
enforcement administration station chief for bolivia after

hoping to move beyond medicares doomed 
catastrophic illness program a house committee on thursday 
examined a series of proposals to rework the nations health care 
system and avoid piecemeal reform 
douglas fraser chairman of the private committee for a national 
health insurance told the house select committee on aging that the 
nations healthcare delivery system is an absolute shambles 
that leaves many people unprotected and saddles others with huge 
costs 
we have to make fundamental changes said fraser former 
president of the united auto workers union patchwork will not do 
it 
he said there is growing support for a national health insurance 
program even among major employers who no longer can keep up with 
rising healthcare costs 
committee chairman edward roybal dcalif who himself has 
proposed a healthcare reform package said the hearing was 
designed to find solutions to the nations cost quality and 
access problems and for building an american health system up to 
37 million americans are uninsured and many more are underinsured 
particularly against the staggering costs of longterm care he 
said 
roybal cited the yearold medicare catastrophic coverage program 
as an example of a piecemeal attempt to improve the healthcare 
system congress is on the verge of scrapping all or part of the 
program after being inundated with complaints that its cost were 
too high and its benefits unneeded by some senior citizens 
the blueribbon us bipartisan commission on comprehensive 
health care established as part of the catastrophic legislation 
also is looking for answers to the problems of the uninsured and 
the costs of longterm care 
deborah steelman chair of the advisory council on social 
security which also has been asked to examine the nations 
healthcare system told the aging committee that determining who 
will pay for new healthcare benefits is always the sticky 
wicket but that the government could do much more with what it 
already is spending 
frasers group is pushing a plan that would retain the medicare 
program for the elderly and cover everyone else through a 
stateadministered program financed perhaps through payroll taxes 
private insurance premiums alcohol and tobacco taxes and state 
sources 
another plan was advanced by paul rogers a former congressman 
who cochairs the private national leadership commission on health 
care the commissions plan would retain medicare and private 
insurance programs and add a stateadministered universal access 
plan for the uninsured financed by fees paid by employers and 
people with income above 150 percent of poverty 
limited access soaring costs and uncertain quality interact 
with the malpractice crisis to form a tightly woven web rogers 
said we need to take the best features of this intricate design 
and weave them into a renewed system of health care 
graham scott former ontario deputy minister of health told the 
committee that canadas national health insurance program is 
immensely popular at home but success there does not mean that 
it is necessarily the answer for the united states because of 
cultural differences

father wounded when they were held up outside a childbirth class

hospital said hospital spokeswoman cathleen odonnell she 
declined to release the cause of death 
the suffolk county coroner and officials at the district 
attorneys office were not immediately available for comment

that christopher would make it boston mayor raymond l flynn 
said thursday night 
the baby had struggled for life in the hospitals neonatal 
intensive care unit since his delivery by emergency caesarian 
section hours after his mother was shot oct 23

shot in the head by a gunman who held up the couple in their car 
after they left the hospital near the roxbury section of boston 
charles stuart 29 who managed to contact rescuers with his 
cellular car telephone was shot in the abdomen and listed in 
stable condition thursday at boston city hospital a spokesman said 
at the fathers request family members declined thursday night 
to comment on the infants death 
its a very difficult time for all of us and were just trying 
to follow chucks wishes said mrs stuarts brother carl 
dimaiti 
the attack on the stuarts who traveled from their suburban home 
to the city for its medical facilities launched a citywide search 
for the assailant who was still at large thursday night 
there arent words to describe the sadness and tragedy 
odonnell said this horror struck in boston on a city street and 
thats difficult for a hospital that values life so much 
residents in the mission hill neighborhood where the attack took 
place expressed little hope this week that the gunman would be 
caught but flynn said thursday that police were pursuing strong 
leads 
flynn said he didnt know if prosecutors would attempt to bring 
doublemurder charges if a suspect was arrested but the 
senseless tragic act resulted in the deaths of two innocent 
people as far as im concerned 
it hits home when you lose a little baby to the senseless 
violence thats taking place in our communities the mayor said 
we have to recommit ourselves in the memory of all people who 
have been innocent victims of violence to make the streets safe for 
everyone

china castigated the us congress on thursday 
for pressing ahead with plans for sanctions against beijing saying 
sanctions would cast a new shadow over chineseamerican ties 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua also singled out 
washington as being too deeply involved in the prodemocracy 
movement here last spring that was suppressed by chinese troops 
if sanctions against china are adopted it will cast a new 
shadow over chineseus relations and will hurt the feelings 
of the chinese people she told a weekly news conference 
negotiators from the us senate and house of representatives 
agreed on tuesday to stiffen proposed sanctions against china to 
protest the june crackdown 
the measure asks two years of trade sanctions including 
suspension of trade assistance a halt to certain insurance for 
firms doing business in china and a freeze on exports of 
satellites semimilitary items such as helicopters and certain 
nuclear material and components 
the bill condemns the unprovoked brutal and indiscriminate 
assault on the protesters which it said left at least 700 dead 
china has said about 300 people died 
at present chineseus relations are in a period of great 
difficulties ms li said china should not be held responsible 
for the difficulties the reason for these difficulties is that the 
us has gotten itself too deeply involved in the turmoil and 
rebellion that happened not too long ago in beijing 
china insists the protests were whipped up by 
counterrevolutionaries seeking to overthrow the communist 
regime and says foreign forces supported the uprising 
senior leader deng xiaoping also told visiting former president 
richard nixon last week that the united states was too deeply 
involved in the demonstrations and china was the real victim 
of the events at the time 
the us government rejects the charges a state department 
spokesman said this month that the protests were clearly the 
result of domestic developments in china

us action against norway because of its 
persistence in hunting whales has been indefinitely postponed a 
spokesman for commerce secretary robert mosbacher said thursday 
reed boatright mosbachers spokesman said a decision had been 
due next monday on whether norway was violating us law by 
interfering with the ban of the international whaling conference on 
commercial whaling he said there would now be negotiations with 
norways new government headed by conservative prime minister jan 
p syse 
the norwegian labor government ousted last month allowed the 
taking of 17 whales this year which it said were for scientific 
research us conservationists who campaign against all whaling 
say that norwegian whalers used to take about 2000 a year and that 
17 are not enough for any scientific or commercial purpose 
syses trade minister kaci kullmann five had a meeting with 
mosbacher on thursday afterwards she said norway would take five 
whales next year 
there will not be any certification on nov 13 mrs five 
said in an interview no date has been set she said she 
expected positive developments in future talks 
boatright would not say if the united states agreed with mrs 
five on further whaling he said that after negotiations with 
norway mosbacher will make a recommendation to president bush if 
bush certifies that norway is interfering with the international 
ban he may restrict or even halt norwegian shipments of fish to 
the united states 
roger payne senior scientist at the world wildlife fund 
predicted a strong reaction from conservationists in the united 
states who campaign vigorously to end all whaling 
the conservation community will be jumping all over the 
administration if it agrees to that he said referring to the 
norwegian insistence on continued whaling 
the norwegians are the only ones doing any whaling except the 
japanese this would prevent the japanese from being isolated 
conservationists say the japanese take about 300 whales a year 
also for what they say are scientific purposes

the bush administration frustrated by senate 
delays on its nominations may give some of its 119 languishing 
nominees recess appointments not requiring senate action white 
house officials said thursday 
such a parlimentary end run around the senates 
adviceandconsent powers would surely anger democatic leaders and 
worsen alreadystrained relations between president bush and 
congress 
white house personnel director chase untermeyer said he was 
preparing recommendations for bush on the procedures for making a 
possible batch of recess appointments during congress upcoming 
yearend break 
ive done it on my own without the direction of the president 
or the chief of staff john sununu said untermeyer however he 
added ive not been told to stop 
untermeyer said there were 119 presidential appointments pending 
as of late thursday 
another white house official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said were not anxious to do this this is only a 
last resort but it is something we may be compelled to do said 
a white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
under the constitution the president can temporarily sidestep 
the senates confirmation powers by appointing a person to fill a 
vacancy while the senate is in recess 
the provision was put into the constitution to enable the 
government to continue to function when the senate took long 
recesses sometimes in the early days of the republic for months 
at a time 
someone granted such a recess appointment may serve under 
the constitution until the end of the next session of congress 
were bush to appoint someone during the upcoming yearend recess 
that individual could keep the job at least until the end of 1990 
without the senate having a say 
nearly all presidents have made recess appointments from time to 
time and it is a favored tactic for giving political supporters 
shortterm jobs like ambassadorships near the end of a presidential 
term 
however the device has never been used in a wholesale fashion 
before 
the president really hasnt wanted to resort to this but 
neither did he realize that some many of his nominees wouldnt be 
acted on this late on said a white house official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
such a move has high political risks and would escalate the 
battle between bush and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine 
up until now bush himself has not advocated such a drastic 
step white house sources said but senior advisers might urge him 
to take such a course in an effort to break the senate logjam the 
sources said 
untermeyers work on the question first was reported in thursday 
editions of the washington times 
among the pending nominations are richard g austin as head of 
the general services administration barbara everitt bryant as 
director of the census bureau brian w clymer as urban mass 
transportation administrator michael paul gavin as assistant 
secretary of commerce and a host of ambassadorial and judicial 
appointments 
some of the delayed nominations have been controversial 
for instance bushs choice of james cason for a top agriculture 
department post has drawn opposition from environmentalists and 
many senators for what they allege to be a prodevelopment bias 
and some ambassadorial appointments have been blocked by senate 
democrats who claim they have few qualifications other than large 
contributions to republican campaigns 
in fact on thursday sen paul sarbanes dmd vowing to end 
an ambassadorial spoils system sought to kill bushs 
nomination of joy silverman as ambassador to barbados there are 
no qualifications for this lady theres nothing there sarbannes 
told the senate 
the nomination of victor stello jr to be assistant secretary of 
energy for defense programs has been stalled since july over 
criticism of his record at the nuclear regulatory commission and 
the nomination of vaugh r walker to be a federal judge in northern 
california has been snarled in neoptism charge he is bushs cousin 
at a news conference on tuesday bush accused the democraticled 
congress of blocking everything i do and has often vented his 
frustration at the slow pace of senate consideration of his 
nominees 
and press secretary marlin fitzwater earlier accused the senate 
of holding up dozens of presidential appointments for artificial 
reasons 
at the same time however mitchell has accused bush of 
footdragging on other key government positions 
the maine democrat told the senate recently that bush had failed 
to make nominations for nearly half of the key executive branch 
jobs and that bushs criticism was unfounded and unfair 
many of bushs ambassadorial nominations have been delayed in 
the senate foreign relations committee where democratic leaders 
have accused the president of seeking to fill many of the posts 
with political supporters rather than experienced diplomats 
if bush does choose to make recess appointments the senate 
loses its power to deny the individual the post for more than a 
year but there are other ways that congress can make its will felt 
if the recess appointee wanted to get paid it might be a 
problem said an official in the senate parlimentarians office 
who spoke on the condition of anoymity

only president bushs promised signature is 
needed for the first minimum wage increase in nearly a decade 
following congress lopsided approval of a bill raising the rate to 
425 by april 1991 
the measure which includes a subminimum wage for teenagers 
new to the job market cleared the senate on an 898 vote 
wednesday exactly a week after it passed the house by an equally 
overwhelming vote of 38237 
bush who struck the compromise plan with congressional 
democrats last week is expected to sign the bill before 
thanksgiving perhaps as early as next week 
the nineyear logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said after the senate vote the 
working poor are about to receive an increase although it is not 
as much as they deserve

this is ratings sweeps time and you face 
considerable nielsenboosting sex violence and bad manners on tv 
but there are occasional respites and a nice one for the family 
lies ahead on nbc sunday night 
its polly an updated adaptation with music and a black 
cast of pollyanna the 1960 disney movie that was so goshdarn 
positive it made the up with people singers seem the grumble 
chorale 
this twohour tv version which dips into the cosby show 
cast for its buttoncute star keshia knight pulliam as polly and 
phylicia rashad as her stern spinster aunt suffers from a similar 
case of sugary 
still its oddly refreshing to see such unabashed innocence and 
good will on primetime tv if only as an antidote to all the 
factbased tv movies that air later and are mostly routine 
salutes to grim 
this polly written by william blinn and directed and 
choreographed by debbie allen former colleagues in tvs fame 
is a gentle tale that through its young star slips in a plea for 
racial harmony 
set in 1955 in times of racial segregation it takes place in 
the mythical tidy allblack alabama town of harrington a hamlet 
run and virtually owned by pollys lovely nononsense aunt 
the aunt played by rashad who in real life is allens sister 
believes that life is a very serious matter woe betide anyone 
even the town preacher larry riley heard making a joyful noise 
all this starts changing when young polly left an orphan by a 
car crash that killed her parents arrives from detroit to live 
with her aunt and quickly becomes best friends with a local orphan 
boy brandon adams 
young polly is a small ray of sunshine whose faith in humanity 
regardless of race is unshakeable she brings out the good in 
everyone 
but of course that proves a turning point when she befriends a 
rich frowsy old white woman celeste holm who as the caucasian 
counterpart of pollys aunt runs and virtually owns a nearby 
allwhite town 
such predictability can be overcome with a good script problem 
is blinn normally a fine writer has sort of a tame teleplay here 
instead of showing the world through the childs shiny brown 
eyes the script is littered with distracting subplots including 
the love of a young music professor dorian harewood for pollys 
aunt 
worse a supposedly mean old man brock peters the kids 
encounter has a kindly twinkle in his eyes a mean old man isnt 
supposed to have such a twinkle only a soul of garlic 
a little more grittiness less pasteurization and more sharply 
drawn characters would have greatly helped this show but its 
enjoyable anyway for two reasons 
one is the fine cast most of whose members have stage 
backgrounds you only wish the script had offered them more 
the other is the music particularly harold wheelers tasty 
orchestrations of the gentle ballads or rollicking gospel songs 
with two firstrate dance numbers as part of the show the tunes 
help propel polly 
they also make you wish this were a fullfledged musical not a 
story with music its a little frustrating as in tap which 
had the potential to be a great dance movie most musical numbers 
in polly end too quickly and seem unwisely abbreviated 
oh well polly is a good family show and cheers to nbc for 
commissioning it 
a warning shoo your tykes away when it ends for all will 
return to normal sweepsmonth routine then and nbc will air its 
grim manhunt search for the night stalker 
it is a tv movie based on the true story of richard ramirez the 
satanic night stalker of los angeles who butchered or raped 
more than a dozen people during a deadly spree in 1985 
ramirez convicted of 13 murders was sentenced to death on 
tuesday

elsewhere in television 
the great audience question for those who want to know if 
abcs primetime live is going to dispense with its studio 
audience the answer from abc news president roone arledge is 
probably yes but not every week 
he says the studio audience was made part of the programs 
format because we were going to do a lot of town meetingtype 
segments but that hasnt often happened now he says abc 
executivies are pondering whether to have a studio audience only on 
those weeks they feel the program needs it were in the process 
of deciding that right now he says 
the real and the recreated at cbs news thursdays scheduled 
48 hours program on teen sex included excerpts of a girl 
telling a wisconsin hearing that she had an abortion without 
parental consent tomorrow saturday night with connie chung 
recreates what a massachusett teenager went through including 
counseling and legal advice when seeking an abortion without her 
parents consent

you have to wonder about the stock market as an 
economic forecaster if what theyre saying is true that the recent 
market slump has its origins in corporate profit weakness 
why because the slowing in the growth rate of profits has been 
going on for a long time and with so pronounced a trend that no 
informed investor could have been surprised the red flags were 
flying high 
even ordinary workaday consumers those without any particular 
knowledge or even interest in corporate profits must have known 
because it was their stubborness that forced sellers to compete 
with lower prices 
in 1988 based on the standard amp poors composite index 
corporate profits showed a 36 percent increase in this years 
first quarter the rate was down to 22 percent year over year in 
the second quarter it was under 10 percent 
aerospace apparel automotive electrical metal and oil and 
gas companies have been strained record profits for the automotive 
companies are a matter of history now in electronics wang and 
control data suffered sharp reversals 
theoretically the stock market sees ahead at least six months 
but in this instance the professionals allegedly were surprised by 
events that began at least six months ago and which are likely to 
continue for months more 
the economy is sluggish consumers are watching dollar and 
credit balances reports show they are not losing their buying 
confidence but instead are sharpening their perspective on prices 
they are forcing price cuts 
the signs are all about anheuserbusch says it is ready to 
match competitor discounts instead of almost constant sales sears 
is promoting everyday low pricing mcdonalds and other 
fastfood outlets are finding that customers sometimes prefer to 
buy frozen foods and microwave them at home 
everyone is aware by now that the car companies are in a fix 
and are willing to talk deals knowing this customers are driving 
more hard bargains than new cars and in some parts of the computer 
market its the same way 
such behavior is an extreme contrast to the inflationary 
situation that existed through much of the 1970s when customers 
competed to buy and thereby forced up prices which in turn caused 
other buyers to stampede before prices went even higher in that 
case the consumer lost on every deal 
in todays marketplace competition is among sellers rather than 
customers and customers are winning on almost every deal 
after one of the longest economic expansions ever millions of 
americans have bought all the luxuries they need anything 
additional is optional if they see a bargain they might buy but 
they are ready to do without too 
meanwhile many companies are involved in a marketplace brawl 
that has little to do directly with consumers except to put them 
in an even better bargaining position 
such companies are fighting to retain market position the 
better to greet the eventual upturn they are reluctant to cut 
production sharply instead they maintain high production and sell 
at low or no profit 
holding market position can be extremely costly of course but 
a lot of companies today are like breakfast cereal companies 
forced to hold onto their shelf position because if they dont they 
might never get it back 
such a position is a rare one for the consumer because it has 
the added benefit of forcing lower both inflation and interest 
rates and in the long run the harsh competition might be good for 
producers too 
in the meantime however it isnt very good for corporate 
profits and everyone seemed to have sensed it except the socalled 
professional stock traders who should have been watching that 
signal most closely of all

in the home of producer arthur baker near 
woodstock ny are crates containing more than 10000 records in 
midtown manhattan the location of bakers shakedown studio nearly 
as many musicians have passed through 
bruce springsteen bob dylan miles davis and paul mccartney are 
but a few of the artists with whom baker has worked remixing songs 
or producing albums 
rappers rockers crooners and funksters have all gotten a boost 
from bakers studio expertise and pounding drum sound thats best 
described by the hall and oates album he produced big bam boom 
disappearing behind the control board doesnt appeal to baker 
emotional hardheaded and opinionated he believes in the producer 
as collaborator even star 
the producers who turned me on were kenny gamble and leon 
huff thom bell and all those philadelphia guys baker said in a 
recent interview at shakedown 
norman whitfield of motown was a big influence all those 
producers made produceroriented music the producers would write 
the songs arrange them and do the whole thing thats what i 
aspire to be 
baker has no catch phrase like phil spectors wall of sound 
or motowns sound of young america if anything the producer 
sees walls as something to be broken down not constructed thats 
why he calls his new record merge 
my album is representative of the music i like baker said 
if you come out to my house and see my records you know my 
influences this album is the merging of lots of different music 
what i focused on was writing really good songs and making an 
album that i found listenable and enjoyable the next album id 
like to combine some different elements and make new music 
shirley lewis tiny valentine and john warren are featured 
singers al greens soaring vocals carry the albums first single 
the message is love but the song took months to record 
we first did a reading and then he sang it through and it was 
really good baker said he said ok al green aint going to 
sing it much better than that but he didnt get the melody he 
rewrote it 
he goes back and sings the medody but its horrible i ask 
him do you think we can get the other al green he sang it again 
and it was great then i had to do some more overdubbing we ended 
up doing two takes in boston and four in memphis 
conflicts in the studio dont faze baker who has seen them from 
all angles settling creative differences and causing some too 
cocaine was a problem he admits and nearly ruined his career 
after a run of hit records in the mid1980s hes counting on 
merge to bring him back 
the only way i cn do anything is to go in and write songs i 
had a bad reputation people were saying i was difficult but i 
helped create things like multiple edits and songs without bass 
lines i think i can be innovative again 
baker a boston native made his breakthrough in 1981 with 
africa bambaatas planet rock an early rap record he was soon 
one of the industrys hottest producers and remixers asked to edit 
extended versions of songs from springsteens born in the usa 
album dylan mccartney and hall and oates also wanted his services 
in 1985 he helped produce the sun city record assembling a 
remarkable collection of musicians including springsteen davis 
u2s bono and ruben blades to perform material attacking south 
africas apartheid system 
in a studio crammed with stars no one was revered more than the 
reclusive davis who glided past an awestruck bonnie raitt and 
contributed a horn part to a jazz track that appeared on the album 
we asked miles if it was ok to have a guy in the studio with a 
video camera baker recalled he starts playing and while hes 
playing he goes you cant come in here youre the wrong color 
i thought he was talking to the video guy whos white 
then he says this aint your country and we realized what 
he was doing we stopped and said that was great and asked if he 
would mind doing something like that again 
but baker also has unhappy memories of drunken sessions with 
dylan feuds with hall and oates and drawn out legal battles with 
new edition that he said contributed to his drug problems 
now hes hoping to produce work that equals his best material 
and will stick around as long as the blues records that fill his 
home

this is the first of an eightpart series by the 
associated press examining the history and impact of the 
governments 3yearold crackdown on insider trading 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in securities and exchange commission hallways 
in washington and 50th floor trading rooms above wall street it is 
remembered simply as boesky day 
on nov 14 1986 six months after arresting a pudgy investment 
banker named dennis levine for insider trading prosecutors 
announced they had landed their biggest fish ivan f boesky 
he stole 50 million through sleazy trades he schemed to 
conceal ownership of stocks and duped investors he spun a web of 
skulduggery that included junkbond giant drexel burnham lambert 
inc and its master financier michael milken 
if my mistakes launch a process of reexamination of the rules 
and practices of our financial marketplace then perhaps some good 
will result boesky said after paying 100 million in fines and 
restitution and agreeing to plead guilty to one criminal charge 
ivan boeskys wish has come true 
in the three years since boesky day wall street has drastically 
changed the way it does business 
the insider trading scandal has been a dominant theme in a 
decade when investment firms grew fat on multibilliondollar 
takeover deals and rewarded babyfaced college graduates with 
sixfigure salaries 
for some fraud and greed were a byproduct of success for the 
justice department prosecuting welldressed criminals created a 
battle subculture reminiscent of eliot ness vs al capone in 
prohibitionera chicago 
criminal and civil prosecutions unprecedented in the history of 
the nations financial markets snared violators from a 24yearold 
junior analyst to a 63yearold magazine editor 
watching the scandal unfold was like watching a movie and it 
became the breeding ground for cinema books and television 
when police handcuffed a broker on a trading floor in the 1987 
film wall street it resembled a day in february 1987 when 
prosecutors seized a veteran trader at venerable kidder peabody amp 
co while disbelieving colleagues watched the incident proved an 
embarrassment for prosecutors however when they had to drop the 
case against the trader for lack of evidence 
the scandal also became the testing ground for aggressive use of 
the criminal racketeering law dubbed rico previously reserved for 
mafia thugs and drug lords to prosecute investment bankers in 
brooks brothers suits 
prosecutors used the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations law to force drexel into a deal it couldnt refuse 
plead guilty to securities felonies or face severe fines and a 
potentially embarrassing trial 
perhaps most significant the scandal forced wall street to 
reassess and reform in a decade of unbridled paper wealth built on 
a mix of youth money ambition and myopia 
i was so focused on my career and getting ahead that i really 
lost touch with reality lost perspective levine now 36 told 
business students in new york this summer 
since levines arrest more than 30 people and three companies 
either have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a range of 
financial crimes in cases brought by the manhattan us attorney 
the crackdown led to a vastly expanded use of criminal 
securities laws to include stock manipulation and disguising 
securities ownership behavior previously handled by the civil 
courts 
milken the wharton mba who pioneered drexels domination of 
highyield securities known as junk bonds has been indicted 
under rico for dealings with boesky 
prison terms have climbed to four years for florida takeover 
specialist paul bilzerian convicted in june boesky is up for 
release in april from a threeyear term at a minimumsecurity 
prison in lompoc calif levine was paroled in september 1988 after 
serving 17 months of a twoyear term 
theres not a lot of sympathy for guys who make 500 million a 
year cheating said harvey pitt a washington securities lawyer 
who represents boesky judges have become a lot tougher 
former us attorney rudolph giuliani orchestrated the 
corruption crackdown and used it as a springboard for an 
unsuccessful bid for new york city mayor the securities unit of 
the federal prosecutors office has grown to 20 people from three 
in 1986 
theyve overindicted and indicted for conduct which should not 
be charged as criminal said stanley arkin a new york lawyer who 
has defended several wall street figures targeted by giuliani 
i think when you rape rob pillage extort these things have 
an inherent kind of evil to them far more than an inappropriate 
tax straddle or a conflict between a lawful and an unlawful 
rumor arkin said 
on wall street the insider trading scandal has changed the way 
business is transacted arbitragers who speculate in stocks of 
potential takeover targets and the investment bankers who finance 
the deals say the days of careless informationswapping are gone 
bankers just wont pick up calls from arbitragers they just 
screen them out said a 27yearold investment banker at a major 
wall street firm who spoke on condition he not be identified 
market participants say they have seen a decline in long runups 
in the stock price of takeover targets before a deal is announced 
possibly indicating less information is leaked in advance 
investment firms have increased the number of compliance 
officers monitoring trades and spent millions on new technology 
the new york stock exchange has boosted its market surveillance 
staff to 109 from 85 in 1986 
taking the action against boesky taking the action against 
drexel has put the street back on an even keel said gary lynch 
the former sec enforcement director who helped spearhead the major 
insider trading cases and is now a private attorney in new york 
investment firms have hired lawyers who wield significant 
policymaking power firms have rewritten rules and added ethics 
lectures to training programs many brokerages now require 
employees to clear personal stock transactions in advance to avoid 
any possible suggestion of wrongdoing 
for those on their way to wall street top business schools 
including harvard have added required ethics courses 
i certainly think it heightened the awareness of wall street 
for the potential for disaster if business isnt being conducted in 
the right way said joel cohen head of mergers and acquisitions 
for donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
kidder closed its arbitrage department after paying 253 
million to settle civil insider trading charges stemming from the 
boesky scandal 
there was an it cant happpen here attitude before that 
said kidders general counsel john liftin to find there was a 
willful violator in the middle of things was a real shock to 
everybody 
the scandal has produced drama ranging from courtroom faceoffs 
to an alleged plot to kill boesky 
when milken pleaded innocent hundreds of reporters and 
spectators jammed manhattan federal court drexel loyalists sported 
hats reading mike milken we believe in you and cheered their

the virginia legislature laid out a pitifully thin welcome mat 
when lawrence douglas wilder arrived at richmonds capitol square 
nearly 20 years ago even so in the minds of some reluctant 
colleagues that day he promptly tripped over it 
wilder then the only black elected to the state senate since 
reconstruction had barely taken his oath when he implored 
replacement of the official state song noting its lyrics extol 
plantation life under old massa and refer to the commonwealth 
as where this old darkies heart am longed to go 
the words burned in my ears said wilder his words in 
turn burned the ears of his white brethren he was the only member 
of the senate who was not invited that year to the annual bash for 
legislators at the exclusive commonwealth club where he had once 
worked as a busboy 
some things havent changed in the old dominion in the two 
decades since carry me back to old virginia is still the state 
song though rarely sung but doug wilder wont find the footing 
nearly so cruel in january when barring an unexpected change in 
last tuesdays vote count he will take his next oath at the state 
capitol the finest red carpet will be out for the new governor 
preliminary vote totals show that wilder a 58yearold 
democrat beat j marshall coleman a white republican by the 
threadthin margin of 5000 votes 
coleman has said he will demand a recount assuming it confirms 
wilder as the winner he will be the first elected black governor 
in the history of the republic 
it would be naive to suggest that some people didnt vote for or 
against wilder on the basis of race but the marvelous thing is 
that no one in virginia a state ruled by segregationists a 
generation ago made race an issue in this campaign nasty as it 
was on other fronts 
political analysts will have a field day postulating how 
virginia became the first state to elect a black governor not 
california where tom bradley came whiskerclose in 1982 then 
faded in 1986 and not michigan where republican william lucas 
also lost in 1986 
prochoice abortion activists who campaigned hard for wilder 
with newfound voice and financial muscle will trumpet his victory 
as evidence of a shifting political tide so will black activists 
and national democratic leaders still smarting from the reagan and 
bush landslides 
but any simplistic explanation simply will not do for that 
would ignore wilders groundbreaking achievements on a long 
patient climb to power over two decades not to mention the 
remarkable social and political metamorphosis of the entire state 
the old dominion it is sometimes said is now the new dominion 
wilder has been a relentless leavenothingtochance 
campaigner and it could be argued that 1985 the year he won the 
lieutenant governorship marked his most important political 
passage white party leaders had pleaded with him to withdraw from 
the race lest he sink the ticket headed by gerald baliles the 
governor he now succeeds instead wilder began a 3719mile auto 
tour of the state handshaking his way through 338 cities and towns 
and all 95 of the states counties 
twothirds of his 750000 war chest that year was spent on 
television ads including one in which a beefy white policeman from 
a small virginia town delivered the endorsement of the fraternal 
order of police wilder won with 518 percent of the vote 
he raised 10 times as much money for this years governors 
race which was a sweatsoaked reprise of 1985 he retraced his 
path into virtually every country store cafe and town hall some 
advised him to stay out of remote allwhite regions people said 
i should never go out there with those people because id never be 
seen again he recalled i go out there to those people and 
they say welcome home doug wilder 
in farmville wilder renewed acquaintances with townspeople 
beneath their monument to confederate heroes and was led around by 
robert bruce a white attorney who has never lived anywhere else 
as bruce put it folks are going to vote for him but they arent 
going to talk about it they arent going to put a wilder bumper 
sticker on the truck 
that suited wilder fine his record is one of living within the 
establishment while selectively challenging it knowing when to 
threaten when to charm he was never a street activist for civil 
rights he did not support jesse jacksons bid for the democratic 
presidential nomination in 1984 or 1988 and spurned offers from 
jackson and other black activists to campaign for him 
to those who think he has been too accommodating to the white 
majority he had a standard rejoinder jesse runs to inspire i 
run to win 
it may not have seemed that way in the beginning he arrived at 
the legislature already having risen from busboy to millionaire 
criminal lawyer wearing an afro and there was the early brouhaha 
over the state song 
over time the afro gave way to a straighter silver mane his 
flamboyant attire to bankers suits someone said to me in 1985 
that when he saw me wearing wingtips he knew i was really 
serious he said 
by then wilder was a committee chairman and one of the most 
influential senators in the legislature he shepherded an array of 
antidiscrimination laws and won a long battle to declare a holiday 
honoring king although whites insisted that the day be shared 
with robert e lee and stonewall jackson 
wilders rise after all took place in the city that once 
served as the capital of the confederacy in a state that was 
dominated for four decades by the segregationist political machine 
of harry f byrd sr a poll tax kept blacks effectively 
disenfranchised until the mid1960s when the 24th amendment to the 
constitution and the federal voting rights act of 1965 forced the 
state to change

yatpang au enrolled at the university of 
california at berkeley this semester after a twoyear battle 
against a school admissions policy that he said discriminated 
against asianamericans 
his case has drawn new attention to affirmative action programs 
designed to help minorities enter top colleges and universities 
because in some cases they have hampered rather than helped this 
minority which scholastically outperforms the general population 
au graduated at the top of his high school class and received 
awards for 10 extracurricular activities but his initial 
application to berkeley was rejected two years ago his father 
said because of an affirmative action policy that put a 40 percent 
limit on admissions based strictly on grades and test scores 
in a single year the number of asianamericans accepted as 
freshmen at berkeley dropped from 24 percent to 21 percent amid 
cries of racism 
i fight this not because its my son but for asian people as a 
whole said aus father sik kee au a businessman in san jose 
calif one of the most important things in life for us is an 
education 
the university has since revised its admissions policy and the 
younger au enrolled there as a transfer student this semester as a 
junior his younger brother yat hon was admitted as a freshman 
university officials say the new admissions policy maintains 
high academic standards while reflecting the states diverse 
population helping blacks hispanics and other lowachieving 
groups it has placated the onceangry asianamerican community 
but rep dana rohrabacher rcalif wants more 
rohrabacher is sponsoring a resolution that would put congress 
on record as opposing quotas that appear to discriminate against 
asianamericans 
i believe that the issue here is not affirmative action but 
one of equal opportunity for all students said rohrabacher in a 
recent letter to the asian pacific americans in higher education 
quotas and other forms of racial discrimination have no place in 
our nations schools and for that matter anywhere else 
university officials said the proposed resolution may hamper 
efforts by colleges and universities to enroll more minorities 
it would appear that mr rohrabacher is using this resolution 
as a way to get at affirmative action which we obviously would 
totally disagree with said john cummins assistant chancellor 
for public affairs 
most colleges and universities across the nation are seeking 
ways to increase minority enrollment to prepare for demographic 
projections that minorities collectively will become the majority 
by the year 2000 
enrollment of minority undergraduate students this fall at 
bowling green state university in ohio increased 132 percent over 
last year blacks account for 4 percent with 636 hispanics make up 
about 1 percent with 140 and other minorities primarily asians 
have gone from 96 to 118 of the 15978 undergraduate students 
at the university of michigan minority student enrollment 
increased by 93 percent this year from 4991 to 5454 a record 
total officials said asians comprise 68 percent of the student 
body after an asian enrollment increase of 111 percent blacks 
65 percent hispanics 28 percent and american indians 04 percent 
the chronicle of higher education said that in 1986 colleges 
enrolled 90000 american indians 448000 asians 624000 
hispanics 11 million blacks 99 million whites and 344000 
foreign students the schools also have instituted special programs 
to recruit and retain minorities 
ucberkeley officials insist their new admissions policy merely 
reflects the states population while upholding high academic 
standards the school receives about 22000 applications for 4000 
spaces 
cummins said that since 1980 the states population has 
increased 500000 a year and that between now and the year 2000 
there will be an additional 6 million residents mostly minority 
hispanic and asians particularly 
the asian population has grown a phenomenal 70 percent since 
1980 and now approaches 10 percent of the states total 
statistics show that asianamericans at ucberkeley had the 
highest graduation rates nearly 95 percent in 1987 compared with 
93 percent for whites other minorities including blacks and 
hispanics had graduation rates in the low to mid80s 
by 1991 ucberkeley will admit 50 percent of its students based 
on grades and test scores alone currently 40 percent are in this 
academic category 
about 45 percent of the fall freshman admissions will be based 
on criteria other than academic scores alone the other criteria 
will include race disability and special talents such as in 
music drama and debating 
a third category will include athletes the poor regardless of 
race or ethnicity and older or reentering students 
patrick hayashi who works with admissions at the university 
stressed that all applicants still fall within the top 125 percent 
of high school seniors 
some people mistakenly think that our commitment to diversify 
our student body has come at the expense of our academic standards 
thats simply false said hayashi we are doing now exactly 
what weve done for the past 50 years selecting from the top 
the elder au said that before the recent changes it was very 
clear ucberkeley had unfair practices for admissions 
but they are now gradually working to change that i hope this 
is the beginning of opportunity

republicans already were having an off 
offyear and they knew there was worse coming 
so they had an alibi ready when democrats swept the seasons big 
three elections in new jersey virginia and new york city the 
outcomes ran to form although the margins for a black governor in 
virginia and mayorelect in the new york were narrower than the 
pollsters anticipated 
the republican refrain was a tested and familiar one that 
these losses were local not portents of the national elections of 
1990 
but the hangover remedy didnt work this time 
republican national chairman lee atwater acknowledged as much 
even as he tried to play down the losses 
these scattered elections had too much in common in issues 
themes and tactics that could echo into next years national 
campaign for congress and 36 governorships 
earlier in the year democrats had won five out of seven special 
elections to the house their majority will be 259 to 176 heading 
into national midterm elections in which the white house party 
historically has lost seats in congress 
the 1990 elections also will shape the state governments that 
will control the process of reapportioning congressional seats 
after the census another worrisome prospect for the gop it takes 
a governor or control in at least one branch of the state 
legislature to put a party in a bargaining position on 
reapportionment republicans will control none of the above in the 
two state governments shaped by tuesdays balloting democratic 
govselect james j florio of new jersey and l douglas wilder of 
virginia who still faces a recount will be working with solidly 
democratic legislatures 
take a look at what happened to underpin reapportionment for 
1992 said rep beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee 
atwater said it would be a mistake to read national patterns 
into local elections but there were some 
the abortion issue boomeranged on republicans who once had 
seen it work against democratic candidates president bush atwater 
and republican congressional leaders discussed it at a wednesday 
political post mortem bush said in advance that he was not budging 
in his own antiabortion stance enforced with two vetoes this fall 
atwater was quoted as saying that if abortion becomes the main 
issue in the 1990 campaign republicans will lose 
the republican losers in virginia new jersey and new york city 
all were abortion foes although each had tempered that opposition 
wilders campaign advertisements stressed the issue saying he 
would veto any attempt to take away a womans right to choose in 
the closest of counts that almost certainly gained him votes 
crucial to his victory margin 
rep newt gingrich of georgia the house republican whip said 
extreme positions for or against abortion can only hurt candidates 
but that there is a common sense position in the middle 
the republican problem is that when their 1989 candidates tried 
to move there democrats hammered successfully at their old 
absolutist positions while antiabortion groups denounced them for 
trying to change 
democratic national chairman ronald h brown said bush had dug 
himself and his party into a hole on the issue 
but the democrats arent home free either the official party 
position is in favor of unrestricted abortion rights but brown 
said that should not be a litmus test for their candidates we 
dont want to run democrats away from the party because they wont 
favor the platform line on this issue he said 
campaigns were tough negative and sometimes personal with 
candidates and their advertisements concentrating on tearing down 
the opposition it is a proven tactic president bush used it in 
1988 
while democratic leaders criticized that style of campaigning 
and claimed the 1989 outcome would end it democratic winners used 
it as aggressively as republicans 
maybe i can have a role in seeing that it gets a little more 
positive bush said tuesday how well say i think it ought to 
be a little more positive 
the argument now and probably next year is about who throws the 
first stone with each side blaming the other for negativism as 
both sides go at it while brown said the voters are fed up with 
negative politics he also said democrats dont believe in 
unilateral disarmament 
wilder became the first black elected governor and david 
dinkins the first black mayor of new york although by unexpectedly 
narrow margins both ran as centrists neither was vulnerable to 
the taxandspend softoncrime labels republicans attached to the 
democratic ticket in 1988 black democrats were elected to succeed 
white mayors in cleveland seattle and new haven conn even the 
losing republicans applauded the trend there and elsewhere 
gingrich said the black victories were fundamentally good for 
america 
atwater could point only to a handful of downtheballot 
victories as evidence of success for black republican candidates 
and eddie n williams president of the joint center for 
political studies said republicans still tend to send black 
candidates on suicide missions running them against heavily 
favored democratic officeholders he said the dinkins and wilder 
victories will help the democrats attract black candidates and 
solidify black support 
there will be at least one major bid for another black 
breakthrough next year 
atlanta mayor andrew young is preparing to run for governor of 
georgia in 1990 hell seek the democratic nomination on what is 
likely to be a crowded ballot 
if he won two of 50 governors would be black there are no 
black senators 24 house members 
and williams sees no prospect that those numbers will change 
significantly next year i dont know where there would be any 
major advances in 1990

sevenyearold justin coles no longer cringes 
when he goes to the doctor and neither does his mother thanks to 
a program that provides free health care to children of the working 
poor 
justins parents earn 13000 a year too much to qualify for 
state medicaid yet well below the federal poverty level for a 
family of five because the coles fall through this everwidening 
crack justin receives treatment for recurring ear infections 
through the caring program for children 
before he was enrolled in 1986 we were relying on clinics if 
it would have been just your typical childhood illnesses i could 
deal with that but with permanent hearing loss said his 
mother chris her voice trailing off 
hes very happy because he can see his doctor now there was 
that period of time when he was running from doctor to doctor and 
clinic to clinic 
the bottom line for him is it saved his hearing im convinced 
of this 
the program sponsored by blue cross of western pennsylvania and 
pennsylvania blue shield has helped more than 13000 youngsters in 
four years about 700 more are waiting to get in its success has 
prompted nine states to start similar programs and four more are 
expected to follow suit soon 
for chris and jim coles the caring program has removed the 
stigma of being on welfare while letting them provide for their 
son his id card resembles any insurance card and is accepted by 
most physicians 
mrs coles 38 who has two children from a previous marriage 
works part time as a nurses aide her husband 37 a laidoff 
steelworker paints houses 
we are the working poor its unfortunate but were not 
alone mrs coles said you have to make a choice whats more 
important to my child his ears or having food on the table and a 
roof over his head that is absolutely what it came down to 
no one should have to make that kind of choice said fred 
rogers host of public televisions mister rogers neighborhood 
and caring program honorary chairman the program is not going to 
solve all of the ills of our society with its skyrocketing medical 
expenses but it certainly is a stopgap 
the coles are among 37 million americans the census bureau says 
lack health insurance about a third or 125 million are under 
19 from 1980 to 1988 the number of children under 15 living in 
poverty rose by 12 million according to the childrens defense 
fund 
we have a national problem said dr james strain executive 
director of the american academy of pediatrics 
the very poor people have access to care through the 
government strain said the children who have trouble are those 
above the level that makes them eligible for medicaid and children 
who should be eligible but arent 
the federal poverty level for a family of five for example is 
14140 a year earning more than 7700 disqualifies them for 
medicaid in pennsylvania 
you see why people go on welfare in this situation said 
charlie lavallee director of the caring program its incredible 
irony people who are working their children are worse off thats 
tragic in a land that has prided itself on the things we have 
done 
the program was established in pittsburgh in 1985 after two 
ministers approached eugene barone president of blue cross of 
western pennsylvania and described the anguish of unemployed 
steelworkers barone discovered that 40000 western pennsylvania 
children lacked health insurance and that the problem spread far 
beyond the families of former steelworkers 
blue cross and blue shield agreed to match contributions dollar 
for dollar and to donate administrative costs so children like 
justin could get not only treatment but regular checkups while 
parents got back on their feet 
although the caring program doesnt cover specialized care for 
chronically ill children and has no plans to do so it hopes to 
help them indirectly with a fiveyear 341000 grant awarded oct 
30 by the american academy of pediatrics and the federal office of 
maternal and child health 
the money will be used to train doctors to treat such lifetime 
ailments as diabetes or cystic fibrosis said dr woodie kessel of 
the federal office and parents of chronically ill children will be 
directed to service agencies and specialty clinics 
the cost to the caring program of providing routine and 
preventive treatment is 156 per child per year youngsters are 
eligible as long as their families are above the medicaid cutoff 
but below the federal poverty level the parents pay nothing to 
participate in the program 
the other states with caring programs are alabama iowa kansas 
maryland missouri new york north carolina north dakota and 
ohio four others plan to launch programs in january but dont 
want to be identified beforehand 
its not a quick fix and then get out said al rohling 
executive director of the 1yearold alabama caring program for 
children about 3000 children are waiting to get into the program 
almost as many as those currently in it the states eligible 
population is estimated at more than 35000 
in central new york 17500 youngsters are eligible for the 
caring program established sept 1 as of nov 1 338 had been 
approved for assistance 
are we going to wait until some federal program that may come 
down a few years from now asked albert antonini president of 
blue cross and blue shield of central new york inc the needs are 
out there 
acutely aware of those needs the pediatrics academy is pushing 
for federal health insurance for all americans under 21 and for 
pregnant women coverage would be furnished by parents employers 
or a state insurance fund 
when we solve this problem we can home in on the next group 
that is really vulnerable like senior citizens lavallee said 
we have to keep attacking this with full strength

kailuakona hawaii ap hawaii conjures up images of 
freespending tourists lolling in the warm pacific ocean but the 
state hopes icy water pumped from the ocean depths will also boost 
the islands economy 
hawaii is in a unique position because unlike the rest of the 
coastal states the ocean bottom drops sharply from shore said 
kari berg manager of hawaii ocean and science technology park on 
the island of hawaii the water down there is free of germs and 
real cold so it can be used for everything from salmon farming to 
cold storage 
the commercial host park was dedicated in july and soon will 
begin renting land cold seawater and facilities to aquaculture 
firms several of which have done research next door at the natural 
energy laboratory of hawaii 
the 15yearold laboratory is a pioneer in aquaculture it draws 
cold germfree water from a depth of 2200 feet to grow everything 
from strawberries to giant clams and studies ocean thermal energy 
conversion using temperature differences between surface and deep 
water to generate electricity 
the commercial park was a natural extension of the lab and the 
two will likely be merged by next years legislature berg said 
weather and geography combine perfectly at keahole point on 
hawaiis western shore for ocean farming on land she said 
the bottom drops to depths of 15000 feet and pipes bring the 
nutrientrich sea water which is colder than 50 degrees inland 
where it is used in a warm dry climate to nourish a variety of 
crops 
phil and joe wilson brothers who formed aquaculture enterprises 
in 1986 fill their ponds or raceways with the water and grow 
mature maine lobsters in 2 years shaving 4 years off the natural 
maturation rate 
its not a crazy concept you can raise lobsters in the 
tropics as long as you have cold water said phil wilson 
besides being cold having water this clean takes a lot of risks 
out of the operation 
moreover by moving away from the ocean the wilsons can control 
other factors lobsters dont grow in the winter in the wild but 
in a controlled temperature they grow yearround you dont have to 
worry about predators and its easier to control disease 
because theres no pollution 
the brothers are in a demonstration phase now but within three 
years they hope to farm 20 acres and produce 500000 maine 
lobsters annually 
other companies cultivate abalone salmon lettuce kelp and 
microalgae for health food and pharmaceuticals 
the commercial park has 547 acres and the lab takes up 322 
acres berg said leases for about half the available land are being 
negotiated but price is a barrier for many interested firms 
tenants spend 10000 to 80000 an acre to grade and develop 
the rough volcanic terrain and pay the state rent plus a 
percentage of their profits the state and county also stand to 
profit from taxes and created jobs 
especially when they see the initial expense its hard to 
convince a salmon fisher who has nets in the ocean that hed be 
better off with ponds on land but he would be berg said they 
dont know the advantages such as yearround production until 
they test it out thats why we encourage them to start small at 
the lab which acts as an incubator 
the cold sea water and controlled environment are also ideal for 
land crops such as strawberries in prototype strawberry fields 
cold sea water is pumped to the surface and through pipes in the 
ground to cool soil surrounding the plants that way the 
strawberries become dormant as they would in winter when the cold 
water stops running the sun warms the fruit and it thrives drip 
irrigation for the strawberries is provided by fresh water 
condensation that forms around the pipes carrying the sea water

using modernday nuclear magnetic resonance 
imaging jacob schaefer has found what may be a chink in 
cockroaches prehistoric armor 
the crosslink is the place where chemicals are produced to 
make the ultrahard exoskeleton said schaefer a washington 
university chemist once formed these bonds are permanent and 
very hard to break 
my collaborators are now isolating the essential enzymes and 
metabolites that help make the structure hopefully they may be 
able to develop an inhibitor molecule one that thwarts the 
enzymes mode of action 
in other words an insecticide that would kill the pests by 
keeping them from developing the hard shell that holds them 
together 
that may be easier said than done 
there may not even be a compound that will work said team 
member karl j kramer a kansas state university chemist who works 
with the us department of agricultures agricultural research 
service now that we know a little bit more about the structure 
maybe well have a little more luck eventually 
in nmr a sophisticated radio receivertransmitter called a 
spectrometer identifies atoms by their distinct response to a 
magnetic field so scientists can determine the makeup of a sample 
such as an insects shell 
its now time for the organic chemists and the pesticide 
chemists to look at that structure and come up with something that 
can use it said kramer 
a new approach to the problem has been called for by people 
concerned over insects ability to adapt to poisons and even 
biological controls 
the shortsighted and irresponsible use of pesticides and 
antibiotics is producing strains of monsterbugs that are resistant 
to our chemical weapons said robert l metcalf professor 
emeritus at the university of illinois who is outspoken on the 
subject of pesticide misuse 
i doubt if we will ever be able to eradicate insect pests 
entirely he said insects in every case become resistant to 
chemicals after a period of continued exposure and they become 
resistant to the biological controls but we can improve our 
methods of less toxic controls and it is clear we dont want to 
keep relying on chemicals that are poisonous to both insects and 
man 
pesticides have found their way into groundwater and killed 
fish wildlife and people the world health organization estimates 
500000 poisonings of humans and 20000 deaths worldwide from 
insecticide each year 
metcalf said schaefers pioneering use of nmr a unique 
approach and an exciting contribution to the newwave of 
insecticide research 
schaefer emphasized that much work needs to be done before his 
findings can be of direct benefit we hope to find that the 
crosslink is different in each kind of insect any insecticide 
will have to be selective 
you dont want to kill every insect in the field some of 
them are beneficial but now at least scientists can make a 
reasonable guess about what chemicals to look at 
one of the problems in the past he said is that there was not 
enough communication between the disciplines in the scientific 
community chemists biologists and entomolgists tended to go their 
separate ways 
my whole strategy is to hook up with the best i can find in 
every field so far we havent worked with microbiologists doing 
genetic engineering but were at least in the talking stage now

that rap or heavy metal music blaring from 
teenagers car stereos may not be the distraction some people 
think 
people tend to react faster when music is at a personal 
comfort level said wichita state university psychologist 
marilyn turner who has tested about 100 people in a driving 
simulator subjects were told to brake when a red bulb lit with 
music playing at different levels up to 80 decibels 
an airplane landing nearby generates 120 or more decibels rock 
concerts generally produce 90 or more and ear damage can occur at 
95 decibels 
in general we found that people reacted fastest when there 
wasnt any music at all ms turner said and we expected as 
the music got louder they would get slower in their reaction time 
what happened is that as they got to their preference level they 
actually got a little bit faster 
gender difference also shows up in the tests she said men have 
the fastest reaction time when there isnt any music and women 
react fastest when the volume was right for them men tend to want 
the volume higher than women 
turner plans to expand the study to see what effect volume has 
on reaction time when people are trying to remember directions 
listening to music they prefer and listening to music they dont 
like 
when someone turns down the music to look for a street address 
or in heavy traffic she said really all a person is doing is 
saying hey all of a sudden my driving task isnt automatic any 
more

ralph portier calls them pets but others

the bugs feed upon phenol and other organic materials found in

of contaminated soil at georgia gulfs plaquemine plant the 
water is impeccably clean but the water was the least of the 
problems the big problem was the sludge and chemicals underneath 
the water that soil is now as safe as garden soil he said 
this is the first time we were able to use this natural 
process to resolve a largescale hazardous waste disposal 
problem said vince tretter environmental manager at the plant 
portiers developments in adapting microorganisms to eat toxic 
materials also is planned for a superfund cleanup at the old inger 
hazardous waste site near darrow it will be the first such use in 
a superfund site 
only about 60 percent of the sites can be approached from a 
microbiology point of view but the economics are quite attractive 
when it can work it cost about onethird to onehalf the cost of 
incineration portier said 
the microorganisms could be used to clean up oil spills too he 
said 
our imagination is the only limit to the future application of 
this technology said peter perez of environmental remediation 
inc one of the firms involved in the cleanup he believes 
microorganisms will eventually be used to clean up a large 
percentage of the nations superfund sites

tests on the skin of a chameleon 
heading for space on wednesday could help scientists understand 
more about cell structure and offer clues to downtoearth human 
problems like osteoporosis 
in space cells apparently make their normal products but 
sometimes these products cant get out said roy hammerstedt he 
hopes to learn if cells that secrete hormones malfunction in low 
gravity because their structure is changed 
the experiment will treat chameleon cells with hormones that 
change skin color from green to brown or brown to green if the 
cells structure changes in microgravity onethousandth normal 
the hormone wont trigger the change 
chameleon skin color change is hormonally dependant and 
requires its own type of internal cell structure said 
hammerstedt a biochemist with penn state universitys nasafunded 
center for cell research 
we picked a skin model because it has many of the same 
features as some of the more fragile cells were interested in 
researchers also believe a hormone imbalance causes 
osteoporosis muscle atrophy and other ailments he said 
astronauts have experienced bone and muscle problems that mimic 
arthritis osteoporosis and other diseases 
wesley himer a penn state biochemist and director of the cell 
research center has found in experiments on us and soviet space 
missions that growth hormone secretions in rats are reduced by half 
in space experiments in space are useful because microgravity 
speeds some cell processes hammerstedt said 
his is one of 12 experiments to be launched wednesday aboard a 
consort 2 rocket from white sands nm the seven to eightminute 
journey will carry the 12footlong 1004pound experiment module 
to an altitude of 200 miles 
other experiments were submitted by battelle advanced materials 
center in columbus ohio kansas state university and the 
university of coloradoboulder thiokol corp instrumentation 
technology associates the university of alabama in huntsville 
mcdonnell douglas space systems co and phillips petroleum co 
consort 2 is the second launch from white sands devoted to 
experiments the national aeronautics and space administration has 
funds for another this fiscal year consort 1 flew march 29 with

the company that is introducing facsimile machines 
to the nations post offices was born out of frustration 
it was 1985 and edd helms was in atlanta trying to rework a bid 
proposal due the next morning from his miamibased electrical 
contracting firm 
late at night helms asked the hotel desk for its fax number so 
he could receive documents from his main office 
they said whats a fax said helms i was stunned i 
thought they were kidding 
helms company lost the bid but the incident sparked the idea 
for hotelecopy inc which has installed fax machines in more than 
1700 hotels nationwide 
on monday hotelecopy moved into a new arena as the us postal 
services first customer fax machine opened in new york city under 
a oneyear program that will bring the devices to about 8000 post 
offices nationwide 
the fax machine is what the personal computer or automatic 
bank tellers once was said the hotelecopy president it will 
become so integrated into american life that we will wonder how we 
got along without it the post office has recognized that 
hotelecopy which has contracted with mci communications corp 
for telephone connections to the machines will install the credit 
cardoperated fax machines in 54 post offices in the northeast it 
also plans to submit bids later this month to provide service for 
the remaining regions of the country 
customers will be charged 1275 for three minutes of 
transmission which is equivalent to about seven pages 
hotelecopy will pay the postal service 150 a month rent for 
each location and an undisclosed percentage of revenue 
hotelecopy which made its first public stock offering in 
september had revenue of about 5 million last year 
even before hotelecopy was founded helms 43 said he was 
extolling the virtues of the fax 
by the early 1980s helms said he decided to place purchase 
orders for his contracting company exclusively by fax he then gave 
his suppliers three options buy a fax lease one from helms or 
lose his business 
today the hotelecopy fax network moves about 50000 pages a 
day helms recently expanded the service to include translation 
services and secretarial work 
a businessperson faxes down a document to us in miami and we 
send back the translation said helms 
hoteleticket inc a wholly owned subsidiary has also placed 
airline ticket machines in about 50 hotels from luxury resorts to 
chain establishments the units can print a ticket and boarding 
pass within 10 minutes of order said helms 
there is a whole new definition of what fast is and what good 
service is said helms people today want things immediately 
and they dont what to go out of their way to get it time is too 
precious 
helms estimates fax machines are used in about 25 percent of 
us businesses but fewer than 1 percent of homes 
think of the butcher the baker the candlestick maker you 
think they have a fax but soon they may not be able to do without 
access to one said helms thats the void the post office will 
fill the faxless will no longer have to do without

a federal express co commercial that featured 
an incredibly fasttalking businessman was the best advertisement 
of the 1980s according to a survey of the board of the ad trade 
group the one club 
the orwellian 1984 commercial for apple computer inc and a 
series of rolling stone magazine print ads noting the differences 
between some perceptions about its readers and reality also were 
ranked among the best ads of the decade the group said wednesday 
ads for levi strauss jeans nike shoes the wine coolers 
bartles amp jaymes and california cooler and miller lite beer also 
made the list 
the one club an association of advertising copywriters and art 
directors developed its ranking based on responses to surveys in 
which each of its 13 directors was asked to rank personal favorites 
from the past decade 
none of the directors ad agencies placed an ad on the decades 
best list 
of the 12 best ads 10 involved television commercials one was 
a print campaign and one used billboards 
mike hughes vice chairman and creative director of the martin 
agency of richmond va said the directors generally were trying 
to identify ads that broke from convention and spawned imitators of 
their own 
but he said 1985 commercials for levis 501 jeans which showed 
young people in urban settings cast in a blueshaded hue had a 
style copied widely a lot of commercials became blue he said 
hughes said the toprated fast talker ad from federal 
express in 1982 brought activity to a halt in many households each 
time the commercial aired 
a separate federal express campaign from 1980 that showed top 
executives anxious to get a package delivered picking up the phone 
and saying hellooo federal broke the ad taboo of never make 
the customer look silly hughes said 
apples 1984 ad showed a dreary scene of prisoners filing in 
for a televised address by a dogmatic leader the gloom was 
shattered when a woman tossed a club that broke the screen the ad 
ran only once during the telecast of the 1984 superbowl football 
game but hughes said no other ad has had more impact on one 
airing 
authorship of a memorable ad in the 1980s did not necessarily 
mean an ad agency kept the assignment ally amp gargano which made 
the two winning federal express ads is no longer the federal 
express agency and apple has dropped chiatday which made 
1984 as its agency 
but chiatday offices now known as chiatdaymojo were 
responsible for five of the 12 best ads according to the one club

the media concern whittle communications thinks 
its not enough to have taken over the magazine racks in doctors 
offices with its series of magazines now it wants to get patients 
to watch its tv programs as they wait for their appointment 
whittle said wednesday it is developing a closedcircuit 
advertisersupported television network for installation in 100000 
medical waiting rooms nationwide 
the company disclosed it was developing the new tv project on 
the same day it launched the first in a series of nonfiction books 
that contain advertising and are being given for free to 150000 
civic and business leaders 
whittle executives hope to decide by years end whether to 
proceed with a largescale test of the new tv project which they 
said could be the companys largest to date and one of the biggest 
in broadcasting with a potential audience of 30 million a week 
the knoxville tennbased company which is 50 percent owned by 
time warner inc is already in 60000 doctors offices with either 
its special reports magazines or sponsored posters 
the tv project has the potential to generate more annual revenue 
than the 90 million expected from whittles other television 
project the channel one daily news show for teens that whittle 
plans to launch in march in 1000 middle and high schools whittle 
executives said 
alan greenberg vice chairman of whittle and the executive in 
charge of the new tv project said the system would deliver 
programming live by satellite to doctors waiting rooms the rooms 
would be equipped with advanced viewing systems possibly 
highdefinition tv sets multiscreen sets or widescreen tv 
we want to offer something as different from existing tv 
technology as color was from blackandwhite he said 
he said it has not been determined what kind of programming 
would be carried on the system but said that possibilities under 
study include a healthrelated program or an entertainment program 
whittle would produce the program which may last an hour or so 
and the show would be repeated continuously during the day he 
said a new show could be produced every week or two he said 
the project could involve more than 250 million in technology 
alone well above the 150 million being spent on channel one 
greenberg said the tv project is a logical extension of 
whittles involvement with publications targeted to people in 
medical waiting rooms 
special reports a series of six quarterly publications are 
read by about 60 percent of the people visiting the 17000 doctors 
waiting rooms where the magazines are available he said 
the audience is predominantly women with children an appealing 
target for many advertisers that is often hard to reach in large 
numbers with other media 
he said whittle has received very positive vibes from the 
medical community about its plans for a tv network 
if the tv project is launched greenberg said advertisers would 
probably be given the chance to buy packages that would include ads 
in the magazines and on the tv network with the guarantee that 
competing brands would not appear 
he said it had not yet been determined how much advertising time 
would be sold on each program but said it would probably be less 
than the 16 minutes of network and local advertising carried each 
hour on broadcast television 
whittle plans to decide in late december whether to undertake a 
largescale test of the system greenberg said the test could 
begin in mid1990 he said and if that proves successful the 
project could be launched nationally the following summer 
the main stumbling blocks he said are assurances that the 
programming can be delivered on time and the cost of technology 
the first book in what whittle is calling the larger agenda 
series is the trouble with money by william greider who wrote 
the secrets of the temple which explored the federal reserve 
system 
the books in the series are slimmer than most regular books so 
that harried opinionmakers will read them said whittle editor 
william s rukeyser 
greiders book runs 96 pages with 18 pages of advertising all 
of it from federal express co the air courier based in memphis 
tenn 
federal express also is shipping the books for free to 150000 
government and business leaders over the next few days 
in addition the book will be available without advertising for 
1195 in 150 selected waldenbooks stores later this month 
rukeyser said whittle hopes to publish one new book in the 
series every two months

the federal reserve after weeks of complaints 
from the bush administration about high interest rates has nudged 
a key interest rate lower in a move analysts predicted would 
trigger widespread declines in a variety of consumer and business 
borrowing rates 
economists were looking for commerical banks to cut by onehalf 
percentage point their prime lending rate which is used as a base 
to calculate more than onethird of their business and consumer 
loans 
one bank southwest bank of st louis said wednesday that it 
was cutting its prime lending rate from 105 percent to 10 percent 
while the move was not immediately followed by the countrys 
largest banks analysts predicted that it would be perhaps later 
this week 
many economists predicted that the easier fed monetary policy 
would accelerate a move to lower mortgage rates 
wall street was buoyed by the feds actions with stock prices up 
sharply on investor optimism that the central bank was moving to 
keep the economy from slipping into a recession the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks closed with a gain of 2623 points 
at 262336 
as usual the fed made no announcement of its decision to move 
toward an easier monetary policy 
however analysts said there was little doubt that such a 
decision had been made given the fact that a bellwether interest 
rate the federal funds rate traded again wednesday at 85 
percent down from 875 percent when the week began 
the federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each 
other to make overnight loans because it is directly influenced by 
the feds decisions on the amount of cash to make available to the 
banking system it considered the best gauge of fed policy 
intentions 
it is clear that the fed has eased said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co the central bank is acting to prevent 
the economy from heading into a serious downturn 
federal reserve officials refused comment on a report in 
wednesdays washington post that the decision to ease was made 
during a telephone conference call monday among members of the 
federal open market committee composed of fed board members in 
washington and presidents of five of the 12 regional federal 
reserve banks 
the fomc which gathers in washington eight times a year to map 
monetary strategy will meet tuesday and some economists expressed 
surprise that the fed took action this week instead of waiting for 
the regularly scheduled meeting 
the quarterpoint drop in the federal funds rate this week is 
the fifth small decline that has occurred since late may when the 
central bank began to reverse a yearlong effort to drive interest 
rates higher as a way to fight inflationary pressures 
president bush and others in the administration have been 
complaining that the central bank has been moving too slowly to 
lower interest rates white house budget director richard darman 
warned in august that if the economy does slip into a recession it 
will be the fault of the feds tightmoney policies 
some economists however said wednesday that the fed was wrong 
to buckle to political pressure warning that the action could make 
inflationary pressures worse in 1990 
i am very disappointed in the fed and very pessimisitc about 
the chances of keeping inflation down said cynthia latta an 
economist with drimcgraw hill they may be thinking that they 
can loosen rescue the economy and then tighten again but 
experience has shown that doesnt usually work 
other economists were not as pessimistic saying that if the fed 
had waited to ease until it got inflation down further it would 
have run an even greater risk of dumping the economy into a 
downturn 
central banks in the past have made big errors in fighting 
inflation for too long and then watching as the economy tumbles 
into a widespread broad recession sinai said that just 
intensified the downturn and forced the central bank to pump up the 
economy with easy money creating a bustboom situation 
various analysts said they believed that a hallmark of the fed 
under chairman alan greenspan has been a gradual approach to either 
tightening or loosening monetary policy and for that reason they 
said that the 025 percent drop in the federal funds rate would not 
be followed quickly by further decreases 
but even the modest reduction will be enough to prompt 
reductions in the prime rate and other business and consumer 
borrowing rates economists predicted 
mortgage rates have already dropped into single digits with 
fixedrate mortgages averaging 982 percent last week according to 
a survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
some economists forecast that rates could drop by another 
onehalf percentage point by the end of the year in response to the 
feds easier credit moves

the us sentencing commission has unveiled 
draft guidelines for punishing corporate wrongdoers that would 
dramatically increase fines for companies convicted of federal 
crimes 
the draft guidelines published wednesday in the federal 
register contain elaborate formulas for calculating the fines that 
companies would be required to pay for a variety of federal crimes 
only 350 companies mostly small are convicted of federal 
crimes each year 
but in recent years large frauds committed by big corporations 
have increased the average fine paid by companies from 48000 
between 1984 and 1987 to 195000 last year according to studies 
performed by the commission 
there is no question this is a dramatic increase in criminal 
fines said mark cohen an assistant professor of management at 
vanderbilt university and former staff member of the sentencing 
commission who studied corporate fines 
cohen said his study of fines suggests that currently if you 
impose a 1 harm youll pay 20 cents to a dollar in criminal 
fines 
but under these guidelines it looks like the criminal penalty 
will be between two and three times the harm that could be as much 
as a tenfold increase over current practice 
the commision said in a draft policy statement that punishment 
of a convicted organization will provide a strong incentive for 
owners and managers of organizations to strengthen internal 
mechanisms for preventing officers and employees from committing 
crimes and for detecting and punishing such crimes that are 
committed 
the proposed guidelines which contain two basic options for 
calculating fines will be open for public comment until feb 15 
the commission which was created by congress in 1987 will submit 
final guidelines to lawmakers on may 1 1990 
the guidelines would become law unless congress enacts 
legislation overturning or altering them 
the new guidelines contain a number of factors that must be 
taken into account when calculating how much money a company would 
be fined 
aggravating factors include whether top executives aided or 
condoned the crimes or whether these officials tried to block a 
government investigation 
an offense that presented a substantial risk to the continued 
existence of a financial or consumer market would also expose a 
company to additional fines 
fines would be reduced for mitigating factors such as a 
reasonable lack of knowledge of the crimes by highlevel executives 
in the case of companies found to be created solely to perform 
criminal activity the fine should be large enough to divest the 
firm of its assets according to the proposal 
two years ago the sentencing guidelines for individual 
defendants took effect they require courts to calculate the 
sentences according to elaborate formulas taking into account 
criminal history and the circumstances of the crime

the new capital standards were announced monday by the office of 
thrift supervision created by the savings and loan bailout law 
passed by congress last summer the agency announced guidelines 
wednesday for thrifts unable to meet the standards 
those institutions that will fall below the new standards on 
dec 7 must submit an acceptable capital plan to raise their 
capital levels or be subjected to operating restrictions including 
growth and capital distribution limitations and regulatory 
approvals of changes in management and the board of directors 
the ots said 
it said the plan must be submitted to the ots district director 
within 60 days of nov 7 the day the standards became effective 
institutions that subsequently fail to meet the requirements will 
have 60 days after falling out of compliance to file plans 
the plans must show what actions the institutions will take to 
meet the new standards no later than dec 31 1994 
the ots has said that as many as 800 thrifts with assets 
totaling 600 billion would not be able to meet the standards 
which are intended to provide a bigger cushion of capital to absorb 
losses before an institution fails and its deposits become eligible 
for federal insurance coverage 
anticipating the new standards many thrifts have been selling 
assets and reducing their size recently 
thrifts may apply for exemptions from capital directives or from 
specific sanctions or penalties imposed for failing to meet their 
capital standards the guidelines said such requests must be 
accompanied by acceptable capital plans demonstrating that the 
standards can be met 
in addition the plans must 
demonstrate that the thrifts increases in capital will meet or 
exceed interim targets for capital levels and can be measured on a 
quarterly basis 
set forth the manner and timing in which capital increases will 
be achieved

nissan motor corps ads for its new 
infiniti models will retain their focus on fuzzy images of nature 
such as ponds of pensive trout and gentle cloudbursts rather than 
the highperformance luxury cars 
there are more rocks and pussywillows to come william 
bruce nissans general manager for the infiniti line said at a 
ceremony wednesday marking the day the japanese cars officially 
went on sale 
infiniti has two models the q45 fullsize fourdoor sedan with 
a base price of 38000 and the m30 sports coupe at 23500 
expensive but less costly than european luxury cars 
nissan officials such as bruce believe the cars are so good that 
they along with toyota motor corps new lexus luxury line will 
force other prestige automakers to offer incentives to buyers or 
cut prices as bmw and jaguar already have done 
but infinitis ads have avoided direct shots of the cars 
instead they softfocus on falling rain birds in flight crashing 
waves hay fields and rock outcroppings giving just a passing 
glimpse of the cars 
a meditative text accompanies the moody images the idea is to 
pique buyers interest and get them into showrooms 
enough already many observers say 
what theyve clearly been trying to do is develop an 
anticipation for the vehicle itself and theyre creating a mystery 
about it said arvid jouppi an auto analyst with keane 
securities in chicago 
but he said that now that the car is on sale sooner or later 
theyve got to bring it out in the ads 
you may talk to the girl on the phone but you dont propose 
to her that way some things you need to do face to face jouppi 
said 
ronald glantz an analyst with montgomery securities in san 
francisco said anyone prepared to pay for a luxury car will take 
the time to compare the infiniti to the lexus and other cars 
regardless of what ads are like 
im not enough of an advertising expert to say whether this 
feelgood advertising will work glantz said but this is not 
like getting joe sixpack to stir from his television the guy who 
is going to spend 40000 is going to check it out 
lexus whose models list for 2000 to 3000 less than 
infinitis was introduced sept 1 through oct 31 its dealers 
sold just under 8000 cars about what lexus predicted 
infiniti officials have avoided sales projections however and 
there are just 50 infiniti dealers in 30 markets in the country 
washington dc and philadelphia are among the areas without 
dealers 
bruce said the company had been extremely selective 
intentionally starting slowly to ensure quality service and 
workmanship but he predicted infiniti would have 100 dealers 
within a year and up to 165 in five years 
as for when tv watchers will get more than just a glance of the 
cars he said surveys of car buyers and dealers would be the 
determining factor 
well let the market reaction tell us what to do lets watch 
the next three or four months and see how the market reacts and 
well go from there

major airlines officials are raising strong 
objections to congressional moves to reimpose government control 
over their industry 
a senate subcommittee heard testimony wednesday on legislation 
that would alter several practices sponsors say have driven small 
airlines out of business and kept others from starting up 
calling for even stronger action sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio introduced the airline reregulation act that would allow 
the government once again to regulate fares routes and services 
the industry was deregulated by congress in 1978 
i dont know if complete reregulation is the answer 
metzenbaum said but i do know its time we owned up to the fact 
that airline deregulation was a mistake 
metzenbaum appeared as a witness before the senate commerce 
science and transportations aviation subcommittee which was 
discussing an airline competition bill opponents said also would 
bring regulation back 
that legislation sponsored by sens john danforth rmo and 
john mccain rariz would force big airlines to give up their 
computerized reservations systems stop them from booking flights 
on smaller airlines as if they are their own end the selling of 
slots at major airports and strengthen the governments ability to 
increase competition 
instead of a proliferation of choices consumers are 
increasingly faced with little or no choice in airline service 
mccain said 
robert l crandall head of american airlines told the 
committee the proposals would diminish not enhance 
competition 
he acknowledged that computer reservations systems give airlines 
who own them a competitive advantage but he denied this was 
because of anything mechanically built into the systems which are 
provided to travel agents for booking flights 
why should we be deprived of an advantage we have earned 
crandall asked 
he said the government should concentrate on building more 
airports and other facilities to increase competition instead of 
restricting successful airlines 
the message i hear is that we are free to be innovative free 
to risk capital free to compete as long as we lose money 
crandall told the committee if we are successful the rug is 
likely to be pulled out from under us 
james w callison a senior vice president of delta air lines 
said forced divestiture of reservations systems would produce 
increased air fares 
callison said a provision of the bill that would prevent 
airlines from linking up with small commuter airlines would punish 
airlines that have not taken over smaller carriers 
deltas connection carriers operate as independent companies 
not owned by delta and are major examples of small business at its 
best he said 
edward r beauvais chief executive of the small america west 
airlines indicated general support for the bill and suggested it 
also call for an internal revenue service investigation of frequent 
flyer programs 
these programs although quite popular are among the most 
antithetical to the spirit and goals of airline deregulation 
beauvais said 
he noted businesses often pay for the tickets but employees can 
use the frequent flyer tickets without being taxed for the benefit 
the programs do not promote new business they simply allow 
airlines to charge higher prices for the business that they are 
already receiving beauvais said most us airlines including 
america west award flights and other benefits for customers who 
regularly fly with them 
beauvais also proposed that airlines be prohibited from paying 
extra commissions to travel agents who book a high number of 
passengers on carriers whose reservations systems they are using

under the growing threat of an outside takeover 
united airlines pilots are again talking with management and 
possible investors about an employee buyout of the company 
directors of uniteds parent company ual corp have given 
chairman stephen wolf the goahead to explore a deal hank 
krakowski a spokesman for the air line pilots association said 
wednesday 
the pilots in october spearheaded an attempted employee buyout 
of the airline company but the bid failed for lack of financing 
krakowski said the pilots have met with management and the 
union is continuing to explore any and all options in its effort 
to gain employee control of the airline 
all i can say is the pilots are seeking employee ownership 
with the current management team krakowski said he did not 
however exclude an effort with other parties 
investor saul steinberg who was a passive investor in ual and 
recently sold a sizable stake met with pilot representatives 
tuesday and indicated he might participate in a bid under the 
right circumstances the chicago tribune quoted an anonymous 
source as saying 
steinberg last week sought government clearance to acquire more 
than a 15 percent stake in the company 
gus oliver of coniston partners said he is aware that ual 
directors have given wolf the goahead to explore buyout 
possibilities but it doesnt change his goals 
he said there has been no change in our plans to gain 
control of ual weve been talking to all interested parties and 
will continue to do so 
coniston a new york investment group met wednesday with 
representatives of uniteds machinist union 
the meeting in washington was to hear what the group was 
planning for ual said spokesman jim conley of the machinists 
uniteds largest union representing 25000 of its 70000 workers 
he said the union was not seeking to reach any immediate 
agreements with the group which last week announced that it had 
bought up 97 percent of uals stock 
oliver refused to elaborate on the substance of the meeting 
the machinists have opposed the employee ownership plan promoted 
by the pilots and contributed to its collapse in october 
coniston wants to reduce uals board of directors from 16 
members to five three of whom would be coniston principals 
ual spokeswoman sara dornacker declined to comment on the latest 
developments 
directors of ual issued a statement last month indicating the 
board would not consider any offer under 300 a share the 
pershare price that failed in october 
ual stock gained 525 in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading wednesday to 185 a share

a west german court has blocked 
plans by a leading chemical concern hoechst ag to start 
production of insulin with the help of genetic engineering 
an administrative court in the city of kassel issued a temporary 
injunction wednesday saying the giant west german company cannot 
roceed with its plans as long as there is no federal law governing 
gene technology such legislation is not expected to go into effect 
before the start of 1991 
the ruling which reversed an earlier decision sparked concern 
about west germanys ability to compete in the hightechnology 
field of genetic engineering 
the court gave no final verdict on the substance of the case 
based on the suit filed by two citizens in 1985 against the hesse 
state governments license for the insulin project 
the spread of genetic technology is opposed by environmental 
groups and parts of the german general public 
hoechst which is based in frankfurt said it will suspend 
construction on the project for the time being and said it does not 
expect a quick settlement of the dispute 
the company said it views developments with great concern 
because the future of the industrial use of genetic technology in 
germany thus remains in limbo 
hesse state governor walter wallmann said the court verdict 
affects the position of all of west german industry and urged 
federal authorities to speed work on the legislation 
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily newspaer said the 
delay which could last for years is even more painful for the 
company because its competition abroad can meanwhile gain 
experience with the new technology 
the 70millionmark about 38 million hoechst project involves 
making human insulin for diabetics from genetically altered 
bacteria pilot production was due to start early next year 
hoechst currently makes insulin from the pancreas of pigs 
wednesdays court decision can be challenged only in west 
germanys constitutional court hoechst officials headquarters in 
frankfurt declined to say whether they plan an appeal

maker that cut about 5000 workers this year and posted financial 
losses today announced it would lay off 2000 more workers as part 
of a fundamental reordering 
immediate and deliberate action does not call for another 
reorganization richard miller president of the lowellbased 
company said rather it demands a revolution a radical and 
fundamental reordering of the way in which every individual at wang 
follows through on their respective responsibility to our 
customers he said in a news release 
the companys new approach according to miller will eliminate

customers 
we must become increasingly more efficient in the way we 
work miller said

employees will result in a onetime charge of 30 million against 
earnings in the companys second quarter which ends dec 31 
wang last month reported a firstquarter loss of 621 million 
and miller said at the time he expected losses to continue through 
the second quarter but he predicted the company would return to 
profitability by the fourth quarter next june 
wang laboratories earlier this year had cut about 5000 
employees lowering its workforce to approximately 25000 
the hightech industry has suffered other setbacks data general 
corp announced last month it would eliminate 2200 jobs and 
digital equipment corp recently offered voluntary severance to 700 
workers 
to survive and prosper in the maturing market of the next 
decade wang laboratories must acknowledge that our customers are 
our lifeline miller said 
miller said wang would change the way it operates in various 
phases of its business including product development technical 
service support and the process of taking orders for products and

wholesale prices pushed up by the steepest 
increase in food costs in 22 months rose 04 percent in october 
the government reported today 
the increase in the labor departments producer price index was 
markedly smaller than the 09 percent jump in september but was 
still surprisingly high to many economists 
the september and october advances followed rare monthly 
declines in july and august 
prices have been on a roller coaster this year first surging 
ahead and then easing during the summer after food and energy costs 
moderated 
for the first 10 months of the year wholesale prices have been 
rising at an annual rate of 52 percent compared with an increase 
of 4 percent for all of 1988 
food costs rose a steep 14 percent in october following 
declines in three of the four previous months analysts said the 
jump in food costs reflected in part bad weather that affected 
california and florida vegetable crops 
vegetable prices shot up 189 percent other big advances in the 
food category were a 95 percent increase in pork costs a 56 
percent rise in fish prices and a 49 percent increase for fruit 
the overall 14 percent advance in food costs was the biggest 
advance since a 15 percent rise in january 1988 but analysts said 
the onemonth increase in the volatile food category was not 
alarming given the fact that food costs had been falling 
economists said they continued to believe that slower economic 
growth would translate into lower inflationary pressures in the 
months ahead 
assuming that food and energy prices remain relatively stable 
we expect further moderation in prices in 1990 said stacy 
kottman assistant director of economic forecasting at georgia 
state university 
energy costs which had been the driving force behind the 
september spurt in the overall index moderated in october to a 
slight 02 percent increase far below the 65 percent surge in the 
previous month 
gasoline prices were up 23 percent after a 106 percent jump in 
september the cost of natural gas dropped by 25 percent while 
home heating prices fell by 05 percent last month 
wholesale prices excluding energy and food costs were up a 
tiny 01 percent in october many analysts consider this figure a 
better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures 
newcar prices which had also been a major factor in the 
september inflation report fell by 14 percent in october at the 
start of the new model year 
before adjusting for normal seasonal variations the wholesale 
price index stood at 1148 in october this meant that a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods that cost 100 in the base year 
of 1982 would have cost 11480 last month up from a cost of 
10940 a year ago 
many economists are looking for price increases to be moderate 
for the rest of this year and into 1990 as inflation is held in 
check by a slowing economy this forecast is based on a belief that 
there will be no special factors pushing up costs such as the 1988 
drought that caused food prices to soar 
as 1989 began policymakers at the federal reserve were pushing 
interest rates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures 
however they switched tactics in may and started lowering rates 
in an effort to keep the economy from tumbling into a recession 
the latest round of interest rate declines came this week when 
the fed boosted the amount of cash reserves available to the 
banking system this allowed the federal funds rate to fall from 
875 percent to 85 percent this rate which is the interest banks 
charge each other to make overnight loans is a key shortterm 
lending rate which is closely watched for clues to fed policy 
intentions 
the fed action came after weeks of complaints from the bush 
administration that the central bank was moving too slowly to lower 
interest rates and would have to shoulder the blame if the economy 
toppled into a recession 
economists predicted the feds move would translate into lower 
consumer and business loan rates including an expected cut in the 
benchmark prime lending rate from 105 percent down to 10 percent 
the prime rate is used as a base to calculate more than onethird 
of all business and consumer loans

britain today banned milk sales by more than 900 
farms because of leadtainted feed that killed 18 cattle and the 
government blamed the contamination on a criminal conspiracy 
hundreds of dutch farms also were affected after dozens of 
cattle died of lead poisoning 
in brussels european economic community agriculture 
commissioner ray macsharry ordered an immediate investigation into 
the alleged conspiracy that is believed to stretch across several 
eec nations 
macsharry will contact all the relevant authorities in 
britain belgium the netherlands and west germany said an eec 
commission official speaking on condition of anonymity 
british agriculture minister john gummer said a shipment of rice 
bran used as cattle feed started in rangoon burma and was 
contaminated with lead from other cargo aboard the ship on its 
journey to the belgian port of antwerp 
authorities in antwerp diverted the feed to holland for 
destruction he said but instead it passed through several hands 
and was turned into maize pellets that ended up being sold by a 
feed importing company in britain and the netherlands 
there has been a major criminal conspiracy said gummer said 
it has meant that there are 300 farms in holland which are 
under restriction and i have no doubt that by the time we have 
completed the material here during the day we may have as many as 
1000 farms or just over that in britain he said in a british 
broadcasting corp radio interview 
the agriculture ministry said milk from the 940 affected british 
farms mostly in southwest england is being collected separately 
for testing and thousands of gallons have been withheld from public 
sale 
the ministry said milk from 200 farms had been tested and 89 
were found to have milk above the trigger level for concern about 
lead contamination but below the safety level of 200 parts of lead 
per billion 
officials said most of the farms which had received the feed had 
now been traced 
on wednesday gummer urged the european commission to open a 
fullscale inquiry into the alleged conspiracy 
national farmers union deputy president david naish said 
farmers had suffered heavy losses 
there are going to be some very substantial civil claims 
initially against the suppliers of the feed and then going back 
further down the chain he said 
in the hague dutch agriculture ministry spokesman mat thissen 
said that the dutch authorities had thoroughly investigated the 
origin of the tainted rice bran after more several dozen cattle 
died of lead poisoning in the northern netherlands last month 
the feed component was traced to a firm in dronten in the 
central netherlands then to back antwerp and also hamburg 
thissen told the associated press adding that he hoped the inquest 
would be completed by next week 
he disputed part of gummers account saying there was no 
evidence yet indicating that the cattle feed had been shipped to 
the netherlands to be destroyed 
thissen said the dronten firm had exported part of the tainted 
rice bran to britain but he did not know the quantity involved

steve wynn the golden boy of nevada gaming is 
putting the finishing touches on his 630 million mirage resort 
just down the strip from where this citys glitz ignited his 
imagination 37 years ago 
employees began reporting for orientation earlier this month to 
work out the kinks before the doors open to the public nov 22 the 
sugar ray leonardroberto duran fight follows at the resort dec 7 
wynns 30story showplace cost more than 100 times the value of 
the cluster of casinos that dotted the strip when he first visited 
here in 1952 and it has sparked a multibilliondollar building 
boom unprecedented in the citys history 
new resorts are popping out of the desert and renovations and 
expansions are under way at many of the citys older properties 
some operators admit privately theyre fixing up and adding on 
because of the challenge of the 3049room mirage 
wynn 47 is the majority shareholder of golden nugget inc 
which owns the mirage sometimes he refers to the mirage as the 
joint a throwback to the jargon of another era when his father 
michael dreamed of opening a bingo parlor in this growing gaming 
town 
other times he refers to the mirage as an experience or a 
wonderment the world will flock to see 
guests arrive via a palmlined entry that features a 54foot 
volcano three lagoons and waterfalls hardly your typical desert 
environment the lagoons and waterfalls are fed by pipes that pump 
100000 gallons of water a minute 
valets whisk arriving cars into a labyrinth of tunnels under the 
resort 
just like a james bond movie huh wynn joked as his 
mercedes whipped along the underground maze during a preopening 
tour 
the top five floors of the 30story resort contain 260 penthouse 
suites for coveted casino customers and for his stratosphere 
players wynn has six groundlevel private bungalows complete with 
their own swimming pools 
the swimming pool is a quartermile around and nearby is a 
dolphin habitat approved by the national marine fisheries service 
registering guests will find themselves facing a giant fish tank 
whose inhabitants include 4foot sharks 
the sharks will of course prompt a lot of bad jokes about 
what will happen if you dont pay your markers wynn laughed 
the casino covers the space of two football fields but will be 
broken up by thatched huts containing such operations as the cage 
the pit and a bar to make the area appear more intimate 
in one area of the casino customers can play nickel slots and 
order pizza or pasta nearby a small room provides 
stratosphere customers their own private casino with 1000 
chips the smallest available 
well let you gamble there as high as youve got the nerve 
wynn promised 
the hotels 1500seat showroom will feature illusionists 
siegfried and roy who returned earlier this month from a tour of 
japan and a stint at radio city music hall in new york city 
the volcano and waterfalls in front of the mirage are designed 
to block the view of other resorts across the strip 
im burned out on neon said wynn whose golden nugget hotel 
in downtowns glitter gulch is also void of any neon i think 
its cheap to me neon is yesterday las vegas 
it was the neon that captivated wynn in 1952 when he came to las 
vegas with his father who hoped to start a bingo parlor in the 
city oldtime gaming figures blocked the elder wynn sending him 
and his son home to maryland nursing busted dreams 
wynn later returned to las vegas bought an interest in the 
frontier hotel then bought stock in the golden nugget and 
eventually took control of the nugget 
wynn is confident his new property will be profitable despite 
the high cost saying it can earn the necessary 1 million a day 
wynn said the highrise came in on budget despite some guesswork 
on exotic frills 
what we could not budget intelligently was the atrium the 
volcanoes there was no way of knowing those costs in advance what 
do you do look under the yellow pages for volcanoes 
donald trumps new 1200room tajmahal in atlantic city is 
expected to cost 12 billion when completed next year wynn says 
his mirage would have cost 15 billion to build in atlantic city 
or new york city where construction costs are higher 
wynn whos had offandon battles with trump said he wants to 
be known as a hotel operator not the star 
i want people to say that steve wynn built the best hotel in 
the world i dont want to say i own it i want to be the guy that 
designed it thats my edge

pressure on takeover stocks which had been driving the market 
higher 
separately bear stearns amp co has begun charging customers a 
handling fee on all individual stock and bond trades the firm 
is among the last of the major brokerages to do so and a bear 
stearns spokesman indicated that the firm has not raised its

former beatles paul mccartney george 
harrison and ringo starr and the wife of the late john lennon have 
settled a series of lawsuits among themselves and their record 
companies ending a decade of legal fights 
the settlements between the members of the group lennons widow 
yoko ono apple records emi records and capital records were 
announced wednesday in a statement by bhaskar menon the chairman 
of emi music worldwide and capitolemi music inc 
as part of the agreement neither side commented about the 
settlements and terms were sealed 
the parties have agreed as a specific term of the settlement 
that neither they nor their representatives or advisors will be 
permitted to make any comment or statement regarding the settlement 
other than it appears in this announcement menon said in the 
statement 
the beatles one of the most popular and prolific bands in the 
history of rocknroll disbanded in 1970 
in the formal statement menon praised the groups contribution 
to music 
the beatles recordings are a unique legacy in the history of 
popular music which emi has been privileged to represent since 
1962 menon said 
we are most delighted to have resolved all the differences 
which arose between us in recent years and look forward to the 
continuation of our long standing and close relationship with the 
artists and apple 
the beatles apple records filed its first suit in 1979 against 
emi and its american subsidiary capitol records alleging the 
company underpaid royalties by not reporting the sale of 19 million 
records from 1969 to 1979 the group sought 50 million in damages 
apple also sued emi in 1987 alleging it was delaying a release 
of beatles material on compact discs and also challenged royalty 
rates paid to individual group members 
if they have indeed come to the end of the long and winding 
road its wonderful said elliot mintz a spokesman for ono 
its such a confusing myriad of issues that even people who have 
been close to the principals have a difficult time grasping it 
a number of attorneys on both sides of the atlantic have 
probably put their children through college on this mintz said

price index of finished goods rose 04 percent in october a bit 
more than had been expected 
excluding food and energy prices that are subject to large 
fluctuations from month to month however the increase was 01 
percent 
analysts said those figures provided fresh support for hopes 
that inflationary pressures would remain subdued enough to keep 
interest rates from rising significantly and allow for continued 
economic growth

a pair of ibm employees who thought they 
had pulled off an undetectable theft were arrested in a parking lot 
trying to peddle discount computer parts to undercover officers 
jay robert wetterer 36 and steven mark shoeppe 34 both of 
boca raton were held thursday at the manatee county jail on 10 
million bail each 
circuit judge george brown said the high bond was justified by 
the value of the stolen goods and the suspects extensive 
outofstate contacts 
the theft of 18 million in computer chips and other parts 
one of the biggest ever at international business machines corp 
began when wetterer and shoeppe tried to take advantage of a glitch 
in inventory records said sam jones spokesman for the tampa bay 
region of the florida department of law enforcement 
wetterer a senior buyer who worked for ibm for eight years and 
shoeppe a cost engineer for 10 years allegedly took the chips and 
tried to sell them at a reduced price jones said 
after lengthy negotiations state undercover agents arranged to 
buy 910 parts from wetterer and shoeppe for 300000 in the 
sarasota parking lot authorities said 
each faces two counts each of dealing in stolen property grand 
larceny grand theft and crimes against computers 
in june 1988 ibm officials announced they were moving the 
companys personal computer manufacturing plant from boca raton to 
raleigh nc 
during the relocation about 1300 memoryboosting computer 
parts were incorrectly labeled and sent to a repackaging plant in 
west palm beach 
so the officials from the west palm beach office said get a 
hold of our man wetterer and let him straighten it out jones 
said 
apparently wetterer felt everything was so busy that no one 
would notice them missing jones said not only would the 
company not know they were missing they would not be able to trace 
them

two major british banks lloyds bank plc and 
national westminster bank plc on thursday announced they were 
increasing their reserves to cover potential losses on loans made 
to developing countries 
lloyds bank said it was increasing specific provisions for loans 
made to problem countries by the equivalent of 19 billion to 
counter what it called a continued deterioration in the 
servicing of the debt 
later national westminster bank announced it added a further 
914 million to its specific provisions for lending to 27 countries 
with repayment difficulties 
in the third quarter major us banks took similar measures to 
bolster their protection against losses amid widespread perception 
that economic and political difficulties in the third world might 
make it impossible for countries to repay their debt 
the additional provisions will lift lloyds cover on medium and 
longterm debt to problem countries to 85 percent of its 57 
billion exposure 
natwest said the new provisions would raise its overall level of 
cover on its 35 billion of exposure to 72 percent

the president of wang laboratories inc declaring 
computers no longer represent a boom industry announced thursday 
his company would undergo a fundamental reordering and cut 
2000 more workers from its payroll 
the cutback was the latest sign of a hightech industry slowdown 
that has contributed to a softening of the regions economy 
some fundamental things are happening that will drive all 
computer companies to do things differently or they will fail 
wang president richard miller said 
miller was named president of wang in august succeeding 
frederick wang who had been ousted from the job by an wang his 
father company founder and chairman 
prior to thursdays announcement the company already had cut 
about 5000 jobs this year and announced plans to sell 200 million 
in assets furthermore wang reported a first quarter loss of 621 
million in the first quarter that ended sept 30 and miller 
predicted more losses for the second quarter 
miller said under the companys new approach wang will cut its 
bureaucracy to get in closer touch with the needs of its customers 
we are eliminating the layers between the field and 
laboratory he said we will eliminate entire functions 
functions that i view as stifling 
for example he said the companys product development programs 
often duplicate efforts with no single group taking 
responsibility as a result products often have been introduced 
late 
but miller said departments will be combined leading to a 
streamlined approach 
the reorganization of the company will mean the loss of about 
2000 by jan 1 lowering the wang workforce to just over 22000 
he said 
about 1000 of the layoffs will occur in massachusetts mostly 
at the companys headquarters in lowell with the rest being 
scattered around the world 
a severance package for these employees will result in a onetime 
charge of 30 million in the companys second quarter which ends 
dec 31 
miller said the restructuring announced thursday would cut 
annual costs by about 115 million but he stressed that the 
company was not simply calculating how much needed to be cut in 
order to be profitable 
the massachusetts hightech industry has suffered other 
setbacks data general corp announced last month it would 
eliminate 2200 jobs and digital equipment corp recently offered 
voluntary severance to 700 workers 
i think restructuring is becoming a common word in this 
industry miller said 
miller said much of wangs bureaucracy grew while the hightech 
industry was booming but now the industry has reached a 
maturing stage with slower growth he said 
the bureaucracy just built up because of the luxury of very 
big margins in a high growth industry he said 
but while miller pointed to the fluctuations in the computer 
industry for many of his companys problems analysts said some of 
the trouble particularly poor customer service has been unique 
to wang 
they have had this problem with service and support for a long 
time said steven wendler an analyst with gartner group inc in 
stamford conn rick miller is a breath of fresh air 
also wendler said after the company completes the costcutting 
measures the hemorrhaging financially will stop 
a lot of wang customers have the shakes right now he said 
george elling an analyst with merrill lynch pierce fenner and 
smith inc in new york said during the 1970s and early 1980s wang 
did not pay attention to customer service because it became 
confident as a leader in word processing equipment 
they had something everyone wanted he said people were 
willing to put up with poorer service 
wang was too slow to recognize they needed to change he 
said 
part of the change miller said will include more focus on 
software and other computer applications 
most customers are not crying for new technology he said 
they are crying for new applications of technology

the government said thursday it would withdraw 
nuclear plants from the planned privatization of the nations 
electricity industry 
energy secretary john wakeham speaking in the house of commons 
said the move was necessary to ensure the public sale of the 
industry is held before the next national elections which must be 
called by mid1992 
wakeham said high costs associated with nuclear energy also were 
a key factor in the decision to keep the plants under government 
control 
the electricity privatization which had been expected to raise 
up to 43 billion would be the largest yet under prime minister 
margaret thatchers successful program 
since the privatization program began the government has sold 
billions of dollars worth of stateowned companies including 
jaguar plc and british airways plc to promote capitalism 
but the electricity sale and the planned selloff of britains 
water industry are highly controversial opponents say such vital 
utilities particularly nuclear plants should stay in state hands 
for security reasons 
britains 18 existing nuclear plants will be placed under the 
control of a governmentowned company after the government 
privatizes their current parent the central electricity generating 
board wakeham said 
the overall plan involves breaking up the central electricity 
generating board into privately held generating companies called 
national power and power gen and into a single distribution company 
called national grid co

air canadas president on thursday argued for 
freer airline travel in canada and the united states saying it 
should be liberalized in the same way as trade between the two 
nations 
wed like to have a greater presence here in north america 
said pierre jeanniot president and chief executive officer of 
canadas largest airline lets not exclude air travel out of 
free trade we should work towards integrating this air market 
air travel was excluded from the historic freetrade agreement 
between the united states and canada which took effect at the 
beginning of this year 
jeanniot said canadian airlines should be given rights of 
cabotage in the united states and us carriers should be accorded 
the same rights in canada under cabotage which is not currently 
allowed airlines would be permitted to carry passengers between 
two cities within a foreign country 
air canada would be able to fly for example between boston and 
chicago or atlanta and san francisco while now it can only operate 
between those cities and canadian destinations likewise a us 
carrier such as american airlines or usair could carry canadian 
passengers between montreal and toronto 
other airline executives such as texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo have recently advocated cabotage for us and european 
carriers to help cope with the growing globalization of world air 
travel 
jeanniot speaking to a small group of reporters in new york 
said the freer uscanada air ties could become part of a wider 
liberalization including european and asian airlines 
if we the united states and canada cant bring it about 
whats the hope for the rest of the world he asked 
jeanniot suggested that to alleviate government fears the 
granting of cabotage rights by the two countries could be started 
on a limited basis perhaps as an experiment for a year us and 
canadian airlines could start by flying between foreign cities from 
which they already operate he said 
i dont want to be united airlines i dont want to fly 
everywhere in north america he said 
while the canadian government has shown itself to be quite 
progressive about the issue of cabotage the bush administration 
appears to be concerned about potential internal competition from 
lowcost asian airlines jeanniot said

as takeovers and expansion attempts make cash 
flow even more important to airline executives leaders of the 
association of flight attendants tried thursday to come up with a 
strategy to secure higher pay and job security for their members 
susan bianchisand president of the 27000member union said 
its board of directors is focusing on shortrange planning because 
of what is happening in the airline industry 
recent events include ual corp parent of united airlines 
pursuing a buyout or recapitalization of the nations 
secondlargest carrier eastern airlines struggling to make a 
comeback in the face of an eightmonthold strike and a number of 
airlines including united battling to increase service to europe 
and asia 
we will be going to the table with newer and stronger 
proposals for job security said ms bianchisand whose union 
represents flight attendants on 18 airlines including united we 
will want guarantees that the contract stays intact if a company is 
bought 
flight attendants pay has fallen at carriers that have been 
hard pressed by competition she noted 
in recent years attendants have accepted pay cuts of as much as 
20 percent to help carriers such as republic airlines western 
airlines and braniff inc to survive republic and western have 
since been merged into larger carriers while braniff recently 
filed for bankruptcy reorganization for the second time in seven 
years 
also forcing down salaries has been twotier wage scales with 
new flight attendants accepting starting salaries far below those 
given their senior colleagues 
jack hunter an airline analyst for howe barnes investments inc 
in chicago noted that salary for bscale attendants is 950 a 
month and that most contracts call for flight attendants to remain 
at the lower scale for five years 
the attendants will be trying to cut the b scale from five 
years to three years in future negotiations hunter said 
but that will be a difficult task because of airline expansion 
plans and takeover activity he said 
last year most major airlines had strong profits with 
dallasbased american airlines showing a 476 million profit and 
chicagobased united 372 million 
the airlines are trying to cut their costs hunter said 
and they think that the only way they can keep expanding is 
buying new airplanes and the only way they can do that is a strong 
cash flow 
ms bianchisand said her washington dcbased union also will 
emphasize the issue of flight attendant health in future 
negotiations with the carriers 
there are issues of reproductive concerns because of 
radioactive cargo and cabin air quality apart from the smoking 
issue she said 
fumes are generated by cabin materials ms bianchisand said 
and flight attendants are plagued by back problems caused by 
pushing food carts that weigh more than 200 pounds 
perhaps one of the most difficult tasks for the union is 
reaching a contract with united for its 14000 flight attendants 
following the failure of a 675 billion takeover effort by 
uniteds top management its pilots union and british airways plc 
the attendants demanded a resumption of the federal mediation that 
was suspended in august due to the buyout efforts 
uniteds flight attendants joined the buyout bid in its latter 
stages a move ms bianchisand described as primarily a protective 
strategy 
we felt it was better to be part of the process instead of 
letting someone else determine the fate of the airline she said 
resuming contract talks could lead to a walkout if the 
negotiations are as unsuccessful as they have been for the past two 
years union officials say 
they had enormous demands for concessions that did not fit 
reality said ms bianchisand they were seeking work rule and 
benefit concessions that were not acceptable to membership 
hunter says he believes flight attendants negotiators will find 
their work more difficult as airlines continue to cut costs to 
maximize profits 
in the future you will see a situation of 10year contracts 
for flight attendants he said 
attendants will be allowed to work 10 years only there will 
no longer be attendants working for years beyond that the unions 
will fight that hard

board reported thursday

difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the growth rate in m2 over the past 52 weeks has been 40 
percent which is within the feds target range of 3 percent to 7 
percent the growth rate in m3 over the same period has been 40

pacificorp president am gleason shrugs 
off the suggestion that his companys 17 billion bid for arizona 
public service co reflects an aggressive campaign to acquire 
electric utilities across the west 
i guess we dont consider ourselves aggressive we consider 
ourselves people who are willing to act on logical opportunities 
gleason said thursday a day pacificorp offered to buy arizonas 
largest utility from troubled pinnacle west capital corp 
pacificorp the parent company of pacific power and utah power 
already is the thirdlargest utility in the west serving 12 
million electric customers in seven western states 
acquisition of arizona public service would give it some 18 
million electric customers in eight states and annual revenue from 
electrical operations of about 36 billion 
pacificorp still would fall far short of the electric revenue 
generated by the wests two largest utilities southern california 
edison co of rosemead calif and pacific gas and electric co of 
san francisco 
the move to acquire arizona public service comes less than a 
year after pacificorps successful 17month campaign to acquire 
utah power it is the latest in a long line of carefully considered 
acquisitions that have built pacificorp into a 35 billion company 
over the last 35 years 
with the acquisition of utah power pacificorp doubled its 
electrical revenues and customer base pushing earnings from 
electrical operations to 73 percent of its 35 billion overall 
revenue the balance of pacificorps earnings come from nerco inc 
a mining and development company pacific telecom inc a telephone 
company and pacificorp financial services inc 
profitable arizona public service attracted the attention of 
pacificorp executives when pinnacle west announced it might file 
for bankruptcy because of losses from its merabank subsidiary 
in announcing the cash offer gleason said acquisition of 
arizona public service would broaden the benefits realized by 
customers and shareholders in the acquisition of utah power 
pacific power would furnish power to meet peak demand in the 
summer in the southwest and arizona public service would do the 
same in the winter when demand peaks in the northwest gleason 
said 
with the cost of constructing new power plants sky high he 
said the deal would create the equivalent of a major generating 
plant 
pacificorps history of acquisition and diversification dates to 
1954 when pacific power amp light cos president paul b mckee 
engineered the acquisition of mountain states power co the deal 
gave pacific power more customers in western oregon outside the 
portland area along with new customers in montana and northern 
idaho 
in 1961 a merger with california oregon power co doubled 
pacific powers electrical business again 
meanwhile the company built a business from the two small 
telephone companies it acquired along with mountain states 
what we did in the area of diversification was not set out to 
diversify but rather we took assets that we had within the 
enterprise and built on them gleason said 
in the 1954 electric merger we acquired two small telephone 
properties we used them as the growth vehicle to build pacific 
telecom 
by the mid70s he said we had made coal sales from our 
coal holdings which we originally acquired for power plant 
purposes we ended up with more proven reserves than we needed for 
power plant purposes so we started selling coal so nerco then 
grew out of that coal sales activity and our ability to mine coal 
for our own purposes 
pacificorp relies on coal for 65 percent of its electrical 
generating capacity with hydroelectric power providing 15 percent 
a merger with arizona public service would reduce pacficorps 
dependence on coal and hydroelectric power but increase its 
reliance on nuclear power from about 03 percent to nearly 10 
percent 
the deal also would position pacificorp to serve lucrative 
markets in the southwest said arnold belosic an analyst with 
bear stearns cos inc in new york 
belosic said the key to success in electric utilities is 
expanding generating capacity without spending enormous amounts of 
money on new plant construction 
pacificorp simply sees the arizona public service deal as an 
opportunity the company could not pass up gleason said 
it developed we felt it had value so we reacted he said

braniff inc may reactivate some of the 
beleagured carriers grounded fleet while continuing to seek a 
buyer a company official said thursday 
a skeletal group of executives are considering expanding the 
orlandobased carriers charter services leasing some of its 
aircraft or establishing some kind of maintenance operation said 
tom volz senior vice president for marketing 
were formulating a realistic business plan said volz 
braniff dismissed most of its remaining 1800 employees after 
shutting down its 46 daily flight schedule shortly after midnight 
monday 
after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection sept 28 the 
carrier drastically cut back flights and laid off nearly 2900 
workers 
volz said 200 to 300 employees were still working thursday 
including some 50 administrative people in orlando and more than 
150 in an accounting department in dallas the carriers former 
headquarters 
braniff chairman william g mcgee and chief financial officer w 
howard mackinnon have been trying to negotiate a possible 100 
million sale to investors led by securities expert john latshaw of 
kansas city company officials thursday declined to give the 
progress of the talks 
there seems to be continued interest said volz 
he said he had no knowledge at this time of any other action 
on a possible buyout or other shortterm operations plan 
braniff which was losing about 15 million a week before 
filing for bankruptcy already operates charters out of the 
bahamas salt lake city and dallas 
company officials are also trying to determine its work force 
needs volz said 
we hope to have some answers by early next week on those 
questions he said

the managing director of the international 
monetary fund said thursday he is optimistic about mexicos ability 
to pay some of its debt mainly because of his faith in the program 
under which the size of the countrys debt is being reduced 
michel camdessus said the socalled brady plan to reduce the 
debt of third world nations is working albeit slowly 
for mexico a committee representing more than 400 banks was 
formed to deal with 52 billion of that countrys debt the banks 
were given a choice of reducing the total reducing interest rates 
making new loans or some combination of the three 
as far as mexico is concerned i am optimistic of their 
ability camdessus told reporters not only because the answer 
of the banks is positive in general but because the program is so 
highquality and because the program is being implemented 
thoughtfully 
camdessus who was visiting atlanta to speak at a private dinner 
held by the federal reserve bank of atlanta and to meet with former 
president jimmy carter defended the debt reduction program devised 
by us treasury secretary nicholas f brady and urged critics to 
give it time to work 
i think the brady plan is an extremely important and positive 
part of the debt strategy he said it is just starting 
working it remains to be seen if it will be a full success or a 
partial one 
what i have seen so far is quite encouraging said 
camdessus whose organization is funded by 152 industrialized 
nations 
for the strategy to work he said it will take full cooperation 
from commercial banks creditor countries and the imf 
camdessus said he was opposed to tinkering with the brady plan 
and disagreed with a banking group that on wednesday called on 
creditor governments to reduce debts owed them by middle income 
debtor nations 
horst schulmann head of the institute of international finance 
said creditor governments should negotiate delays in repayments of 
loans owed to them stretching them out beyond 10 years 
schulmann whose organization represents 150 banks in the united 
states japan and western europe said such help has been given to 
the poorest nations and now should be extended to others 
said camdessus im not in favor of a permanent process of 
change of the strategy i understand very well the very good 
intention and probably the good analytical reasons of mr schulmann 
but we have just launched a few months ago the brady strategy 
were just in the process of implementing that 
to rethink that strategy now he said would be the most 
efficient way of organizing its failure 
in remarks prepared for his thursday night speech camdessus 
stressed the importance of reducing us inflation and increasing 
the nations savings rate 
the world economy can only take full advantage of the 
increased sense of international responsibility among major 
industrial countries if the united states maintains its commitment 
to play its part in fostering conditions favorable to worldwide 
economic prosperity he said

trans world airlines inc said thursday it lost 
299 million in its third fiscal quarter citing higher interest 
expenses associated with the privatization of the carrier last year 
and higher operating costs 
twa which is owned by takeover specialist carl icahn and based 
in this new york suburb said its loss for the three months ended 
sept 30 contrasted with a profit of 88 million for the quarter a 
year earlier 
the results a year ago included a onetime gain of an 
unspecified amount from litigation between twa and the estate of 
the late howard hughes a previous owner the latest figures fail 
to reflect about 98 million in unrealized gains in twas 
investment portfolio the airline said 
revenue in the quarter was virually unchanged at 127 billion 
the nations sixthlargest carrier said its operating profit 
tumbled to 607 million in the latest quarter from 141 million a 
year earlier 
it said its operating expenses climbed to 121 billion from 
113 billion because of the expiration of concessions previously 
granted by the machinists union general salary increases fuel 
price increases and increased costs due to improvements in 
transatlantic service 
for the first nine months of the fiscal year twa said it lost 
1173 million in contrast to a profit of 1327 million a year 
earlier 
ninemonth revenue rose 4 percent to 348 billion from 333 
billion a year earlier 
though twa is privately owned it reports its earnings because 
it has publicly traded bonds

allegheny international inc on thursday 
scrapped its latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection after 
wells fargo bank withdrew its commitment to provide 400 million in 
financing 
the smallappliance maker said at a hearing in us bankruptcy 
court it would revert to a previously filed backup plan that would 
repay virtually all creditors in new stock 
us bankruptcy judge joseph l cosetti pledged to force lawyers 
to work through the weekend to get an amended form of the stock 
plan ready for a vote by creditors even if no alternative source of 
bank financing can be found quickly 
meanwhile the pittsburgh press reported thursday that a group 
that reportedly included shaving king victor kiam has offered to 
buy allegheny for 6838 million 
kiam would become the new chief executive under the proposal 
made by japonica partners a new york investment firm sources 
familiar with the deal told the press 
japonica made an offer for allegheny in july and put more 
substance behind the bid wednesday in a letter to alleghenys 
board the july offer gave no indication of how the bid would be 
financed or how the reorganized company would be operated 
at thursdays hearing lawyers for allegheny and its major 
creditors said they did not put much credence in the japonica 
proposal bruce mccullough a lawyer for allegheny said the 
companys board is not going to waste a lot of time on it 
cosetti called japonicas offer almost impertinent and said 
it would not hold up consideration of managements newest plan 
the skepticism stems from doubts about whether japonica could 
raise the money it says it is willing to pay for allegheny 
japonica made its offer in conjunction with steinhardt partners 
a new york money management firm japonica said it was confident of 
lining up financing from several banks none of which was 
identified 
japonica contended its bid is more sensibly financed than 
allegheny managements plan all but 53 million of the 6838 
million price would be paid in cash unlike alleghenys latest 
plan japonicas would not use highyield highrisk debt 
securities known as junk bonds 
on a different front kiam remington products president and 
pitchman has recently worked on a possible bid for allegheny in 
conjunction with the equity committee in the companys bankruptcy 
case that effort is not related to japonicas offer according to 
gary blu the lead lawyer for the equity committee 
kiam was out of town thursday and not immediately available for 
comment his secretary said 
wells fargo previously expressed concern that the management 
plan contained too little equity but it had given no indication it 
would withdraw its financing 
allegheny has been operating under chapter 11 federal bankruptcy 
protection since february 1988 
last month it filed two alternate plans to emerge from 
bankruptcy the company has filed several plans in its efforts to 
reorganize but has met consistent opposition from creditors and 
shareholders its debts currently total about 500 million

the red cross he said 
eastern workers have been on strike since march sending the 
company into chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization

paul volcker former chairman of the 
federal reserve board said he doesnt foresee a recession in the 
near future but warned that americans should reexamine their 
habits of overspending and dependence on foreign capital 
volcker who oversaw the nations monetary policy under the 
carter and reagan administrations pointed to the recent japanese 
acquisitions of columbia pictures and firestone tire as warning 
signals 
japan has been lending us a lot of money and buying a lot of 
our companies volcker said it has financed a large part of 
our deficit it has also permitted our consumption to proceed 
volcker now chairman of the james t wolfensohn investment 
banking firm was in birmingham to speak at birminghamsouthern 
college 
volcker said the nations economy will likely continue its 
current sevenyear expansion the longest peacetime growth period 
he noted that the unemployment rate has hit a 15year low prices 
are stable and inflation is remaining steady at about 4 percent 
the chances are good in fact that we will avoid a recession 
in the next year and if we play our cards right we may have an 
expansion for years to come volcker said 
despite his optimistic forecast the former policymaker warned 
that the economys builtin risks the federal and trade deficits 
reliance on foreign capital and a low savings rate continue to 
threaten growth 
volcker said the stock market crash of oct 19 1987 was a sign 
of problems in the economic system but that investors did not heed 
the warning and continue to shrug off the twin deficits 
with a higher savings rate americans could finance more of the 
economy themselves he said 
there are more risks than usual in our economy he said 
they are pretty well known

star tribune newsroom employees approved a 
sixyear contract wednesday night hours after their second strike 
deadline in as many days but union leaders could find little 
positive to say about the deal 
guild chairwoman margaret zack said the vote was 23370 
a lack of support from other unions at plant helped spur the 
reluctant membership to accept the contract after several hours of 
discussion union leaders said 
its a bad deal its a rotten deal said jay weiner vice 
chairman of the negotiating committee but guild members feared 
they would be replaced in a prolonged strike he said 
we could have struck but without the other unions it would 
have been extremely difficult said strike coordinator steve 
brandt who characterized the contract as punitive 
it simply doesnt meet the needs of people trying to keep 
their standard of living intact he said 
star tribune spokeswoman bette fenton said the newspaper was 
back to work as usual 
we had hoped from the very beginning that we were able to 
reach a fair and equitable settlement and were pleased that weve 
done that she said 
brandt said the contract covers six years and includes bonuses 
in each of the first three years and pay raises of 32 percent in 
the fourth year 31 percent in the fifth year and 30 percent in 
the sixth year 
for top scale reporters photographers copy editors and 
district circulation managers the bonuses would be 2000 in the 
first year 1750 in the second and 1500 in the third brandt 
said 
the pay raises for topscale employees would amount to about 26 
a week in each of the last three years he said weiner said the 
package averages out to a 16 percent annual increase in pay scales 
over six years he called it worse by far than the recent deal 
struck by guild employees at the st paul pioneer press dispatch 
supervisors worked on scaleddown editions of thursdays paper 
until union members returned at about 1015 pm brandt said 
the unions original strike deadline was 4 pm tuesday but 
that was extended to 4 pm wednesday as the deadline passed 
union negotiators said they were waiting for the companys response 
to a new offer they had made 
other provisions of the tentative pact as described by brandt 
include 
six employees would be removed from guild jurisdiction rather 
than the 26 originally proposed by the company 
mileage would increase 1 cent a mile to 22 cents the guild 
had sought an increase to 28 cents 
union members have been working without a contract since their 
threeyear pact expired july 31 the minneapolis unit covers about 
300 newsroom employees and about 60 circulation and promotion 
workers 
under the old contract top minimum weekly salaries for star 
tribune guild members have been 31550 for copy aides 74250 for 
circulation district managers 812 for reporters photographers 
copy editors and promotion personnel and 89575 for some editors 
the guild said
