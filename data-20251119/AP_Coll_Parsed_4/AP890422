responding to demands in parliament for curbs on 
press intrusions into private lives mainly by britains racy 
tabloid newspapers the government on friday announced an 
independent review panel and told editors to clean up their act 
home office minister timothy renton said the panel would report 
within a year 
editors and publishers of the national press in this country 
are on probation renton told the house of commons they have a 
year or two to clean up their act 
british media freedom meanwhile came under unprecedented 
scrutiny at an international conference on friday spurred by 
charges that prime minister margaret thatchers government has 
undermined the publics right to know 
the announcement in parliament came as the group of editors 
publishers broadcast executives and journalists debated news media 
freedom at a oneday seminar sponsored by the international press 
institute 
the watchdog body which has a membership of 2000 publishers 
and editors in some 60 countries normally focuses attention on 
government harassment of newspapers or journalists in third world 
countries 
political charges that the conservative party government has 
undermined press freedom and complaints about excesses by mass 
circulation newspapers are the two big issues in a growing 
controversy about the news media in britain 
on the political front editors cite a government ban on 
broadcast interviews with the irish republican army farreaching 
official secrets laws and a threeyear court battle over government 
attempts to block publication of spycatcher a retired 
intelligence agents memoirs 
but newspapers have themselves been increasingly criticized for 
sensational stories that boost circulations of the major tabloids 
which each sell more than a million copies a day 
what is disturbing is the fact that the government can get 
away with this without the public caring said max hastings 
editor of londons proconservative daily telegraph 
the british public is disenchanted with the press the chief 
issue is how we raise our standards so that the british public will 
care about the press 
renton announced the press review panel after a right of 
reply bill foundered friday in the commons for lack of government 
backing 
the bill put forward by a rankandfile legislator tony 
worthington sought to empower the government to force newspapers 
to publish corrections of errors 
the bill attracted considerable support from government and 
opposition legislators but renton rejected it on grounds it 
would introduce a measure of government control over the press 
supporters accused the tabloids of what one called replacing 
journalism with voyeurism 
the reporters profession has been infiltrated by a seedy 
stream of rent boys pimps bimbos spurned lovers smear artists 
with grudges prostitutes and perjurers said jonathan aitken a 
rankandfile conservative party legislator this is a cast of 
shame 
apart from racy stories about the private lives of people from 
tv stars to accident victims the tabloids regularly incur the 
wrath of buckingham palace for pursuit of the royal family 
at the seminar an american participant dana bullen director 
of the washingtonbased world press freedom committee contrasted 
british and american treatment of the news media 
where there is an official secrets act here we have a freedom 
of information act said bullen 
andrew neil editor of londons sunday times the topselling 
upmarket weekly in britain led complaints by editors and broadcast 
chiefs about government use of court orders during the controversy 
over spycatcher national newsapers were barred at each stage 
by orders called prior restraints from publishing 
there is a culture in this country against the freedom of the 
press because the government and the judges belong to the same 
club said neil referring to the british establishment we 
must have the freedom to publish and then take the consequences 
in a series of disputes since mrs thatcher won power in 1979 
the government has also clashed with television networks usually 
over features and documentaries involving the outlawed irish 
republican army or the intelligence services 
also media and civil rights groups charge that a bill to reform 
the catchall 1911 official secrets act is inadequate one example 
they cite is the governments refusal to allow civil servants who 
leak classfied information to argue they acted in the national 
interest to expose a government coverup 
earlier friday a british delegate at a a meeting of 35 nations 
to monitor a recent eastwest accord on media freedom said the 
attitude of mrs thatchers government toward the media alarms 
us 
neal acherson a columnist in the observer a liberal london 
weekly said the british government tradition of organized 
unattributable briefings by officials to domestic political 
correspondents conflicted with the eastwest accord 
the accord was signed last january by the 35 nations at the end 
of of the conference on european security and cooperation in vienna

four other announced candidates were removed friday from a ballot 
for the new soviet parliament a colleague reported 
yakunin a russian orthodox priest and the four were blocked 
from the ballot in a central district in moscow on grounds they 
didnt live or work in the district said victor popkov a 
christian activist who attended the district meeting at the zil car 
factory 
soviet election laws have no residency requirements many of 
those already elected to the new congress of peoples deputies were 
selected by organizations they did not belong to or from districts 
where they do not reside 
popkov said about 750 electors were at the district meeting and 
he said they were picked in a crude move on the part of the top 
echelon of the communist party 
he said the head of the central election commission agreed to 
meet saturday with yakunin and the other rejected candidates to 
hear their complaints 
none of the five was allowed to present his platform at the 
meeting and no election commission member was present to count the 
votes popkov said in a telephone interview 
yakunin was suspended from his religious duties for 20 years and 
imprisoned for dissident activities after more than six years in 
prison and exile in siberia he was released in march 1987 and 
assigned to a small parish near moscow 
popov said the four other rejected candidates were two writers 
a criminal investigator and a military officer the names of 11 
candidates were placed on the district ballot

president bush is reportedly planning to 
recommend a mix of singlewarhead midgetman and multiple warhead mx 
missiles in a budget decision that will determine the future of the 
nations nuclear arsenal 
a white house source who declined to be identified said friday 
that bushs decision was expected to be some kind of mix of rail 
garrison mx and midgetman but the final mix is to be determined 
the decision represents a setback for defense secretary dick 
cheney who reportedly favored deploying only one mobile missile 
the 10warhead mx bush was supposed to make a final decision this 
weekend and inform cheney 
cheney had urged bush to remove the nations 50 mx missiles from 
their concrete silos and put them on railroad cars to be shuttled 
around the country an option known as the rail garrison mx he 
reportedly wanted to cut off funding for the truckmobile midgetman 
the decision on the missiles was one of several that must be 
made as cheney tries to cut 10 billion from the pentagon budget 
according to congressional and pentagon sources both star wars 
and the b2 stealth bomber face the budget ax when cheney announces 
his choices at a congressional hearing on tuesday 
cheney plans to scale back work on the b2 which at recent 
estimates of 500 million per plane is the most expensive aircraft 
in history while cutting funding for star wars 
details on the proposal for the b2 were not immediately 
available the sources who requested anonymity said friday 
star wars of the strategic defense initiative would be cut to 
48 billion for the department of energy in fiscal 1990 former 
president reagan who made star wars his top priority had asked 
for 59 billion in fiscal 1990 and 7 billion in 1991 a sharp 
increase from the 45 billion allocated for the program this year 
the total defense budget stands at 2992 billion 10 billion 
less than the budget former president reagan submitted in january 
and in accordance with the cut agreed upon a week ago by the white 
house and congress 
the defense secretary discussed the shrinking military budget at 
a pentagon meeting with the chairmen and ranking members of the 
senate and house armed services committees and the leaders of the 
house appropriations defense subcommittee 
cheneys plan calls for the elimination of funding for the 
marine corps v22 osprey troop transport aircraft retirement of 
one of two aging aircraft carriers the coral sea or the midway 
when the abraham lincoln is commissioned in 1990 
such a retirement would maintain the navy carrier force at 14 
instead of the 15 sought by reagan 
the defense secretary is also planning to shift 24 frigates to 
reserve status and cancel 14 billion procurement of the f14d 
tomcat fighter jets cheney also retained reagans plan to 
eliminate funding for the last two submarines in the los angeles 
class ssn688 in favor of the newer class ssn21 
in addition cheney plans to mothball a handful of b52s delay 
the millstar program an air forces communications satellite 
program and cancel the army helicopter improvement program reagan 
had proposed spending 210 million in 1990 for millstar and 299 
million for the ahip 
buys of the blackhawk uh60a would be reduced from 83 to 72 and 
purchases of the f15e would be reduced to zero that program had 
been earmarked for 17 billion in the fiscal 1990 budget 
army force structure would be reduced by 5 percent with cuts in 
the number of people employed at headquarters and in procurement 
those attending the meeting with cheney were sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee john warner of 
virginia ranking republican on the panel rep les aspin dwis

the first half of fiscal 1989 ended with a 
budget deficit that is running 74 percent ahead of last years 
according to the governments latest report on its financial 
situation 
for the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year which began 
oct 1 the budget deficit totaled 12843 billion up from the 
11961 billion shortfall posted in the first six months of last 
year the treasury department said friday 
the bush administration is estimating this years deficit will 
total 1633 billion up 53 percent from the 1551 billion 
shortfall posted in for all of fiscal 1988 under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law this years deficit was not supposed to 
exceed 146 billion 
the administration and congressional leaders last week unveiled 
a compromise plan designed to reduce the deficit in the next fiscal 
year to 994 billion just within the 100 billion target for 
fiscal 1990 established under grammrudman 
in march the government posted a 3578 billion deficit up 
222 percent from the same month last year and the highest monthly 
shortfall since may 1986 
revenues last month were up 39 percent from march 1988 to 
6828 billion while spending of 10406 billion was up 95 
percent 
economist louis crandall of rh wrightson amp associates in new 
york said last months deficit surge was largely due to technical 
factors related to the timing of government payments for tax 
refunds and veterans and disability benefits 
he said checks totaling 5 billion in tax refunds and 25 
billion in benefits that normally would have gone out in april were 
mailed out at the end of march artificially inflating the monthly 
deficit figure 
if you take out technical factors last month was right on top 
of last years number crandall said this points toward an 
annual deficit in the 145 billion range which would be better 
than last year and better than most people are currently 
expecting 
economist paul denoon of manufacturers hanover trust co in new 
york said that even setting aside the special factors that inflated 
marchs shortfall he expects the deficit this year to be in the 
range of 160 billion to 165 billion 
clearly its not doing as well as it was last year he said 
denoon said much of the worsening in the deficit so far this 
year has been linked to government payments to help shore up the 
troubled savings and loan industry 
analysts say the deficit also has increased because of 
higherthanexpected interest rates so far this year the federal 
reserve board for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an 
effort to slow down economic growth and thus restrain inflation 
the largest government spending category last month was the 
military defense spending in march totaled 289 billion and 
reached 148 billion for the first half of the fiscal year up 4 
percent from the same period during the previous year 
spending on social security last month totaled 195 billion and 
reached 1111 billion for the first six months of fiscal 1989 58 
percent ahead of a year earlier 
interest on the national debt totaled 165 billion last month 
and 117 billion so far this year up 112 percent from a year 
earlier 
health and human services programs other than social security 
cost 16 billion in march and 828 billion so far in the fiscal 
year up 69 percent from the previous year 
spending by the agriculture department last month was 38 
billion and totaled 286 billion for the first half of the year 
up 97 percent from a year earlier

more than a third of the firstgrade boys 
in rural north carolina have tried smokeless tobacco and the 
number increases to 70 percent by seventhgrade a study shows 
the recent university of north carolina at asheville study found 
that the most frequently stated reason for using smokeless tobacco 
was its taste followed by peer pressure a desire to feel grown 
up and the influence of role models such as athletes 
the study used children in grades one three five and seven in 
urban and rural schools in western north carolina 
it was apparent during the administration of our questionnaire 
that the firstgraders clearly understood what oral tobacco was 
said cheryl mcclary coauthor of the study in two of the rural 
schools several little boys immediately jumped up to show their 
containers of chewing tobacco which they kept in their back 
pocket 
state law allows a 6yearold to buy and use smokeless tobacco 
but prohibits the sale of cigarettes or cigarette papers to anyone

relatives of americans killed in the bombing 
of pan am flight 103 say they are encouraged by recent government 
response to aviation security problems but still want a broad 
investigation into the incident 
transportation secretary samuel skinner on friday announced 
rejection of calls for an independent commission to look into the 
dec 21 bombing he then took off for europe to meet with 
transportation officials in five countries 
bert ammerman spokesman for relatives of nearly 200 americans 
killed in the explosion over lockerbie scotland expressed 
disappointment with the decision saying we feel theres enough 
information thats been uncovered that only an independent 
investigation can deal with appropriately 
ammermans brother tom was killed in the bombing 
among concerns of the relatives are the lack of a public warning 
of threats against the flight security procedures that failed to 
detect the plastic explosive which authorities say was believed 
planted by terrorists and inadequate government response after the 
incident 
ammerman of demarest nj said however there have been 
several positive developments since the relatives staged a rally 
and met with bush and other officials in washington on april 3 
including steps to improve aviation security he said the state 
department had agreed to escort relatives who want to visit 
lockerbie 
skinner was meeting in naples italy this weekend with the 
administrations nominee to head the federal aviation 
administration adm james b busey who is us navy commander for 
europe and next week with government and airline officials in 
italy west germany switzerland france and england 
skinner in a news conference for foreign journalists covering 
washington said he would push for security initiatives that would 
encourage international travelers to retain their justified 
confidence in the systems safety 
skinner said us carriers have given unbelievable attention 
to security and are the safest in the world 
his spokesman david prosperi said skinner and other 
transportation and security officials were flying most of the way 
on a government plane to meet a tight schedule but would likely 
make at least part of the trip aboard commercial airliners 
skinner in a letter to ammerman rejecting the call for a 
separate investigation said for a variety of reasons we do not 
believe formation of an independent commission is necessary or 
prudent the letter was accompanied by a fivepage outline of 
administration action since the pan am explosion 
skinner said he had confidence in the investigation by scottish 
and west german authorities and the fbi and believed those 
responsible for planting the bomb which investigators have said 
was hidden in a radiocassette will be apprehended and prosecuted 
i can assure you that in my opinion the investigation is 
moving at full speed skinner said i think that eventually and 
hopefully in the not too distant future the public will know the 
full story there he said it was important not to disclose 
targets of the investigation or the information being sought 
skinner said his trip would review screening given foreign 
nationals hired by us airlines abroad and seek diplomatic 
approval for installation of devices to detect plastic explosives 
in airports used by us carriers abroad

president bush will continue the economic 
sanctions against nicaragua that were imposed in may 1985 by former 
president reagan 
bush said friday in a letter to house speaker jim wright that 
the trade embargo will continue as long as these measures are 
appropriate but also suggested the sanctions could be lifted if 
free elections are held february in nicaragua 
the trade sanctions are an essential element of our policy 
that seeks a democratic outcome in nicaragua by diplomatic means 
bush said in his letter 
the policies and actions of the government of nicaragua 
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the united states he 
said 
the ban covers imports of nicaraguan goods into the united 
states and exports by us firms to nicaragua except goods 
destined for the contra rebels who have fought for eight years to 
overthrow the countrys sandinista government 
the presidential order also prohibits air and ship traffic 
between the two countries 
bushs order came as a group of members of congress both 
democrats and republicans sent a telegram to nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega on friday criticizing the law nicaragua adopted this 
week to govern its elections scheduled for next february 
the telegram sent by a group led by rep frank guarini dnj 
said the law is biased unfair and designed to monopolize power 
rather than seek national reconciliation an aide to one of the 
sponsors provided a copy 
it calls on ortega to meet jointly with political opposition 
leaders and come up with a new election law to comply with the 
peace plans adopted by the presidents of the four central american 
democracies and ortega in esquipulas guatemala in 1987 and in 
tesoro beach el salvador this year 
the bush administration also has expressed strong displeasure 
with the new election law contending it gives the sandinista 
government and its candidates an unfair advantage the state 
department said the sandinistas will dominate the electoral council 
that will run the elections 
internal opposition parties and the contra rebels also have 
strongly criticized the new law 
an administration source who commented on condition he not be 
named said the administration was particularly displeased that 
ortega did not meet jointly with the opposition leaders to work out 
an agreeable election plan instead meeting with them one at a time 
and then pushing the sandinista proposal a complaint also made by 
the congress members who sent the telegram 
if nicaragua implements its esquipulas commitments and holds 
free fair and honest elections i believe the emergency that 
prompted the prior administration to impose the trade sanctions 
would largely be resolved bush wrote 
bushs letter reviewed the trade situation with nicaragua since 
the last administration report of nov 9 
those signing the congressional telegram include reps john 
spratt dsc rod chandler rwash dave mccurdy dokla tom 
carper ddel ike skelton dmo james slattery dkan roy

the american telephone amp telegraph co is 
seeking court permission to enter the complex of computer data 
videotex financial and other information services known as 
electronic publishing 
a brief filed friday with us district judge harold greene said 
the leading firms in the electronic publishing industry are 
large financially strong corporations that could withstand 
competition from atampt 
atampt also said there were other companies than atampt such as mci 
communications corp and us sprint to deliver data for the 
electronic publishers 
the court order breaking up the old bell system had banned atampt 
from electronic publishing but the atampt brief said that in 1982 
greene stated he intended to lift the ban after seven years 
greene said the burden after seven years would be on any 
opponents of removal to show that competitive conditions clearly 
require the maintenance of the ban atampts filing said 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the leading firms include 
knightridder online database services citicorp dow jones and 
reuters securities quotations and financial information dun amp 
bradstreet and trw credit data and general electric and ibm and 
sears videotex services 
linnen said atampt had no current plans to enter the electronic 
yellow pages and television businesses two areas that are of 
special concern to the seven regional bell telephone companies that 
were spun off from atampt in 1984 and to the broadcast and cable tv 
industries 
we have no specific business plan in mind linnen said we 
have no current plans to provide services via yellow pages and 
this court filing is not motivated by any current plan to get 
into television 
the company said there are now means other than atampts 
network for the transmission of the messages of electronic 
publishers and those firms providing electronic publishing 
services unquestionably have sufficient strength to permit them to 
compete 
citing mci and sprint it said it is beyond serious dispute 
that these carriers offer ample alternatives to all of the atampt 
interexchange transmission services used by electronic publishers 
mci officials did not immediately return calls for comment 
bill mccloskey a spokesman for one of the seven regional bell 
companies bellsouth said company officials had not seen the 
filing and could not comment 
robert l smith jr executive director of the videotex industry 
association said if atampt could be a potentially very important 
participant in electronic publishing and i think probably the 
one area to watch out is if they use this as an opportunity to get 
into electronic yellow pages 
noting that the regional bell companies are banned from this 
area he said a vacuum existed there 
greenes breakup order as modified defines electronic 
publishing as owning originating compiling or editing information 
content that is transported over atampts facilities 
in 1987 greene gave the regional bell companies permission to 
transmit but not originate information services which besides 
electronic publishing also include data processing and related 
computer services

health and human services secretary louis w 
sullivan gave his approval friday to a plan by federal scientists 
to wipe out tuberculosis in the united states by the year 2010 
i challenge you at cdc to carry out the strategies necessary 
to accomplish that goal sullivan said in a speech to employees 
at the centers for disease control 
the contagious lung disease attacked more than 22000 americans 
last year 
tb can be cured in most cases with drug therapy but has become 
a growing public health problem in recent years in part because of 
the spread of aids which weakens the immune system allowing tb 
among other diseases to develop scientists estimate that about 10 
million americans are infected with tb bacteria but the vast 
majority never get the disease 
the advisory committee for the elimination of tuberculosis

calls for more effective use of existing prevention and control 
programs development of new diagnosis and treatment techniques 
and rapid transfer of new technology into widespread medical use

erupted friday over 1200 acres of the pike national forest and 
forced the evacuation of more than 200 homes in scattered 
subdivisions near colorados foothils authorities said 
there were no reports of injuries or of damage to houses said 
craig a coultas spokesman for the woodmoormonument fire 
protection district 
about 175 firefighters from 20 agencies converged on the area 
about 20 miles north of colorado springs after the blaze broke out 
shortly after noon in the mount herman estates in unincorporated 
el paso county he said

overhaul the fire and finish the job the cause of the blaze was 
unknown he said 
coultas said structures in three subdivisions were evacuated in 
front of the fire burning grass brush scrub oak and pines 
the terrain has given us more fits than anything else 
coultas said fire tends to move up and so its following the 
contours of the land moving up the side of the mountain 
an air tanker was dropping fire retardant on the periphery of 
the blaze and helicopters were pulling water from monument lake to 
drop on the fire another air tanker was en route from arkansas to 
join the fire fighting 
officials said the rough terrain also was preventing workers 
from bringing in bulldozers to build fire lines so axes and small 
hoses were being used 
el paso county sheriffs spokesmen predicted it would take three 
or four days to quench the fire 
the national weather service said colorados rangeland fire 
danger was extreme as record high temperatures were reported 
friday in eastern colorado and the fire danger was high in the

the united states must pressure syria to stop 
the shelling that has killed hundreds in beirut and made life for 
the survivors virtually unlivable according to 2000 lebanese who 
demonstrated across from the white house 
its a total breakdown of everything said may rihani a 
washington dc consultant who visited her family in beirut in 
september no work no school no electricity 
its unbearable unpredictable unlivable since syrian 
forces began bombarding beiruts christian enclave in early march 
said samuel ibrahim a lebaneseborn chicago businessman who also 
has relatives living there its inhumane to shell peaceful 
innocent people he said 
the demonstrators came to washington on friday from across the 
united states and canada and were organized by a variety of 
prolebanese groups 
marching in lafayette park across the street from the white 
house they carried signs and sang the lebanese national anthem 
amid chants of president bush save lebanon 
the international movement for the liberation of lebanon an 
organizer of the demonstration said in a letter to bush it was 
disappointed by a statement by secretary of state james a baker 
earlier this week that the united states can do little at present 
to help lebanon 
bush told reporters thursday he wished there were some 
dramatic plan to stop the violence the problem the shortrun 
of it how you stop this firing the shelling how you get 
factions to stop warring has certainly in recent times defied 
solution bush said but we cant give up on it 
several demonstrators suggested the united states could use 
diplomatic or economic pressure in an effort to force syria to 
withdraw its 40000 troops from their country 
at least 270 people mainly civilians have been killed and 
nearly 1000 wounded in shelling since march 8 more than 150000 
christians and moslems have fled beirut out of fear of fighting or 
due to shortages of food and fuel 
elia sarkis a boston businessman who brought his 11yearold 
son to the demonstration said he believes that if syria withdrew 
the warring lebanese religious and ethnic factions would find a way 
to form a workable government 
a federation of religious ethnic communities thats the 
ideal new lebanon that were looking for sarkis said

former labor secretary raymond donovan is 
asking an appeals court panel to order the federal government to 
pay 112281 in legal bills he says he incurred during an 
investigation of an alleged kickback supposedly paid donovan in 
1977 
donovan and his lawyers say the legal fees and expenses are for 
the period march 1987 through october 1987 in connection with the 
probe by independent counsel leon silverman 
federal law on independent counsels provides for the government 
to pay legal fees if the subject of the criminal investigation 
isnt indicted 
donovan was cleared in the probe of accusations that he lied 
when he denied knowing anything about the alleged kickback scheme 
which involved a former supplier of schiavone construction co 
where donovan was working at the time

the rape and beating of a jogger has reinforced 
the reputation of central park as a haven for criminals which city 
officials say is an unfair stereotype of americas most famous 
urban park 
generally crime in the park is low it is safe to jog in 
central park said police chief of detectives robert colangelo 
after the wednesday night attack by a marauding gang of teenagers 
left a 28yearold woman near death 
theres danger in jogging anywhere colangelo said but we 
dont feel its inordinately dangerous here 
the parks reputation for illegal activity has been reinforced 
in recent years by several highly publicized incidents jennifer 
levins 1986 strangling by preppie killer robert chambers a 
shooting a month earlier that left a police officer steven 
mcdonald paralyzed and a 1983 free concert by diana ross that 
drew packs of thieves 
the victim of the latest attack an investment banker remained 
unconscious on lifesupport systems friday at metropolitan 
hospital said hospital spokeswoman aura retamoso 
the woman lost roughly threequarters of her bodys blood in the 
attack and suffered a fractured skull severe head lacerations 
brain contusions fractured facial bones and bruises from head to 
toe in the assault by a dozen teens said dr robert s kurtz 
assistant chief of surgery at the hospital 
kurtz said that on friday her pulse rate went way up when 
her mother spoke to her so at some level shes processing 
information today which she wasnt doing yesterday he said 
he said the next four days were crucial for her health but 
added she has a fighting chance of making a full recovery 
seven teenagers were arrested friday and charged with attempted 
murder rape and assault in the attack police said additional 
arrests were expected 
colangelo said the woman was attacked by some members of a group 
of 32 teens who went to the park wednesday night to raise hell 
attack joggers steal bicycles 
within 10 minutes they had assaulted three men including a 
jogger and a homeless man they later split up into three groups 
after spotting a police cruiser and terrorized at least nine people 
during a twohour period 
colangelo said the youths told investigators the crime spree 
resulted from a pastime called wilding 
its not a term that we in the police had heard before the 
chief said they just said we were going wilding in my mind 
at this point it implies that they were going to go raise hell 
central park is the focus of national attention every 
incident that happens there is news especially if its grisly 
parks commissioner henry stern said friday 
last year police had reports of 51 assaults and 13 rapes in the 
park compared with 71030 assaults and 3412 rapes citywide 
of last years attacks in the park a dozen involved joggers in 
1987 13 joggers were assaulted in the park the rape wednesday was 
the third rape reported this year in central park police said 
officials say the crime reports for the park are low for an area 
larger than the country of monaco on a busy day hundreds of 
thousands of people pass through the park 
officials acknowledge the park has dangers after dark 
its safer to use it by day stern said but he said 
people shouldnt give up on the park any more than you would give 
up on air travel because of a plane crash 
fred lebow head of the new york road runners club tells 
evening joggers to avoid the northern area of the park where the 
wednesday attack occurred that area bordering on harlem has more 
rugged terrain and hiding places for criminals 
lebows warning is based on history one of his groups members 
was raped in almost the same spot while jogging through the park 
five years ago 
mayor edward i koch also sounded a warning friday about 
jogging if you do it in some parts of this town youre 
endangering your physical wellbeing maybe occasionally even your 
life

a sailor injured when missiles ripped 
into the uss stark as it patrolled the persian gulf says the 7500 
the government is trying to get him as compensation is insulting 
all this for 7500 said bill mcleod who spent more than 
11 hours in the gulf nursing his injuries and fighting off sharks 
following the may 1987 attack 
im starting to wonder was it all worth it he said itd 
be better off as far as compensation goes to go out and get in a 
car wreck 
mcleod heard last month that the iraqi government had agreed to 
pay 2735 million to the families of the 37 navy sailors killed 
aboard the stark and thought he would be compensated as one of the 
22 sailors injured 
mcleod received a letter from the state department on thursday 
that said the united states would seek 7500 for his injuries from 
the iraqis 
the state department would not comment on the total amount being 
sought for the injured sailors 
mcleod and the other sailors were injured when two exocet 
missiles fired by an iraqi warplane hit the stark in may 1987 
he and three other sailors were thrown from the ship by the 
blast 
mcleod who was awarded a purple heart spent two weeks in a 
wheelchair before returning to light duty 
i think its a ripoff its an insult he said mcleod and 
his wife rosa were thinking about 30000 to 40000 would be 
about right 
the state department letter invites mcleod to submit additional 
information if he believes the claim is unjust 
mcleod left the navy after his enlistment expired in november 
1987 the navy paid his hospital bills plus 3200 for personal 
items lost on the ship

a school principal prevented a 
seventhgrader from displaying her antiabortion science project 
which consisted of 10 jars of human fetuses saying the 
awardwinning exhibit was too much for his students 
carrie walker placed the jars which contained fetuses from 
pregnancy stages ranging from 6 weeks to 5 months on her exhibit 
table thursday at pi beta phi elementary school said principal al 
cardiel 
to an untrained eye the fetus 5 months along was 
definitely a child said jim wade curriculum director for sevier 
county schools 
the girl said she got the fetuses which were kept in 
preservative solutions from her uncle a pathologist the girls 
mother said the fetuses came from miscarriages 
cardiel said he learned of the exhibit early that morning as 
students were setting up their projects for the schools annual 
science fair which this year has the theme life science 
the project was very inappropriate for the age group here 
cardiel said 
he said he first conferred with carries mother donna walker 
who teaches art at the school the project was removed from the 
fair after it was graded and given a blue ribbon but before classes 
had a chance to view it said sevier county school superintendent 
jack parton 
parton said he agreed with cardiel that most of the 
schoolchildren were too young to understand the ideas and points 
behind the exhibit parton also said recent nationwide political 
debate over abortion played no part in the principals decision to 
yank the display from the fair 
the school is located in gatlinburg an east tennessee resort 
town of about 3000 people about 430 students in kindergarten 
through eighth grade attend the school

the transition from jose 
napoleon duartes christian democratic government to alfredo 
cristianis rightist administration is not going smoothly 
assassinations bombings deathsquad style murders and mass 
roundups of leftists have further disturbed a political climate 
that has been roiled by nine years of civil war 
marxistled guerrillas have vowed to make the country 
ungovernable by june 1 when cristiani takes office 
the 41yearold leader of the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance or arena handily defeated the centrist christian 
democratic candidate in last months presidential election 
arena and us officials have blamed the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front or fmln for three recent assassinations 
of rightists and a bomb attack on the home of the 
vicepresidentelect 
attorney general roberto garcia alvarado was slain wednesday by 
a bomb placed on the roof of his car when it stopped at a traffic 
light 
the targeting of highprofile individuals a tactic not 
routinely employed by the guerrillas in the past appears designed 
to provoke and undermine cristiani but who is doing it and why 
remain unclear 
the guerrillas have neither claimed nor denied responsibility 
for the killing of garcia they did however deny responsibility 
for the april 14 bombing of vice presidentelect francisco merinos 
house 
both cristiani and us ambassador william walker have blamed 
the recent wave of violence on guerrillas determined to provoke a 
harsh repressive response from security forces 
according to this view guerrilla sympathizers in the united 
states and europe would point to a surge in rights abuse as reason 
for a cutoff of us aid 
el salvador receives about 15 million a day in us economic 
and military assistance more than any other country in the 
western hemisphere 
some stillactive arena leaders have been linked to death squads 
that in the early 1980s killed thousands of suspected leftists the 
insurgents continue to refer to arena as the deathsquad party 
arena denies the charge and cristiani says the eightyearold 
organization has evolved into a modern conservative party similar 
to the uss republican party 
but arena continues to harbor a farright wing whether the 
cristiani faction of relatively moderate and modern capitalists 
wins out over oligarchic and fascistminded elements remains to be 
seen 
an extremist sector of the right hopes to subjugate cristiani 
and impose a hard military and political line ignacio ellacuria 
rector of the prestigious jesuitrun central american university 
said friday 
leftleaning unions and other popular organizations have 
condemned what they say is an increase in repression in recent 
weeks elementary school teacher cristina gomez was abducted from 
her school tortured and killed april 5 by heavily armed men in 
civilian clothes acting in broad daylight apparently confident 
they would not be challenged by security forces 
police and army troops on wednesday and thursday raided a union 
headquarters the headquarters of a displaced persons group and 
the offices of a womens association more than 70 people were 
arrested 
the escalation of repression demonstrates the desperation 
being felt by the rich and powerful theyre starting to feel the 
effect of the war and see their riches in danger said tomasa 
ruiz a member of the directorate of the raided refugee center 
so they declare war on the people 
cristiani said his government will act resolutely but within 
the law to ensure law and order 
defense minister gen eugenio vides casanova who met thursday 
with lawmakers to discuss possible legislation to combat 
organizations considered guerrilla fronts by the military said he 
does not believe the current level of violence requires the 
imposition of a state of siege

a soviet skimmer swung into action friday 
but collected no oil as a number of fishing boats waged their own 
lowtech fight against americas worst oil spill 
while the 425foot vaidogubsky plied the rough seas off the 
kenai peninsula kelly duncan shook his head in disgust over his 
53foot fishing vessel with its holds full of oil sucked from 
resurrection bay 
i got all the evidence of the oil spill you could want right 
here said duncan 29 of kasilof its death and destruction 
people look at it and it makes them sick 
duncans boat sea quest was docked in a contamination zone of 
sewards small boat harbor while state and coast guard officials 
debated what to do with the 7500 gallons duncan said he sucked up 
in 16 hours thursday 
the soviet skimmer spent thursday testing its equipment and 
steamed for gore point where large pools of oil have gathered 
coast guard spokeswoman kathleen donohoe said the soviet skimmer 
was to begin retrieving its first oil today 
a total of 48 skimmers most in the 36foot to 42foot range 
were working on stretches of oil floating in prince william sound 
and the gulf of alaska heaviest concentrations were in the sound 
at gore point on the kenai peninsula and on the west side of kodiak 
island 
local fishermen have been pulling their boats up to oil 
contained by plastic booms dipping the crude up with scoops and 
buckets and then stacking the buckets on the sterns of their boats 
coast guard petty officer brad smith said delays unloading the 
oil were widespread and slowing progress on cleaning up the oil he 
declined comment on whether more barges were needed and referred 
the question to exxon 
rick coleman a spokesman for the oil company in valdez said 
four barges in prince william sound and another near seward had a 
combined capacity of almost 8 million gallons another barge was to 
join them he said 
another exxon spokesman henry beathard acknowledged there were 
long delays in loading recovered oil from skimmers onto the barges 
he blamed that on the thick consistency of recovered oil which he 
likened to taffy 
exxon also was under attack from environmentalists upset with 
the oil companys reluctance to open a sea otter treatment center 
at seward 
the us fish and wildlife service said friday it had written 
exxon strongly reemphasizing the need for a second treatment 
center in addition to one at valdez 
spokesman bruce batten said his agency first asked for a center 
april 7 and asked that it be completed by sunday 
were not really in a position where we can order them to do 
it but we finally felt compelled to put it in writing he said 
batten said the service is expanding its effort to rescue 
oilcoated otters off the outer coast of the kenai peninsula 
the center for marine conservation estimated about 200 oiled sea 
otters have been found along the southern shoreline of the 
peninsula by fishermen altogether the fish and wildlife service 
has observed 3406 dead shore birds 409 dead sea otters and four 
dead bald eagles 
the devastation yet to come from the exxon valdez spill could 
be enormous said roger mcmanus president of the washington 
dcbased environmental group as he pressed for the second otter 
center 
the exxon valdez rammed bligh reef march 24 and spilled 101 
million gallons of oil it had loaded in valdez the southern 
terminus of the alaska pipeline 
delays in responding to the spill contributed to its spread and 
some of the oil seeped out of the sound into the gulf of alaska and 
moved southwest to the kenai fjords national park 
the ecologically sensitive region is home to large populations 
of marine mammals and seabirds biologists say thousands of birds 
and hundreds of sea otters have died although an exact figure is 
unobtainable 
the oil continued to spread southwest friday to kodiak island 
and beyond said pete mcgee a spill cleanup coordinator for the 
alaska department of environmental conservation 
kodiak is the no 1 fishing port in the nation as well as home 
of the worlds largest concentration of brown bears many of which 
are just emerging from winter hibernation

some outspokenly criticized the communist system no one 
believes in communism anymore said one 34yearold teacher no 
one believes in the party the party is strangling china 
ren wanding activist in the shortlived 1978 democracy wall 
period of relative tolerance for democratic views told one 
audience of about 2000 people are praying for the awakening of 
a legal system this is a historical necessity democracy wall 
lives again 
others critized deng xiaoping for holding onto power and 
demanded that premier li peng resign saying he lacked ability for 
the job 
at about 615 am saturday a student leader announced to 
cheers that the authorities agreed to let the students remain in 
the square while the party memorial service took place in the great 
hall 
the beijing government on friday announced that access to the 
great hall and the square would be restricted during the ceremony 
students feared police or soldiers would move in during the night 
to drive them out of the area 
a victory for us a big victory the communist party has 
backed down said one jubilant student in the square 
the students acknowledged however that authorities rejected a 
list of demands presented earlier in the week 
they included more funding for education public disclosure of 
the incomes of top leaders and an end to the ban on unauthorized 
demonstrations 
students said the most significant demand was for greater press 
freedom a persistent theme during the demonstrations 
the official press has given little coverage to the 
demonstrations except to report on alleged violent acts by 
demonstrators during thursdays clash and issue warnings that those 
taking advantage of hus death to promote antigovernment 
activities will be punished 
tiananmen square a 100acre plaza sided by the forbidden city 
the great hall and mao tsetungs mausoleum is the symbolic center 
of china 
saturdays demonstration was the biggest since april 1976 when 
the death of premier chou enlai sparked a huge outpouring of grief 
and anger toward the leftist government 
that tiananmen incident set off events that were to lead to 
the overthrow of the leftists and the end of the 196676 cultural 
revolution 
hu was widely admired by students for his work in redressing the 
wrongs done to intellectuals during that decade of chaos 
he was ousted as party leader in january 1987 after party 
conservatives accused him of being soft on student demonstrators 
and the trend toward bourgeois liberalization 
on saturday one government worker in the demonstration said of 
deng our leader is old maybe he is crazy many people hope he 
will die 
deng remains popular for his marketoriented reforms that have 
brought china some economic prosperity but he has carried out only 
limited political reforms and does not tolerate opposition to 
oneparty rule 
deng who was believed at one point to have chosen hu as his 
successor approved hus ouster after prodemocracy demonstrations 
rocked the nation in december 1986 and january 1987

hundreds of women wearing veils wait 
outside an abandoned schoolhouse for bags of flour and sugar to 
feed their families for the next two weeks 
their children huddle close by some clutch torn plastic bags 
and rusting buckets to carry the rations home others simply stick 
out cupped hands 
they are among the women and children in kabul most affected by 
the 11year civil war only the poorest of them are eligible for 
the emergency rations distributed by a un relief program called 
operation salaam or peace 
relief workers say they dont know how much longer they will be 
able to help because their stockpile will be depleted by the end of 
april 
we make no illusions that we are even able to begin to handle 
the need we are not solving the problem said ross mountain 
director of the united nations development program 
since february relief workers have handed out 22pound bags of 
flour and 6pound bags of sugar as well as some medicine and 
blankets to about 33500 families 
they also have provided fertilizer to farmers hoping to start 
planting crops in fields destroyed by fighting between afghan 
forces and moslem guerrillas trying to oust the sovietbacked 
government 
afghanistan was selfsufficient in food before civil war broke 
out following a marxist coup in april 1978 the fighting has 
destroyed fields and orchards and forced the government to import 
about 1 million tons of wheat annually 
relief workers say fertilizer also will be gone within days 
moscow donated 175 tons of wheat and flour and about 235 tons of 
sugar to operation salaam 
the development program is one of five un organizations 
involved in the relief effort the others are the aid coordinators 
office unicef the high commission for refugees and the world food 
bank 
dozens of soviet military transport planes descend daily on the 
capital from sunrise to sunset but the blueandwhite aircraft 
each carry only about 25 tons of food and supplies the rest of the 
cargo is weapons and ammunition 
the soviets ended nine years of intervention in afghanistan when 
they withdrew the last of their troops on feb 15 western 
countries that withdrew from afghanistan before that time do not 
recognize the government of president najib and have refused to 
help it 
the united states pakistan saudi arabia and china back the 
guerrillas known as mujahedeen 
bread lines at kabul bakeries that once stretched for blocks 
have eased and there are plenty of fruits and vegetables in the 
markets but food prices have risen dramatically and the poor 
cannot afford them 
the cost of 15 pounds of flour has risen from about 40 cents in 
january to 325 today 
heavy snow and rebel attacks at times have cut off two vital 
supply routes to kabul a city of 22 million people the salang 
highway running north to the soviet border and the jalalabad 
highway east to pakistan 
fighting between government forces and the guerrillas closed the 
salang highway for nearly two weeks this month a 1300truck 
convoy was stalled about 30 miles north of kabul and dozens of 
containers of food rotted on the soviet border 
convoys also have had trouble traveling between pakistan and 
kabul because of the guerrilla assault on jalalabad the insurgents 
have pounded the city with heavy artillery and tens of thousands of 
rockets since march 6 
the soviet airlift has enabled the government to hold out 
against the guerrillas but it supplies less than half the 650 tons 
of flour that kabul needs daily 
guerrilla leaders operating from pakistan originally said they 
would take power in afghanistan within weeks after the soviet 
pullout 
however government troops have managed to repulse their 
assaults on jalalabad and diplomats say the insurgents now hope to 
starve major cities such as jalalabad and kabul into surrendering

an honor roll student searching for a 
way to protest his schools dress code found something his mother 
would think natty a bright red pair of her culottes 
theyre saying we cant wear shorts but girls can wear skirts 
that are shorter than shorts so theyre indirectly discriminating 
against guys said aaron martinez who was sent home thursday 
when he showed up in school sporting the outfit 
on friday five other boys joined his protest by going to school 
in skirts 
school officials told them to change their clothing or go home 
two went home while the others changed to pants and went to class 
said principal gary blocker 
the school boards student dress policy clearly states that 
culottes sometimes referred to as split skirts are 
permissible the policy does not say that only girls can wear 
culottes to school 
culottes are for girls blocker said the handbook doesnt 
say that but thats what is meant it might be sex discrimination 
but its disruptive to the school 
martinez a member of the baseball team and captain of the 
soccer team said he feels more comfortable in shorts than in 
jeans i never wear long pants unless i have to 
the kids in california are allowed to wear shorts to school 
he said i guess theyre a bunch of illiterate dropouts because 
of it 
the school board has scheduled a public hearing next week to 
consider changes to the student dress policy

a judge said a jurys passion led it to give 
rock hudsons lover an excessive 217 million in a landmark aids 
lawsuit and he slashed the award to 55 million 
its still a big award said marc christian 35 who was 
reached by telephone friday after superior court judge bruce 
geernaerts decision 
christian had sued the late actors estate contending hudson 
should have told christian he had the deadly and contagious disease 
during the trial christian a former bartender testified in 
sometimes lurid detail that he continued to have sex unwittingly 
with hudson for months after the actor was diagnosed with aids 
the jury ruled in february that hudson was guilty of 
outrageous conduct for concealing his aids diagnosis from 
christian his lover for two years 
although christian did not contract aids and has tested negative 
for the presence of the virus both the judge and jury found he 
deserved damages for the extreme emotional distress he suffered 
christian said he didnt learn of the stars illness until a few 
months before hudson 58 died on oct 5 1985 
i thought i was a dead man he testified about the terror 
that gripped him in the wake of the disclosure 
legal scholars said the ruling was unique in personal injury law 
concerning sexually transmitted diseases because only plaintiffs 
who developed the diseases have collected damages in previous cases 
in separate deliberations in february jurors gave christian 
145 million in compensatory damages and 725 million in punitive 
damages 
the judge upheld the verdict and said hudsons conduct was 
outrageous and reprehensible because the actor and his 
secretary mark miller agreed to keep hudsons aids diagnosis 
secret 
but in the 30page order issued friday the judge said the 
court finds that the jurys award of 145 million is so high that 
it must be concluded that the award is based in part on passion 
resulting from the jurys evaluation of the outrageous and 
reprehensible nature of the conduct of rock hudson and defendant 
miller 
it is clear that the emotional distress at issue here is 
the fear of contracting aids and therefore the fear of an 
agonizing death is very substantial whether measured in quantity or 
quality geernaert wrote 
on the other hand however serious christians distress 
might be when he first learned of hudsons aids such emotional 
distress would become somewhat less over time 
furthermore there is no evidence that plaintiffs emotional 
distress has been physically debilitating or that plaintiff has 
suffered any tangible economic loss he wrote 
christian said he was happy with the outcome because it still 
sends a message to aids patients to inform their sexual partners if 
they have the disease 
christians attorney harold rhoden who said he was 
disappointed by the judges decision said christian accepted the 
reduction because he does not have the money to continue the court 
battle 
robert parker mills an attorney for the hudson estate said he 
believes his clients will appeal 
theres not any evidence i can see that would substantiate a 
5 million award to this man said mills

a familys decision to have a feeding tube 
removed from a 90yearold semicomatose stroke victim has 
rekindled a debate over whether it is humane to withhold food and 
water from terminally ill patients 
for many doctors cutting off the flow of nutrients through a 
tube is equivalent to pulling the plug on a respirator but 
opponents argue that withholding food oversteps the line between 
allowing nature to take its course and actively ending a life 
there is a line in many peoples eyes said fenella rouse 
legal services director at the society for the right to die in new 
york city which supports the right to cut off nutrition 
i dont think theres a practical difference she said i 
think theres an emotional difference 
wisconsin is among at least 39 states and the district of 
columbia that permit socalled living wills in which people 
can declare whether they would want to refuse lifesustaining 
medical treatment if they became terminally ill according to the 
society 
but wisconsin is one of a handful of states with laws that 
specifically prohibit cutting off food from patients 
do we want to go around starving and dehydrating people to 
death said susan armacost legislative director for wisconsin 
right to life the group has fought proposals to broaden the living 
will law to include nutrition and hydration successfully defeating 
one effort last year 
norman fost director of the medical ethics program at the 
university of wisconsin medical school in madison said it is 
misleading to say patients starve to death he says comatose 
patients cannot experience hunger or thirst 
of course its always hard to withdraw treatment he said 
it goes against natural medical impulses but death is often in 
the interest of the patient 
people should have the right to control medical care 
concurs arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics 
at the university of minnesota 
both doctors are supported by the american medical association 
which says it is ethical to discontinue lifeprolonging treatment 
for patients facing imminent death or in irreversible comas such 
treatment includes medication and artificially and 
technologically supplied respiration nutrition or hydration 
but ms armacost of wisconsin right to life insists that 
nutrition is different a patient has a chance of surviving if a 
respirator is removed she says but cutting off food means certain 
death 
court rulings have been mixed in two states with laws that 
exclude the removal of food and water 
in connecticut the state supreme court ruled this year that 
feeding tubes could be removed from a comatose patient but 
spoonand strawfeeding could not 
missouris supreme court ruled last year that the parents of a 
braindamaged woman who is not comatose could not have the womans 
surgically implanted feeding tube removed the case has been 
appealed to the us supreme court where it is pending 
no one has been prosecuted for withholding food from a patient 
in wisconsin the woman died last year 
but the milwaukee county district attorneys office is seeking 
advice from doctors about the case of the elderly stroke victim in 
an attempt to clarify the law 
assistant district attorney thomas potter wouldnt comment on 
whether the department was considering filing charges he said the 
departments main intention was to give doctors guidelines on what 
they can do under the law

two farmers who claimed a neighbors 
wandering bulls impregnated 32 of their heifers won a lawsuit but 
got far less money than they sought to pay for abortions on the 
cows that were too young to have babies 
an iowa county circuit court jury awarded damages of 640 to 
mike and paul mieden on thursday the men had sued for 54000 
the 640 according to a veterinarians testimony would have 
covered the cost to administer abortion shots to the animals the 
shots would have had no prolonged health effects 
the trial pitting the miedens against their neighbor lloyd 
vivian began monday 
the miedens claimed that in late june and early july 1986 two 
of vivians bulls jumped a fence and bred with 32 of the 86 heifers 
that were in an adjacent pasture 
the miedens claimed that the heifers were too young to be bred 
and that they lost milk production because of the early pregnancies 
vivian did not deny that his bulls were in the pasture with the 
heifers but took the position that the miedens could have done 
something to prevent damage to the heifers he offered to have the 
heifers pregnancies checked and to pay to have the pregnancies 
aborted 
paul mieden said four of the heifers were aborted by a 
veterinarian four aborted on their own and calves delivered by the 
other 24 heifers died two heifers died while giving birth he 
said and others suffered damaged reproductive tracts because they 
were too young to deliver

millions of tickets have already been 
bought for the chance to win the pennsylvania lotterys jackpot of 
70 million which is sure to grow but lottery officials are 
urging people not to splurge on tickets 
the super 7 jackpot guaranteed to reach the 70 million mark by 
wednesdays drawing would break north american records lottery 
spokeswoman terry murphy said friday 
ticket sales for the super 7 game have been booming she said 
players bought nearly 7 million tickets thursday and friday 
lottery officials will continue to update the jackpots value as 
sales continue ms murphy said 
despite the temptation to buy as many tickets as possible to 
increase chances of winning to do so would be futile ms murphy 
said 
the odds of winning the jackpot are one in 96 million for 
each ticket you buy she said theres no way you could cover 
it all 
players should only use extra money to buy tickets not money 
they need to cover bills food clothing or other essentials she 
said 
we are after players discretionary dollars the same money 
they would spend buying a magazine or a candy bar she said 
if one person gets a ticket with seven of the 11 winning 
numbers he or she would receive 269 million a year for 26 years 
the super 7 jackpot is guaranteed to reach 70 million because 
no one has bought a winning ticket for the past six weeks that 
would surpass any of the lottery jackpots ever offered in the 
united states canada and mexico ms murphy said 
prior to the super 7 jackpot the largest us lottery winnings 
were 699 million in illinois split by four ticket holders on 
april 15 
before the 70 million prize pennsylvanias largest jackpot was 
46 million in the super 7 game which was won by a hollidaysburg 
couple on oct 14 1987

a man accused of clubbing his 
mother with a crowbar and then stabbing her to death in a cocaine 
frenzy has been ordered to take powerful drugs that may make him 
competent to stand trial 
charles moore 29 who shouted and cursed when circuit judge 
robert carney issued the order thursday has the right to be spared 
thoughtmanipulating drugs argued his lawyer ryal gaudiosi 
but carney sided with state psychiatrists who said moores 
mental health probably would not improve without the drugs 
if after five years moore still is not mentally competent to go 
to trial criminal charges against him may have to be dropped 
prosecutors said 
moore was charged with firstdegree murder and two counts of 
attempted firstdegree murder after attacking his mother his 
nephew and a passerby in april 1988 police said he clubbed his 
mother with a crowbar before stabbing her then attacked the others 
with the crowbar 
carney ruled that moore was mentally incompetent to stand trial 
and he was taken for treatment to the staterun south florida 
evaluation and treatment center in miami in september 
the state department of health and rehabilitative services asked 
carney on thursday for the authority to make moore take 
antipsychotic drugs aimed at altering his behavior 
dr andrew perfilio a psychiatrist who has been treating moore 
told carney that he wants to give moore the drugs trilafon and 
cogentin 
the first is an antipsychotic drug the second is to counter 
possible side effects of trilafon such as dry mouth blurred 
vision drooling involuntary muscle movements and even glaucoma 
moore loudly opposed taking the drugs 
ive done the best i can without any medicine he told the 
court i feel like theyre trying to kill me my behavior has 
been been outstanding since ive been in there if you want to see 
me worse than what i am then bring the medicine to me 
but perfilio said the proposed medication is the cornerstone 
of his treatment the longer he is delusional the more likely it 
will become permanent and fixed 
that prospect coupled with the potential that the state may 
have to drop charges makes the medicine necessary argued 
assistant state attorney pete laporte 
carney agreed to order moore to take the drugs for three months 
then report back to him 
the benefits far outweigh whatever disadvantages there may be 
to the treatment carney said 
moore who was handcuffed and wore leg shackles remained 
unconvinced im not voluntarily taking any drugs he insisted 
i dont even take aspirin

a united nations conference on disarmament 
that ended today gave unanimous backing to a global ban on chemical 
weapons officials said 
there has been a proliferation of chemical weapons and we have 
to be careful said yasushi akashi undersecretarygeneral for 
disarmament affairs at the un we may not be able to close 
pandoras box 
akashi and others at the fourday conference noted that 20 to 30 
countries now possess chemical arms some of which were used most 
recently in the iraniraq conflict that left more than 1 million 
people dead 
there was universal agreement among the 100 arms control experts 
that a complete ban on chemical weapons should be negotiated at the 
uns permanent conference on disarmament in geneva 
experts from the united states the soviet union and 28 other 
nations gathered in kyoto for the conference which was held in the 
only country to be the victim of nuclear attacks in august 1945 
the united states dropped atom bombs on the western cities of 
hiroshima and nagasaki 
at the meeting experts and officials clashed over the need for 
a comprehensive nuclear test ban and on the policy of nuclear 
deterrence 
seismologists from around the world agreed that modern 
technology can produce highly accurate methods of detecting 
underground nuclear explosions but said they needed political 
support and funds to build a global network of seismological 
monitoring stations 
the united states britian and france advocated the policy of 
possessing nuclear arms to deter others from using them while 
others noted their threatening and dangerous aspects 
on friday us ambassador maynard w glitman told the assembly 
that despite unilateral reductions in soviet troops and 
conventional arms to be carried out by next year the united states 
would continue to stockpile nuclear arms to maintain global 
security 
glitman told reporters today that the next goal of the united 
states in arms controls negotiations is the reduction of soviet 
conventional forces in europe 
to achieve an equal number for the united states and the 
soviet union in europe will enable us to look to future nuclear 
reductions there said glitman the chief us negotiator for the 
1987 inf intermediaterange nuclear missiles treaty

two congressmen said they would push for a 
spill czar to take charge of any future oil disasters but the 
cleanup of the exxon valdez spill remained fractious with fishermen 
demanding a bigger role 
fortyeight skimmers were gathering 100000 gallons to 150000 
gallons of oil a day the coast guard estimated but officials said 
friday there were widespread delays in unloading the oil onto 
barges which exxon spokesman henry beathard blamed on the crudes 
thick taffylike consistency 
the giant soviet oil skimmer vaidogubsky which spent two days 
getting ready and testing its booms was poised at gore point on 
the kenai peninsula where large pools of oil washing westward have 
been stopped by a spectacular outcropping of rocks jutting into the 
gulf of alaska it was to begin collecting oil today 
heavy concentrations of oil also remained in prince william 
sound and were on the west side of kodiak island more than 300 
miles to the southwest 
more than 300 miles of shoreline have been affected since the 
tanker ran aground in the sound last month and spilled 101 million 
gallons of crude 
delays in responding to the spill have contributed to its 
spread many fishermen frustrated at the lack of progress have 
taken to the sea themselves using scoops and buckets to pick up 
oil contained with homemade booms 
kelly duncan 29 said he sucked 7500 gallons of oil and 
seawater into the hull of his boat he said he fears his fishing 
boat may be permanently contaminated 
at homer on the kenai peninsula angry fishermen demanded one of 
their own be given equal decisionmaking power with exxon and the 
coast guard in the cleanup 
reps don young ralaska and curt weldon rpa met friday 
night with fishermen and representatives of the coast guard and 
exxon we came out with a very positive outlook young said 
without elaborating 
the two congressmen toured oilspotted beaches on the kenai 
peninsula earlier in the day with interior secretary manuel lujan 
jr 
at a news conference the two men said they would push for 
legislation to put one person most likely the commandant of the 
coast guard in charge of cleaning up future spills 
commandant paul yost on wednesday ended a weeklong stay in 
alaska during which he rearranged the cleanup strategy approved an 
exxon plan for the work and set a timetable for completion the 
entire job is to be finished by midseptember 
young said the legislation he plans to introduce might include 
funding for one oilskimming ship to be stationed in alaska 
weldon said it would be ideal to have skimmers in place on both 
coasts he was a fire chief in the pennsylvania port town of marcus 
hook when two foreign tankers collided there in 1975 burning and 
spilling 300000 gallons 
young also vowed to spend money on research and push for the use 
of oildispersing chemicals regardless of toxicity in dealing 
with future spills 
lujan didnt attend the news conference he left the congressmen 
to go to kodiak island home of the nations no 1 fishing port and 
the worlds largest concentration of brown bears 
meanwhile environmentalists attacked exxon over the companys 
reluctance to open a sea otter treatment center at seward 
the us fish and wildlife service said friday it had written 
exxon strongly reemphasizing the need for a second treatment 
center in addition to one at valdez 
the fish and wildlife service has counted 3406 dead shore 
birds 409 dead sea otters and four dead bald eagles

strikebound eastern airlines says it has 
stopped a program that rewarded new york cab drivers for steering 
passengers toward its gates at laguardia airport with 25 gift 
certificates and weekly prize drawings 
eastern dropped the 2weekold campaign on friday after new 
yorks taxi and limousine commission told the airline it was 
illegal 
once it was brought to our attention it was discontinued 
said jim ashlock an eastern spokesman in miami 
ellen weiman a spokeswoman for the commission said the shuttle 
incentive program for cabbies was against all rules since taxi 
drivers shouldnt be induced to take riders where they dont want 
to go 
eastern was giving cabbies a 25 american express certificate 
for every five loads of passengers they dropped off at easterns 
shuttle terminal at laguardia 
there also was a weekly drawing for participating taxi drivers 
for a color television set videocassette recorder or radio 
wed like to think that maybe the cabbies are doing some 
selling for us eastern spokesman robin matell said earlier 
friday he noted that around half the passengers coming to 
laguardia arrive by taxi 
easterns hourly among new york boston and washington has been 
running a normal schedule compared with only 10 percent of 
prestrike flights for the airline as a whole passenger loads have 
been decimated however as the rival shuttle operated by pan am 
corp has eaten into easterns traffic 
pan am once used an incentive plan to encourage cabbies to pick 
arriving passengers up at its new york terminal when the airline 
started its shuttle service in late 1986 spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
said but the program wasnt illegal 
she said pan am has captured around 80 percent of the northeast 
shuttle market and easterns taxi program appears to have had no 
impact 
in another development a washington property developer 
confirmed through an associate friday that he is interested in 
buying eastern 
weve expressed our interest its sincere and were pursuing 
it said john sarpa senior vice president of hadid development 
co in roslyn va the company is run by mohamed hadid who 
recently agreed to buy the ritzcarlton hotels in washington and 
new york

communist rebels today claimed 
responsibility for the ambushslaying of a us army officer and 
said it was in retaliation for the united states arrogant 
trampling of philippine independence 
col james nick rowe a former vietnam prisoner of war was 
killed friday by a shot to the head when gunmen in a stolen car 
sprayed his vehicle with bullets while he was on his way to work in 
suburban quezon 
the communist new peoples army general command claimed 
responsibility in a statement delivered to news agencies the 
letter bore the logo of the rebel army and was released on behalf 
of its chief romulo kintanar 
the statement threatened further attacks if the united states 
continues support of president corazon aquinos fight against the 
20year communist insurgency 
the death of col rowe signifies the firm commitment of the 
revolutionary forces to continue military actions against us 
personnel and installations as these are manifestations of the 
arrogant trampling of us imperialists on the filipino peoples 
independence and sovereignty the statement said 
rowe 51 was chief of the ground forces division of the joint 
usmilitary advisory group which provides training and 
logistical support to the philippine military 
rowe a native of mcallen texas was a decorated vietnam war 
hero who was held in a cage for five years by the viet cong as a 
prisoner of war until he escaped in 1968 
us ambassador nicholas platt called the killing a cowardly 
act 
marlin fitzwater president bushs press secretary said the 
us government will work with the philippine government to track 
down and bring to justice those responsible for this 
assassination 
police said they recovered the assailants car and traced it to 
a filipino civilian who said it was stolen on april 7 cartridges 
from bullets used in the killing littered the vehicle police said 
police said up to three cars may have been used in the ambush 
but witnesses said they saw only one carrying at least three men a 
driver and two gunmen one gunman had an m16 rifle and the other a 
45caliber pistol police said 
rowes filipino driver was wounded in the attack 
it came five days after the communist national democratic front 
said the rebels were determined to make us imperialism pay 
dearly for the continuing stay of its bases and its escalating 
intervention in our peoples affairs 
the statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing 
of a us communications station in the northern province of 
benguet on april 9 no one was hurt 
in october 1987 rebels killed three americans and a filipino 
outside clark air base 50 miles north of manila authorities then 
increased security at six us military installations and civilian 
offices in the philippines 
the us navy today ordered additional security for the 1000 
sailors on the flagship uss blue ridge of the 7th fleet the ship 
arrived friday for a fourday port call 
lt mike andrews the fleets spokesman said the sailors were 
told among other things to travel in groups and stay away from 
dark alleys 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said friday that a us travel advisory issued march 15 indicates 
areas of the country where because of criminal activity or 
terrorist activity people should try to avoid 
the advisory says most urban areas in the philippines including 
manila are safe for travelers 
boucher indicated the advisory might be revised im sure that 
will be looked at he said i would note that the threats that 
i have heard about were against official americans and werent 
general threats to travelers

former gov evan mecham can run for public office 
again despite the impeachment and conviction that ousted him a year 
ago the attorney general said 
naturally im happy about it said mecham who has already 
announced a 1990 gubernatorial bid 
its what we thought it should be he told television 
station kpnx from omaha neb 
the opinion issued friday by attorney general bob corbin is 
nonbinding and could be challenged in court but political leaders 
from both parties said they wouldnt challenge it 
i think this issue should be settled by the voters of 
arizona said phoenix developer j fife symington iii who has 
announced he will run against mecham in next years gop primary 
corbin said mecham was free to run becafice in the future the 
impeachment and conviction did not disqualify mecham automatically 
he said 
his attorney donald macpherson said that mecham originally had 
intended to take this question of the dracula clause to the 
supreme court regardless of bob corbins opinion 
the republicancontrolled senate ousted mecham on april 4 1988 
by more than the required twothirds vote but by a vote of 1713 
three short of a twothirds majority the senate failed to invoke 
the socalled dracula clause that would have driven a political 
stake through mechams heart and barred him from holding office 
again 
some legal scholars have said the senate might not have needed 
to vote on the clause because the states constitution speaks of 
ouster and disqualification in the same sentence and even if a 
separate vote was required they said a simple majority such as 
1713 might be enough 
but in his 11page opinion corbin said those who wrote the 
states constitution expected that there would be separate votes on 
ouster and disqualification 
political leaders from both parties welcomed the opinion and 
said it would be better to let mecham go ahead with his campaign 
for 1990 
i think he ought to be able to run said senate president 
robert usdane a republican who voted to oust mecham but also voted 
against the dracula clause 
i think itd be better that he not be martyred usdane added 
senate minority leader alan stephens a democrat who also voted 
for impeachment and against the dracula clause said corbins 
ruling is the right decision 
democratic gov rose mofford who succeeded mecham following his 
ouster said the attorney generals opinion would not change her 
plans to run for governor in 1990 
mecham was elected on his fifth try for governor in 1986 and was 
impeached by the house after barely a year in office 
the articles of impeachment charged mecham with concealing a 
developers campaign loan misusing state money and obstructing 
justice 
the senate convicted mecham on the misuse of funds and 
obstruction charges but deferred the obstruction charge to superior 
court where he was acquitted 
macpherson said mecham still plans to ask the state supreme 
court next month to set aside the impeachment 
we still have high hopes of either having the articles of 
impeachment dismissed which would put gov mecham immediately back 
in office or having a new trial declared macpherson said

fears for a fragile bayou environment 
were receding after officials downgraded the estimated size of a 
spill of oiltainted water to no more than 10000 gallons 
meanwhile the coast guard said an employee who was transferring 
the waste water from a barge when the spill occurred lacked proper 
certification 
the spill of socalled slop water occurred early friday on a 
loading dock on grand river about 35 miles southwest of baton 
rouge said bobby mayweather of gsx land treatment in nearby white 
castle 
the barge was carrying 900000 gallons of waste water from an 
exxon plant in houston it buckled in the middle while the waste 
was being unloaded into tanker trucks mayweather said 
authorities said the spill was quickly contained and that a 
cleanup would continue today 
exxon had paid gsx to treat and dispose of the waste at white 
castle mayweather said 
coast guard lt cmdr dean kutz said one of the companies or an 
individual could be assessed civil penalties for conducting the 
transfer without proper documentation 
coast guard chief warrant officer larry doss said gsx employee 
gordon vice didnt have the required merchant marine certification 
for the job 
rick davenport facility manager for the gsx recovery unit in 
crowley confirmed that vice was manning the operation when the 
spill occurred but he declined to comment further gsx is assuming 
responsibility for the cleanup davenport said 
the barge was leased by gsx and exxon had no responsibility for 
the shipment after it left the texas site said iberville parish 
sheriff freddie pitre 
paul dubois a spokesman for the palmer co owner of the barge 
said waste water is used to wash out tanks and ships 
louisiana state police lt ronnie jones said that according to 
exxon the waste was about 90 percent water 7 percent alcohol and 
3 percent light oil 
state police initially estimated the spill at up to 400000 
gallons while gsx estimated it at 180000 gallons exxon chemical 
spokeswoman jill johnson in dallas downgraded the estimate late 
friday to about 10000 gallons 
no one was injured in the accident but johnson said a small 
number of fish were killed at the outset 
it looked like a giant had stepped on the barge smack in the 
middle said jones oilabsorbing booms were in place shortly 
after the spill and we believe most of the waste was confined to 
the immediate area of grand river 
things could have been an awful lot worse but because of the 
waste involved and the quick response by iberville parish 
officials weve got a good handle on the situation he said

an escaped mental patient who doused 
himself with gasoline and set himself on fire in front of a closed 
abortion clinic had been arrested twice during previous protests 
there a clinic official said 
thomas valiquette 26 was in critical condition early this 
morning with thirddegree burns over his entire body at the 
vanderbilt university medical center burn center hospital 
spokesman doug williams said 
the doctor said his prognosis is not good williams said 
earl ferrell administrator of the clinic said friday 
valiquette had been arrested at the clinic during antiabortion 
protests 
he was arrested for illegally entering the clinic trying to 
disrupt the operations we could not prosecute him because he 
would have been judged incompetent to stand trial ferrell said 
valiquette escaped from the middle tennessee mental health 
institute sometime friday said nashville police detective jim 
fuqua 
my understanding is that he was at the mental health institute 
because he suffered from delusions that he could fly fuqua said 
the nashville fire marshall investigating the attempted suicide 
found antiabortion pamphlets on the man fuqua said a nurse 
asked him if he did this as a protest and he nodded he said 
valiquette was committed to the institute by general sessions 
court judge william faimon after leaping from the balcony of a 
downtown shopping arcade in june 1988 in what police described as a 
suicide attempt he suffered a severe broken arm and severe head 
injuries the tennessean reported in todays editions 
the nashville morning newspaper also reported valiquette had 
escaped at least three times before and left the institute friday 
during visiting hours 
two nashville firefighters at a station across the street saw 
valiquette walk up to the clinic but realized what he was doing too 
late to stop him 
he reached in his pocket came out with a bic lighter flicked 
it and was a human torch right before my eyes said howard cage 
a firefighter and emergency medical technician 
the two firefighters then drove an engine into the street 
we pulled off the hose and extinguished him put burn sheets 
over him and administered oxygen cage said 
ferrell said the clinic closed for renovations on feb 24 after 
state inspectors found numerous violations of fire and health 
regulations ferrell said he hopes the clinic can reopen next week 
after being the target of numerous antiabortion protests the 
clinic obtained a court injunction limiting the number of 
protesters ferrel said 
im really sorry this happened this is something that all of 
us sure want to avoid ferrell said 
for any sound thinking person they will realize this person 
was incompetent i think and it should have no effect on 
proabortion or antiabortion debate ferrell said

demonstrators gathered today to 
protest a nearby white supremacist conference but many people who 
oppose racism stayed away out of fear of violence 
law enforcement officers meanwhile made plans to head off any 
potential confrontations between the two groups 
as many as 2000 demonstrators were expected to march in the 
sevenmile walk for racial equality which is planned to end 
two miles from the aryan nations compound site of the conference 
of neonazi youths 
sheriffs deputies and officers from the idaho state police and 
coeur dalene police planned a show of force around the antiracism 
marchers to discourage confrontations 
weve established what we feel to be tactics that are going to 
ensure the safety of all the parties involved said capt tom 
dickson 
fewer than 100 neonazi youths were believed to be staying at 
the 30acre ranch of richard butler founder of the church of jesus 
christ christian aryan nations a white supremacist organization 
that wants to turn the northwest into a whites only homeland 
butler said white supremacist leaders including ku klux klan 
officials will speak and conduct workshops 
sheriffs deputies set up checkpoints friday on roads leading to 
the camp a few miles north of coeur dalene to check 
identifications of people entering the area 
lisa anderson organizer of citizens for nonviolent action 
against racism the coeur dalenebased group sponsoring the march 
said she expected few problems 
although the march has been endorsed by the rev jesse jacksons 
rainbow coalition the new jewish agenda and washington gov booth 
gardner groups such as the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
were staying away 
marvin stern regional adl director in seattle said his group 
was concerned about placing an additional burden on law enforcement 
and a potential for violence 
idaho gov cecil andrus also refused to endorse the march 
saying it could promote violence and give the neonazis more 
publicity 
in a statement issued friday andrus lashed out at the skinheads 
the people of idaho stand united against hate groups and those 
who would spread a message of fear and intolerance he said 
leaders of organizations formed during the past decade to combat 
the aryan nations planned a picnic and other events a few miles 
away from the white supremacist gathering 
we think that a march just does them too much honor and 
respect said norm gissell chairman of the kootenai county task 
force on human relations

as many as 150000 students and their supporters 
waving fists and chanting long live freedom demonstrated today 
against the communist system as chinas leaders watched from behind 
a wall of soldiers 
facing more than 8000 troops students shouted down with 
dictatorship down with corruption while top members of the 
communist party hierarchy filed out of a funeral for ousted party 
chief hu yaobang 
the protest in tiananmen square the symbolic political center 
of china was one of the clearest rejections ever of the communist 
system by chinas increasingly disaffected youth it also marked 
the culmination of a weeklong commemoration of hus death last 
saturday 
during 15 hours of demonstrations that featured no major 
incidents the students waved colored prodemocracy banners and 
turned the plaza into a sea of red and white banners 
the students confronted chinas leaders as they filed into a 
memorial service for hu in the great hall chanting antigovernment 
slogans hu who died of a heart attack was 73 
the turnout was one of the largest in china since the communist 
victory over the nationalists in 1949 and the biggest in 13 years 
when the death of premier chou enlai sparked an outpouring of 
grief and anger toward the leftist government and an end to the 
196676 cultural revolution 
but major differences with the bloody spontaneous 1976 protest 
remained todays protest left few people injured and was well 
organized 
the government has rejected all the students demands including 
greater freedom of speech and press more money for education 
disclosure of the incomes of top officials and reassessment of hus 
historical role 
when the students ended their demonstration they departed 
peacefully in groups that represented about 30 universities in 
beijing and other cities 
in shanghai about 1500 people marched through downtown also 
to commemorate hus death earlier today about 2000 students 
marched on the campus of east normal university 
in beijing the traffic was stopped along changan boulevard the 
capitals main avenue and people climbed trees to get a better 
view of the procession 
the students said they would go back to their campuses and 
boycott classes 
when the 4000 officials attending the ceremony started to 
arrive this morning the students let out a roar waved their 
banners and raised their fingers in vforvictory salutes 
some officials protected by a triple line of military troops 
stopped momentarily to listen 
during the ceremony party general secretary zhao ziyang praised 
his predecessor saying as a marxist hu yaobang led a glorious 
life 
hu was forced to resign in disgrace in january 1987 after being 
accused by party conservatives of being soft on student 
demonstrators and western liberal ideas 
zhaos 10minute speech before a large portrait of hu draped in 
black bunting made no specific mention of hus ouster and did not 
as demanded by the students attempt to reassess hus performance 
zhao said only that hu was a man brave enough to admit his 
mistakes and to insist upon what he thought was right he never 
tried to hold back his opinions 
some of the aging ideologues who are believed to have engineered 
hus ouster did not attend the ceremony among those absent were 
former president li xiannian former politburo member bo yibo and 
former party propaganda chief deng liqun 
senior leader deng xiaoping 84 looking tired and fragile 
circled the glassencased casket and shook hands with hus family 
and wife li zhao hus body was clad in a western suit and draped 
with a red communist party flag 
flags were flown at halfstaff on tiananmen square and in front 
of the communist party headquarters scene of a clash between 
demonstrators and police earlier this week 
the official xinhua news agency said 1 million people some in 
crowds five deep lined the streets to watch the motorcade that 
carried hus body to the babaoshan state cemetery in western 
beijing for cremation 
it said people carried banners reading farewell comrade 
yaobang and yaobang well always remember you 
zhaos speech was broadcast over loudspeakers on the square but 
the students paid little attention 
as soon as he finished they resumed their chants of long live 
democracy as officials descended the steps of the great hall 
they shouted we demand dialogue and come down li peng 
li chinas premier is a technocrat regarded as lukewarm toward 
economic and political reforms he has said that social stability 
must take priority in china and that excessive democracy would 
harm the nation 
unlike the soviet union which has held direct parliamentary 
elections and given its press greater freedom china has taken the 
lead in economic reforms it has taken only small cautious steps 
to make its political system more open

the man identified as the principal suspect 
in a dozen drugrelated torture slayings in mexico near the us 
border denied he was the killer but said he may have information on 
the deaths officials said 
hector fragoso burgueno 45 was held without bond friday at the 
federal correctional center after his arrest late thursday at a 
mobile home in an isolated area about 30 miles west of tucson 
hes the principal one according to the witnesses said 
enrique cecena zone commander with the judicial police of the 
mexican state of sonora 
mexican federal and state authorities will file formal requests 
for fragosos return to mexico officials said 
gerard murphy a drug enforcement administration special agent 
said fragoso has made statements extricating himself from any 
culpability in the murders in agua prieta however he has said 
that he may be able to provide information that authorities are not 
aware of 
fragoso was found with a woman identified as his wife anna 
marie fragoso scott coffin deputy chief agent for the us border 
patrol in tucson said fragoso was being held as an illegal alien 
under a federal immigration arrest warrant his wife could be 
voluntarily deported to mexico officials said 
fragoso owned the ranch near the mexican border town of agua 
prieta where the bodies were found on march 29 and april 1 he had 
shaved his moustache changed his hair style and altered his 
eyebrows but it didnt help him we recognized him right away 
said pima county sheriffs maj dennis douglas 
douglas said investigators found fragoso after getting various 
tips including some from a local crime hotline and from the tv 
show americas most wanted which had a segment sunday on 
fragoso 
authorities were investigating whether the agua prieta killings 
were linked to the slayings of five people whose bodies were found 
in a tucson shed shortly before the agua prieta bodies were 
discovered 
cecena said 11 of the agua prieta victims apparently were killed 
after they witnessed the murder of one person 
the border patrol said fragoso has an extensive arrest history 
ranging from drug and weapons violations to assault sexual assault 
and robbery 
like the unrelated ritual slayings of 15 people in matamoros 
discovered last week authorities consider the agua prieta killings 
to be drugrelated

residents angered by governmentimposed 
price increases defied a curfew and rioted in this town near amman 
today king hussein cut short an overseas trip and headed home from 
the united states 
eight people have been killed in the violence that began 
tuesday and the presidents of jordans professional associations 
called on hussein to withdraw the armed forces from towns and 
villages to prevent further bloodshed 
they said in a statement that the government had set a bad 
example in implementing austerity measures and called for elections 
for a new government 
hussein will return to the worst unrest in his country since his 
army put down violence by palestinian guerrillas in 1971 
the rioting began tuesday in the south the bedrock of his 
support in response to price increases of 10 percent to 50 percent 
on gasoline cigarettes heating oil and other commodities 
by thursday night the violence had spread to the north 
on friday rioters in the northern town of salt threw rocks at 
police and looted buildings they shouted support for hussein but 
called for the ouster of prime minister zaid rifai whom they blame 
for austerity measures and declining living standards 
after the rioting children played inside shattered offices and 
hundreds of people milled around on the glassstrewn streets in the 
city of 100000 about 10 miles north of amman no injuries were 
reported in todays riots 
we are fed up with this government they have stolen all our 
money said a man in his 60s who refused to give his name he 
said demonstrators trust the kings leadership and we know he 
will respond 
king hussein who was on a state visit to washington canceled 
his trip to britain that was set for today and because of the 
rioting instead will return home the jordanian embassy in london 
said 
the first riots occurred in the southern city of maan where the 
government said four civilians and one police officer were killed 
three other people were reported killed in mazar 55 miles south of 
amman 
on friday troops banned moslems from attending weekly prayers 
in mosques in maan and other southern cities in an attempt to 
prevent more unrest 
cancellation of friday prayers is highly unusual in an islamic 
country the koran islams holy book calls on moslems to 
participate in the ceremony and most take it as a binding duty 
staterun jordan television broadcast an appeal to jordanians on 
friday night to end the violence and for the first time showed 
pictures of smashed buildings and destroyed vehicles 
these are the services which the government tried to provide 
for the whole country and we paid with our tears and with our 
sweat and with our blood to have them built said mohammed amin 
the jordan television director who narrated the 20minute program 
these were destroyed by a bunch of terrorists 
amin said the damage only would add to jordans economic 
problems because now we have added pressure 
the government announced the price increases sunday as part of 
an agreement with the international monetary fund to reschedule 
jordans 6 billion foreign debt they came on top of rising 
unemployment and soaring inflation 
israeli radio and tv reported the difficulties to instigate 
problems amin said and news agencies are exaggerating the 
picture of the situation 
government officials earlier hinted that moslem fundamentalists 
had inflamed the unrest most of the rioting has involved native 
jordanians not the palestinian half of the population

automatic teller machines helped 
police track down a winery worker accused of murdering seven 
people including his wife and two daughters 
the sonoma county sheriffs office persuaded wells fargo bank to 
extend unlimited credit to ramon salcido and arranged to track him 
through any transactions made with his automatic teller card said 
sheriff dick michaelsen 
a tip from salcidos sister and brotherinlaw in mexico also 
helped authorities find him the san francisco chronicle reported 
today citing unidentified us diplomatic and law enforcement 
sources 
salcido 28 who also is accused of killing his motherinlaw 
and her two daughters and a coworker at the winery where he was a 
forklift operator was arraigned on murder charges friday after 
being captured in mexico 
salcido was reported to have run out of bank funds last week 
while on a cocaineandalcohol binge that friends said preceded the 
april 14 slaughter 
he tried to use a bank card at least once at a wells fargo 
branch that morning in san rafael 30 miles south and possibly 
again later in san francisco while heading for mexico authorities 
said 
the manhunt ended wednesday when salcido was arrested in western 
mexico near his hometown of los mochis 
a spokesman for the sheriffs department citing a gag order 
imposed by a judge on friday would not comment on the report about 
family members tipping off police 
salcido who also is charged with three counts of attempted 
murder appeared in court friday in handcuffs and a bulletproof 
vest he did not enter a plea but will return to court may 5 he 
could get the death penalty if convicted 
salcidos attorney chief public defender marteen miller said he 
expected salcido would enter a plea of innocent by reason of 
insanity he added that he would have his client undergo 
psychiatric and neurological tests 
i expect to find some brain lesion or tumor said miller 
who called the crimes so bizarre so incomprehensible 
god i hope i find something said miller who also planned 
to ask that the trial be moved because of all the publicity the 
case has received 
the prosecutor however discounted speculation that the rampage 
was fueled in part by alcohol and cocaine us and said he believed 
salcido is legally sane 
the final decision about his state of mind will be made in 
court said district attorney gene tunney those were not the 
acts of an irrational berserker 
after his arrest salcido told mexican television reporters and 
law enforcement agents he killed his americanborn wife angela 
24 and a winery coworker tracy toovey in a jealous rage 
believing toovey and his wife were romantically involved according 
to federal officials 
also killed in the series of attacks across the sonoma valley 40 
miles north of san francisco were salcidos motherinlaw and his 
two sistersinlaw 8 and 12 
salcido also is accused of killing two daughters 1 and 4 who 
were found dead at a dump april 15 their throats had been slashed 
another daughter carmina who turns 3 on monday also was found 
at the dump with a slashed throat but is recovering and has

walesa came to italy seeking economic investment in poland and 
the blessing of fellow pole pope john paul ii for the countrys new

prime minister noboru takeshita received a 378000 
loan in 1987 from the company at the center of a growing bribery 
scandal japanese news media reported today 
takeshita who heads the governing liberal democratic party 
received the loan from recruit co and repaid it several months 
later kyodo news service and the japan broadcasting corp said 
they said officials in takeshitas office confirmed the loan but 
did not disclose the terms of its repayment 
takeshita did not mention the loan when he told a parliament 
committee on april 11 that he had received more than 1 million in 
political donations from recruit between 1985 and 1987 
recruit an information services company is suspected of using 
political donations and other financial transactions to gain favors 
from politicians and bureaucrats 
although pressure on takeshita to step down to appease public 
and opposition criticism over the scandal has grown in the past 
week a lack of strong candidates untainted by the scandal makes 
takeshitas resignation problematic 
virtually none of the most influential liberal democratic 
leaders could take over from takeshita says takeshi sasaki 
political science professor at tokyo university 
there is a leadership vacuum theres literally nobody 
powerful who has not been tainted by the scandal said robert m 
orr professor of political science at temple university in tokyo 
the opposition is demanding that takeshita resign and that 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone testify in parliament on 
his own role in the recruit affair 
a survey by the nationwide newspaper mainichi shimbun released 
friday showed that 357 percent of liberal democratic party members 
in japans parliament responding to the poll think takeshita should 
resign 
takeshita and nakasone are among 17 politicians who reportedly 
benefited from unlisted cutrate shares in a realestate 
subsidiary of recruit the shares sold by the company to about 160 
influential politicians public officials and businessmen produced 
substantial profits for the recipients after overthecounter 
trading began in october 1986 
although the transactions were not illegal they aroused 
suspicions of bribery and influencepeddling the result was an 
outcry over fundraising practices and the cozy relationship 
between businessmen and politicians

the supreme court hears arguments this week on 
limiting or even ending womens abortion rights but the battle 
is sure to continue no matter what is decided in the missouri case 
before the justices 
the dispute over the missouri abortionregulation law for which 
arguments will be conducted wednesday has become one of historys 
most closely watched high court cases 
there are two reasons 
missouri officials and the bush administration are urging the 
court to use the case to overturn or substantially limit the 
landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
even if the court does not accept that invitation and decides 
the missouri case narrowly the decision expected in july will 
be viewed as a barometer of the current courts commitment to the 
16yearold ruling in roe vs wade 
if roe is reversed the nations whole political landscape 
could change said kate michelman executive director of the 
national abortion rights action league state by state our goal 
would be obtaining a legislative right to abortion making the lack 
of any constitutional right irrelevant 
she added it no longer would be acceptable for any politician 
to be antichoice 
reversal of the 1973 ruling would allow states to more 
stringently restrict access to abortions or even ban virtually all 
abortions 
james bopp general counsel of the antiabortion national right 
to life committee said roe vs wade is doomed at some point in 
the foreseeable future but the prochoice people are laying the 
legal groundwork for other attacks on restrictions already arguing 
that they amount to genderbased discrimination or involuntary 
servitude 
and if the 1973 decision emerges unscathed by the courts 
decision in the missouri case 
we in the prochoice movement would still be vulnerable 
michelman said in a recent interview 
laurie ann ramsey director of education for americans united 
for life agreed reversal by 1992 is part of our strategic plan 
if not in the missouri case then in the next she said we 
want to keep as many cases in the pipeline as possible 
michelmans apprehension and ramseys confidence stem from 
changes in the high courts membership since it ruled by a 72 
vote in 1973 that women have a constitutional right to abortion 
only three members of the original roe vs wade majority remain 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall each has supported the 1973 decision in subsequent 
rulings 
justice john paul stevens who joined the court in 1975 is a 
dependable proroe ally 
the two 1973 dissenters nowchief justice william h rehnquist 
and justice byron r white still oppose the ruling 
any significant retreat from roe vs wade will have to attract 
the courts three most junior justices sandra day oconnor 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
all are appointees of former president ronald reagan an 
outspoken critic of the high courts abortion rulings 
oconnor criticized the rationale of roe vs wade while 
dissenting from a 1986 decision striking down certain abortion 
regulations in pennsylvania but it is unknown whether she 
disagrees with the core holding of the 1973 decision that women 
have a fundamental right to abortion 
scalia and kennedy have not yet ruled in any abortion case but 
many believe both favor cutting back abortion rights 
justice oconnor is the key narals michelman said we 
wrote our friendofthecourt brief to speak to sandra day 
oconnor 
dawn johnsen the naral legal director who wrote the brief 
said if we are going to win its likely to be by one vote 
thats not the kind of victory with which one can be comfortable 
in all the justices received a record 78 friendofthecourt 
briefs the judicial branchs equivalent of lobbying from 
interested individuals and organizations not actually involved of 
the missouri dispute 
the justices often give such unsolicited advice close attention 
the same cannot be said however for the tens of thousands of 
letters and hundreds of telephone calls the court is receiving 
daily from americans expressing their views on abortion 
this is not a popularity contest court spokeswoman toni 
house said this is a war of ideas not numbers 
if a war it is one with no end in sight

she favored giving states more authority in regulating abortions 
and criticized the legal approach taken by blackmun in 1973 but 
she has never said that women do not have a constitutional right to 
abortion 
justice antonin scalia 52 he never participated in an 
abortion case as a federal appeals court judge and since joining 
the high court in 1986 has taken no public stand on abortion 
justice anthony m kennedy 52 although a federal appeals 
court judge for 12 years before joining the court last year he 
never has ruled in an abortion case nor has he stated his views 
publicly on the issue

the historic 101st congress is out of sorts 
the institution began its bicentennial year pledging to 
cooperate with a new president and touting an ambitious legislative 
agenda 
but lawmakers have spent their first four months killing a 
50percent pay raise in embarrassment flinging morals charges at 
defense secretary nominee john tower and investigating the ethics 
of their highestranking official house speaker jim wright 
this is worse than the peoples court said rep david 
mccurdy dokla likening the institution to the television 
tribunal the pay raise john tower jim wright im baffled 
whats going on i dont think any incumbent comes out looking very 
good after this sideshow 
by the end of last week congress had met seven fewer days this 
year than it had by the same date in 1987 the beginning of the 
100th congress sixteen laws have been enacted this year none of 
them major and 10 of them commemorative measures like national 
agriculture day 
beyond the statistics theres a widespread sense that congress 
has been sleepwalking through its legislative paces this year 
distracted and preoccupied by its own internal problems 
were tired of a donothing congress said rep mickey 
edwards rokla as house republicans last week accused majority 
democrats of ignoring important legislation we demand that the 
democrats bring these issues before the house so we can do the 
job we were elected to do 
the implication is that wright and his top lieutenants are so 
busy playing defense against the 69 rules violations alleged 
against the speaker that they have lost their legislative compass 
democratic leaders who are responsible for the capitols 
output disagree and point to bipartisan agreements with the bush 
administration on the budget and aid to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels and to legislation on the minimum wage savings and loans 
and military base closings 
while everybody would like to see the wright matter resolved 
as quickly as possible the function of the house is proceeding 
said rep tom foley dwash the majority leader the speaker is 
moving important legislative matters its not true that the house 
of representatives is in a gridlock condition 
congresses are notoriously slowstarting especially in the 
first session of a twoyear term and hill leaders did bide their 
time for the early part of the year waiting for bush administration 
budget proposals appointments and legislative initiatives 
even at that the year so far has been less productive than most 
while the budget agreement does add some oil to the legislative 
machinery it failed to seriously address the nations deficit 
problem and the base closings action was merely a ratification of 
steps taken last year by an independent commission that took the 
political heat off congress 
it is a confluence of what would be the normal slowness added 
to by some distractions said christopher deering a political 
scientist at george washington university and close observer of the 
legislative process that has conspired to make this in 
appearance especially a slow start instead of substance theyve 
had to focus on sidelights 
the most blinding current sidelight is the wright investigation 
last week the ethics committee formally charged the texas 
democrat with 69 instances of violating house rules lawyers for 
wright and the committee are fencing over arrangements for the 
speaker to appear and mount a personal defense before the panel 
and it appears the case will drag on for at least a few more weeks 
one aspect of the case a complicated oil well transaction which 
yielded wright huge profits last year remains under investigation 
and could yet cause additional problems for the speaker waiting in 
the wings is a separate ethics case against wright alleging that 
he improperly disclosed a covert cia operation in nicaragua 
republicans say they plan to press the matter 
hes shark bait right now and thats not fun said mccurdy 
this is a crazy process 
on the house floor and in corners all around the capitol wright 
has replaced tower and the pay raise as the prime topic of 
conversation theyre talking about it every second said rep 
beryl anthony dark even democratic senators worried about their 
partys image have taken a rare interest in what happens on the 
other side of the building 
one house democrat rep bill richardson of new mexico said the 
mood of his colleagues is at its lowest ebb in years 
theres been a slowdown and a morale loss richardson said 
its a very bleak period ive been in congress seven years and 
ive never felt so bad and down about being a member of congress 
wrights defenders call the charges that he failed to report 
145000 in improper gifts from a friend with a direct interest in 
legislation and sought to evade limits on outside income through 
bulk sales of a book he wrote trivial and the reaction to them 
overblown 
it should be beneath the dignity of this house to question 
that kind of thing said rep james scheuer dny there is a 
certain sense of outrage that this process has taken on a life of 
its own that was never intended 
wright himself has sought to maintain a normal schedule but 
with varying results much of his days lately have been consumed by 
meetings with his lawyer william c oldaker and with political 
allies plotting defense strategy wrights normally daily press 
conferences have become less frequent 
at one recent one at which reporters peppered him with ethics 
questions he finally asked in exasperation do you have any 
questions about the government of the united states

soviet defense spending rose 3 percent last 
year despite president mikhail s gorbachevs promises to cut his 
military budget according to an intelligence report released 
sunday 
but the study prepared jointly by the cia and the pentagons 
defense intelligence agency also said gorbachev was laying the 
groundwork for his proposed 142 percent cut in defense spending 
the study said chopping military spending so sharply would 
require the soviets to reduce their armed forces by more than the 
500000troop reduction announced by gorbachev last december 
meaning further cutbacks in the soviet military 
the newly declassified report painted a grim overall picture of 
the soviet economy it said gorbachev had been forced to slow the 
pace of his economic reforms and to delay such key steps as 
allowing the market to set wholesale and retail prices 
while the reforms have a good chance of success in the long run 
they are likely to cause gorbachev short term political problems 
from consumers who want to see faster improvement and from 
bureaucrats who resent their loss of power over economic 
decisionmaking the report said 
the economy was hampered by sluggish industrial and agricultural 
performance disruptions and confusion stemming from gorbachevs 
reforms and the cost of coping with the earthquake that struck 
armenia last december the report said 
according to our estimates the soviet economy grew by only 
about 15 percent in 1988 the second straight poor yearly 
showing the study said 
the cost of rebuilding armenia will exceed the estimated 112 
billion price tag of cleaning up after the 1986 chernobyl nuclear 
reactor disaster the cia predicted 
all these factors contributed to a budget deficit that the cia 
estimated at 9 percent of the soviet gross national product which 
is the value of all goods and services produced by an economy last 
year the kremlin admitted for the first time that it was running a 
deficit although estimates of the amount varied among soviet 
economists 
poor economic performance has forced gorbachev to back away from 
some programs and the need to provide consumer goods was impelling 
him to decrease defense spending the report said 
soviet media indicated that the campaigns to modernize 
industrial plant and equipment and reform the economic system and 
even the once muchvaunted antialcohol campaign were not only 
failing but were occasioning major disruptions it said 
gorbachev remains committed to his original vision of a 
revitalized economy the report said he has however 
apparently concluded that he cannot realize this vision as rapidly 
as he once thought possible nor proceed directly along the path he 
initially planned to follow 
the shifts that gorbachev has implemented in our view have 
the potential if sustained to boost consumer welfare and bring a 
sense of order to the economy the report said 
gorbachev has acknowledged that consumer welfare must be 
substantially improved soon if the regime is to develop broadbased 
popular support for perestroika as the reforms are called in 
russian it said 
that will mean a 142 percent cut in defense spending gorbachev 
announced in january the first time he put a firm number on cuts 
that had been discussed as part of a new military doctrine known as 
reasonable sufficiency 
despite proclamation of the new defensive military doctrine 
over the past two years soviet defense spending as measured in 
constant 1982 rubles grew by roughly 3 percent in line with the 
growth rates of the past several years the cia said 
procurement of weapons systems was again a major contributor 
to growth the cia said missile procurement particularly 
icbms intercontinental ballistic missiles and strategic 
surfacetoair missiles also displayed growth 
last year however gorbachev took several actions that 
evidently were intended to lay the groundwork for future military 
cuts the report said 
key points of gorbachevs plan to cut military spending remain 
unclear the report said and may involve substantially larger 
cuts than the 500000 troop reduction announced last december 
indeed our estimates indicate that to reduce their total 
defense budget by 142 percent the soviets would have to go beyond 
the cutbacks in military programs that they have specifically 
promised to make

the heartwrenching news from a distant 
ocean the vigil while the names of the dead trickle in the 
playing of taps for the fallen these are not new to townspeople 
here who cheer for the navys victories and cry for its defeats 
none of the 47 sailors killed in a gun turret explosion 
wednesday on the battleship uss iowa listed the area as their 
hometown yet the people here are claiming them as their own just 
as they have done so many times before when death strikes a 
norfolkbased ship 
there isnt an us or them even when the tragedy strikes 
far away from here it is felt here that ship is part of our 
community said mayor joseph leafe 
overnight the norfolknewport newshampton metropolitan area of 
13 million became a small town in schools shops bars and on the 
streets the topic of conversation was the iowa who was aboard 
who had word who was helping who had lost someone 
its hard to find anybody in any walk of life in this area 
that didnt start out in the navy said donald smith a 
sociologist at old dominion university with this areas long 
history as the worlds largest naval facility the impact goes 
deeper young people get out of the navy they seem to stay around 
here 
the militarys influence is seen throughout hampton roads as 
the area where the james and elizabeth rivers meet the chesapeake 
bay is known 
the economic relationship between the military and civilian 
sectors is a very close one said wolfgang pindur director of 
research for old dominions college of business and public 
administration the military is the major employer that isolates 
us from any downward trends in the economy 
the area has 138000 active military men and women and 65000 
military retirees according to government statistics the annual 
payroll and federal spending for the area is 553 billion newport 
news shipbuilding which is building nuclear aircraft carriers is 
the states biggest private employer 
by comparison tourism the areas other major industry brings 
in about 13 billion 
while the civilianmilitary economic marriage seems a sweet one 
socially there has always been some friction 
there are tales of sailors and dogs keep off the grass signs 
appearing during world war ii local officials say the signs never 
existed or if they did they were someones poor idea of a joke 
navy men however have been denied service in bars or made to 
pay exorbitant cover charges in every case when the practice 
became known it ceased 
its a lovehate relationship especially with the younger 
military men there are a lot of kids in town and they do what all 
kids do and sometimes they get into trouble said pindur 
its a pain sometimes to have all these kids running loose but 
at the same time there is an appreciation for what they do there 
job is to protect us 
smith said some of the friction is based on class differences 
lets face it the majority of these navy kids are from 
loweror workingclass families he said for them the navy 
was a way out 
but the tension disappears in times of triumph or tragedy 
we are a navy community pindur said there is a deep 
empathy for things that happen to navy folks 
the rev david lassalle who delivered a short homily friday at 
a service organized by the city in tribute to the dead gestured 
toward the workmen setting up the podium on the elizabeth river 
waterfront the police honor guard officers rehearsing their 
entrance and the people quietly gathering 
words dont always say enough but the actions of today 
perhaps they say even if we didnt know their faces or their names 
those men were ours he said

richard m daleys march to city hall by 
defeating two blacks has left the black vote in disarray and has 
many wondering whether daleys inauguration monday will be his 
first and only or the first of many 
daley son of the last of the bigcity bosses ended blacks 
sixyear grip on the mayoralty by soundly beating acting mayor 
eugene sawyer in februarys democratic primary and by doing the 
same to alderman timothy evans six weeks later 
daley will complete the last two years of the second term of the 
citys first black mayor harold washington who died in 1987 
daleys father richard j daley won six consecutive terms 
whether the younger daley is in for the long term may depend less 
on his own actions than on whether black voters can regroup after 
splintering between sawyer and evans 
we knew what the stakes were this time around and we let it 
get away from us once so im taking a dismal view of things 
for the future said lu palmer an influential black radio 
commentator and political activist 
i dont see any possibility of winning the mayors office back 
by 1991 and lets face it if daley gets a foothold then he 
said the office is probably his until the year 
2000andsomething 
most election postmortems have centered on the low black 
turnout that crippled both sawyer and evans despite the efforts of 
former democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson on behalf of 
both 
the ensuing debate among blacks has centered on whether they 
should spend their time on the sidelines developing a black 
independent party as palmer suggests or try to rebuild the 
multiracial coalition that lifted washington to power in 1983 and 
made him the first mayor since the elder daley to be reelected 
the reason harold won and make no mistake about it is 
because he was able to graft liberal whites and hispanics onto that 
huge bloc said clarence page a black who is a member of the 
chicago tribunes editorial board 
it doesnt have to be tomorrow but blacks should begin the 
process of looking for a candidate to do that to suggest they 
sit on the sidelines and wait until the numbers grow enough to go 
it alone is just shortsighted 
the city has roughly equal numbers of blacks and whites but 
whites make up about 49 percent of the electorate compared with 
about 43 percent for blacks 
don rose a veteran political strategist who held top posts in 
the washington and evans campaigns said daley won because a lot 
of white liberals and people who joined washingtons reform 
movement were willing to give him a chance and because a lot of 
blacks didnt feel a sufficient amount of outrage and didnt vote 
what daley has to do now is make good on his campaign promises 
to be inclusive racially and ethnically in terms of appointments 
and contracts and promote reformminded legislation rose said 
if he doesnt the movement had better be ready

two military space shuttle flights 
planned next summer will be delayed one for at least three months 
because work on the shuttle columbia is taking longer than expected 
nasa said friday the schedule had become too tight to support 
both missions and still preserve an october launch for the 
highpriority galileo flight to jupiter 
a discovery launch that had been scheduled for aug 10 will be 
delayed until at least november columbia which had a july 1 
launch target will be launched in early august the space agency 
said 
both missions are to deploy classified defense department 
payloads 
unaffected will be fridays planned liftoff of atlantis with the 
magellanvenus spacecraft on board the first planetbound payload 
scheduled for release from a space shuttle 
the schedule changes will have a ripple effect on launch dates 
later in the year leaving nasa with six instead of its goal of 
seven shuttle launches this year 
officials have said the planned oct 12 liftoff of atlantis with 
the jupiterorbiting galileo spacecraft is a highpriority flight 
because there is only a 40day launch period during which jupiter 
and earth are aligned properly so it will be next in line after 
columbias august mission 
then will come the delayed discovery military flight probably 
in november and a flight probably in december in which 
columbias crew is to deploy a communications satellite and 
retrieve a science satellite which has been orbiting since 1984 
the mission of discovery with the hubble space telescope long 
awaited by astronomers will slip from its present december launch 
slot into 1990 
nasa said dates for missions after the galileo flight will be 
determined later 
nasa management has become increasingly concerned that the 
work involved in preparing the orbiter columbia for its first 
flight in over three years is taking long enough that it might 
endanger the option to launch galileo at the opening of the launch 
window said shuttle chief richard h truly our overriding 
objectives in this situation are to protect the galileo window and 
to fly columbia as early as we can 
following the challenger explosion in january 1986 the shuttle 
fleet was grounded for 32 months while the three remaining orbiters 
underwent major modifications to improve safety and performance 
the modified discovery has made two flights since the accident 
and atlantis is about to make its second 
besides the challengerdictated changes columbia the first 
shuttle and a veteran of seven space trips also had to undergo 
extensive alterations to its thermal protection tile system and is 
the last one to be returned to flight status 
the columbia work is taking longer than planned because of a 
shortage of skilled engineers and technicians to process three 
shuttles simultaneously

the day lebanons civil war began its 
15th year 69 people were killed or wounded most were civilians 
the casualties were caused by an estimated 25000 shells and 
rockets fired by christian and moslem forces that day april 13 
the figures indicate it took 362 shells and rockets to inflict one 
casualty 
thats about average in the daily battles between mainly 
christian units of lebanons army long fractured along sectarian 
lines and an alliance of syrian forces and moslem druse militiamen 
it costs the syrian army about 120000 every time it fires a 
broadside from one of its 40barrel 240mm rocket launchers into 
christian east beirut 
it costs gen michael aouns christian army units about the same 
to lob a similar number of 155mm howitzer shells into moslem zones 
but there is no shortage of guns or ammunition among lebanons 
warring factions who are well supplied by regional powers who use 
lebanon to fight their rivals by proxy 
leftist and moslem militias are armed and bankrolled by syria 
libya and iran their christian rivals get their usmade weapons 
from iraq and israel 
its a strange war there are no ground assaults no one gains 
territory or loses it both sides deeply entrenched just hammer 
each other usually with longrange weapons 
the current round of fighting the worst in four years started 
march 8 since then by police count more than 270 people have 
been killed and nearly 1000 wounded 
despite the intensity of the shelling with 50 shells and 
rockets a minute falling in the worst barrages the casualty toll 
is surprisingly low 
the reason is that after 14 years of civil war and factional 
bloodletting the lebanese have developed a sixth sense about when 
trouble is near they know to head for underground bunkers and 
basements 
for those who havent developed that sense the signal to take 
cover is the theme song from the movie shaft on the radio the 
isaac hayes tune always precedes flashes on where shells are 
falling 
beirutis know that when their side starts firing a retaliatory 
barrage is inevitable 
when the big fuel depot on the christian side was hit a few days 
ago sending up a huge fireball and destroying virtually all 
lebanons fuel supplies the radio advised everyone living near the 
blazing facility to get away in case other fuel tanks blew 
a distraught christian mother of three told how she rushed out 
of her apartment with her family amid the thud of exploding shells 
nearby 
it was only when she reached her brothers house in the 
neighboring hazmieh district that she realized shed left her son 
with a neighbor 
three hours later the 10yearold boy showed up he had walked 
three miles under heavy shelling without a scratch 
those were the worst hours of my life said the young woman 
she did not want to be identified because my husband works 
abroad and i dont want him to hear about this 
but despite their wellhoned survival instincts people are 
sometimes caught off guard 
a young moslem named jamal was killed by shrapnel as he drove 
his family from his home in the south beirut district of ouzai to 
west beirut to be with his elderly mother during a lull a few days 
ago his neighbors said 
a 25yearold druse student just back from west germany where 
he majored in computer science was killed when he visited a 
militia base manned by fighters of druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party 
wed asked him to teach us how to use communications 
equipment a fighter said a shell landed close to where we 
were standing and he was killed 
the bunkers have become second homes for many families for many 
beirutis life underground is austere and cramped power plants 
have been hit or shut down because fuel has run out 
fires rage out of control because the water pumping system 
doesnt work because theres no power 
several families are often crammed into reinforced basements for 
days on end eating from stockpiles of canned food and water 
sleeping as best they can by the light of kerosene lamps or candles 
for the welloff bunker life can be almost comfortable 
fourteen christian families living in the adonis district of 
east beirut have constructed a luxury twostory bunker under their 
apartment block 
one of them furniture store owner hanna breidi has fitted it 
with walltowall carpets 10 double beds armchairs refrigerators 
and a small gambling salon 
they also have two color television sets with video recorders 
and radio telephones which operate independently of their 
generator there are video games for the children 
the fridge is stocked with smoked salmon hams imported 
cheeses steaks and wine 
the families maids mostly sri lankans and filipinas live on 
the first floor below ground level

congress may be asked to bail out numerous 
corporations that will be forced into bankruptcy in the next 
recession because of excessive debt the chairman of the senate 
finance committee said saturday 
lloyd bentsen dtexas said a study that shows a spectacular 
increase in the amount of highrisk junk bond debt since 1980 
makes him worry about the possibility of a taxpayer bailout similar 
to the multibillion dollar rescue of the nations troubled savings 
and loans 
bentsen said the library of congress study tells us that the 
amount of corporate debt is going through the roof and that the 
quality of corporate debt is going through the floor 
in 1980 one out of 25 bonds was below investment grade today 
it is one out of five bentsen said corporate debt has tripled 
since 1980 
when we see another recession and ultimately we will 
youre going to see that recession deeper and longer because of 
this great increase in debt and some of these highly leveraged 
corporations said bentsen 
and then youll see so many of them going bankrupt that youll 
begin to hear cries for having the taxpayers going in and bailing 
them out like we had to do on the savings and loan industry and 
that gives me very deep concern bentsen said 
the study said more than 30 billion in junk bonds was issued in 
the last three years accounting for more than 20 percent of 
outstanding corporate debt 
bentsen said his committee would be examining a way of limiting 
the attractiveness of corporate debt

cuba has been officially atheist since the communist revolution 
30 years ago but the holy see and the vatican have maintained 
diplomatic relations 
last month the pope applauded improvements in the churchs 
ability to carry out its mission in cuba but made no mention of a 
possible visit

communist rebels claimed 
responsibility saturday for killing a us army colonel who advised 
this countrys military and officials fearing more attacks 
bolstered security for us forces 
philippine troops near the six us military installations in 
the country were reinforced and put on maximum alert immediately 
after col james nick rowe was slain friday according to gen 
renato de villa the philippine armys chief of staff rowes 
filipino driver was wounded 
communist assassins in a stolen car sprayed rowes vehicle with 
bullets while he was on his way to work in suburban quezon city 
the killers escaped 
the 51yearold rowe who was a prisoner of war in vietnam 
served as chief of the ground forces division of the joint 
usmilitary advisory group which provides training and 
logistical support to the philippine military 
rowe a native of mcallen texas was a decorated vietnam war 
veteran who was held in a cage for five years by the viet cong 
until he escaped in 1968 he wrote a book about the ordeal titled 
five years to freedom 
the communist new peoples army general command claimed 
responsibility for his assassination in a statement delivered 
saturday to news agencies 
the statement threatened further attacks if the united states 
continues to back president corazon aquinos fight against the 
20year communist insurgency 
the death of col rowe signifies the firm commitment of the 
revolutionary forces to continue military actions against us 
personnel and installations as these are manifestations of the 
arrogant trampling of us imperialists on the filipino peoples 
independence and sovereignty the statement said 
the us navy ordered additional security for the 1000 sailors 
on the flagship uss blue ridge of the 7th fleet the ship arrived 
friday for a fourday manila port call 
lt mike andrews the fleets spokesman said the sailors were 
told to travel in groups and avoid dark alleys 
filipino soldiers used bombsniffing dogs saturday to check 
luggage at manila airport fearing terrorists might try to plant 
bombs on departing planes 
us ambassador nicholas platt called the killing a cowardly 
act and presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said us 
authorities would help the government search for the killers 
no date had been set for memorial services or for flying rowes 
body back to the united states 
his killing came five days after the rebels announced they were 
determined to make us imperialism pay dearly for the continuing 
stay of its bases and its escalating intervention in our peoples 
affairs 
that statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing 
of a us communications station in the northern province of 
benguet on april 9 no one was hurt 
in october 1987 rebels killed three americans and a filipino 
outside clark air base 50 miles north of manila authorities later 
increased security at us bases and civilian offices in the 
philippines 
de villa said additional precautions were now needed because 
rowes killing created a new problem for us because this was 
terrorism against foreign nationals 
the six us installations which include clark and subic bay 
naval station are occupied by about 40000 soldiers civilian 
workers and dependents about 100000 other americans live in the 
country 
resentment toward us forces has spread beyond the rebel army 
in recent years the agreement allowing the us bases to remain 
was extended last year to 1991 over heavy opposition from 
protesters and some lawmakers

for those to whom a heavy diet of wagners 
ring cycle is poison the metropolitan opera has an antidote 
thats easy to swallow an elixir of love with superstars 
luciano pavarotti and kathleen battle 
donizettis comic masterpiece which he dashed off in an 
amazing two weeks made its first appearance of the season friday 
night to a standingroomonly crowd 
it will be performed four more times during the final two weeks 
of the season while most of the mets attention is devoted to its 
new staging of wagners fourpart der ring des nibelungen 
luckily this fading but still charming 1960 production by 
nathaniel merrill and robert ohearn practically runs by itself 
like a windup clock and with music so effervescent and a plot so 
foolproof the audience is guaranteed a good time even if the 
performance never quite sparkles as it should 
pavarotti started his career singing light tenor roles like 
nemorino the bumbling country bumpkin who tries to win the heart 
of his true love by drinking a magic potion hes gone on to tackle 
heavier parts and lost some of his luster in the process but 
this role remains a favorite 
though hes always an agreeable performer pavarotti was not in 
top vocal form friday night straining for notes when he should 
have been caressing them his big secondact aria una furtiva 
lagrima drew the usual feverish ovation from his fans but in 
truth it was only moderately soothing to the ear 
miss battle as the heroine adina took a while to warm up at 
first sounding oddly detached as she has in other recent 
assignments at the met but after the intermission she became more 
animated and produced a rich full tone along with her famous 
silvery high notes 
it was good to hear doctor dulcamara the traveling quack who 
arrives in a balloon sung with the firm booming voice that bass 
paul plishka displayed often the part is given to an aging singer 
who must rely on comic business to cover up an inability to get all 
the notes across 
less effective was leo nucci as sergeant belcore nemorinos 
rival for the love of adina his modest baritone just couldnt hold 
its own in such highpowered vocal company 
marcello panni who conducted pavarotti and miss battle in the 
same opera in central park last summer was making his house debut 
and didnt quite have his act together the orchestra sounded 
ragged at times and the singers especially pavarotti tended to 
go their own way where tempos were concerned

dozens of military aircraft will be diverted to 
civilian duty to haul 50000 tons of farm produce construction 
equipment and other goods around the country this year an 
official report said 
the report friday by the tass news agency gave no reason for the 
move however it said the military planes would be transporting 
southern fruit and vegetables to northern cities including moscow 
and leningrad those cities suffer chronic shortages of such goods 
 
military aircraft have occasionally been used for civilian duty 
in the past they helped deliver equipment and relief workers after 
the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident and the armenian earthquake in 
december tass said 
a new resolution ordering the aircraft to carry civilian cargoes 
was adopted by the council of ministers the news agency said 
tass said the 60 military transport planes in the program will 
include the ruslan and antheus jumbo jets il76 turbojets and 
an12 turboprops it did not say when the program would begin or 
how long it would last 
it said the jumbo jets are capable of bringing practically to 
any point in the country large structural elements building and 
earthmoving machinery cranes excavators and transport vehicles 
col gen vyacheslav yefanov chief of the military transport 
division was quoted by tass as saying combat readiness will not be 
impaired 
crews will continue to upgrade their flying skills improve 
maintenance of aircraft and will master radio communications

the middleaged white woman in the david 
duke sweatshirt was pleasantly enthusiastic 
hes for fair play for all she said of the exku klux klan 
leader she had come to hear right now its like weve become the 
minority and we need someone to do something 
duke who has made the jump from radical fringe to elected 
official points to such people as proof his message is becoming 
mainstream now leader of the national association for the 
advancement of white people duke won a seat in the louisiana 
legislature by talking about the high birthrate among unwed welfare 
women and claiming that whites are victimized by civil rights laws 
i think i spoke out loud what a lot of people say around the 
dinner table he said people were so impressed by the ideas 
that they voted for me despite the controversy of my background 
duke is not alone in his thinking much of what he says is 
echoed by those who have opposed him throughout his career 
the david duke election was a signal of a sour mood of 
resentment on the part of some whites that has been a long time in 
developing said irwin suall director of factfinding for the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith there is a perception out 
there that blacks are being favored at the expense of whites not 
merely in employment but in status in the media 
some dismiss dukes slim 200vote victory as an anomaly his 
suburban new orleans district is 99 percent white but suall and 
other trackers of racial tension believe disparate events like 
dukes election and the rise of the racist skinhead subculture are 
warning signs to be taken seriously 
these people and these events represent something larger 
said chip berlet a researcher for political research associates of 
cambridge mass they are like the canaries in mines telling us 
there is an undercurrent of people that are very unhappy 
this unhappiness says berlet and others runs long and deep it 
is the result of economic changes that have nibbled away at the 
bluecollar union tradition of fear of drugs and crime of the 
perception that civil rights programs like affirmative action are 
unfair to whites and of a general hopelessness within the white 
working class that sees a shrinking of its power in society 
at a shopping mall on the edge of dukes district a white woman 
in her 30s offered her opinion but declined to give her name 
you see all this about black power and black pride and helping 
blacks economically and i guess that started out with good 
intentions but its not right when whites lose jobs and its not 
fair when youre called a racist for complaining about it 
it is difficult to measure this mood most polls show the 
american public far more tolerant of racial differences and 
integration programs than it once was but michael mckeon a 
pollster who has worked with the democratic congressional campaign 
committee said standard surveys that ask yesno questions cant 
plumb the depth of individual attitudes 
mckeon said his phone surveys which involve more dialogue with 
subjects show big time disenchantment 
its nothing you can put a number on but there is a 
resentment out there that the lower middle class and their 
children arent going to be any better off than they were he 
said if you ask are you mad because your kid didnt get a 
scholarship and a black kid did theyre going to say no but if 
you talk to them youre going to see this resentment woven into the 
fabric of their thoughts 
those in the civil rights trenches like curt koehler an 
organizer for the chicago commission on human relations note a 
simmering anger especially among young whites 
a growing number of white people in their 20s feel they are on 
the short end of the stick said koehler who tries to defuse 
racial tension in the bluecollar neighborhoods on chicagos 
southwest side an area that has seen klan rallies and violence by 
skinheads 
koehler said the lower middleclass white bastion of the secure 
union job is crumbling at the same time the disenchanted see a 
growing black middle class moving in and believe it is the result 
of favored government treatment 
a black on his way up might have a chance to buy a home in a 
neighborhood where a young white kid just saw his job leave he 
said the anger is being placed now on black folks and 
affirmative action 
beyond the economics is an issue of group identity and pride 
the higher profile of minorities on stage film and the television 
screen gives some whites already worried about their status the 
sense that their importance in society is diminishing 
berlet noted that while relatively few blacks appear on tv 
their numbers have increased so rapidly that their representation 
can seem disproportional blacks make up 15 percent of the 
population and maybe only 4 percent on tv he said but when 
some whites see more black faces on televison they think 
theyre taking over 
gregg a 20yearold atlanta skinhead who declined to give his 
last name complained bitterly about what he sees as black 
propaganda 
i was watching television and they had these blacks sitting 
around telling everybody it was blacks who invented this and 
blacks who invented that it was abunch of lies he said 
bert a fellow skinhead sees such concepts as black pride and 
black history coming at the expense of white identity 
white heritage is not being taught in school its like youre 
supposed to be ashamed of being white while theyre teaching black 
heritage full force he said they completely downplay the role 
whites have in this country 
these frustrations can blossom into acts of racial violence that 
koehler has seen in his chicago neighborhoods or he said 
these people can vote for a david duke in the belief they can 
protect what is mine 
whether or not that translates into the election of more 
candidates with similar ideologies is debated by the pulsetakers of 
society 
martin lipset a stanford university sociologist thinks other 
white rights candidates may be elected to local office but 
theyre dead if they have any ambitions to go further 
duke however believes he is only the first to tap into a 
sentiment that will grow 
i think that this is the beginning of a time when we will see 
candidates discuss these things he said a candidate who 
doesnt have to carry the political baggage i had to carry and who 
discusses these issues will win

ships to carry them to safety police said 
no casualties were reported as the 122mm sovietdesigned grad 
rockets exploded around jounieh the christians only escape route 
from their beleaguered enclave 
other rockets hit the area around the coastal highway running 
north to the ancient port of byblos 
christian sources reported that one unidentified ship slipped 
into the port 
several other small freighters with unknown cargoes have reached 
the christian zone in recent days iraq syrias main arab rival 
has been supplying weapons and ammunition to the christians 
saturdays salvos came during a relative lull in the battles 
between the syrians aided by moslem druse allies and the mainly 
christian units of army commander gen michel aoun 
by police count 270 people have been killed and nearly 1000 
wounded in ferocious artillery and rocket exchanges that began 
march 8 
police reported that an estimated 4000 christians had gathered 
at jounieh 12 miles north of beirut awaiting a ferry from cyprus 
to take them to safety 
the 4000ton baroness m one of two ferries that have carried 
12000 christians to cyprus during the fighting anchored off 
jounieh on friday night 
the ship took on an estimated 1200 people who were shuttled out 
from jounieh in small boats without incident 
cypriot shipping officials said the baroness m would make the 
trip to jounieh again sunday 
beiruts moslem voice of the nation termed the syrian rocketing 
a warning to ships to stay away from the besieged enclave 
it will persist as long as the blockade imposed by aoun 
perists it said 
the current spasm of fighting was triggered after aoun seeking 
to restore state authority to the fractured government blockaded 
illegal ports run by moslem militias 
the 310squaremile christian enclave is ringed on its three 
landward sides by hostile forces and about 1 million christians 
are trapped inside

christians main militia advised christians trapped in the enclave 
how to aid casualties in the event of new shelling 
keep your nerves under control it said parks cars in 
such a way that they dont block ambulances take cover in the

a soviet deputy foreign minister arrived in 
beijing on saturday for talks aimed at overcoming problems facing 
the first sovietchinese summit in 30 years sources said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is scheduled to come to 
china on may 15 
the two sides have had difficulty agreeing on a joint communique 
to be issued at the visits end said an eastern european source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
it is hoped the visit by deputy foreign minister igor rogachev 
of the soviet union will clear up these difficulties specifically 
the soviet and chinese position on vietnam and the war in cambodia 
other difficulties concern the vision that each nation has of 
future sinosoviet ties beijing has played down the significance 
of its growing ties with moscow while the soviets like to portray 
their improving rapport with the chinese as a foreign relations 
coup 
one indication of this occurred when the date of gorbachevs 
visit was announced in february soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze ended a visit to china on feb 3 by announcing the 
date at a press conference that same day a chinese official 
denied a date had been set 
china then waited two days to announce that the date was may 15 
rogachev arrived saturday afternoon a chinese source said his 
visit had been planned for some time but postponed for unknown 
reasons 
both china and the soviet union support a vietnamese troop 
pullout from cambodia by september they also support an end to 
chinese aid for cambodias antivietnamese guerrillas 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to replace the prochinese 
khmer rouge with a provietnamese puppet government 
china and the soviet union apparently still differ on the 
composition of a transitional government which would rule until 
elections to replace the current vietnameseinstalled government 
the last soviet leader to visit beijing was nikita khrushchev in 
1959

donald trump is playing a reallife 
game of monopoly with atlantic city real estate these days 
in less than a month the developer has announced two property 
deals that would put him in command of a lucrative fiveblock area 
in the center of the boardwalk 
new jersey regulatory authorities say they will look closely at 
the implications of the deal in deciding whether to approve it 
the financial genius of the deal is that the two acquisitions 
would be taken off the rolls as casinos and converted into luxury 
hotels to comply with state law thus enhancing the market share 
for the gambling spots trump already owns 
new jersey law has a threecasino limit per owner trump already 
owns trump plaza trump castle and the soontobeopened taj mahal 
converting elsinores atlantis casino hotel and the former 
penthouse casino site into hotels would benefit the gaming hall in 
the middle trump plaza said marvin b roffman an analyst with 
the investment firm janney montgomery scott inc 
when you take a casino site off the market the people sharing 
the pie will share bigger pieces he said donald trump took 
the most important five blocks in atlantic city where caesars 
begins and atlantis ends four properties were going to share that 
space and now theres only going to be two 
trumps atlantis purchase is subject to regulatory approval the 
financially ailing casino is controlled by a stateappointed 
conservator 
theres a good deal of concern over anyone who amasses too 
much of the real estate among the casinozoned properties said 
anthony parrillo director of the state division of gaming 
enforcement the public policy of this state is to foster 
competition in the atlantic city marketplace and the public policy 
is against undue economic concentration 
the question it boils down to is with all the incremental 
holdings of mr trump or anyone for that matter when is enough 
enough parrillo said thats a very difficult issue to assess 
because the legislature didnt give a precise formula other than 
the threelicense rule 
at the same time regulators must consider the prerogative of an 
entrepreneur to enter into such agreements as well as the best use 
for the property and what the local market is able to handle he 
said 
the casino control act parrillo said wants a healthy mix of 
competitors diversified and multidimensional 
martin danzinger a former member of the casino control 
commission said the issue is whether trump has become powerful 
enough to become a government of his own 
among casino employees he will control 20 percent of the 
industry danziger said if for some reason the state had to 
close him up what impact would that have on the industry and how 
much impact would it have if he decides to walk away from the 
gaming tables the state should be debating those questions and 
they probably are 
roffman said trumps purchase of the atlantis for a bargain 
price of 63 million trump bought the former penthouse site for 
56 million 
if both deals are completed trump will control almost a mile 
of boardwalk frontage roffman said thats very powerful

rule after rhodesia became the independent nation of zimbabwe in 
1980 nyagumbo held key posts in the cabinet the 15member 
politburo and the ruling partys central committee 
but he resigned his government and party posts april 14 after he 
was found by a presidential inquiry to be involved in a racket 
involving illegal sales of vehicles investigators found he abused 
his position by acquiring 38 vehicles mostly for friends from a 
state assembly plant 
nyagumbo denied wrongdoing but stepped down 
despite the scandal the government spokesman who commented on 
condition of anonymity said mugabe declared nyagumbo a national 
hero 
his death has robbed us of a man whose record of revolutionary 
performance is second to none the president said friday 
nyagumbos body was to lie in state until burial 
the revolutionary shrine honors about 27000 zimbabweans who 
died in the sevenyear guerrilla war that led to independence

san quentin prison for more than a 
century one of the toughest places in the nation to do time has 
been emptied of virtually all its most hardened criminals 
some 1750 of them more than half the population of the 
137yearold fortress that once held charles manson and sirhan 
sirhan have been sent to new prisons throughout california as part 
of a 5 billion prison expansion 
in their place are minimum and mediumsecurity prisoners 
including many who live in trailers outside the prison walls on san 
quentins fencedin grounds and have little contact with the 
higherrisk inmates inside 
californias death row remains here for the 252 prisoners all 
men facing execution by cyanide gas but aside from them we 
have lost almost all of our hardcore inmates said prison 
spokesman cal white not unhappily 
that once housed the most desperate people in california he 
said pointing to an empty fivetier cellblock now its just a 
temporary holding facility 
the concreteandsteel compound ringed by guard towers on the 
edge of san francisco bay has long been depicted as one of 
americas toughest prisons 
its inmates included sirhan who assassinated robert f kennedy 
in 1968 and caryl chessman convicted of los angeles red light 
bandit sex attacks of 1948 he became a bestselling author 
behind bars before being executed in 1960 
but in the past two years most of the highestrisk prisoners 
have been sent to three new prisons manson the leader of a 
murderous cult and perhaps the most notorious prisoner in 
california went to the new corcoran prison near fresno 
corcoran is one of eight prisons opened in california since 
1980 the states prison population has tripled since then to more 
than 75000 more than any other state none of the older prisons 
has been affected more than san quentin 
on the outside the complex appears as forbidding as ever 
several buildings were erected in the middle to late 19th century 
one has the date 1857 chiseled in its front and even the more 
recent structures are decades old 
on the inside what authorities call san quentins change in 
mission is quickly apparent in addition to holding medium and 
minimumsecurity inmates it serves as a reception center where 
new inmates are sent for orientation and classification 
the stress level here has dropped considerably over the past 
couple of years white said we used to have some kind of 
incident every day it wasnt uncommon to have a lockup every 
month now thats pretty much of a rarity 
the prison has been extensively remodeled including a 28 
million overhaul of an old cellblock in the hospital 55 years old 
but newly refurbished is the dental ward a spicandspan suite 
that smells powerfully of disinfectant 
they call me dr painless said dr glenn jamieson a 
bouyant breezy man who has taken care of prisoners teeth here for 
22 years he calls the ward the only airconditioned place in the 
prison as good as any on the outside 
despite the changes a visitor never forgets that san quentin is 
steeped in violence 
before visitors go through the massive steel gates a guard 
warns of the possibility of being taken hostage and adds that state 
policy is to never negotiate a prisoners freedom for the release 
of hostages 
the officer adds with a grin welcome to san quentin

sen phil gramm employed unusual tactics 
including a lawsuit to fight attempts by federal auditors to 
review his 1984 campaigns financial records government documents 
show 
gramm who agreed to end the 5year dispute with the federal 
election commission by paying a 30000 fine gave his version of 
the events last month in a move that preempted public release of 
documents in the case 
the texan republican released the settlement to news 
organizations on a friday night after the fec had closed and 
before the settlement was final 
gramm spokesman larry neal said the fec had made the final 
offer and it was ours to accept or reject that was the final 
action as far as we were concerned 
while acknowledging errors and blaming them on the inexperience 
of volunteers gramm described them as technical reporting 
violations 
although many of the instances did involve reporting errors an 
fec audit also found that the campaign apparently accepted 151 
separate contributions from corporations totaling 10890 
corporate contributions to political campaigns are forbidden 
under both texas and federal laws 
fec documents in the case also reveal the friends of phil gramm 
committee fought the agencys investigation of federal campaign 
violations with tactics that included a lawsuit against the 
commission in us district court in dallas and its members as 
individuals 
the committee also questioned subpoenas issued by the fec to 
obtain key papers 
in one instance the campaign committee insisted on a 
piecebypiece inventory of more than 500000 committee documents 
sought by the fec 
this procedure would have been more expensive and 
timeconsuming than the audit itself according to a report by 
the fecs general counsel 
neal said disputes early in the auditing process were largely 
due to a bureaucratic procedure that the general counsels office 
attempted to impose 
he said the agency at one point sent a letter that simply said 
please send half a million documents to washington immediately 
thank you obviously we felt inventories were appropriate and 
necessary and challenged them on points such as that 
in essence we felt that some of the bureaucrats the fec 
dispatched to handle this audit were highhanded and lowdown 
neal said 
fec spokesman scott moxley said it is not often the agency must 
go to court in the course of an investigation and it is even 
less often that the commission is sued and especially if the 
commissioners are sued in their individual capacity 
moxley said an average fec investigation lasts eight months 
although some cases have taken longer so something that draws on 
for four years is unusual he described the fine as one of the 
largest ever in a congressional race 
yet in a statement accompanying the release of the settlement 
campaign treasurer donald r white said the campaign has made a 
consistent and very costly effort over five years to comply fully 
with the spirit and substance of the fecs regulations 
white said the crush of 70000 individual contributions totaling 
10 million defeated the efforts of our volunteer campaign 
workers to adequately screen and process the incoming mail 
the corporate contributions in question slipped through the 
normal screening process undetected because checks drawn on 
corporate bank accounts were not readily identifiable as such 
white said 
of the 151 prohibited contributions 127 appear not to have been 
refunded within 30 days the fec counsels report said 
auditors said they found one instance in which the campaign 
committee made a refund of an apparent corporate contribution 
and voided this refund check when the contributor stated he had 
intended to write the check from a personal account rather than a 
corporate account

a highranking government official 
said saturday nato should not exclude the possibility of 
eliminating shortrange nuclear rockets now based on german soil 
the remark by education minister juergen moellemann could 
further fuel a simmering disagreement between west germany and the 
united states over shortrange nuclear weapons 
west germany is expected to press the united states to agree to 
early superpower talks on reducing those weapons 
both the united states and britain are strongly opposed to early 
talks contending that warsaw pact superiority in conventional 
weapons requires a western nuclear deterrent of shortrange 
arsenals 
chancellor helmut kohl also wants the north atlantic treaty 
organization to postpone a decision on modernizing those weapons 
until 1991 or 1992 
speaking at a meeting of the free democratic party in duisburg 
moellemann reiterated the west german governments position but 
went even farther saying nato and the warsaw pact should not 
exclude the possibility of eliminating shortrange nuclear weapons 
moellemann is a leading member of the free democrats junior 
partners in kohls coalition government 
depending on disarmament negotiations results and other 
concrete realities it should be decided after 1992 whether we need 
any nuclear landbased shortrange rockets moellemann said 
moellemann also called on nato to make its own wideranging 
disarmament initiatives and not to react only when the east bloc 
makes disarmament proposals 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense 
minister gerhard stoltenberg are scheduled to fly to washington on 
monday for talks with us officials 
they are expected to press the united states for negotiations 
with the soviets on reducing the number of shortrange lance 
weapons which have a range of about 60 miles and are mostly based 
in west germany

a federal jury weighed the guilt or innocence 
of oliver l north for part of a second day saturday then took the 
rest of the weekend off as the former presidential aide awaited his 
fate on 12 felony counts stemming from his role in the irancontra 
affair 
the nine women and three men guided in their deliberations by a 
95page set of instructions from district judge gerhard a gesell 
arrived bright and early saturday to resume work in an 18by12 
room on the sealed second floor of the us courthouse 
but there were no clues as to their progress by the time they 
quit at 1210 pm to return to their downtown hotel to relax 
under constant supervision of us marshals until resuming work 
monday 
the jurors who were asked by the judge to begin by 930 each 
morning were driven in a van to the courthouse at 820 am and 
started their work at 845 
the jury had deliberated for six hours on friday 
so far only requests for copies of gesells instructions one 
for each juror and for pencils paper and paper clips have 
emanated from the jury room along with the question friday is 
lunch at 12 
they got the materials and the early lunch 
writing supplies remained a concern saturday an unsigned note 
which covered the jurys return of some documents to the court for 
safekeeping had this ps please sharpen pencils and we need 
more pencils and highlighters 
the jurors will be allowed family visits under marshals 
supervision at their hotel on sunday the jurors are forbidden to 
talk about the case even among themselves when they are not in 
the jury room 
norths trial nearly three months long is the first stemming 
from the late 1985early 1986 sale of arms to iran at a 270 
percent markup in price and the siphoning off of some of the 
proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
three other men former national security adviser john 
poindexter businessman albert hakim and former air force maj 
gen richard secord are awaiting separate trials another former 
national security adviser robert c mcfarlane has pleaded guilty 
and received two years probation and a 20000 fine for 
withholding information from congress about the episode 
north a former marine lieutenant colonel who served as deputy 
to both mcfarlane and poindexter is charged with 12 felony counts 
including withholding information from congress lying to attorney 
general edwin meese iii about his activities destroying and 
altering documents misusing money entrusted to him and accepting 
an illegal gratuity a 13800 security system at his home 
north a decorated vietnam war veteran testified he was a mere 
pawn in a chess game played by giants and was following orders 
throughout even as he was the action officer in both major 
elements of the irancontra scheme i was not stepping in he 
said i was brought in basically it was a handoff youve 
got the ball now run with it 
but independent prosecutor john w keker told the jury you 
have heard a lot about courage at this trial theres another kind 
of courage courage to admit when you are wrong courage to admit 
personal responsibility courage to admit guilt where appropriate 
he has not admitted any of those things its time for you do to it 
for him 
in his instructions gesell set specific guidelines for the 
jurys consideration of each specific count 
for example on the count that north obstructed congress by 
making false or misleading statements to two house committees 
gesell said a false or misleading answer to a question may be 
taken by you as an obstruction if it was made corruptly with the 
specific intent to impede the investigation it must be 
established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted for 
the specific purposes of obstructing or impeding 
similarly on four counts that north made false statements to 
congress or meese gesell said the jury could convict only if it is 
convinced that when the defendant made or caused to be made the 
false statement or representation he was acting willfully that 
is deliberately or on purpose and not because of mistake 
inadvertence or accident 
as for the document destruction charge the judge said the jury 
could convict only if it believes north altered or destroyed the 
materials with knowledge of the illegality of his conduct but 
the defendant did not have to know the exact terms of the law if 
he knew that he was prohibited by departmental or agency rule or 
regulation from destroying official records 
to convict north for accepting an illegal gratuity the 
security system gesell said the jury must first be satisfied that 
north specifically intended to receive the security system for a 
past or future official act or acts and not for reasons wholly 
unrelated to his official employment 
most of the charges carry penalties of five years in prison and 
250000 fines upon conviction one charge is punishable by a 
maximum of 10 years one of three years and one of two years with 
the total possible punishment being 60 years and fines of 3 
million

solidarity leader lech walesa predicted saturday 
that his newly legalized labor movement will dwindle as it gives 
rise to splinter groups during the growing political pluralism in 
poland 
speaking at a news conference at the end of a threeday visit to 
italy he also praised president bushs proposed aid for poland and 
voiced his support for economic reforms in the soviet union 
from solidarity other economic and political organizations 
will be born said walesa a strong proponent of pluralism 
solidarity for the moment is huge but it will become smaller 
with the growth of other organizations this is the logical course 
of events 
polands communist government last week lifted the ban on 
solidarity and agreed to free elections for a new chamber of 
parliament solidarity was crushed in martial law in 1981 and later 
outlawed 
the government is now seeking support from solidarity and aid 
from the west to restore polands shattered economy 
in its heyday the union claimed 10 million members of the 18 
millionmember polish work force 
coinciding with the official recognition of solidarity the bush 
administration announced a 1 billion economic aid program for 
poland 
speaking through an interpreter walesa called the program a 
great step forward taken by mr bush 
we ask europe and the world to help poland travel the road of 
development we have laid the foundations and if we dont succeed 
the responsibility will also be yours he said 
the union leader reiterated his support for the liberal reforms 
of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
asked about solidaritys contacts with opposition in other east 
bloc countries walesa said his labor movement was open to ties 
with other groups but he added we dont want to disturb anyone 
and above all create obstacles for perestroika 
perestroika is gorbachevs program of social and political 
reforms 
walesa who won the 1983 nobel peace prize indicated he planned 
to visit other countries as an ambassador of solidarity but 
gave no details 
he came to italy seeking both western economic investment in 
poland and the blessing of pope john paul ii a pole for the 
countrys new political course 
he also met with italian political leaders and union officials 
who invited him to make the trip 
later saturday walesa flew back to warsaw he planned to meet 
sunday with an opposition committee naming candidates for 
parliamentary elections in june

steer course 359 the skipper 
tells me as i swing the rudder left 10 degrees and wait for the bow 
of my 800foot tanker to move slowly to port 
only one problem it gets to course 359 and the simulated ship 
keeps right on going a wild spin of the wheel in the opposite 
direction gives a moment of calm then the realization i have 
overcorrected and the ship is headed in the other direction 
the glacierlike handling of oil tankers is a problem for pilots 
from boston harbor to alaskas prince william sound it is one 
reason instructors here at the massachusetts maritime academy scoff 
at coast guard commandant paul yosts suggestion that a child could 
steer a tanker through the alaskan waters where the exxon valdez 
ran aground and spilled 101 million gallons of oil 
a recent turn at the helm of an imaginary tanker proved that 
reporters if not children are wholly unqualified to guide the 
floating oil fields to port 
the yearold 800000 simulator here is a fullscale tanker 
bridge an array of computer and video equipment projects a 
realistic view of a harbor during the day at night at twilight or 
in fog 
in the foreground hundreds of feet away is the prow of my 
80000ton tanker nearly as long but much lighter than the exxon 
valdez i stand at a virtual duplicate of the type of wheel and 
rudder control stand found on most ships 
in front of me the shipmaster academy professor jerome 
mcgourthy stands by the compass and gives orders while another 
professor thomas bushy serving as a chief mate looks over my 
shoulder 
driving a ship is like piloting airplanes hours and hours of 
boredom with intermittent moments of terror bushy says as our 
ship moves toward a channel at about 9 knots 
later bushy programs the radar computer to show prince william 
sound and i watch as a radar blip identified as the exxon valdez 
passes me and approximates the course of the 987foot 211000ton 
ship to the reef that made the valdez infamous 
still a mystery in the valdez disaster is why the ship veered 
more than two miles off course and into bligh reef a 
miscalculation about the location of the reef might have left the 
valdez with no time to respond a supertanker travels thousands of 
feet before it executes a full turn an emergency stop can take 
miles of water 
on our radar screen bushy brings the exxon valdez close to the 
reef marked with a buoy and then tries to avoid it we gave it 
hard right rudder and were well beyond the buoy and were probably 
aground by now because of the reaction time required for a loaded 
tanker like the valdez bushy says 
the fouryear academy trains its 550 students on both simulators 
and ships and awards bachelors degrees in marine engineering or 
navigation graduates typically go to work in the maritime industry 
or for the goast guard or the military 
the terror bushy speaks of seems hard to imagine from the stable 
deck of the maritime academy until the computer operator switches 
the video simulator to night mode and a clear view of my channel 
approach becomes a jumble of lights 
a grouping of seemingly stationary green red and white lights 
means nothing to me but to my superior officers it represents an 
approaching ship soon the distant lights are passing swiftly to 
port a scant 50 yards away too close for comfort 
evasive action in a tanker is a slowmotion maneuver the tanker 
i was operating would need a mile to go from full ahead to a full 
stop and in that maneuver it would swing out of control as much as 
60 degrees 
the ship would continue to move forward five lengths in making a 
rightangle turn slowing down might seem a smart thing for a 
novice to do but below 5 knots the tanker responds poorly in a 
turn and is more susceptible to wind and current 
and going slow cant be quickly corrected at one point 
mcgourthy increases speed to compensate for my sloppy steering i 
kicked up the speed five minutes ago and were only up one knot 
he says 
the number of oil tankers has dwindled by several hundred in 
recent years to 3180 said arthur mckenzie of the tanker advisory 
center in new york but the average cargo is on the rise raising 
the stakes in navigating them properly 
the exxon valdez accident said capt geoff motte the academys 
vice president was an error in judgment and thats what these 
simulators can cure we can cram into a week the kind of experience 
it would take years to get into at sea 
the commanders at the academy scratch their heads trying to 
figure out how the valdez ran aground but they refuse to 
secondguess the crew without knowing the facts 
i dont believe theres a shipmaster afloat including me 
that wouldnt admit to being in a few close shaves motte said 
ive never been in a collision and never been in a grounding but 
ive come close 
so have i skipper so have i

a vietnamese family was reunited with the 
us admiral who saved their lives by dumping 10 million worth of 
helicopters in the sea so they could land a small plane on the deck 
of his aircraft carrier 
south vietnamese maj bung lee his wife and their five children 
had crammed into a singleseat cessna o1 bird dog to escape from 
their homeland as it was overrun by communist forces in april 1975 
it appeared they would be unable to land on the uss midway in 
the south china sea because its flight deck was filled with 
helicopters used to evacuate saigon rear adm lawrence chambers 
now retired ordered the deck cleared 
his decision was priceless lee said without his decision 
we would not be here today 
lee and chambers reminisced about the landing at the us naval 
aviation museum where the tiny plane was ut on display friday 
another retired rear admiral magruder h tuttle bought the 
plane for an undisclosed price 13 years ago and donated it to the 
museum at pensacola naval air station 
lee now a waiter at a polynesian restaurant at walt disney 
world his wife van an electronics worker and four of their 
children came from their winter park home for the dedication 
ceremony 
chambers said he worried for a moment about destroying the 
choppers but the situation was desperate 
lee had flown through viet cong gunfire in dense fog heading 
out to sea without knowing what was ahead the plane was miles from 
shore and running low on fuel when he spotted the midway which 
saved 3000 refugees 
lee had no radio so he attempted to drop a note onto the deck 
asking permission to land he said he was afraid to fly too low for 
fear the crew might think it was under attack and shoot down the 
plane 
three times he dropped notes attached to a knife a boot and a 
key chain but each was too light and blew away 
on the fourth attempt a note tied to lees survival pistol hit 
the carriers deck it read can you move these helicopters to 
the other side i can land on your runway i can fly 1 hour more 
we have enough time to move please rescue me major bungly wife 
and 5 child 
chambers said there wasnt space to move the uh1 huey 
helicopters so he ordered them pushed overboard the singleengine 
plane touched down once bounced and rolled to a stop 
the crew was ecstatic to see the major make his first carrier

the foreign ministers of iran and iraq resumed 
direct peace talks saturday but they appeared no closer to a 
permanent truce than when negotiations began eight months ago 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz leaving after 2 hours of 
talks with his iranian counterpart ali akbar velayati said the 
meeting brought only a reiteration of clashing positions 
asked if there was any progress on clearing those obstacles 
aziz replied i cannot say yes 
the talks were chaired by un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar who also had two separate session in the past 24 hours 
with the iranian minister in an apparent attempt to soften 
positions 
another session was planned sunday un spokeswoman nadia 
younes said 
periodic unsponsored talks began five days after an aug 20 
ceasefire but immediately stalled over irans demand for a full 
withdrawal of iraqi troops from iran and iraqs insistence on early 
dredging of the shattalarab its only sea outlet 
the latest sessions started thursday with a joint ministerial 
meeting that perez de cuellar said did not deal with substantive 
issues 
talks are tentatively scheduled to recess monday but 
participants have left open the possibility of an extension 
the president of the international committee of the red cross 
cornelio sommaruga said he met perez de cuellar saturday and 
expressed renewed concern that all prisoners of war taken in the 
iraniraq war must be repatriated 
he said priority should continue to be given to wounded and sick 
pows but also to captured children and the longestheld prisoners 
the genevabased icrc monitors compliance with the geneva 
conventions on international humanitarian law 
the icrc agreed to supervise a pow exchange last november but 
iran quickly pulled out of the accord after charging iraq had 
reneged 
only about 700 prisoners mostly iranians have returned home 
since the ceasefire took effect the icrc says both sides together 
hold about 100000 pows captured in the eightyear war

house speaker jim wrights intervention with 
federal sampl regulators on behalf of texas businessmen did not 
strictly violate ethical standards according to the house ethics 
committee but its report provides an inside peek at how truly 
hardball politics is played in the nations capital 
wright according to a report by the ethics panels general 
counsel put a hold on a bill in late 1986 to provide 
regulators 15 billion through special fees on the industry to 
close the most critically insolvent savings and loan institutions 
many of them in texas 
during the same period wright was meeting with officials of the 
federal home loan bank board which regulates the thrift industry 
on behalf of four texas businessmen two of them democratic party 
fundraisers deeply embroiled in the sampl crisis 
despite split votes by the ethics committee clearing wright of 
specific violations of house rules in those meetings special 
counsel richard phelan concluded wright exercised undue 
influence in two of the cases and in trying to get two of the 
bank boards toughest regulators fired 
and several bank board officials told the committee of instances 
in which they felt compelled to bow to wrights demands in order to 
prevent collapse of the sampl insurance fund that guarantees 
depositors against losses up to 100000 
at the time the bank boards federal savings and loan insurance 
corp fslic subsidiary had only a 3 billion a fraction of what 
it would need to rescue of depositors in 130 severely 
troubled sampls 
a combination of plummeting real estate values from the collapse 
of the oil belt economy plus ponzi schemes by high flyer real 
estate developers who jumped into the sampl business particularly in 
texas with its loose banking regulations had made many of their 
outstanding loans worthless 
as the crisis developed the reagan administration in may 1986 
asked congress to recapitalize the sampl insurance fund with 15 
billion to be financed through special assessments on member 
institutions 
the bill was put on the house calendar for action on sept 29 
but two weeks earlier on sept 15 wright then the house 
majority leader called the bank boards thenchairman edwin gray 
to his office to complain about heavyhanded and 
gestapolike tactics of bank board regional officials in dallas 
on sept 2 wright had met in his fort worth office with craig 
hall a dallasbased real estate syndicator and one of the largest 
owners of real estate in texas hall complained to wright that the 
bank board was too inflexible according to the ethics committees 
report 
hall said he could not keep current with hundreds of millions in 
dollars in loans with more than 20 sampls because of the worsening 
texas economy he had arranged global repackaging deal with all 
but one of them westwood savings and loan of los angeles which 
held approximately 200 million of his loans 
because of its already severe loan losses westwood was under 
the control of a bank board representative the bank board official 
had concluded it would be less expensive for the federal insurance 
fund to foreclose on halls property and let him go bankrupt rather 
than accept the restructuring package 
shortly after the sept 2 meeting wright called gray to 
complain about the bank board representative running westwood and 
asked him if there was not anything he could do about this 
according to gray 
on sept 26 a friday hall gray and other bank board officials 
learned that wright had put a hold on the 15 billion sampl insurance 
fund recapitalization scheduled for house action the following 
monday 
three days later gray replaced the bank boards representative 
at westwood the bill was put back on the house calendar for oct 6 
and passed the next day 
but for wrights request gray told the ethics committee i 
would have taken some other corrective action such as youre 
going to have to be more communicative listen better be more 
prepared 
gray said wright made no specific threats nor used any coercive 
terms at the same time gray said he was convinced he was being 
asked to remove the bank board official overseeing westwood 
anybody who has worked in the government for very long knows 
that when the speaker soon to be the speaker of the house of 
representatives is asking you to look into it its not just 
anybody 
shannon fairbanks then the bank boards chief of staff told 
the ethics committee that gray and other agency officials felt they 
were under extreme pressure to bow to that request and several 
others by wright before the bill in a different version was 
signed into law 11 months later 
ed gray believed that he was being posed a choice she 
said and that choice was craig hall has a significant problem 
with your system you say your system needs money but i am not 
going to be prepared to give that system money unless i see 
evidence that your system is capable of responding and that 
evidence can be provided by being responsive to craig hall 
as a result she said the bank board felt compelled to 
compromise its regulatory standards in order to obtain the funds it 
needed 
throughout that whole period we tormented and we didnt like 
what we did she told the ethics committee i had spent a lot 
of years growing up talking theoretically about means and ends and 
the end here was the ability to start to close down these 
institutions with adequate money but the means was a perversion of 
the system 
phelan the ethics committees counsel said neither wright nor 
his staff ever looked at the merits of the bank boards regulatory 
activities or gave any consideration to the legal bases for its 
actions 
phelan likened wrights actions to blackmail and said he 
called for reconsideration regardless of the legal justification 
blocking of the recapitalization bill after his call regarding hall 
constituted a prohibited suggestion of reprisal 
in august 1987 the bank board finally received a 108 billion 
recapitalization package but only after president reagan had 
threatened to veto any amount less 
during the interim it had been cut to 5 billion at one point 
through the efforts of house democratic whip tony coelho of 
california and the us league of savings institutions the sampl 
industrys biggest lobbying arm and a large source of political 
campaign funds 
of the 38 billion that the government committed in 1988 to 
closing down or merging insolvent sampls 25 billion involved 
institutions in texas or defaults on loans from thrifts in other 
states for texas real estate ventures 
last week the senate approved an sampl bailout bill with a 
minimum estimated costs of 126 billion twothirds of if from 
taxpayers over the next 10 years 
we would not be here today talking about a 126 billion 
problem if we had passed the 15 billion in fslic recapitalization 
in october of 1986 sen jake garn rutah and former chairman of 
the senate banking committee said in opening the debate last 
monday 
im not going to insult anybodys intelligence by saying that 
15 billion would have solved the problem but its safe to say the 
problem would be at least half what it is today garn said it 
would have provided funds to close down a lot of those braindead 
institutions before they continued to make bad loans

despite widespread mob violence at home king 
hussein of jordan seemed almost ebullient during his visit here 
this past week reflecting his view that the parties to the 
arabisraeli conflict may finally be ready to grapple seriously 
with the issues that divide them 
hussein has watched the tumultuous politics of his region from 
up close for almost as long as israel has existed and he senses 
that the possibilities for peace are rising 
the conditions are as ripe as theyve never been for progress 
towards a final comprehensive peace in the area hussein said 
saturday on cnns evans amp novak program 
a senior jordanian official told a group of american reporters 
thursday not long after hussein had concluded his talks with 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii that the 
king and the president saw eyetoeye 
his majesty and the president had almost identical views on 
almost every subject that was discussed said the official who 
asked not to be quoted by name 
it was a mixed week for hussein with at least the promise of 
progress toward a middle east peace settlement on the one hand 
coupled somewhat incongruously on the other with rampaging rioters 
at home protesting recent price increases 
husseins visit capped off an intensive period of middle east 
diplomacy for the bush administration he had been preceded here by 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and egyptian president hosni 
mubarak 
hussein and bush have known each other for years and their 
mutual regard was evident both in their public statements and the 
deferential manner in which they treated each other during the 
hours they spent together on wednesday culminating in a glittering 
white house state dinner 
the senior jordanian official said he believes the new 
administration may pursue a more evenhanded policy on the middle 
east than the reagan administration 
he said it is more likely now than before that the united states 
will be perceived by both sides arabs and israelis that it is 
taking the genuine interests of both sides into consideration 
aside from an american president perceived to be better suited 
to advance the peace process the official also said the 
palestinine liberation organization has come a long way from the 
time when it was refusing negotiation recognition or peace with 
israel the three noes 
the plo he said has retreated on each of these points and now 
it has accepted all the american stipulations beyond that he 
added the new plo position has overwhelming arab support 
hussein is encouraged by the usplo dialogue which began last 
december and by the similarity of views between the united states 
and the soviet union on the possibility of a unsponsored 
international conference on the middle east 
the official was critical of shamir suggesting that our three 
noes have been replaced by shamirs five noes 
these include he said no recognition of the plo no 
independent palestinian state no withdrawal from the occupied 
territories no withdrawal from jerusalem and no international 
conference on the middle east 
still the official said shamir seems to have been chastened by 
the 17 months of turmoil in the west bank and gaza strip and may be 
more flexible than before 
shamir now says that no option is excluded in negotiations 
for a final settlement suggesting a retreat from his previous 
position that israel opposes any surrender of territory in exchange 
for peace the official said 
none of the parties to the conflict has rejected outright 
shamirs call for palestinian elections in the territories as an 
initial step in a broader peace process 
but all the parties concur that negotiations on the objective of 
the elections and the next steps beyond that stage en route to a 
final settlement will be fraught with difficulties 
nonethelss as the jordanian official described it the 
important thing is to start a process the status quo is not 
possible to maintain advocating the status quo means advocating a 
deterioration of the situation

iraq said saturday it is building a 
sophisticated sovietdesigned battle tank and developing a new 
longrange missile as part of a major program to beef up its 
weapons industry 
maj gen amer sadi chief of iraqs military industries also 
said iraq is negotiating with france to build advanced mirage 2000 
fighters and with four other aircraft companies to build their 
warplanes 
he also disclosed that the soviet union will participate in an 
iraqi arms exhibition that begins april 28 
sadi speaking to reporters during a preview of the weapons 
show said the sovietdesigned t72 battle tank iraq is building is 
equipped with sophisticated combat systems 
sadi said the first tank off the production line will be a 
centerpiece of the fiveday exhibition a showcase for iraqs 
rapidly developing domestic arms industry 
the exhibition will be staged as a temporary truce between iran 
and iraq drags into a ninth month with no agreement on a permanent 
peace in sight 
the soviet union iraqs main army supplier provided baghdad 
with hundreds of t72s during the war they were widely used in a 
string of iraqi victories that forced iran to accept a 
unsponsored ceasefire that took effect aug 20 
sadi said the military also will display new iraqimade weapons 
at the exhibition 
you will see more sophisticated more advanced missiles with a 
longer range and better capabilities than we used against iran 
he declared 
many people are going to be surprised at what we will put on 
display at the show and with the variety and quality he said 
among other displays will be soviet air force mig29 fighter 
jets with sukhoi su24 and su25 fighterbombers he said 
the respected londonbased flight international magazine 
reported in december that moscow has supplied iraq with an 
unspecified number of advanced su25s 
the powerful iraqi air force a key factor in the war also took 
delivery of some mig29s from the soviets last year 
sadi noted that the soviet jets will be flown by iraqi pilots 
who will stage an air display during the exhibition it was the 
first time the iraqis have acknowledged their pilots were capable 
of handling the advanced sukhois 
sadis disclosure that the soviets will participate in the 
exhibition came as a surprise the soviets had indicated earlier 
they were reluctant to take part while iraniraq peace talks were 
going on 
moscow has been improving its relations with iran in recent 
months 
the soviet military industry enterprises wanted to 
participate but they had to wait for a political decision which 
wasnt taken until the last minute a diplomatic source said on 
condition of anonymity 
sadi also said an agreement with frances dassault aircraft 
company to produce the supersonic mirage 2000 could be reached 
later this year 
france was iraqs secondbiggest arms supplier during the war 
and sold hardware worth an estimated 5 billion sadi did not 
identify the other aircraft manufacturers with whom he said iraq 
was negotiating

the judge in the oliver north trial saying it 
was all a misunderstanding on saturday released 12 uncensored 
pages of a court transcript that previously had been released with 
large portions blacked out by the court security officer 
the associated press and nine other news organization filed a 
motion with us district judge gerhard a gesell on friday asking 
for an uncut version of the transcript which was of the closing 
remarks made in open court wednesday by north lawyer brendan 
sullivan 
the heaviest deletions were of sullivans references to 
intercepts of information that tracked the shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran in 1985 the intercepts sullivan said in the 
blacked out portion told white house officials where they were 
when they were delivered what ocean they were over and when they 
got there 
at another point sullivan said the materials were distributed 
by hand not even sent by messenger because it is the most 
guarded most closely held intelligence in the united states 
government 
in ordering the documents release gesell said that until the 
news media complaint arrived the court was unaware that through 
a misunderstanding the portions were blacked out 
gesell however denied another news media request for a sealed 
stipulation about topsecret intercepts about the iranian 
initiative collected in 1985 and 1986 at norths request by the 
national security agency

the stone has been returned to the grave of sylvia 
plath restoring the married name that vandals perhaps her 
admirers have repeatedly tried to erase 
on saturday poet laureate ted hughes struck back at recent 
criticism of his custody of the grave and of the legacy of his 
wife the tormented american poet who killed herself feb 11 1963 
at the age of 30 
when i first had the lettering set into the stone the only 
question in my mind was how to get the name plath on to it 
hughes said in a letter printed in saturdays edition of the 
independent 
if i had followed custom the stone would be inscribed sylvia 
hughes which was her legal name for her children it was their 
mothers name 
but he added i was already well aware in 1963 of what she 
had achieved under that name and i wished to honor it 
plath who was born in boston was posthumously honored with the 
pulitzer prize in 1982 she was estranged from hughes at the time 
of her death and some of her partisans have accused him of 
smothering her in housework and leaving her for another woman 
many of her poems were intensely personal some of the 
bestknown ones such as lady lazarus and daddy deal with 
illness suffering and death 
hughes burned the last volume of her journals saying he did not 
want their son and daughter ever to have to read them 
he said that her married name set in riveted lead letters was 
chiseled off the tombstone three times 
after a fourth attempt he had the stone removed and was 
contemplating a new design however he said he found the stone 
had been repaired last year by the engraver who was keeping it and 
he agreed to have it restored to its place near the church of st 
thomas the apostle in the village of heptonstall 
the stone bears the name sylvia plath hughes and a line of 
poetry even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be 
planted it is a sentence from sanskrit that i used to tell her 
when she was low hughes said 
the controversy was stirred up earlier this month when julia 
parnaby of the university of lancaster and rachel wingfield of the 
university of cambridge wrote to the guardian newspaper complaining 
about the lack of a marker on the grave 
by failing to replace the headstone and thus leaving plaths 
grave unidentifiable her place in the tradition of womens 
literature is being denied and her work devalued they wrote 
in a long letter published thursday in the guardian hughes 
attacked the two women for falsely claiming that he and plath had 
signed divorce papers 
i am no great student in the fantasia which has obscured the 
life and death of sylvia plath but so far as i am aware ms 
parnaby and wingfield are the first in 26 years to decide that this 
bit of her history needs to be rewritten hughes wrote 
there is rather more to it perhaps ms parnaby and wingfield 
will plead that they did not invent this bit of apocrypha but that 
certain other people have been accepting it as gospel for some time 
if that is so perhaps it would explain why sylvia plaths 
grave has been so repeatedly vandalized ms parnaby and 
wingfields wording of their mischievous falsehood can be read to 
my mind very like an incitement for other misguided enthusiasts to 
desecrate the grave afresh 
hughes letter to the independent took issue with an article by 
ronald hayman who complained that hughes and his sister had kept 
a firm grip on biographers to the extent of threatening to 
withhold copyright material from authors who criticized hughes 
family 
mr hayman tells us that nobody owns fact i hope each of us 
owns the facts of her or his own life hughes wrote otherwise 
you reader might suddenly find yourself reinvented by a mr 
hayman who had decided that he owns your facts and can do what he

jesse jackson on saturday told delegates to 
the african american summit 89 that black election victories mean 
little if economic opportunity doesnt follow 
we have not been successful here if weve been legislated in 
and regulated out jackson said on the second day of the 
threeday conference billed as a meeting to set a political and 
social agenda for the 1990s 
touching on numerous other topics jackson stressed the need for 
awareness among americans of blacks african heritage a theme he 
has sounded often this year as a leader in a movement to supplant 
the term black with african american 
we are not descended from slaves nor up from slavery but 
rather africans who were enslaved the african roots in 
american civilization must be taught in all american schools the 
civil rights leader said 
a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination in 1984 
and 1988 jackson complained that a lack of unity was a key reason 
richard daley won the chicago mayoral race earlier this year over 
black candidate tim evans 
evans lost because we broke the three rules a house divided 
against itself cannot win do unto others as you would have them do 
unto you and love one another as i have loved you jackson said 
jackson also ridiculed judicial decisions against affirmative 
action particularly a recent supreme court decision striking down 
a richmond va program setting aside 30 percent of contracting 
jobs for minorities 
its not about the 70 percent the whites were already 
getting said jackson its about the other 30 percent they 
want 
jacksons stirring 45minute speech drew the largest crowd so 
far in the conference filling for the first time the 1000 seats 
set up in a corner of the huge new orleans convention center 
the meeting drew only half the number organizers had predicted 
and about 1700 fewer than attended a similar rally organized by 
thenmayor richard hatcher in gary ind in 1972 hatcher is 
chairman of this weekends gathering 
im disappointed in the turnout said maryland delegate curt 
anderson but i think whats important is there were good people

a fire and explosion in a moscow watch factory 
killed two people injured two others and touched off rumors that a 
radioactive cloud had been released over the soviet capital 
official media said saturday 
however the tass news agency said the worries were based on 
incredible and unfounded rumors 
tass said the moscow city council was besieged with telephone 
calls friday night from muscovites worried that their neighborhood 
might be contaminated by poisonous gas released by the explosion 
earlier in the day 
staterun radio moscow said some muscovites were concerned that 
radiation might have leaked into the air 
tass in dismissing the worries said authorities were trying to 
determine who called childcare centers to tell them to keep 
children indoors and close windows 
the fire and explosion occurred when plant workers installing 
new wiring in an unventilated area accidentally ignited a gas leak 
tass said 
the blast killed a woman worker and an electrician was burned 
and later died two other women were hospitalized with injuries 
troubled muscovites were inquiring as to what kind of 
explosion happened friday morning at one of the enterprises of the 
cheremyshkinsky region and how dangerous it was for people living 
in neighboring areas tass said

the defense ministry newspaper said saturday that 
an irritating chemical agent was used on proindependence 
demonstrators in soviet georgia but it quoted an official as 
saying the substance does not cause suffocation or poisoning 
however the newspaper acknowledged a report in the local 
communist party daily zarya vostoka that 61 people suffering 
poisoning symptoms were hospitalized in georgia and that some were 
in grave condition 
georgian activists claim several of the 19 people killed when 
soldiers broke up an april 9 demonstration were victims of poison 
gas they also say military authorities refused to identify the 
substance or tell doctors how to treat patients suffering from 
exposure to it 
the defense ministry paper red star identified the substance as 
cheremukha 
soviet officials have previously said tear gas was used in 
georgia but have given no further details 
we used only cheremukha and it alone red star quoted a 
representative of the soviet interior ministry majgen yu 
yefimov as saying it is a substance basically consisting of 
chloroacetophenone cheremukha is an irritant but it does not 
cause suffocation or poisoning 
a western military attache in moscow said the substances base 
was a type of incapacitating agent stronger than tear gas and akin 
to what is commonly known in the west as cs 
yefimov told the newspaper only 27 cartridges of the substance 
were used by soldiers and not in the square in front of 
government house where people were killed but in two other 
places on the capital citys main thoroughfare rustaveli 
prospekt 
he said internal security troops attached to the interior 
ministry used the chemical on his order as they say when 
passions had burst their banks 
despite yefimovs contention the chemical cannot cause poisoning 
or suffocation the weekly moscow news reported in its issue last 
week that the substance used on protesters could have been a factor 
in the fatalities 
the use of gas in great concentrations can lead to the 
instantaneous loss of consciousness moscow news said a 
helpless person then falls under the feet of a running crowd 
yefimov said the use of the chemical was authorized by a july 28 
decree from the supreme soviet presidium which says special 
means may be used for suppressing mass unrest group violations 
of public order and other antisocial activities 
he claimed the april 9 rally in front of georgian government 
headquarters fell into that category because seizure of political 
power overthrow of the present regime and the separation of 
georgia from the ussr were publicly discussed 
georgias leadership assumed responsibility for the clash and 
the communist party leader and premier resigned 
the protests began in early april in reaction to demands by the 
small black sea area of abkhazia to be separated from georgia they 
evolved into massive protests by groups depending georgian 
independence from the soviet union

government austerity measures that earlier this year prompted the 
worst rioting in venezuelan history 
the oneday strike which would be the first major work stoppage 
in 31 years of democratic government will definitely go in 
may said juan jose delpino president of the venezuelan workers 
confederation 
the union plans to hold a twoday congress next week to discuss 
strategy for fighting the belttightening program which resulted 
in sharp increases in bus fares gasoline and other goods and 
services 
the austerity plan the result of an agreement with the 
international monetary fund so venezuela could ease its 33 billion 
foreign debt spurred violent protests in february more than 300 
people were killed and 2000 injured in caracas alone 
the labor group represents 3 million of venezuelas 58 million 
workers 
president carlos andres perez called the threatened strike 
suicide because nobody would join it 
the strike and the massive obedience to our call will be the 
response to that claim delpino said 
venezuela an oilproducing nation whose economy has collapsed 
as petroleum prices have plunged had experienced little labor 
unrest before februarys riots 
venezuelan workers are living through the worst crisis since 
the labor group was created delpino told the associated press 
workers have felt the severe impact of the economic policy 
the austerity program eliminated subisides on more than 25 basic 
food products and implemented an indexing system that tied wage 
increases to inflation rates

a lebanese newspaper said saturday that 
israel has expelled 60 families from their farms in southern 
lebanon after they refused to sell the army their land 
an israeli army official in jerusalem called the reports not 
true totally unfounded in southern lebanon the spokesman for 
the un peacekeeping force said he had no reports of villagers 
being expelled lebanese police could not immediately confirm the 
report 
the daily annahar said a 500strong israeli force backed by 30 
armored personnel carriers stormed seven farms around the town of 
shibaa friday and rounded up 300 people 
shibaa lies within israels selfdeclared security zone a 
sixto10miledeep strip patrolled by israeli troops and 
israelibacked militiamen 
the commander told the farmers they have either to sell their 
10squaremile land to israel or give it up annahar said 
it quoted unidentified residents as saying the israelis opened 
fire to force the farmers out but that no casualties were reported 
the farmers loaded their belongings on 300 mules and left for 
shibaa along with their 30000 goats and 500 cows annahar said 
timor goksel the spokesman for the un interim force in 
lebanon said we received a petition from the village signed by 
142 people they said they were informed by israel that their 
land would be confiscated for military purposes 
some villagers have said they have been offered compensation 
but most dont want to accept it goksel said 
he said the un force began investigating the reports after the 
lebanese government filed a complaint with the united nations 
israel expelled 70 lebanese civilians from shibaa and several 
villages in the security zone earlier this year for refusing to 
cooperate with the areas israelisponsored local administration 
israel carved out its security zone when it withdrew the bulk of 
its occupation army from southern lebanon in june 1985 
the strip which extends from the mediterranean coast in the 
west to the foothills of mount hermon in the east serves as a 
buffer against crossborder guerrilla attacks against northern

janos kadar removed in may as head of 
hungarys communist party after 32 years in power is unable to 
carry out his official functions because of poor health a 
government minister said saturday 
kadar 76 was replaced by karoly grosz as party leader at a 
special conference and given the honorary post of party president 
kadar attended the second half of a meeting of the communist 
party central committee last month but has been absent from recent

minister of state rezso nyers told a meeting of reform 
communists saturday in szolnok that kadars attendance at the 
central committee meeting may have been his last such 
appearance the official mti news agency reported 
kadar was ousted as party chief as reform communists accused him 
of stifling progress they claimed he halted hungarys economic and 
political reforms in the 1970s and crticized his role in backing 
the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 that crushed that 
nations prague spring reforms 
mti reported nyers said the more than three decades of kadars 
rule should be reviewed but kadar probably would not become 
personally involved in any such review because of his health

rejoin the communist party after being expelled a year ago will 
remain outside the party according to a broadcast on hungary radio

a missouri abortionregulation dispute in 
which the supreme court will hear arguments wednesday has generated 
the most friendofthecourt briefs ever submitted in one case 
the justices are being asked to use the missouri case to 
overturn or substantially limit its 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
the landmark roe vs wade decision based on a womans 
constitutional right to privacy said a womans decision to have an 
abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to 
her and her doctor 
the court said states may interfere in the abortion decision 
during the second trimester only to protect the womans health and 
may take steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester 
when the fetus can survive outside the womb 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute however 
a federal appeals court relying on roe vs wade struck down as 
unconstitutional five key provisions of the missouri law now under 
scrutiny 
a ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for 
performing abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting an abortion 
a ban on using taxpayer money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus reasonably 
believed to be older than 19 weeks is viable capable of surving 
outside the womb by determining lung maturity and other testing 
a declaration that the life of each human begins at 
conception 
here are excerpts of some of the arguments raised in 
friendofthecourt briefs submitted to the justices in all the 
court received 45 such briefs supporting the missouri law and 33 
briefs opposing it

from the bush administration roe vs wade as the court is 
well aware has been intensely controversial from the day it was 
decided that controversy is more than simply a reflection of the 
deep divisions in american society over the underlying question of 
abortion rather the controversy has in substantial measure been 
a product of the decision itself 
roe rests on assumptions that are not firmly grounded in the 
constitution it adopts an unworkable framework tying permissible 
state regulation of abortion to particular periods in pregnancy 
and it has allowed courts to usurp the function of legislative 
bodies in weighing competing social ethical and scientific factors 
in reaching a judgment as to how much state regulation is 
appropriate in this sensitive area 
from the international right to life federation in most 
nations of the world abortion policy has not been the subject of 
constitutional intervention by a high court remaining determined 
by a wide variety of legislative schemes the democratic 
compromises reached in developed western nations are significantly 
more protective of fetal life than is roe vs wade 
from the american collegians for life and the catholic league 
for religious and civil rights under roe the states have an 
important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life from 
conception until birth which interest becomes compelling at 
viability 
if the states interest in the protection of fetal life 
becomes compelling at viability it necessarily follows that the 
states possess the ability to require that the point of viability 
be determined if the compelling nature of a states interest in 
unborn human life is to be anything more than illusory then 
roe and its progeny should be read to permit those states desiring 
to protect fetal life to require a physician to make a 
determination consistent with sound medical practice as to 
viability 
from the national right to life committee abortion 
jurisprudence needs resolution after 16 years of turmoil this 
court attempted to resolve the matter in 1973 time has proven the 
effort a failure this court is now confronted with the opportunity 
to restore a proper interpretation to the constitution returning 
this volatile matter of social policy to the proper fora the 
state legislatures 
from feminists for life there is ample evidence in the 
medical studies and public health statistics cited herein that the 
unfettered right of abortion on demand foisted upon our society by 
the court and by abortion advocates is a public health disaster the 
proportion of which we are just beginning to uncover 
from focus on family and the family research council of 
america changes in understanding and medical science will always 
outpace the courts ability to respond when this courts 
precedents are rooted in science and not in the constitution as 
was roes trimester framework science is pitted against precedent 
and the prestige of this honorable institution suffers 
this court can best protect the interests of our citizens by 
abandoning the trimester approach as outmoded unscientific and 
constitutionally unworkable and by recognizing that the states 
have legitimate interests existing throughout pregnancy in 
protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child 
from the us catholic conference if the court seriously 
seeks support for abortion decisions in the historical line of 
privacy cases it must reflect accurately that one persons 
liberty is not license to control even ones own body where 
anothers interest could suffer or the common good be diminished 
from the southern baptist convention the national association 
of evangelists the lutheran churchmissouri synod and the 
christian life commission it has been argued that state laws 
prohibiting abortion unconstitutionally impose the religious 
beliefs and views of one religion upon persons not adhering to 
those views thereby constituting an establishment of religion 
prohibited by the first amendment 
we do not advocate the imposition of our religious views by 
law in order to impose on others our religious beliefs rather 
those religious beliefs are deeply seated in the moral and 
ethical system that forms the basis of much of the civil and 
criminal law of this nation the fact that a states law 
coincides with a deeply held religious belief does not render that 
law unconstitutional under the first amendment

from the american medical association and other medical groups 
this court has observed that viability is usually placed at about 
seven months 28 weeks but may occur earlier even at 24 weeks 
since the improvements in health care have resulted in greater 
survival of infants born at a gestational age of 2428 weeks 
the earliest point at which a fetus can survive is 2324 weeks 
thus while substantial strides have occurred in saving 
infants born between 24 and 28 weeks the earliest point at which 
an infant can survive has changed little 
what the court found in 1973 is even more true today the 
medical risks to a woman of childbirth are greater than the risks 
of abortion 
from 167 scientists and physicians including 11 nobel 
laureates there is no scientific consensus that a human life 
begins at conception at a given stage of fetal development or at 
birth the question of when a human life begins cannot be 
answered by reference to scientific principles like those with 
which we predict planetary movement the answer to that question 
will depend on each individuals social religious philosophical 
ethical and moral beliefs and values 
assertions that viability has moved significantly earlier in 
fetal development are flatly contrary to the scientific evidence 
although advances in technology have improved the chances of 
survival of premature birth within the range of 24 to 28 weeks the 
outer limit of viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed 
roe vs wade has not been rendered obsolete by subsequent 
advancements in science 
from the american psychological association five major 
reviews of the psychological and psychiatric literature published 
between 1975 and 1989 all confirm that for the overwhelming 
majority of women who undergo abortion there are no longterm 
negative emotional effects 
when women experience regret depression or guilt such 
feelings are mild and diminish rapidly without adversely affecting 
general functioning severe emotional responses are rare even in 
young women to the contrary the great majority of women who have 
had an abortion express feelings of relief 
from the national association of public hospitals through 
its restrictions on the use of public facilities for the purpose of 
performing or assisting an abortion and on the use of public funds 
for the purpose of encouraging or counseling an abortion 
missouri has intruded deeply into the physicianpatient 
relationship 
missouris restriction has the effect of prohibiting 
constitutionally protected conduct and it is therefore 
unconstitutional 
from women about 3000 who have had abortions a compendium 
filed by the national organization for womens legal defense and 
education fund and the national abortion rights action league 
womens privacy and liberty interests would be substantially 
infringed upon by the provisions of the missouri statute at issue 
the option of abortion is fundamental to womens lives liberty 
and their pursuit of happiness 
from 281 american historians at the time the federal 
constitution was adopted abortion was known and not illegal 
abortion was not uncommon in colonial america 
a presumed interest in protecting fetal life does not justify 
denying women their historic liberty to choose abortion

during the reforms in poland 
from solidarity other economic and political organizations 
will be born said walesa solidarity for the moment is huge 
but it will become smaller with the growth of other organizations 
this is the logical course of events 
the first major office to open in warsaw since legalization was 
the solidarity citizens committee headquarters in an empty former 
history institute on the edge of the picturesque saxon garden park 
the organization technically separate from solidarity is racing 
against early deadlines for finding candidates it is collecting 
nominating signatures running campaigns and training election 
observers for parliamentary voting scheduled for june 4 and june 18 
on friday jacek kuron a veteran activist slated to run for the 
existing upper chamber of parliament scrambled through the 
building holding quick chats with several prominent activists in 
the bustling center 
its full of problems he replied when asked about the 
practical side of ushering in legal activity we dont have 
telephones we dont have space we dont have anything but we 
will 
jan litynski spokesman for the warsaw regional chapter of 
solidarity said the mood is getting hotter and hotter because 
of the elections 
anatol lawina a solidarity representative to the state election 
commission said he hopes to line up 100000 people nationwide to 
help guard against cheating at the 22000 polling sites 
elsewhere in the country local election offices and news 
bureaus were also being opened 
the election newspaper a newspaper that expects to circulate 
500000 copies has found offices in an empty building in central 
warsaw said ernest skalski one of the editors 
the paper will become the first opposition masscirculation 
daily in the east bloc with its first edition scheduled for may

president bush signed a secret intelligence 
directive to provide more than 10 million in aid to opponents of 
panamas gen manuel noriega in that countrys upcoming elections 
a published report says 
bush signed the directive called a finding in february 
according to the may 1 issue of us news amp world report the 
magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying bush personally lobbied 
the plan through the congressional intelligence committees and won 
approval for the cia to provide more than 10 million in aid 
including printing advertising transportation and communications 
to noriegas opponents 
reagan set a similar program in motion one year ago the 
magazine said 
asked about the report on saturday white house spokeswoman 
alixe glen said i cant comment on intelligence matters 
she added that the us official position remains opposed to 
noriega but that the government does not back any candidates there 
our position remains the same we want to return democracy to 
the panamanian people she added however its the panamanian 
people that vote 
panamanians go to the polls on may 7 in a presidential election 
where noriegas candidate is carlos duque 
noriega who is accused in a federal drug trafficking case in 
miami has been the central american countrys de facto ruler since 
february 1988 when he orchestrated the ouster of president eric 
arturo delvalle 
delvalle had tried to fire noriega as military leader 
washington still recognizes delvalle as the president of panama 
and president reagan in 1987 cut off military and economic aid to 
panama 
bush this month extended the sanctions which include sharp 
restrictions on us companies that do business in panama a hold 
on assets of the panamanian government in the united states and a 
prohibition on tax payments by us organizations to panama 
administration officials have raised the possibility that the 
sanctions could be eased if the may 7 elections are deemed to be 
fair but the officials have expressed pessimism that will be the 
case

president daniel ortega signed a law 
saturday that abolishes both prior censorship and the indefinite 
closures of newspapers and radio stations 
the new code does not authorize private television stations 
which had been sought by oppositon groups but guarantees equal 
access to social and political groups to governmentrun 
television 
the law was passed friday by the national assembly 
ortega signed it before before leaving on a twoweek tour of 11 
western european nations to seek aid for his cashstrapped 
sandinista government 
ortega claimed the new law is one of the most progressive in 
latin america because it does not provide for fines or permanent 
shutdowns of news outlets but it does provide for temporary 
suspensions 
the president also said journalists work in greater security in 
nicaragua than in other central american nations and he mentioned 
el salvador where he said they face systematic terrorism 
in other countries in the region journalists union leaders 
and opposition politicians are assassinated he told reporters 
after signing the law 
major provisions of the new law include 
penalties for disseminating information deemed contrary to the 
interests of the state for alterating government news 
releases communiques and other statements and for the 
transmission diffusion publication or projection of injurious 
defamatory or false information 
the interior ministry can order closures of up to four days and 
can order offending broadcasters or publishers to issue 
retractions clarifications or corrections broadcasters and 
publishers will have the right to a hearing before sanctions are 
applied 
no prior censorship 
under the previous law the government could require the news 
media to submit copies of articles to the censor before publication 
or broadcast and the interior ministry could order the inderfinite 
suspension of news media without a hearing 
the main opposition newspaper la prensa and the radion station 
of the nicaraguan roman catholic church were freequently shut down 
sometimes for months at a time and could only reopen with 
government approval 
ortega agreed at a meeting in february of the presidents of five 
central american countries to reform nicaraguas press laws and 
also the election code that will govern the general elections next 
february 
on saturday ortega said the four other central american nations 
have failed to live up to part of the agreement that he said 
provided for producing a plan to dismantle the usbacked 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
he accused the governments of honduras el salvador guatemala 
and costa rica of trying to toy with nicaragua 
and ortega again said the united states is trying to block 
propects for peace in the region 
the bush administration on friday extended a 4yearold economic 
embargo against nicaragua saying its leftist government poses an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to us security 
on tuesday president bush signed a measure that will provide 
498 million in humanitarian aid to the contras most of whom are 
based in honduras until the nicaraguan elections in february 
ortega said the us government is throwing gasoline on the 
fires of central american conflicts

four pumps were used to empty the 
remaining oiltainted water from a disabled leaking barge saturday 
and workers laid out absorbent pads to clean up the impurities that 
spilled into grand river 
officials said 10000 gallons of the nonhazardous waste 
material water with small percentages of oil and alcohol 
spilled into the river early friday on a loading dock on the river 
about 35 miles southwest of baton rouge 
earlier estimates had put the amount of the spill at 100000 
gallons or more 
as of 10 am they were pumping out the barge into vacuum 
trucks said douglas wootten a marine science technician for the 
coast guard they were one behind another as soon as one is 
filled another pulls up 
the spill occurred when a barge carrying 900000 gallons of the 
waste water from an exxon plant in houston buckled in the middle 
while workers unloaded the waste into tanker trucks 
there were initial fears for the fragile environment the site 
of the spill is near a large marshland area and some fish died 
but authorities said the spill was quickly contained by booms and 
the environmental damage would be minimal 
they have booms in place and only a small amount of the 
product went down river it is being retrieved wootten said 
absorbent pads have been put out to soak up the impurities in the 
river officials said 
gordon vice an employee at gsx land treatment which was being 
paid to dispose of the waste water did not have the required 
merchant marine certification for performing the work at the time 
of the accident said coast guard chief warrant officer larry doss 
gsx is assuming responsibility for the cleanup officials said 
gsx spokesman bobby mayweather said saturday afternoon that vice 
was at the site and unavailable for comment a woman answering the 
telephone at vices home in white castle also said he was 
unavailable 
exxon which has been harshly criticized in the past month 
because of the 10 milliongallon spill from an oil tanker that hit 
a reef off alaska had no involvement in fridays spill except that 
one of its plants was the source of the waste water officials said 
exxon is getting a bad rap on this wootten said they had 
nothing to do with the spill they had just hired a company to haul 
the product off in fact exxon should be commended they have no 
liability and they still sent a cleanup crew 
wootten said the amount of the socalled slop water leaking 
from the barge into the grand river was very small 
drip drip drip thats all it is he said 
paul dubois a spokesman for the palmer co owner of the barge 
said the wateralcohol mixture is used to wash out tanks and ships 
when its dirty with oil residue it becomes waste water he said 
exxon estimated the water contained 3 percent oil and 7 percent 
alcohol the alcohol began evaporating after the spill

the defense forces said saturday that 
panamas new visa requirement is designed to keep us journalists 
out of the country during the may 7 presidential election 
defense forces spokesman maj edgardo lopez grimaldo issued a 
statement claiming the us news media plan to denounce the 
elections as fraudulent 
it said the decision to require visas for us citizens to visit 
panama is to prevent a disinformation campaign and not to hide 
election fraud 
the visa requirement is aimed at a strategy of crying fraud to 
the four winds by representatives of the us press the 
statement said 
it added the us media voluntarily or involuntarily 
innocently or maliciously is playing the game of the state 
department and the us embassy in panama 
state department spokesman richard boucher said in washington 
thursday that the visa requirement was an attempt to isolate the 
electoral process from public scrutiny 
panamanian opposition leaders have invited hundreds of foreign 
observers to monitor the may voting they say they fear that the 
defense forces controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega will fix 
the vote in favor of carlos duque the officially sanctioned 
candidate 
the opposition alliance seeking noriegas ouster is supporting 
guillermo endara 
noriega was indicted in february 1988 by two federal grand 
juries in florida that accused the defense forces commander of drug 
trafficking 
the united states imposed economic sanctions against panama in 
an unsuccessful effort to force noriega to resign and leave panama 
the new visa requirement ended 43 years of easy entry into 
panama for us citizens until friday all they needed was a 
tourist card 
now they must have a visa issued by a panamanian consulate that 
recognizes acting president manuel solis palma most consulates do 
not recognize solis palma 
instead they recognize eric arturo delvalle who was ousted by 
the noriegadominated national assembly when he tried to force 
noriega to step down after the us drug indictments were issued 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as president 
in washington the may 1 issue of us news amp world report said 
president bush signed in february a secret intelligence directive 
to provide more than 10 million in election aid to noriegas 
oppoents 
the magazine attributed its report to unidentified sources and 
quoted them as saying bush personally lobbied the plan through 
congressional intelligence committees and won approval for the cia 
to provide the money for printing advertising transportation and 
communications to the generals opponents 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said saturday she could not 
comment on intelligence matters 
she said the us position remains opposed to noriega but the 
government does not back any candidates in the panamanian election 
our position remains the same we want to return democracy to 
the panamanian people she said its the panamanian people 
that vote 
earlier this month bush extended the sanctions that include 
restrictions on us companies doing business in panama holds 
assets of the panamanian government in the united states and 
prohibits tax payments by us organizations to panama

astroturf the synthetic sod that makes 
it possible to play football baseball and other sports where grass 
doesnt grow had a 25th birthday party at the private school where 
it all began 
astroturfs silver anniversary was observed friday at moses 
brown school the quaker school where the prototype was installed 
25 years ago as part of an effort to help city kids become more 
physically fit 
we had an idea that it would develop into something big 
recalled the schools athletic director and football coach jerry 
a zeoli who oversaw the installation and was among the 20 to 30 
people at fridays celebration 
astroturf has been installed in more than 500 locations in 32 
countries said astroturf industries inc president ed m milner 
it wound up at moses brown because of a ford foundation study 
showing urban children were less fit than their suburban 
counterparts in 1964 the foundation gave the school a grant to 
test the artificial grass in its new field house 
in developing the turf monsanto co studied traction shock 
absorbance weather resistance how balls rolled and bounced and a 
host of other factors milner said in a statement 
moses brown used its nylon field for baseball tennis soccer 
and lacrosse zeoli said it also saw service in graduation 
ceremonies and dances 
you can clean it so easily all you need is a vacuum 
cleaner zeoli said 
zeoli figured astroturf might have some potential when in 1965 
some officials from the houston astrodome journeyed north to have a 
look at the nylon carpet because they just couldnt get real grass 
to grow in their new domed stadium 
the texans decided on an improved version and the synthetic 
turf was subsequently named for the astrodome artificial turf 
which costs less to maintain than the natural variety is used 
today in most professional football stadiums 
astroturf is made from a nylon polymer which is dyed green and 
spun into a ribbon then crimped to give it texture and knitted to 
a tough backing 
moses browns prototype was far different from todays 
astroturf zeoli said its backing was just onesixteenth of an 
inch thick compared to as much as an inch today 
i could run plays and it was ideal but i couldnt 
scrimmage zeoli recalled hitting the surface could probably 
injure someone 
some professional athletes have blamed injuries on astroturf 
saying the synthetic surface does not give the way natural turf 
does 
however astroturf industries magazine turf talk quotes 
several doctors as saying the product does not increase the risk of 
football injuries 
astroturf industries was a subsidiary of monsanto until february 
1988 when it was sold to the west german company balsam 
sportstattenbau of steinhagen the company remains based in dalton 
ga 
as an anniversary gift the company resurfaced the weight room 
at moses brown with astroturf 
its old astroturf is still going strong threefourths of the 
prototype still covers the field house floor

people responded with surprising frankness to 
questions about sexual habits and drug use in a pilot study to 
determine the prevalence of aids suggesting a similar study could 
succeed nationwide us health officials say 
of the 308 eligible residents approached in january and february 
at their homes in allegheny county 263 or 85 percent agreed to 
fill out a form containing questions about sexual habits and drug 
use and to give a blood sample for the study in exchange for 50 
id call it a surprising success said peter hurley project 
officer for the atlantabased centers for disease control which 
commissioned the survey 
the results were discussed friday at a meeting of the allegheny 
county health departments community advisory committee which 
approved the pilot study last fall 
still unanswered researchers said is whether people 
participating in a survey are actually telling the truth about 
their intimate habits and whether a national survey could be done 
at close to the original estimated cost of 25 million 
besides the allegheny county study a pilot survey is slated to 
start this summer in dallas one in washington dc was scrapped 
in august after community leaders complained it appeared to single 
out blacks 
the pilot studies are running about 20 percent over budget 
largely because of the effort required to quell community concern 
about them hurley said 
in allegheny county out of an original pool of 450 homes 
randomly chosen for the survey interviewers found 308 where a 
person at home was aged between 18 and 54 the surveys target 
ages in all 263 of the 308 people agreed to fill out a form and 
give blood 
most residents said they agreed to take part because they wanted 
to help research into acquired immune deficiency syndrome only 15 
said the main reason was to get the 50 paid to everyone who 
answered the 22 questions and gave a blood sample 
aids tests were run on all of the blood samples but county 
health officials said they will not release the results even 
survey participants were not given the results of their own blood 
tests but those worried about having been exposed to aids were 
advised to contact their doctor or a health clinic

president jose azcona hoyo pleaded 
saturday with his countrymen to return their money to honduras 
saying capital flight was crippling the economy 
azcona said more than 1 billion had left the country in the 
last nine years most of it deposited in us banks 
he blamed the capital flight on regional conflicts that plague 
central america 
the uncertain panorama of central america has badly damaged 
honduras one of the few nations in the region which lives in 
democracy and relative tranquility azcona said 
there are no restrictions on the taking of capital out of 
honduras 
honduras is not involved in civil war but neighbors such as el 
salvador guatemala and nicaragua are and honduras has become a 
haven for both refugees and guerrillas 
azcona said that the situation confronting the region provokes 
fear and insecurity in local and foreign investors 
because of this more than 1 billion has been deposited in 
foreign bank accounts specifically in the united states by many 
hondurans in the last few years he said 
he said the majority of honduran businessmen have bank accounts 
in the united states of between 200000 and 300000 
he spoke in an interview with radio america one of the main 
networks in honduras 
if our compatriots would return only 25 percent of this 
capital which would be about 250 million it would partially 
solve the problems that confront honduras the president said 
honduras is ranked by many international organizations as one of 
the poorest nations in the hemisphere it suffers 30 percent 
unemployment a budget deficit of more than 300 million and an 
inflation rate of 30 percent

oklahomans on horseback and in wagons 
saturday reenacted the mad rush that occurred a century ago when 2 
million acres of indian territory were opened to white settlement 
thousands watched as history buff paul ward fired a colt pistol 
and 150 yelling participants in costume rushed forward 
with cowboy hats and other gear flying they raced a halfmile 
where the winners were awarded stakes like those their ancestors 
might have used to claim land in 1889 
a few yards into the race a woman was thrown from her horse 
she was taken away by ambulance but emergency officials said they 
didnt believe her injuries were serious 
the reenactment a parade and the issuing of a commemorative 
postcard were among hundreds of activities marking the 100th 
anniversary of the land run which was the first step in the 
process that led to the creation of the state of oklahoma in 1907 
at noon on april 22 1889 more than 40000 settlers raced from 
the borders of the 2 millionacre unassigned lands presentday 
central oklahoma then indian territory to claim 160acre tracts 
or town lots the land had been opened to white settlement by 
president benjamin harrison 
many oklahomans trace their roots to that race for land and the 
centennial has been a focus of celebrations statewide some indian 
groups are participating others have protested the festivities 
were in the ghetto while the people who stole our land are 
enjoying prosperity said frances wise a member of the tribal 
voices coalition 
she said asking indians to take part is like asking us to 
dance on the graves of our people 
many of the events took place in guthrie the old territorial 
capital and traffic on interstate 35 into town was backed up for 
about 10 miles saturday afternoon 
on the steps in front of guthries carnegie library the us 
postal service issued the commemorative postcard as gov henry 
bellmon wearing a cowboy hat and a westernstyle jacket and other 
dignitaries looked on 
speeches on the library steps delayed the start of the parade 
past its scheduled noon start 
mayor james weems got 65 floats and 18 marching bands rolling 
around 1215 pm drawing cheers from a crowd estimated at 50000 
as he said weve waited 100 years for this so lets start this 
sucker 
most of the settlers who flocked here in 1889 were immigrants 
former civil war soldiers blacks and farmers fleeing drought they 
also were opportunists speculators and profiteers 
edmond author stan hoig a retired central state university 
professor who has written 10 books on oklahoma history said the 
land run proved to be unfair at the time many called the 
unprecedented event harrisons hoss race 
for some the race was not to the swift but to the sneaky the 
sooners who got in sooner than everyone else and gave the state 
its nickname evaded federal troops guarding the areas borders and 
claimed choice parcels disputes over sooner claims snarled the 
courts for years 
those who staked claims for homesteads faced five years of hard 
work to prove up their land and gain permanent ownership many 
lived in houses constructed of sod cut from thickly matted soil 
that had never felt a plow 
some gave up their claims only to try again at later land 
openings in the indian territory four more via runs others by 
lottery allotment and sealed bids 
guthrie swelled by settlers staking their claims became the 
territorial capital and was the state capital before oklahoma city 
took its place in 1910

a judge investigating allegations of 
foreignexchange fraud has issued an order barring two former 
finance ministers from leaving the country newspapers reported 
saturday 
congressman carlos tablante whose accusations brought about the 
investigation has said the case involves overbilling and grants 
for dollars for nonexistent imports that could amount to more than 
4 billion 
the alleged fraud occurred during the administration of 
president jaime lusinchi of the social democratic party when there 
was a preferential dollar exchange system 
that system was abolished shortly after the feb 2 inauguration 
of president carlos andres perez also a social democrat who 
succeeded lusinchi 
the preferential plan pegged the exchange at 1450 bolivars per 
dollar for some imports and foreign debt payments when it was 
eliminated it left only the free market rate that ranged around 36 
bolivars per dollar last month 
judge luis la rivas order issued friday banned exfinance 
ministers manuel azpurua and hector hurtado from leaving venezuela 
also named in the prohibition order were former vice finance 
minister jorge garcia duque egdalia bastardo who had been the 
director of recadi and an unspecified number of other people who 
the judge did not identify 
recadi was the government agency since abolished that for six 
years was in charge of granting the preferential exchange for 
imports investigations by both la riva and a congressional 
committee are centered on recadi 
azpurua was finance minister during the first three years of 
lusinchis fiveyear administration he was replaced by hurtado 
who had previously served as minister of development

a goldfish was reunited with its 
owner saturday after a week few goldfish can claim to have survived 
the sixinch red fantail suffered a close brush with death a 
week ago when it fell from a motorcycle riders knapsack onto a 
busy highway but was rescued by a passing motorist and 
resuscitated at a nearby garage 
denise warley who was traveling in the opposite direction from 
the motorcyclist saw the newly purchased fish in its plastic bag 
of water pop onto the scalby road in this seaside town on the 
northeast coast of england 
mrs warley 43 asked her husband to stop their car and ran 
back along the road as cars drove over the bag and burst it 
leaving the goldfish high and dry 
the fish slithered into the gutter and was gasping its last when 
mrs warley scooped it up in her hands sprinted to a nearby garage 
and plunged it into water from a watering can then the warleys 
took it home to share a tank with their own goldfish 
when i picked him out of the gutter he looked in a state of 
shock the good samaritan said no wonder talk about the one 
that got away he must have more lives than a cat 
the story of the rescue appeared in a local newspaper and a pet 
shop owner recognized the fish he had sold by a stroke of luck 
the purchaser had left his name and address at the shop earlier 
when he bought a puppy there 
so after a week few of its peers would envy the lucky red 
fantail was safely handed over to his owner

the governor on saturday asked alaskans to 
observe five minutes of silence sunday in remembrance of the way 
things were before the exxon valdez oil spill fouled hundreds of 
miles of pristine coastline 
the coast guard and hundreds of volunteers meanwhile scrubbed 
tarlike oil from beaches vice admiral clyde robbins the coast 
guards onscene coordinator said the uss juneau and uss fort 
mchenry would join the effort as floating hotels 
they exxon asked me for them subject to finding out what 
the price is i suspect theyll use them said robbins adding 
that he had been told the ships cost the us government 150000 a 
day to operate 
exxon has asked to pay only the amount exceeding the 
governments cost of operating the landing ships which are both 
based in san diego robbins said the cost issue will be settled at 
the highest levels of government he said 
the juneau due in valdez on monday can sleep 840 troops the 
fort mchenry can sleep 500 
gov steve cowper set the period of silence to mark the 30day 
anniversary of the grounding of the exxon valdez the fully loaded 
tanker struck a reef and spilled 101 million gallons of crude into 
wildliferich prince william sound 
in cordova a fishing community 40 miles from the accident 
organizers planned an afternoon of activities including speeches 
displays of photographs and a childrens mural depicting the 
americas worst oil spill 
we wanted the world to know how much we loved prince william 
sound how beautiful we think it is said belle mickelson who 
coordinates commercial fisheries education programs at cordova high 
school 
maybe people will understand why were so sad seeing 
whales three feet away bears and fish swimming upstream are 
experiences threatened by the spill she said 
many fisherman have expressed frustration with exxon and the 
coast guard over the lack of progress since the march 24 accident 
they have been scooping oil with buckets 
a makeshift fleet of 48 skimmer boats returned to their work 
shortly after daylight saturday the oil is being taken to one of 
five barges hired by exxon to receive the recovered oil which will 
be reprocessed by the company 
low clouds and fog grounded observation and supply planes early 
saturday 
the cleanup concentrated on sites where seals haul themselves 
out of the water 
exxon spokesman joe tucker said 303000 feet of boom had been 
deployed to keep the 14 percent of the spill still at sea from 
coating beaches 
less than a halfmile of beaches have been cleaned while the 
spill has touched beaches along more than 300 miles of the kenai 
peninsula and kodiak island the latter home to many brown bears 
and the worlds no 1 fishing port 
robbins said that by midday saturday the 425foot soviet skimmer 
vaidogubsky picked up about 10000 gallons of oil at gore point 
the site of large pools of oil trapped by spectacular rock 
outcroppings 
the vessel arrived wednesday but spent days testing its booms 
and refueling as of saturday morning it had yet to scoop up any 
oil 
alaska policymakers worried that the states image has been at 
least as sullied as the spectacular shoreline sen ted stevens 
called on exxon to pay for a program to inspect alsaska seafood and 
certify its purity to ease consumer fears 
theres indications of a falloff in demand for alaska 
products the republican said its the largest problem ive 
seen so far and it could be overwhelming if not addressed 
rep don young ralaska and rep curt weldon rpa toured 
oiltainted shores with interior secretary manuel lujan jr and 
said friday they will introduce legislation to make one person 
probably the coast guard commandant responsible for spill 
cleanups

sailors aboard the uss wisconsin sister 
ship to the uss iowa where 47 men were killed last week in a gun 
turret explosion opened their ship saturday to talk about their 
pride in battleships and sense of loss 
the one thing on our mind is the tragic loss of many of our 
exshipmates said capt jerry m blesch commander of the 
wisconsin with only four battleships in the navy many aboard the 
iowa once served on the wisconsin 
these are all old ships said lt matt schatzle 25 of 
gulfport miss who commands the three 16inch guns of the 
wisconsins turret no 3 the crews have a connection with all 
the old sailors who served on the same ships back in world war ii 
they do the same jobs they face the same dangers 
an explosion ripped through the iowas no 2 turret wednesday 
during gunnery exercises off puerto rico the cause of the blast 
was under investigation the guns 2700pound projectile is fired 
by six 110pound bags of black powder 
at the time of the explosion there were 58 men in the turret 
which extends six decks into the 887foot ship the 11 who survived 
were all in the lowest deck loading powder from the ships forward 
magazines the navy said 
navy teams that entered the turret immediately after the blast 
found the no 2 guns breech open and undamaged with the practice 
projectile that the gun was to have fired still sitting there the 
new york times reported in sunday editions 
this indicated that the explosion occurred as the six bags were 
being loaded into the gun and before it was ready to fire the 
times said quoting unidentified sources who have seen initial 
reports on the disaster 
navy gunnery officers have further narrowed their estimate of 
the time of the explosion to the point when the bags were being 
transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the newspaper said 
they said the flame and gases released by the explosion which 
killed everyone in the upper part of the turret also went down the 
powder hoist to the lowest deck 
the officers said that if the transfer of powder to the guns had 
been complete the hoist also would have been sealed off 
pentagon spokesman jim turner said saturday he had no new 
information on the investigation the ship is expected to arrive at 
its home port here on sunday and a base memorial service is 
scheduled for monday with president bush 
aboard the wisconsin a texas sailor was undaunted 
to me this is the gunners ultimate dream said gunners 
mate 1st class billy owens pointing into the gun room filled with 
the immense breech of the 16inch gun 
there is a big boom rattle and shake when it goes off i just 
like hearing them go off its the ultimate experience little guns 
go bang the big ones boom said the 29yearold corpus christi 
native 
in the turret conditions are cramped and the equipment old 
maintenance said the crew is a daily ritual 
one of the things about these guns is the pride they 
instill schatzle said everything in the gun room is 
mechanical there are no computers the men actually do things 
they can take apart the equipment like a car they get dirty its 
a handson job and its something that the gunners are proud of 
its a team and team effort 
it has brought home the fact that it is a dangerous occupation 
and that things can go wrong and will go wrong in the future 
blesch said a kentucky native he compared gun duty to coal 
mining where caveins and injuries occur 
critics have argued that the battleships are too old 
especially the 16inch guns to be effective something blesch 
disputed 
these are magnificent ships the iowa withstood the turret 
blast and today is steaming to port essentially battle ready what 
other ship could he asked

meet a budget crunch didnt have to look further than their 
basement where they found an authentic copy of lincolns 
emancipation proclamation hidden in a junk pile 
trustees of ashfields small public library were meeting in the 
basement worrying over whether state and federal grants would come 
through when they stumbled across the copy said trustee maurice 
isserman a professor of history at mount holyoke college in south 
hadley 
somebody said we could sell those old prints over there in the 
corner he said i walked over and looked at one and it wasnt 
a print it was a document and i looked down at the bottom and 
there was abraham lincolns signature 
i took it to a local appraiser who introduced me to the world 
of lincolnia sales he told us we had a valuable document and i 
called up sothebys isserman said 
the document was one of 48 copies made in 1864 signed by 
lincoln and secretary of state william seward experts at sothebys 
auction house in new york told library trustees 
the document will be auctioned next fall and is expected to 
fetch at least 70000 just about equal to what the library needs

thousands of gallons of water 
flooded a control room at the river bend nuclear power plant 
knocking out pumps that help cool the reactor a nuclear regulatory 
commission spokesman said saturday 
the plant had been shut down for about three weeks for refueling 
and maintenance when the accident occurred shortly after midnight 
wednesday said bill benedetto spokesman for plant owner gulf 
state utilities 
the reactor cores temperature never exceeded 95 degrees there 
were no injuries and the pumps were working again within 10 minutes 
of the accident benedetto said 
a federal investigative team arrived friday to look into the 
accident said nrc spokesman joe gilliland 
according to gilliland a maintenance crew had been fixing a 
6inch water pipe in the plants auxiliary building which houses 
pumps and control centers workers used seals to block water to the 
section the crew was working on but the seals failed and about 
15000 gallons poured out 
the pipe carries water used to cool various plant equipment but 
not the reactor itself gilliland said the water that spilled was 
not radioactive 
however the flood shorted out electrical equipment running the 
pumps that cool the reactor and powering lights in several parts of 
the plant benedetto said 
he said the work that caused the spill would not have been 
performed if the reactor had been operating 
the inspection teams report should be completed in about three 
weeks about the same amount of time river bend is to remain shut 
down gilliland said 
river bend is about 25 miles northwest of baton rouge and has 
been in operation since 1985

an australian scientist has charged an 
influential indian scholar faked the fossil history of india and 
the himalayas in what he called one of biggest paleontological 
frauds of all time 
its a massive fabric of disinformation liberally poured into 
a 25year period without anyone blowing the whistle said john 
talent an associate professor in earth sciences at sydneys 
macquarie university 
talent accused prominent indian geologist viswa jit gupta of 
building his career on a warped twisted tangled web of 
disinformation 
gupta a geologist at the panjab university in chandigarh 
india was quoted in the new york times sunday as saying talent was 
lying about him he said talents charges were far from the 
truth and the product of malicious bias and professional 
jealousy 
talent in an interview thursday with the associated press said 
gupta had invented fictitious fossils and had rewritten the 
geological history of northern india he said gupta based his 
writings on specimens that could be bought in fossil shops and 
were often picked up in the united states parts of europe china 
and elsewhere 
he said gupta had reported discovering a huge number of 
fossils in remote areas of the himalayas which because of the high 
mountain range is accessible to few scientists 
he contended that most of the specimens were common laboratory 
rocks 
talents findings were published thursday in the respected 
british journal nature 
talent said gupta had published about 400 scientific papers and 
several major texts on the geology of the indian subcontinent 
he said academics from around the world had collaborated on the 
papers which were readily accepted by leading international 
journals 
the sydney morning herald newspaper in an earlier interview 
said talent estimated that about 60 scientists had unwittingly 
been drawn into the fraud by agreeing to examine specimens and 
coauthor papers 
talent said he first became suspicious of guptas research in 
1971 because of a research paper on tiny marine fossils called 
graptolites which he reported came from a site in kashmir 
after visiting the site talent said he discovered to my 
amazement you could never find graptolites or any kind of fossils 
there because the site was so mashed up 
i became intrigued at the results that gupta was putting into 
the literature he said i intially believed that the fraud 
would collapse under its own weight 
it reached a point that there was so much misinformation that 
it was getting difficult to place our own work and that of our 
colleagues in context 
gupta told the times he had invited talent to visit his 
laboratory in chandigarh and the fossil sites that were in dispute 
but talent declined talent told the newspaper he had not been able 
to fit such visits into his schedule and was calling for an 
investigation by a panel of scientists

about 200 people including seriously ill 
patients who said medical research with animals had saved their 
lives rallied saturday at northwestern university in support of 
such research 
the rally by students faculty members and proresearch 
demonstrators came after a rash of protests and death threats 
against biomedical researchers at the university in this suburb 
north of chicago 
university president arnold weber told demonstrators the 
university would not be intimidated by recent acts of vandalism 
against university buildings including spraypainted death threats 
against faculty members 
animal rights groups have denied any connection with the threats 
and vandalism 
seriously ill demonstrators said research using animals is their 
only only hope for a cure and claimed that foes are jeopardizing 
medical progress 
we need to look at the human side of it and realize what 
would happen if animal rights activists got their way said steve 
carroll national executive director of the incurably ill for 
animal research a group he said has 2500 members nationwide 
carroll 37 was severely burned over 50 percent of his body in 
an airplane accident and suffers from chronic osteomyelitis a 
painful bone infection he said can be treated thanks to tests on 
animals 
i am a person whose life was saved by animal research he 
said theres no way i can express how grateful i am this 
research was done 
painkillers that allowed me to keep my sanity were developed 
on animals carroll said we wouldnt have coronary bypass 
surgery be able to remove cateracts or have joint implants for 
arthritis victims without the research 
carroll was joined by about a dozen other patients who have 
illnesses for which there is not yet a cure including diabetics 
cancer survivors and two children with congenital heart defects 
two parents also spoke at the rally contending that their 
children would not be alive if it werent for medical progress made 
through animal testing 
a member of concerned citizens for ethical research a group 
opposed to animal testing said he was outraged by what he called a 
distortion of the issue 
they paint a picture trying to say that animal rights 
activists are hurting medical progress said steve davis just 
because something has been done in the past or is legal doesnt 
mean that its right 
the concerned citizens group has targeted five scientists in 
recent weeks pressuring them to discontinue their research 
the group contends northwestern researchers starve monkeys and 
stick electrodes and needles in cats eyes researchers counter 
that the animals are anesthetized and feel no pain

in a fiscal ruse that authorities 
hoped would help them track ramon salcido police persuaded wells 
fargo bank to extend unlimited credit to the accused mass killer 
the automatic teller machines effectively were deputized to help 
catch the man accused of killing his wife two of his daughters 
his motherinlaw and her two daughters and a winery coworker 
salcido fled to mexico where he was captured and deported back to 
california late thursday 
salcido was reported to have run out of bank funds last week 
while on a cocaineandalcohol binge that friends said preceded the 
slaughter 
the sonoma county sheriffs office arranged with the bank to 
track salcido through any transactions he made with his automatic 
teller atm card and instructed bank tellers that his credit line 
was wide open sheriff dick michaelsen said 
wells fargo spokeswoman lisa hoogerwef said the bank gladly 
cooperated with authorities adding that salcido tried to use an 
automatic teller card at least once at a wells fargo branch in san 
rafael on friday at 924 am and possibly again later in san 
francisco while heading for mexico 
investigators said the killings occurred that day between 7 am 
and 10 am 
salcido also bought some clothes with his bank card at the ross 
dress for less store in san rafael friday morning 
the debate was whether or not you give him open credit 
we were worried about the safety of our tellers said hoogerwef 
we did not want to do anything to set him off agreed ron 
renfro the banks security manager 
renfro said as word of the crimes spread it became more 
credible that salcido would not chance going into a bank where he 
might be recognized and would try to use the atm to get cash 
michaelsen said with the banks cooperation the department was 
able to bypass a court request for permission to tap in to 
salcidos account 
the sheriff said the bank cooperated because they were in hot 
pursuit and lives were in danger 
i am very proud i think we did an excellent job said 
michaelsen it was excellent police work it his arrest was not 
just a fluke

friendly investors could help northwest 
airlines defend itself from a hostile takeover bid if the carriers 
5000 pilots quickly agree to a contract according to a management 
letter made public friday 
frankly there are alternatives available to us from friendly 
investors chairman steven rothmeier said in the letter which 
was sent to pilots of the nations fourthlargest airline on 
thursday 
the absence of a pilot contract keeps the patient money 
away the letter said but it does nothing to scare away the 
highly leveraged money from those investors who dont really care 
because if they cant make the airline work they just break it 
up 
the letter was released to the media after stock in northwest 
parent nwa inc closed at 10250 on the new york stock exchange 
up 375 from thursdays close 
the stock price reflects a belief on wall street that there will 
be a bid higher than billionaire marvin davis current 27 
billion or 90ashare hostile tender offer 
calls to the twin cities headquarters of the air line pilots 
association went unanswered friday night pilots have been working 
under two separate contracts since northwest acquired republic 
airlines in the fall of 1986 one of the key sticking points in 
negotiations is merging the airlines seniority lists both 
contracts have expired 
we are prepared and willing to negotiate around the clock to 
reach an agreement rothmeier wrote we are in a fluid 
situation that can change quite literally from hour to hour 
according to testimony in a lawsuit filed by northwest against 
davis representatives for davis have been in contact with labor 
leaders at northwest including the pilots union a judge has 
issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting davis from 
disrupting the contract talks but the order does not forbid 
nondisruptive communication 
davis aides have said they want to establish an open 
dialogue with the pilots davis himself has said he does not 
intend to break up the airline by selling strategic assets to pay 
takeover debt

soviet defense spending rose 3 percent last 
year despite president mikhail s gorbachevs promises to cut his 
military budget according to an intelligence report released 
saturday 
but the study prepared jointly by the cia and the pentagons 
defense intelligence agency also said gorbachev was laying the 
groundwork for his proposed 142 percent cut in defense spending 
the study said chopping military spending so sharply would 
require the soviets to reduce their armed forces by more than the 
500000troop reduction announced by gorbachev last december 
meaning further cutbacks in the soviet military 
the newly declassified report painted a grim overall picture of 
the soviet economy it said gorbachev had been forced to slow the 
pace of his economic reforms and to delay such key steps as 
allowing the market to set wholesale and retail prices

many company bosses duck investor salvos at annual meetings but 
warren buffett likely will bask in shareholder adulation because 
hes enriched them for the 24th year 
buffett one of the worlds wealthiest people is chairman of 
berkshire hathaway inc a 6 billion conglomerate with interests 
that include an encyclopedia a homespun candy maker an omaha 
furniture mart a giant insurance company and investments in coca 
cola co capital cities abc inc the washington post co and 
salomon brothers inc among others 
folksy charming and unconventional the 57yearold investor 
wows shareholders and stock analysts with a pithy annual report he 
writes himself filled with insights into what he considers good 
and bad in his business and the economy in general 
its earned him the nickname oracle of omaha 
this year buffett began the report with a 21page letter to 
shareholders telling them the stock market is lousy corporate 
taxes are higher and the takeover business is getting expensive 
nonetheless he wrote berkshires management team gained 569 
million in net worth for them in 1988 contributing to an average 
net worth gain of 23 percent over the last 24 years he also 
proclaimed berkshire had made a great investment in borsheims a 
flourishing omaha jewelry business 
we continue to concentrate our investments in a very few 
companies that we try to understand well buffett wrote there 
are only a handful of businesses about which we have strong 
longterm convictions therefore when we find such a business we 
want to participate in a meaningful way we agree with mae west 
too much of a good thing can be wonderful 
buffetts report is a prelude to berkshire hathaways annual 
meeting which hes holding monday in omaha the companys 
headquarters he plans to make shareholders feel like theyre at a 
family reunion 
after the meeting we will have several buses available to take 
you to visit mrs b at the nebraska furniture mart and ike friedman 
at borsheims buffett wrote to the shareholders be prepared 
for bargains 
the biggest bargain berkshire hathaway shareholders ever got was 
buying the companys stock which had a book value of about 20 a 
share in the mid 1960s when buffett acquired what was then 
massachusetts cloth milling concern with 10 million in assets now 
its book value is nearly 3000 a share and it trades on the new 
york stock exchange at nearly 5900 a share 
berkshire hathaway is considered such a gem that takeover 
strategist t boone pickens ranked it last month as among the top 
20 of 1000 big companies for what he called its commitment to 
shareholders 
buffetts annual report is so widely followed that usa today 
said recently it runs a good chance of being the only one anyone 
actually reads on or off wall street 
verne mckenzie berkshire hathaways chief financial officer 
said the company is besieged with requests for the annual report 
and shareholders flock like pilgrims to the annual meeting 
people travel here from the far reaches of the country and the 
world he said 
richard a lewis chairman of corporate annual reports inc a 
professional annual report publishing concern gave high marks to 
buffetts yearly prognostications to shareholders largely because 
it showed he was honest and direct with fellow owners of the 
company 
buffett is one of the four or five richest men in america 
lewis said when he speaks people listen he uses his report to 
say what he wants to say he uses the report to underscore his own 
investment principles and the keys to his success 
nonetheless buffett is not universally admired sid cato 
publisher of a monthly newsletter on annual reports based in 
waukesha wis ranked berkshire hathaways as one of the 10 worst 
last year largely because of what he called buffetts inflated ego 
i wrote mr buffett youre starting to get on my nerves 
already enough already cato said 
asked if hed seen this years annual report cato said no 
he has not seen fit to send me a copy
