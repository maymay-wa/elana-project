nomination of zalman shoval as its ambassador to the united states 
a foreign ministry spokesman said 
shoval 60 a legislator from prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc will resign from the parliament or knesset 
before assuming his post the spokesman said 
the replacement will take effect at the end of september after 
the us administration agrees to the nomination in accordance with 
diplomatic protocol he said 
shoval himself speaking on israel army radio expressed hope he 
would encounter a more positive atmosphere in washington than did 
his predecessor moshe arad 
the us administration has been increasingly critical of the 
jewish state over its failed peace efforts with the palestinians 
they have been waging a 32month rebellion against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and the gaza strip 
shoval said the us administration due to the persian gulf 
crisis now appears to realize that the israelipalestinian 
conflict is not the main reason for conflict in the middle east and 
that israel is in the end the only stable ally the united states 
has in the middle east 
the polishborn shoval is an veteran israeli politician who is 
also experienced in diplomacy in 19551957 he worked at the 
foreign ministry where he rose from a cadet to the post of deputy 
head of the north american desk

western south dakota on sunday as the weeklong 50th black hills 
motor classic came to a violencemarred end 
the event drew an estimated 300000 bikers to the area its 
mostly peaceful festive mood was dampened by a saturday night 
shooting and stabbing brawl involving the outlaws and sons of 
silence motorcycle gangs three men were injured

traffic accidents one person was killed by carbonmonoxide 
poisoning in a tent and police shot and killed a knifewielding

law officers issued 1060 traffic tickets and 2143 warnings 
and made 202 drunken driving and 73 drug arrests officials 
reported 133 traffic accidents 78 involving injuries 
the fight occurred saturday night at gunners lounge and casino 
on main street usually a hangout for hells angels during the 
event officials said two sons of silence members were 
hospitalized in stable but serious condition sunday with stab 
wounds said meade county sheriff floyd cleland a member of the 
outlaws was treated for gunshot wounds and released 
the stabbing victims will be charged with aggravated assault 
and the gunshot victim may also be charged cleland said 
it sure puts a damper on people having a good time said 
matt waller of gillette wyo who operated a food stand near the 
main street bar where the fight occurred 
by sunday morning the scene on main street appeared to return 
to normal bikers again rode and walked the route around a huge 
cluster of motorcycles parked down the center and along the length 
of the street 
the violence didnt take anyone by surprise 
as ive said before the potential is there cleland said 
these people all drink booze take drugs and carry knives and 
guns 
with this amount of people you know theres going to be 
things happen theres going to be accidents theres going to be 
fights said bill kienast who works at a truckbuilding company 
in oshkosk wis 
marcy myhre executive director of the sturgis area chamber of 
commerces black hills motor classic board noted that last years 
rally drew only 60000 people 
the week went well except for a few incidents of violence she 
said we put a lot of effort into it and its too bad things 
like that have to happen 
some sturgis residents have tried to stop the rally but most 
seem to accept and even enjoy the crowds that invade the town of 
7000 one week each year according to conservative estimates the 
bikers and other visitors spent at least 34 million in the town 
and surrounding black hills 
a lot of them feel it was a little too much but a lot of them 
realize this is a onceinalifetime crowd too myhre said 
sturgis residents ken and barb grosch were on main street 
saturday night before the riot recorded images of people and 
motorcycles with a video camera 
its nice to see a small boring town come alive said mrs 
grosch i think its great but after a week or so im ready to 
see them go home 
main street was the center of activity with thousands of 
motorcycles parked in the middle of the street and at the curb and 
bikers sporting leather and tattoos as they gathered around their 
hogs 
merlin rosen a veterinary student from fort collins colo 
posed with two boa constrictors wrapped around her neck and arms 
everybody has to stop and look and theres always the 
attraction of being seen she said 
biker gangs werent the only ones who showed up for the week of 
races and other events there are many motorcycle enthusiasts among

for years philadelphia schools have offered students a chance 
to study latin as early as fourth grade but this fall fewer kids 
will learn their amo amas amats a tight budget has forced 
the layoff of six out of 26 itinerant latin teachers 
an awful lot of them wont even finish high school and the 
only language they are exposed to is street language this is the 
one opportunity they have to get a little something beyond 
thatsaid one laidoff latin teacher h michael dunn 
many such cuts affecting both innovative programs and 
daytoday operations await bigcity districts across the country 
this fall a check by the associated press found that districts 
from philadelphia boston and new york to dade county fla and 
los angeles face the worst fiscal problems since the mid70s 
its going to be tough to innovate when youre trying to 
survive said james fleming associate superintendent of dade 
county schools a district that gained national notice for school 
reforms but now faces a 108 million deficit that will likely lead 
to more crowded classes 
with a possible recession looming and worsening state finances 
putting a squeeze on school budgets bigcity school officials 
everywhere are bracing for teacher hiring freezes layoffs and 
larger classes 
its a very bleak fall said jewell gould research director 
of the american federation of teachers 
he and others believe next spring could bring even worse news 
when districts customarily send out layoff notices 
one leading reformer called this falls cutbacks fresh evidence 
that political leaders give more lip service than resources to 
school improvement 
if snow is piling up in city streets you get a greater sense 
of emergency than if half the kids drop out of school year after 
year said ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation 
for the advancement of teaching 
on the one hand we say education is at the center of what we 
hope for and dream about and we almost get maudlin about it but 
then if something happens it gets put off as kid stuff he 
said 
this is easily the worst fiscal crisis i have seen in the last 
20 years said fleming of dade county 
state funding fell 44 million less than expected said dade 
county school spokesman andy gollan its already meant elimination 
of a merit schools program where schools devised innovative 
programs to help students achieve educational goals 
philadelphia anticipating deficits of 68 million for fiscal 
year 199192 170 million in 1993 and 275 million in 1994 has 
put on hold reforms including fullday kindergartens lengthening 
the school day and year and more classroom computers 
its come to a period where we have to make hard choices 
which are not necessarily popular choices said leontine d 
scott associate superintendent 
in boston a 397 million budget approved last week is 64 
million lower than last years cuts include 100 fewer nontenured 
teachers fewer school police reduced extracurricular and 
afterschool programs less funding for a cityfinanced parent 
organization and reductions in a private industry council that 
provides jobs for highschool students 
the citys schoolchildren are treated like secondclass 
citizens because they dont have the political clout that other 
communities have said boston school committee member peggy davis 
mullen 
in los angeles a 220 million budget gap earlier this year 
forced extensive administrative cuts the crisis worsened last week 
when gov george deukmejian announced he was withholding 465 
million in school funds statewide compelling the district to cut 
77 million more from the 199091 budget 
school officials havent decided yet how to parcel out the cuts 
but a number of reform ideas have already been shelved or reduced 
a bilingual master plan designed to help nonenglish speaking 
students in all major subject areas has been only partially funded 
the district is also postponing expansion of its schoolbased 
management program in which more than 60 schools participate 
devastating would not be too strong a word said school 
board member rita walters it just socks it to us 
new york citys school board must come up with 268 million in 
instructional cuts this fall after having already eliminated some 
350 jobs at the central board 
how that will be done is the unanswered question said susan 
amlung a spokeswoman for the united federation of teachers 
the district is likely to cut school aides and 
paraprofessionals measures that the union fears will put more 
students in alreadyovercrowded classes school officials insist 
that wont happen kindergarten classes currently average 248 
pupils and highschool classes of 40 or more are not uncommon 
seattles 2436 million school budget has meant eliminating 165 
teaching administrative and other positions mainly through 
attrition 
its been a difficult time said seattle schools budget 
manager george steinhofer weve taken a number of reductions in 
central administration and this year we took reductions in special 
education and bilingual programs the only place left to look is in 
basic educational programs 
new orleans is closing two of its three centers for problem 
students and 60 school employees were laid off to balance the 358 
million budget said superintendent everett williams 
thats been the story of our life in this school district for 
the past four or five years i have had no budget thats been an 
even budget where i have been able to start off the year with no 
cuts at all he said 
in houston superintendent joan raymond is pushing for a record 
18 percent tax rate hike to fund a 7979 million budget the 
proposed budget would provide a 10 percent pay raise for teachers 
31 new principals and deans a dropout prevention program beefed 
up security a principal performance incentive program and funding 
of a massive construction program 
but some taxpayers are resisting 
by no extent of the imagination is the public going along with 
this said john pellicciotti a board member of the taxpayers 
coalition of greater houston 
not all cities are in such dire straits 
in atlanta public schools comptroller lawrence thompson said 
the district has not had cuts next years budget is 3313 
million compared with 3193 million this past school year 
weve been pretty fortunate thompson said 
newark with a 421 million school budget has an 85 million 
shortfall but has largely avoided layoffs some assistant 
principals and other administrators may be demoted to save money 
said spokesman kirk smith 
next year the district will get as much as 50 million in 
additional funds as part of a state plan to boost the quality of 
new jersey city schools but another state plan to shift teacher 
pension costs entirely to local districts could cancel out those 
gains smith said 
in detroit an 889 million budget for the 199091 school year 
includes such reform initiatives as expanded preschools and special 
schools meant to help troubled ninthgraders avoid disciplinary 
problems 
a 5mill property tax increase and a bond issue approved by 
voters last september wiped out the districts 160 million deficit

here are excerpts from editorials on the middle east crisis in 
sunday editions of us newspapers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the mideast crisis triggered by the decision of militaristic 
iraq to seize one oilproducing nation and threaten the conquest of 
others has predictably destabilized the worlds energy network 
what is surprising and inexcusable is that america enters 
this state of confusion without an energy policy any more 
comprehensive than the hapless policies of 1973 the iraqi threat 
to one of the worlds major oilproducing regions should force the 
development of an energy policy designed to secure the nations 
energy needs a national energy policy is long overdue 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
faster than anyone had bargained for america is learning what 
it will take to defend its national interests in the postcold war 
era neither hawks nor doves of the old school are enjoying the 
lesson 
one lesson of kuwait is that the united states must maintain 
enough military strength to protect its commerce and citizens from 
pirates like hussein this is a depressing prospect for doves who 
have been gleefully preparing to cut americas defense budget 
middle east events havent been kind to cold war hawks either 
 
european armies mirved missiles and 800 million bombers arent 
much use against the likes of hussein the crises america is likely 
to face in the foreseeable future will demand strong airborne and 
marine forces light armor tactical air and naval power much of 
it able to move on a days notice to any trouble spot in the world

saddam wants to be seen as a military strongman who gets what he 
needs through brute strength he sees hostagetakingy correctly 
as the desperate resort of the powerless and not worthy of the 
selfproclaimed leader of the arab world 
not yet that is if they are not actual hostages the foreign 
nationals held by iraq represent insurance for saddam they are his 
rainyday fund so to speak if and when his situation 
deteriorates which it will they will become far more valuable 
they will become in truth hostages 
it is the rule of the middle east bazaar any americans held 
hostage by iraq become worth what we are willing to pay the more 
preoccupied we become with getting them back the more unlikely 
they will be released at a price we are capable of paying

by snatching kuwait hussein injected uncertainty into the 
worldwide oil system uncertainty affects prices because oil 
selling today has to be priced at what it will cost tomorrow to 
replace it uncertainty affects supplies because consumers from the 
motorist to the refiner to the gaspump jockey lay in extra in case 
shortages develop thereby creating supply disruptions 
whether in the persian gulf or at home bad oil news will be 
telegraphed to americans via their local gas pump they should get 
mad at themselves if they continue to let their dependence on 
imported oil make them vulnerable to madmen

it should be said that the arab leagues decision to send 
arab troops to defend saudi arabia is one of the more hopeful 
signs for the future of world peace since world war ii for it 
therapeutically destroys the myth of arab unity a fantasy based 
on the preposterous but powerful assumption that the various arab 
countries comprise one arab nation 
saddam has forced fellow arabs to choose between civilized 
international behavior and a bloodyminded arab dictator 
it also represents a great personal victory for president bush 
and for us efforts to create a global force to thwart iraqi 
aggression the president has spent much time and energy trying to 
ensure that the world community and not just the west condemns 
and confronts baghdad 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
theres an immediate lesson to be drawn from the confrontation 
in the persian gulf the danger of this countrys crushing 
dependence on imported oil in part thats a legacy of the reagan 
years but it is also a failure of industry and consumers to 
recognize the advantages of alternate energy sources 
there arent any quickfix solutions the fastest and cheapest 
way to respond to the cutback in oil imports would be a national 
conservation program the president in concert with the nations 
governors and mayors ought to act immediately to curb profligate 
use of petroleum 
we can no longer remain complacent about importing 50 percent of 
our petroleum this imbalance must be ended our future economic 
wellbeing is at stake 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
although us military experts grow more sanguine as each hour 
passes the wild card in this is the unpredictability of the 
volatile saddam a man who has used poison gas against the kurds in 
his own country and against teenage iranian soldiers his 
volatility makes military planning against him more difficult 
saddam can rant all he wants but he is up against 
formidable odds his whole economy is based on the iraqis ability 
to sell their oil so as long as the blockade is successful it 
amounts to an economic chokehold 
the events played out in the sands of the middle east will 
surely have repercussions on the us domestic front in terms of 
both energy and defense policies

it is heartening to see egypt exercising leadership in the 
strategy to force iraq out of kuwait for the united states and 
europe the primary interest in political stability there is the 
flow of oil iraqs neighbors have much more at stake iraq has 
made it clear that its intentions go beyond this months conquest 
it proposes to make itself dominant among the arabs saddam hussein 
has been claiming in recent days to speak for all the arab world 
in a great test of will and of strength with the americans but 
most of the arab world denounced him on friday in the arab leagues 
meeting and now egyptian forces as well as americans face him at 
the saudi border

no one in washington it seems wants to use the h word 
hostages to describe the several thousand americans who were 
caught in kuwait and iraq at the time of the latters blitzkrieg 
conquest of the former two weeks ago with every day that passes 
without their being allowed to leave however it becomes harder to 
avoid the conclusion that they are being held against their will 
president bush should set a deadline for the unconditional 
release of the americans failure to comply will result in attacks 
on iraqi oil fields and other targets harm to any americans would 
be considered an act of allout war 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
an arab force on the saudi border will signal that an attack 
will embroil him hussein in an interarab war it is hoped that 
this would also undercut his attempt to portray himself as the hero 
who would save arab oil fields and muslim holy places from unclean 
western hands 
the real test of global cooperation against iraq will be if 
that blockade holds it could take months for sanctions to move 
baghdad and saddam hussein will undoubtedly counterattack he may 
use hostages or terrorism or undermine arab leaders who stand up 
to him it will take patience and test white house leadership to 
keep a global blockade going but the best inspiration to stick 
together may come from listening to the words of saddam hussein 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the crisis provoked by iraqs invasion of kuwait has escalated 
into the first major confrontation of the postcold war era and new 
realities both hopeful and sobering are emerging 
foremost among the latter is the realization that a world 
liberated from the threat of nuclear annihilation will not be free 
of mortal danger as the case of saddam hussein makes all too 
clear there remain good oldfashioned nationalist dictators every 
bit as aggressive and threatening as stalinist ideologues 
but much that has transpired so far should be a source of 
hope the willingness of the vast majority of the worlds nations 
to directly and collectively engage husseins challenge is as 
foreign policy analyst stanley hoffman put it quite 
remarkable in fact if the antihussein coalition holds 
together this crisis could as former diplomat richard n gardner 
has said constitute a landmark event in the history of this 
century

every malay who is anybody has a 
title from the duli yang maha mulia seri paduka baginda yang 
dipertuan agong thats the king to each haji and hajah who 
makes the moslem pilgrimage to mecca 
tun tan seri and datuk are among the many hereditary or 
conferred titles borne by leading citizens 
proper ways of addressing a malay are diverse and complicated 
family names are relatively unimportant as long as the title is 
used correctly improper usage may cause offense 
some titles are gained at birth others given as rewards for 
service to government or nation to the ordinary encik mister 
titles and forms of address can be confusing 
the kings title means approximately his most glorious 
majesty who is raised most high in english your majesty is 
usually enough the queen or seri baginda raja permaisuri agong 
also is your majesty 
malaysia is unique in having a monarchy that rotates among royal 
families nine of the 13 states have royal families whose leaders 
take turns being king of the entire nation for five years 
passing the throne around solved a sticky protocol problem when 
malaysia shed colonial ties with britain in 1957 none of the nine 
state rulers would have been accepted by the other eight as 
permanent king and tunku abdul rahman who was prime minister 
divised the method of sharing glory 
children of the state rulers usually are called tunku or tengku 
loosely equivalent to prince or princess tunku rahman for 
example is of royal descent 
niks and megats are those with royal blood on the mothers side 
syeds and their female counterparts sharifahs claim to be 
directly descended from the prophet mohammed from royal families 
of the malay archipelago or both 
a man honored for distinguished service to the nation becomes a 
tun and his wife a toh puan the title is malaysias highest order 
of chivalry limited to 25 living men 
when prime minister dato seri dr mahathir mohamad retires 
officials say he probably will become tun mahathir he is a 
medical doctor and was made a dato seri years ago for his 
contributions to public life 
the nonhereditary title tan seri is given to the recipient of 
either of malaysias two secondhighest orders of chivalry for 
nonroyals 
datuks and the variants datuk seri and dato are numerous and 
their wives are datins the title is nonhereditary and its basic 
meaning is grandfather 
in higher social circles practically everybody is a datuk 
whether malay chinese or indian 
a common compliment is to call a man dato before he has been so 
designated few object except the very modest 
the highlight of the kings official birthday celebrated on the 
first wednesday of june is the conferment of hundreds of awards 
and titles hundreds more are issued each year by the 13 states 
with datuk in the majority 
tuan means sir in malay and is used informally to address an 
elderly person or someone of prominence or wealth tuan yang 
terutama the malay translation of excellency is applied to heads 
of diplomatic missions and the governors of the four states without 
royal families 
puan or madame often is used to refer to married women a 
single women is called cik 
haji and hajah are the titles for men and women who have made a 
pilgrimage or haj to mecca and performed certain acts required on 
a pilgrimage 
in malay usage bin means son of and binte means daughter 
of the part of the name before it is the given name and the 
part after is the name of the persons father 
names can be as confusing as titles the prime minister is 
mahathir mohamad the information minister is mohamed rahmat and 
thousands of others spell the name mohamat muhamat muhhammad and 
even mohd 
in 1988 the goverment decreed the official version of the 
prophets name to be muhammad those already born and named with 
other spellings were excused from compliance

legal battle with the museum of modern art according to a 
published report 
but 6yearold ariana rodina calderone stahmer probably will 
never see the painting in her home because it will be sold to cover 
legal bills her family has to pay the new york times reported in 
sunday editions 
the times said the museum settled out of court on friday but 
terms of the arrangement in federal court in bridgeport conn 
were not made public the childs family spent more than 100000

argued over the painting ever since 
the museum miss steichen donated the painting to the museum the 
family said miss steichen bequeathed the painting to her 
grandniece ariana who lives in pennington nj 
its a little bit late said the girls father joel 
stahmer they felt they could wait us out in terms of money they 
were as uncharitable as a charitable organization can be

that said in part given its long relationship with edward 
steichen the museum does not wish to be in conflict with the his 
family 
steichen was in charge of the museums photography department

including the widely viewed the family of man 
arianas mother francesca calderonesteichen told the times 
she was selling the painting which she had hoped to hang in her 
daughters bedroom 
i feel very sad she said she adored my aunt and this 
would have been a way to keep that bond now the painting is never 
going to be in the house the only way shell see it is in a book 
in april when the lawsuit was filed lawyers for the estate 
contended the museum was waging a war of attrition against a modest 
estate a stategy they say would eventually backfire 
who else is going to lend works to the museum of modern art if 
theyre afraid theyll treat loans as gifts asked attorney l

police shot and killed a key member of 
the violent medellin cocaine cartel saturday in a gunbattle in one 
of medellins exclusive neighborhoods police said 
gustavo de jesus gaviria the cousin of the cartels leader 
pablo escobar was killed at 400 pm a local hospital did not 
identify his body until four hours later 
gaviria who authorities said was the third most important 
member of the drug cartel exchanged gunfire with police before 
being killed according to a police statement

gaviria is the third cartel leader killed in gunbattles with 
police during the past eight months 
he is the main partner of escobar the medellin cartel leader 
blamed for a terrorist campaign of bombs and other attacks that 
have killed hundreds of people over the past year

several business transactions and that several of escobars 
properties are registered in gavirias name 
gaviria was wanted for extradition to the united states on drug 
trafficking charges 
the medellin cartel last month called a truce in a yearlong 
terrorist campaign saying it was yielding to colombians desire 
for peace the cartel said in a communique that the government 
should respond to the peace overture by ending its policy of 
extraditing drug traffickers to the united states 
colombian president cesar gaviria said after taking office last 
week that both extraditions and the crackdown on traffickers would 
continue 
all medellin police officers were ordered to their posts late 
saturday because of fears the cartel may call off the truce 
following gavirias death 
last december police shot and killed gonzalo rodriguez gacha on 
colombias northern coast along with escobar rodriguez gacha was 
considered one of the cartels most violent leaders 
police shot and killed another major cartel figure john jairo 
arias earlier this year in medellin arias was said to have 
coordinated the cartels terrorist campaign 
the cartel began the campaign last august after the government 
announced its antidrug crackdown in response to the assassination 
of a presidential candidate 
the government has seized hundreds of properties of suspected 
traffickers and ordered the extradition of colombians wanted on 
drug charges in the united states since august the government has 
extradited 22 drug trafficking suspects

parliament for the power to declare a state of war and send armed 
forces into combat in the event of an escalation of the persian 
gulf crisis 
premier yildirim akbulut made the announcement before the start 
of an extraordinary session of parliament to discuss the crisis 
caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait and massing of troops on saudi 
arabias border 
a multinational force led by the united states is being sent to 
saudi arabia to protect that nation against a possible iraqi 
invasion and some news reports have said that iraq also is 
building up troops on turkeys border 
this is not an authorization we are going to use now 
akbulut said describing it as a precautionary measure he told 
deputies of his governing motherland party that we have no 
intention of going to war but we cannot remain indiffeent when 
there is a state of war next door to us 
there is no intention of any agression on our part this is a 
purely defensive measure he said 
president turgut ozal told reporters on saturday that the 
government could ask for war powers authorization just in case 
to be prepared for any eventuality this would make it easier to 
take fast action in case of a surprise attack he said 
under the turkish constitution approval from parliament is 
required to send turkish troops abroad in a war or to allow foreign 
combat troops to be stationed in the country

country and banned all trade except emergency food and medical 
supplies

55 million against iraqs 17 million its selfsufficiency in food 
and its developed industrial base 
also nato has assured turkey it will protect its only moslem 
member in the event of iraqi aggression

tamil guerrillas killed at least 116 
people in an assault on five moslem villages in sri lankas 
escalating ethnic war military officials said sunday 
a tamil politician said the attacks were in retaliation for the 
killing of 33 tamil civilians by moslems using governmentsupplied 
weapons the tamil guerrillas claimed the killings were carried out 
by progovernment tamil groups in an attempt to provoke sectarian 
clashes between tamils and moslems 
about 50 gunmen threw hand grenades into houses and raked the 
moslem villages with machinegun fire late saturday the officials 
said on condition of anonymity they said 116 bodies were counted 
and about 40 people were critically wounded 
the attacks were on five villages west of eravur 125 miles east 
of colombo the officials said 
mohammed saly of the moslem refugee relief organization said 
the assailants first hacked to death moslem priests in a mosque 
to prevent them from using the loudspeakers to warn of the attack 
they then attacked people in the five villages and shooting 
lasted three hours saly said 
villagers fled into the jungle to escape he said army troops 
reached the region on sunday morning from their camp at chenkaladi 
about three miles away it was not immediately clear why it took 
troops so long to reach the region 
the largest of the villages attacked was called saddam hussein 
after the iraqi leader who sent building assistance several years 
ago saly said 
the tamil politician mahalingam sivajilingam said the killings 
saturday were related to fatal attacks on tamils earlier in the day 
armed moslems raided a tamil refugee camp on saturday and 
abducted and killed 25 tamil civilians including seven women 
said sivajilingam another eight tamil patients were killed in a 
hospital he said 
this led to the tamil tigers attacking the villages and 
killing innocent moslems he said the two communities are on 
an annihilation spree nobody knows how many more will die before 
it all ends said savajilingam a leader of the tamil eelam 
liberation organization a former guerrilla group which gave up 
arms for politics 
lawrence thilakar a tiger leader said in a telephone call to 
the colombo office of the associated press that the attacks on 
moslems were carried out by progovernment tamil groups to cause 
sectarian clashes 
why should we attack moslems he asked 
we need the fullest cooperation of the moslem people who are 
also supressed at the hands of the government this dangerous game 
being played by the government will not last long very soon the 
truth will come out 
thilakar spoke from london where the tigers maintain a 
propaganda office 
on aug 3 tamil rebels raided another eastern village and gunned 
down 140 moslems inside two mosques the military said the tamil 
tigers later denied responsibility but the incident set off 
vengeance killings on both sides 
tamil insurgents seeking independence from the 
sinhalesedominated government in colombo broke a 13month 
ceasefire on june 11 though moslems are not directly involved in 
the conflict tamils suspect them of acting as informers for the 
military 
before saturdays incidents 193 moslems and about 60 tamil 
civilians had died in the latest round of fighting according to 
the military nearly 60 sinhalese civilians have also died in 
attacks attributed to the tigers 
since the fighting resumed government troops have consolidated 
their hold on east coast villages forcing the tigers into the 
jungle the tigers remain in control of the northern jaffna 
peninsula

six men and three women were 
killed in gunfire in a hostel south of johannesburg in what 
appeared to be a fight among black factions police said sunday 
police capt eugene opperman told the independent south african 
press association that attackers fired through the windows of two 
rooms in a black workers hostel in sebokeng saturday night 
four men and three women were killed two other men died later 
in a hospital fifteen people were injured in the shooting 
police discovered several sovietdesigned ak47 assault rifles 
and bullet cartriges at the scene 
opperman told independent radio 702 that the motive for the 
attack was unknown we can only presume that it is differences 
among different black groups he said 
but he disputed a claim by a township resident that the violence 
was between supporters of the african national congress and the 
conservative zulubased inkatha party 
the shooting follows violence in townships around johannesburg 
between anc supporters and other residents 
at least 22 people were killed on july 22 in sebokeng after 
armed inkatha supporters clashed with township residents who had 
been warned by anc leaders that inkatha backers were planning to 
attack them 
earlier this month in kagiso east of johannesburg at least 12 
people were killed in two days of violence between inkatha backers 
and other residents 
more than 5000 blacks have died since 1986 in fighting between 
inkatha and anc supporters in the eastern province of natal 
fears that the conflict may be spreading to other parts of the 
country were sparked in recent weeks by the fighting between 
inkatha and opposing groups in areas around johannesburg

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
sunday that the united states would intercept iraqi oil shipments 
after the exiled kuwaiti government asked world governments to 
enforce united nations sanctions against iraq 
baker declined to be specific about what the united states might 
do and said the plans would be developed over the next couple of 
days he was careful about the language he used to describe any 
possible action 
lets not use the word blockade baker said lets just 
say we have the legal basis for interdicting these things 
in diplomatic parlance a blockade is an act of war 
ill give you a word right now interdiction i would suspect 
it would begin almost instantly now that kuwait has made the 
request 
baker said the government of kuwait that fled when iraq invaded 
aug 2 had just requested of us and other nations support for 
enforcement of united nations sanctions 
we now have the legal basis to enforce the sanctions which 
call for an embargo on iraqi exports and imports baker said the 
united nations security council approved a worldwide trade embargo 
on iraq and kuwait on aug 6 
were going to take measures that are necessary and 
proportional to enforce the united nations standards now that we 
have a request baker said 
baker had been asked what the united states intends to do about 
an iraqi tanker now off the coast of saudi arabia if it moves to 
claim iraqi oil shipped by pipeline across saudi arabia 
he did not comment on the ship specifically but said that the 
united states planned to enforce the united nations sanctions 
a state department spokesman said that us officials gave no 
details about the iraqi vessel 
this was a very specific incident he baker was raising to 
illustrate that we do have support from kuwait and other countries 
to carry out the sanctions said the spokesman who asked not to 
be further identified 
we dont know the name of the ship 
baker commented on the abc television program this week with 
david brinkley

the writer a 27yearold bank employee in 
kuwait kept notes of her experiences after the iraqi invasion aug 
2 the saudi arabian woman and her family escaped from kuwait and 
she made her diary available to the associated press 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we witnessed the unthinkable the 
invasion and conquest of kuwait by fellow arab troops of iraqs 
president saddam hussein 
we first encountered their ugly tanks on the streets of kuwait 
city eight days later we managed to escape to bahrain 
here are my notes of the nightmare 
thursday aug 2 as i approached the gulf bank i saw many cars 
outside and people were inside to draw cash indians kuwaitis 
pakistanis eygptians palestinians americans and others were 
outside the building some were yelling go home go home iraq 
has invaded kuwait 
i drove home troops were streaming in and heavy vehicles 
rumbling down istiklal independence boulevard friends called and 
told my family to get ready for war how the hell do you get ready 
for war fill the bathtubs with water buy as much canned food as 
possible buy water call your kin and see if they have any plans 
to escape then wait 
we turned on the radio and took it along with mattresses down to 
the basement 
friday aug 3 whatever little sleep we could have we had it 
was at that point that we heard bombs friends invited us to spend 
the night at their house we went the streets were empty silent 
there were about five radio sets tuned to the bbc another on 
voice of america saudi arabia dubai and iraq radio it was 
horrible to hear what they iraqi radio said especially since we 
knew that they were all lies that the iraqis were in kuwait to 
save its people 
saturday aug 4 we woke up to the sound of bombs they were 
coming from an area called kifan where young kuwaitis had obtained 
rifles and were harassing the iraqis we were proud of them 
friends called and said the iraqis were looting shops and houses 
of rich people who were abroad they said the central bank was 
looted too along with car showrooms 
we heard distant shelling and were told the iraqis were trying 
to silence kuwaiti guns at shuwaikh 
sunday aug 5 the iraqis installed a new government a joke of 
a government a group of young iraqis who tried over television to 
tell us they were kuwaiti their accent betrayed their real 
nationality despite their white robes and ghutra headgear 
wednesday aug 8 we listened to the radio newscast a friend 
called to see if we wanted to leave kuwait we refused 
it was also the same evening that president bush talked i 
cried when mr bush said he wanted the american people to pray for 
the men and women who will be fighting for the principles of 
freedom and democracy 
i am arab and i felt bad thay we had to ask for foreign help to 
defend ourselves against an invasion by fellow arabs it was sad 
but i understood it was necessary 
an american friend of my fathers had a heart attack my sister 
and i went to him at hospital immediately his condition improved 
but was anxious to be with the rest of his family 
thursday aug 9 i went to hospital to visit the american and 
his wife and give them a radio set to listen to newscasts when i 
returned home a friend of ours called nasser was there to offer 
us an escape plan which we accepted 
it pained our hearts to leave kuwait i am saudi arabian but i 
have lived all my years here in this country friends told my 
father the iraqis had rounded up foreigners mainly american and 
british and taken them to baghdad as hostages 
shortly after 11 in the morning nasser came and picked us up we 
took what we can some of our gold and important papers and left 
my heart was tearing up as we drove down fahaheel road where two 
other families in their cars joined us 
we were stopped at an iraqi checkpoint nasser argued with one 
of the soldiers who let us through 
we saw iraqi soldiers near the border nasser stopped then 
turned right to the desert the soldiers waved to us to get back 
we ignored them my heart was beating so fast i could not hear 
anything we began to pray we knew the iraqis shoot first at the 
tires then come and smash the cars and take occupants out there 
were many destroyed cars along the border we didnt what iraqis 
did with the occupants no shots were fired at us but we couldnt 
get over fear 
nasser told us to start singing to overcome fear the three 
cars were running very fast it took 15 minutes through the desert 
to reach the saudi border which we crossed into the khafji region 
we drove on to nassers house there my father uncle and aunt 
were there we resumed driving this time in safer areas we 
crossed the 15mile causeway on the persian gulf and entered 
bahrain

the worlds most powerful people will give 
their attention to the weakest at the world summit for children 
next month 
heads of state of 60 countries have agreed to meet at un 
headquarters sept 2930 to discuss ways of improving the lot of 
millions of children whose lives are threatened by poverty disease 
or malnutrition 
officials of unicef the united nations childrens fund is 
organizing the summit james p grant executive director of 
unicef said he hoped it would produce global acceptance of the 
idea that children have a first call on societys resources 
he urged the national leaders to establish such goals for the 
1990s as immunizing 80 percent of all children reducing the number 
of children who die before age five by onethird to 70 deaths per 
1000 live births and providing safe drinking water for every 
child 
the leaders also will be asked to commit themselves to 
eradicating polio and reducing measles by 90 percent over the 
decade 
an international convention on childrens rights has been 
ratified and will become effective sept 3 unicef said bangladesh 
benin and sudan ratified it aug 3 bringing the total to 22 two 
more than required 
it sets minimum standards for childrens health education and 
protection from exploitation 
in addition to addressing the direct needs of children grant 
sees the summit as a forum for discussing broader problems that 
effect them such as debt relief he described efforts by 
developing countries to pay their foreign debts as an economic 
hemorrhaging 
in subsaharan africa for example the economies are in such 
bad shape in part because of the debt crisis that there are 
inadequate funds for the social sector he said in an interview 
at unicef headquarters in new york 
the summit was proposed in the 1988 unicef report on the state 
of the worlds children canada egypt mali mexico pakistan 
and sweden followed up in february with a formal call for the 
meeting 
president bush is among the national leaders who plans to 
attend he will deliver the american presidents annual annual 
address to the un general assembly the day after the summit 
children are relatively low on the priority list of most 
countries grant said 
unicef estimates 8000 children die every day from measles 
whooping cough tetanus and other diseases vaccination can prevent 
and another 7000 perish from being dehydrated by diarrhea 
as many as 4000 die each day because their mothers do not know 
how to breast feed them properly the agency says most of these 
deaths occur in undeveloped countries 
one goal of the summit grant said is to get commitments from 
governments to educate parents about the importance of 
vaccinations breast feeding and preventing 
in the 1980s many countries have demonstrated that it is 
possible to achieve many improvements in the health of children 
by marshaling government and the media to educate parents grant 
said 
he said 10000 children were saved every day because of such 
campaigns in the last decade and another 20000 can be saved each 
day in the 1990s if the world makes the commitment 
the cost of preventing most child deaths would reach 25 
billion a year by the end of the decade unicef says or 1 percent 
of the amount now spent on arms

the state health department said sunday 
it is paying several aidsinfected prostitutes not to have sex 
dr charles watson director of western australia states 
disease control division said taxpayers were subsidizing less 
than five hivpositive prostitutes by up to 80 a week as an 
incentive to keep them out of brothels and off the streets 
watson denied newspaper reports that the payments were as high 
as 240 a week 
he said the payments continued for up to four weeks until the 
male and female prostitutes were retrained for alternative work 
he said the prostitutes could earn 400 to 800 a week on the 
streets 
the money is clearly not a benefit arrangement it is to 
handle emrgency situations or set up possibilities for retraining 
into another job watson said 
he said the money was paid by the support information 
educational and referral association from aids council funding 
which comes mainly from the health department 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease caused by the 
human immunodeficiency virus or hiv the disease attacks the 
bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety 
of infections and cancers 
the virus is most often transmitted through sexual contact 
other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood 
or blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic 
needles or syringes by drug abusers

the elvis presley faithful are gathering 
again for their annual pilgrimage on the anniversary of his death 
a weeklong lineup of 13th anniversary events includes dances 
and musical shows a presley impersonator contest and a candlelight 
procession past his grave a 4yearold presley imitator is to 
perform at an elvis nostalgia concert and a fourmember band 
billed as elvis cousins planned a show called kin to the king 
presley fell dead on a bathroom floor at his graceland mansion 
aug 16 1977 
for several years afterward the anniversary gatherings were 
informal but that began to change when the ground floor of 
graceland opened for public tours in 1982 now the anniversary is 
the focal point of elvis international tribute week 
graceland the whitecolumned georgian residence presley bought 
in 1957 is expected to draw more than 30000 visitors over the 
anniversary week it attracts more than 600000 visitors a year and 
supports a tourist complex that includes museums and souvenir shops 
graceland crowds often include fans with jetblack pompadours 
long sideburns and bespangled bellbottomed trousers for 
anniversary week the elvis dressalikes are especially common 
the single largest gathering each year is a candlelight 
procession to presleys grave beside graceland the procession 
begins at 10 pm wednesday it generally takes participants four 
to five hours to file past the grave in single file 
presley fans have formed more than 280 clubs around the world 
including ones in zimbabwe and moscow said patsy andersen 
gracelands fan club coordinator many of the clubs send members to 
memphis for the anniversary week 
weve got clubs coming from hungary from germany brazil 
japan england denmark and from all over the united states ms 
andersen said 
while most of the presley fare is promoted by graceland one of 
the most popular events the impersonator contest has grown on its 
own at a memphis nightclub called bad bobs vapors 
it runs throughout the week with the winner drawing a trip for 
two to cancun mexico 
the 4yearold contest generally draws performers who base their 
acts on presleys bespangled jumpsuit period said jackie franklin 
the shows manager 
though the performers follow each other closely on stage and 
often sing the same songs particularly my way and american 
trilogy the audience is generally kind 
no one ever complains she said

people take a split second longer to lie than to 
tell the truth when asked about themselves which may help identify 
dishonesty by job applicants suggests a study presented sunday 
questions about illegal drug use and employment history showed 
the effect most clearly when study participants answered truefalse 
questions on a computer 
if further research bears out its promise the effect may be 
useful in screening applicants for jobs in law enforcement or 
private security or for security clearances said study coauthor 
michael mcdaniel 
while it could not prove deception by itself it might signal 
areas for extra scrutiny in background checks he said 
he spoke in an interview before presenting the work at the 
annual meeting of the american psychological association 
mcdaniel a psychologist who consults on human resources issues 
said he did the work independently of his employer boozallen amp 
hamilton inc of bethesda md the same is true for study coauthor 
howard timm of the defense personnel security research and 
education center in monterey calif mcdaniel said 
other psychologists cautioned that the study was limited by 
several factors but said it contributed to an area that needs 
further research 
the experiment involved 198 students in a criminal justice 
class most of whom hoped to work in law enforcement or security 
jobs they completed a 131item truefalse test which they were 
told was being evaluated as a tool for screening applicants for 
securityrelated jobs 
they were told to answer the questions as if they were taking it 
for a job they wanted later they were asked to complete it again 
but this time to answer as honestly as possible confidentiality 
was assured 
whenever a participant answered a question differently the 
second time from the first time he was assumed to have been lying 
the first time 
overall for honest answers participants took an average of 
403 seconds from the time the question appeared on the screen to 
the time they punched a key in response dishonest answers required 
an additional threefifths of a second 
lying on the 12 drug use questions such as whether one had 
gotten into a significant amount of trouble from cocaine use took 
an average of 11 seconds longer than telling the truth the 
difference for the 12 employment questions such as whether one had 
been fired for poor performance was 94 second 
smaller differences were observed for other categories of 
questions on such topics as alcohol use crime and possessing such 
unlikely virtues as never getting angry 
mcdaniel said he has not yet determined how to analyze the 
results of such a test in a jobscreening situation analysis would 
have to account for the fact that people have different average 
reaction times to questions and that some questions take longer to 
answer than others he said 
terry mitchell a psychologist who has done similar work said 
the new paper will stimulate attention to an area of research 
thats very important 
but mitchell president of mport management solutions in san 
diego calif said deception does not always take longer than 
honest responses a person who simply punches in answers wihout 
thinking about the questions or who has been coached on what 
answers to give will take less time he said 
he also cautioned that while response delays might suggest 
inaccurate answers to particular questions that is different from 
determining whether a person is basically honest 
margaret mcmanus who develops personnel selection tests at the 
life insurance marketing and research association in hartford 
conn called the work a reasonably well done interesting 
study 
but she said it included relatively few participants and that 
they were students rather than real job applicants more work is 
needed on the topic she said

the presence of us aircraft carriers 
in the middle east could help stop iraqi aggression but the 
massive floating airports could be vulnerable to chemical warfare 
officers aboard the uss nimitz say 
the nuclearpowered carrier performing flight operations off 
the california coast has cruised the middle east and the persian 
gulf area before in 1981 two of its aircraft shot down libyan 
planes over the gulf of sidra 
one sailor said he hoped the ship would go to the middle east 
i would like to see something done said chris szymanski 
20 a bedford mich native who works in the galley i would 
like to see the nimitz go but i know that some of the people would 
not like to see the nimitz go because of their girlfriends or their 
marriage 
but the nimitz which left its home port of bremerton wash 
last week had no orders to go to the middle east 
officers aboard the nimitz say their sister carriers could be a 
deterrent to iraqi leader saddam hussein and his millionman 
military 
the carrier dwight d eisenhower and its flotilla recently 
crossed the red sea into the indian ocean the carrier independence 
and its 13 escort and support ships are in the northern arabian 
sea and the saratoga and its 15ship battle group are en route to 
the mediterranean 
over the weekend the pentagon declined to comment on a number 
of reports that the aircraft carrier uss kennedy would be sent to 
the mideast from norfolk va where it is being supplied for a new 
duty cruise 
the carriers can each carry at least 5000 men and more than 70 
aircraft including a6e and fa18 attack bombers and f14a 
tomcats they also carry antisubmarine sea king helicopters and 
e2c hawkeyes whose rotating radar domes provide early warning 
capabilities the ships also have their own missile defense systems 
the carrier has a long arm to deliver weapons to hit targets 
and it can move around said cmdr bruce ross an officer in the 
nimitzs combat defense center the nerve center of a carrier 
with four catapults a carrier can launch an aircraft every 30 
seconds radar jammers would make it difficult for an enemy fleet 
to find the carriers 
i dont know how many wars and how many conflicts have been 
prevented in the past 20 years by having a carrier battle group 
present off the coast or in a position to strike potential 
adversaries said nimitz capt robert c williamson a 27year 
navy veteran 
in this particular case i dont think we desire to have a 
conflict or any expansion of the warfare that has taken place right 
now but i do know we will defend saudi arabia militarily he 
said 
iraq used chemical weapons in its war with iran and us ground 
troops are equipped for defense against them 
nimitz officials say carriers also can be susceptible to 
chemical attack 
if you want to neutralize a carrier the best thing that an 
enemy can do is to use chemical weapons said lt cmdr tom 
tanner a combat damage control assistant who helps train sailors 
on chemical warfare defense 
the ship frequently has drills during which crew members don 
cumbersome masks the sailors also are equipped with rubber boots 
and gloves and charcoallined pants and hooded tops 
by just threatening a chemical attack and having to get your 
guys onto the flight decks with their suits theyve met their 
mission tanner said it puts you in a position that cuts down 
your effectiveness 
but the nimitzs captain minimized the possibility of iraq 
harming a us navy battle group 
i dont feel very threatened by iraqis at all when were 
operating in the arabian sea williamson said 
if i were saddam id quit right now he added

trump says hes not upset at being dropped from forbes 
magazines list of the worlds richest men and blames it on a 
runin he had with the magazines late owner malcolm forbes the 
magazine which last put trumps net worth at 17 billion lowered 
that estimate to 500 million in april 
ive been expecting this attack from forbes he said 
you know why malcolm forbes got thrown out of the plaza by me 
youll read about it in my new book and i didnt throw him out 
because he didnt pay his bill 
trump also said he is more popular than ever despite the bad 
press hes been getting about his marital woes and cash problems 
and that popularity has rubbed off on the two women most often 
linked with him his estranged wife ivana and his alleged 
mistress marla maples 
ive made a lot of satellites whether its marla or 
ivana trump said marla can do any movie she wants to now 
ivana can do whatever she wants

sending us military forces to saudi arabia 
will cost an estimated 300 million to 440 million a month 
defense analysts say and like everybody else the pentagon will 
feel the bite of fuel bills driven up by the crisis in the middle 
east 
higher oil bills could add billions of dollars to pentagon 
spending other analysts say affecting not only troops deployed 
in the persian gulf but us military operations everywhere 
figuring the cost of the deploying troops to saudi arabia has 
been a slippery exercise for analysts inside and outside the 
government many were reluctant to give even a ballpark figure 
because there are so many unknown factors 
for one the number of troops being sent is still uncertain 
50000 or 250000 and no one knows how long they will stay 
besides some costs already are being paid salaries food 
supplies fuel and maintenance and any increases caused by the 
deployment are difficult to measure in advance 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said simply i have no idea 
how much its costing a day 
president bush sidestepped the issue after announcing he had 
sent americans into the persian gulf to help defend saudi arabia 
whatever it is were going to have to pay it he said 
lawrence korb a former assistant secretary of defense who is 
now a defense analyst with the brookings institute estimated the 
cost at 10 million a day or 300 million a month 
his estimate is based on the deployment of 50000 people and 
three carrier task forces it gives the costs above what the 
pentagon would spend anyway in salaries and other expenses for 
peacetime operations 
the center for defense information a group of retired military 
officials that often has criticized us military spending as 
excessive estimated that deploying 50000 troops would cost about 
440 million a month above normal military expenses 
and if the us sends as many as 250000 troops the additional 
monthly cost could rocket to 169 billion according to the 
centers study 
another analyst a house staffer who works on defense issues 
also estimated the cost in the hundreds of millions 
thats just to maintain defensive positions if shooting starts 
costs will spiral ammunition is expensive and damage to ships 
planes tanks and other equipment not to mention people is 
incalculable 
maintenance costs are likely to skyrocket too the saudi desert 
sands present hideous conditions for equipment said a senate 
budget analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the maintenance costs are going to be enormous the senate 
analyst said 
but perhaps the biggest potential cost is fuel consumers 
already are paying more at the gas pump for the pentagon every 
penny per gallon increase adds 100 million in defense spending 
korb said 
fuel costs could run in the billions said the house 
staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
house and senate budget analysts say the pentagon is working on 
cost projections for the operation but has not yet sent them to 
congress analysts say the initial costs can be handled by 
transferring money between accounts skimping in some places to 
cover the operations 
after that the pentagon may have to go back to congress and ask 
for more money 
all this is comes while the administration is fighting with 
congressional budgetmakers to limit what congress cuts from defense 
saudi arabia said it is prepared to help defray some of the 
costs of maintaining a usdominated multinational force in the 
kingdom asked if the saudis would pay for the fuel used by us 
naval and air forces saudi ambassador prince bandar bin sultan 
responded i cant imagine us disagreeing with that point 
elaborating on that a saudi source speaking on condition on 
anonymity said the saudis were willing to pick up other costs but 
were concerned that doing so would create the appearance of hiring 
mercenaries to protect their borders

a senior shiite moslem leader appealed 
sunday for iraqi president saddam hussein to release 15 shiite 
moslems imprisoned for the bombings of the us and french 
embassies in kuwait 
the release of the imprisoned men has long been a key demand by 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war a shiite group which holds 
american journalist terry a anderson and educator thomas 
sutherland as hostages 
the 15 jailed shiites reportedly have been moved to baghdad 
and they should be freed said hussein musawi he heads a 
prosyrian wing of the fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god 
irans main ally in lebanon and an umbrella for several 
hostageholding factions 
the demand of the hostageholders still stands as well as 
other demands musawi said in a telephone interview from his home 
in the eastern town of baalbek 
the united states britain and germany are all aware of the 
kidnappers demands there are interests for the moslems in 
lebanon and elsewhere in the middle east that these countries 
should take into consideration musawi said he did not elaborate 
the hostages held in lebanon are six americans four britons 
two west germans a swiss an irishman and an italian anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press has been 
held the longest he was abducted march 16 1985 
asked whether the kidnappers would harm the hostages because of 
the us military deployment in saudi arabia musawi said 
if the moslems are cornered by a new us aggression they 
will act i dont want to go into details 
seventeen shiite moslems were convicted for the dec 1983 
embassy bombings in kuwait that left five people dead and 86 
wounded 
of the 17 men convicted in the attack three were given death 
sentences seven were sentenced to life four were given 15year 
terms one was sentenced to 10 years and two were released after 
serving two years 
one of those sentenced to death is mustapha youssef badreddin a 
cousin and brotherinlaw of imad mughniyeh said to be the leader 
of islamic jihad one of the men sentenced to life is hassan 
youssef musawi hussein musawis cousin 
hussein musawi who branded iraqi president saddam hussein a 
satan not a hero was instrumental in the release of american 
hostages robert polhill and frank reed in april 
if saddam is truly antiamerican then he should set these 15 
men free at once musawi said 
there were conflicting reports about the fate of the 15 convicts 
in kuwait after iraqs invasion of the oilrich arab state on aug 
2 
one report said iraqi troops shot and killed them another said 
they were removed from kuwait to a baghdad prison 
kuwait had identified the bombers as members of the proiranian 
dawa party an iraqi group seeking to overthrow saddam 
musawi condemned the iraqi invasion of kuwait and the us 
military buildup in the area 
the moslem youths should not be deceived they should confront 
saddams aggression without cooperation with the great satan 
america which also should be confronted by suicide attacks 
musawi added 
saddam is a satan not a moslem leader the one who waged war 
against the islamic republic iran and syria and who unleashed 
chemical weapons against the kurds is not a hero but a satan

if three former northwest airlines flight 
officers are to be found guilty of flying while intoxicated jurors 
must conclude they were impaired by alcohol despite their 
apparently solid performance 
with the third week of testimony in the federal trial to start 
monday defense attorneys have demonstrated that flight 650 on 
march 8 from fargo nd to minneapolisst paul was smooth 
despite freezing drizzle 
overall i dont see any area that i can point to and say they 
fell short said robert collette an expert defense witness who 
reconstructed the flight based on taperecorded communications 
between the crew and air traffic controllers 
assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega has not uncovered 
any problems with the flight but she has hard evidence that 
alcohol was lingering in the pilots bodies from a night of heavy 
drinking which ended for the captain within about seven hours of 
the flight 
capt norman lyle prouse has admitted drinking more than 15 rum 
and colas and a waitress at the speak easy restaurant and lounge in 
moorhead has testified that first officer robert kirchner and 
flight engineer joseph balzer shared seven pitchers of beer 
kirchner and balzer left the bar about 1030 pm about an hour 
before prouse she testified 
in bloodalcohol tests performed two hours after the boeing 727 
safely landed 91 passengers at the minneapolisst paul 
international airport prouse showed a bloodalcohol content of 
013 percent more than legal limit for driving cars in minnesota 
and other states 
each pilot is charged with operating an aircraft while under the 
influence of alcohol the case marks the first time that commercial 
pilots have been tried under the 1988 federal law provision 
prohibiting operation of a common carrier while under the influence 
of alcohol 
however unlike state drunken driving laws the federal law does 
not specify an illegal bloodalcohol content 
the issue is not what his condition was the night before or 
what his alcohol content was the next day prouses lawyer peter 
wold told jurors the government must show their abilities were 
impaired based on all the evidence we will show you their 
abilities were very good 
de la vegas final witness behavioral scientist herbert 
moskowitz said tests have proven that all humans are impaired by 
alcohol when their bloodalcohol content hits a mere 001 percent 
the equivalent of half a beer he said significant impairment 
of vision information processing and shortterm memory occur in 
all people beginning at bloodalcohol levels of 002 percent and 
003 percent 
any amount of alcohol reduces or decreases your ability to 
perform moskowitz testified theres no way you can look at 
somebody and tell that their brain is operating more slowly but it 
is when you have alcohol in your system 
prouse agreed under crossexamination thursday that its 
dangerous to fly within eight hours of drinking 
but he said he did not believe he was endangering any lives when 
he ignored a caution from an faa inspector in fargo not to fly 
id think it was dangerous if i was impaired prouse said 
prouse 51 said he was accustomed to heavy drinking because he 
is an alcoholic part of his defense is that he has a high 
tolerance for alcohol that makes it harder for him to get drunk 
a bar patron reported the three crew members to the federal 
aviation administration 
they were arrested when the plane landed in the twin cities 
northwest fired them for breaking the company rule of drinking 
within 12 hours of flying and the faa has revoked their licenses 
if convicted the pilots face a maximum 15 years in prison and a 
250000 fine

the federal government has agreed to pay 120000 
to a crippled navajo woman who experienced what a judge called 
bureaucracy at its worst after being barred by a bureau of 
indian affairs high school 
the settlement approved last week by us district judge carl 
muecke calls for lorraine begay to be paid 20000 immediately and 
100000 over the next 15 years in addition it calls for 100000 
to be paid to her lawyers who have worked on the case for six 
years 
ms begay 23 suffers from progressive arthritis and has to use 
a wheelchair she had sued individual employees of the bia because 
she was barred by law from suing the federal government directly 
the bia boarding school at many farms on the navajo reservation 
never installed a wheelchair ramp or special toilet she would have 
needed to attend 
the modifications would have cost no more than a few thousand 
dollars at most according to court records and were supposed to 
have been made under a federal law mandating access for the 
handicapped school officials give conflicting reasons as to why 
the work wasnt done 
the government paid for private lawyers to represent the bia 
employees but said initially that it would not pay any judgment if 
ms begay won in court 
because none of the individual bia employees was rich that left 
ms begays lawyers looking at the possibility they could win a big 
judgment and then be unable to collect it 
muecke in pretrial hearings urged both sides to settle and 
hinted strongly that the government should pay 
at one point addressing a defense claim that only toplevel 
officials in washington were at fault and that ms begay should 
have sued them muecke replied i find that rather astonishing i 
find that bureaucracy at its worst 
ms begays struggle began about 10 years ago after juvenile 
arthritis confined her to a wheelchair she wanted to attend the 
many farms boarding school in northeastern arizona with her 
brothers and sisters 
the bia offered to send her to special schools for the 
handicapped hundreds of miles away 
ms begay refused saying she did not have the kind of mental 
handicaps that the other schools were set up to accommodate 
i am a regular child and want to be in school with all my 
brothers and sisters she wrote at one point 
ms begay who lives with her mother in a house with no 
electricity or runnign water enrolled instead in a day school 10 
miles over bumpy roads from her home she graduated from high 
school two years late largely because of absences attributed to 
her illness 
ms begays telephone rang unanswered saturday and sunday she 
said in a recent letter to one of her lawyers that she was glad not 
to have to go to court 
james loss who heads the civil division of the us attorneys 
office in phoenix referred the call to the justice department 
saying lawyers there had made the settlement frank kelly a 
justice department spokesman said sunday that his agency would 
have no immediate comment

a onemile stretch of beach was temporarily 
closed after at least 28 shells some of which may date back to 
the civil war were discovered in sand dredged from the chesapeake 
bay 
police and fire officials closed buckroe beach on saturday after 
a man looking for valuables with a handheld metal detector found 
four 11inchlong shells at least 28 shells have been found since 
wednesday when a norfolk dredging employee discovered three shells 
along the beach 
some are missing the nose part or the fuse part all of them 
still have the explosive material inside the shell fire 
battalion chief richard c blakeslee said sunday 
police officers guarded the beach area and shooed away wouldbe 
explorers until a twoman team from langley air force base arrived 
late saturday to dispose of the shells 
on sunday morning officials armed with metal detectors 
unearthed eight shells during a sweep of the beach police said 
officials reopened a major portion of the beach sunday afternoon 
much of the ammunition is world war ii vintage but officials 
said some dates back to world war i and some contained traces of a 
powder that was used in civil war artillery 
blakeslee said most of the shells were probably dredged up from 
an area that was previously used for target practice 
tech sgt sp temme of langleys explosive ordnance disposal 
unit said it was unlikely that the shells would explode unless 
they were dropped on their nose 
blakeslee said some of the shells probably could cause extensive 
of damage 
these were designed to take aircraft down he said once 
that black powder portion dries they can be capable of doing their 
job for up to 200 years 
the shells were dredged along with tons of sand from the 
chesapeake bay about two miles offshore and pumped through a 
22inch wide steel pipe onto the beach sand is being dredged from 
the bay as part of a nearly 1 million beach replenishment project 
that began aug 3 
the air force base was unable to offer its larger mine detectors 
because they were being transferred to the middle east to help the 
us defend saudi arabia from a possible attack by iraq temme said

the commander of the us 
military effort in saudi arabia said sunday that his troops would 
be on guard against terrorists as well as iraqi guns and gas 
describing the massive movement of troops and equipment overseas 
as a totally awesome undertaking that is moving ahead of 
schedule gen h norman schwarzkopf also said that the combined 
forces in place in the middle east could withstand an iraqi attack 
if one occurred now 
i would never tell you that the american forces that are there 
are 100 percent out of harms way schwarzkopf told reporters at 
a briefing at united states central command headquarters on this 
base near tampa 
but he said we have built up a great deal of force over 
there now and if they do make an attack they are going to pay a 
price for it 
although american ground forces are outnumbered at the moment 
us air and naval power could neutralize any iraqi attack 
schwarzkopf said he added in response to a question that iraqi 
leader saddam husseins call for arab world resistance to the us 
presence would force troops to be on the lookout 
there are several terrorist organizations that have found 
haven in iraq and i have every expectation that theyre going to be 
asked to do something he said were paying attention 
in october 1983 more than 200 marines and sailors who were part 
of an international peacekeeping force were killed by a terrorist 
truck bomb in beirut us service members also have been the 
victims of terrorist assaults in western europe 
schwarzkopf opened his briefing by describing the logistical 
challenge of transporting us troops and equipment to the middle 
east 7000 miles by air and 12000 miles by sea from the east 
coast 
airlifting one heavy division would take 1538 loads aboard a 
c141 transport and another 269 loads aboard a c5 transport the 
largest aircraft in the world for that reason he said a lot of 
equipment was being shipped by sea 
the magnitude of this task to quote my teenagers is 
totally awesome schwarzkopf said 
schwarzkopf said the iraqis were continuing to move 
reinforcements into kuwait those forces were taking up defensive 
positions and some were right down literally on the 
kuwaitsaudi border he said 
schwarzkopf said that the iraqi troops had taken a similar 
defensive posture before invading kuwait on aug 2 
theres no question about the fact that they have dug in right 
now for a strong defense the general said but he added they 
have the capability to do just about anything they want to 
schwarzkopf said he was confident us troops could perform well 
in the desert climate even if saddam unleashed his arsenal of 
chemical weapons 
its tough sure but its not impossible its nowhere near 
impossible 
asked whether he expected a chemical attack schwarzkopf 
saidgiven their record in the iraniraq war i would never 
discount that possibility were prepared for everything 
he said iraq has been calling up reserves but that its best 
troops were those that invaded kuwait and are still there 
schwarzkopf was in saudi arabia last week with defense secretary 
richard cheney but since then had been directing the us military 
response from the florida base with a deputy command center based 
in saudi arabia but he said the main hq would soon be set up in 
saudi arabia and that he personally was going

businessman john norman rode a taxi for 
five hours across the iraqi desert in a harrowing flight to 
freedom chainsmoking cigarettes and nibbling on hardboiled eggs 
as the cab bounced toward jordan 
at the border checkpoint norman said he feared for his life 
when iraqi soldiers began firing their automatic weapons after a 
broadcast speech by iraqi president saddam hussein 
it was an escape norman told the charlotte observer in a 
telephone interview saturday it wasnt a walk through i didnt 
know whether i was going to leave iraq alive 
norman 38 was swept up into the usiraqi military 
confrontation while working in baghdad the iraqi capital as a 
consultant to an iraqi state bank 
he returned to north carolina on friday ending an odyssey that 
in three days took him by cab private car and jumbo jet from 
baghdad to amman jordan to london to raleigh 
a resident of the raleigh area norman was on a 10month 
assignment in iraq for the accounting firm ernst amp young he was 
scheduled to leave on a monthlong vacation aug 2 the day iraq 
invaded kuwait and the baghdad airport was closed stranding norman 
and other foreigners 
norman who stayed at the sheraton hotel said he felt no 
immediate threat but over the aug 45 weekend he and his 
colleagues sensed a rapid deterioration in their situation as the 
united states turned up the heat on iraq 
last tuesday night he said the us embassy told them to leave 
iraq as soon as possible but no one was sure whether the borders 
were open 
although norman and the others had planned to make a run for it 
thursday they quickly decided to leave wednesday 
after breakfast norman hit the streets looking for taxis that 
appeared durable enough to make the 300mile trip to jordan he 
found three iraqi brothers taxi owners who agreed to take five 
americans and two britons to jordan in three cabs and a pickup 
truck at a cost of 1000 per vehicle 
they didnt know whether they could pass through the iraqi 
frontier we knew some of our compatriots had tried it norman 
said they were not back yet that was a positive indication they 
had gotten through 
the group left baghdad at 1230 pm for a hot stomachknotting 
ride norman remembered the dash through the desert as the worst 
part of the journey the anxiety of getting to the iraqi border 
what would i do next he said 
they arrived at the border checkpoint at 530 pm only to go 
through repeated searches and passport checks at one point 
boisterous iraqi soldiers unnerved the americans when they fired 
their weapons into the air at the end of a speech by hussein 
it was more like celebration stuff said colleague pat 
schenning 47 of alexandria va we were just a little scared at 
that point 
after four hours of hassles the border guards cleared the 
americans about that time employees from a us bank arrived in 
cars and took them to amman where they arrived about 330 am 15 
hours after they had left baghdad 
they closed the border shortly after we left norman said 
i think we were the last people out

about three dozen hare krishnas danced and sang 
their way through gorky park on sunday but their advice to live 
simply in a material world lost something in the translation in 
materialless moscow 
the first legal krishna celebration in the soviet capital 
followed years of official harassment or persecution of devotees 
you dont need meat to be healthy indra dyvmna swami of san 
francisco told a group of curious soviets gathered around a wooden 
cart carrying a colorful tent and a brightly painted statue of the 
krishna god jaganatha red carnations and daisies were strung 
together around the cart 
the crowd of about 100 listened closely but there likely would 
have been more enthusiasm and a longer line had the cart been 
selling meat 
and when he told them this material world has very little to 
offer they nodded in agreement knowing too well the expanses of

they also enviously eyed his nike running shoes a hot item on 
the moscow black market 
although dyvmna and other group leaders were foreigners most of 
the krishnas were soviet citizens 
the noisy procession through the park interrupted an outdoor 
puppet show when the audience became more interested in the 
krishnas the puppet apparently peeved began mimicking their

boat passengers craned to see what all the fuss was about one of

on things dyvmna swami stopped to autograph krishna books 
there were a few rough spots along the way as krishnas pulling 
parallel ropes dragged their creaking cart on a circuitous route 
through the wooded park 
several times they had to lower the tent on the cart or take a 
detour because trees and power lines kept snagging its flag dyvmna 
swami lost his translator at one point and briefly had to abandon 
proselytizing for more chanting 
later after a krishna trio belted out a rock version of a 
krishna chant he tried to resume his sermon to soviets seated on 
wooden benches in an outdoor theater but the sound system failed 
some soviets walked out when the music ended others sat 
patiently waiting for the equipment to be repaired and for the 
speeches to begin 
dyvmna swami seemed pleased with the turnout and said that 
glitches notwithstanding it was a day to remember 
this is the first year its legal he said thats quite 
historic actually considering the history of the soviet union 
religion of all types was severely restricted until recently and 
providing children with a religious education was a criminal 
offense 
an unofficial demonstration took place last year but this year 
the krishnas received permission for the public ceremony

a drug cartel leader killed by police 
was responsible for coordinating terrorist attacks in colombia and 
shipments of cocaine to the united states police said sunday 
gustavo de jesus gaviria the 41yearold cousin of the medellin 
cartels leader pablo escobar was fatally shot saturday in a 
shootout with antinarcotics police raiding his apartment in 
southern medellin according to an official police statement 
gen octavio vargas the operations chief of the national 
police said escobar delegated gaviria to manage the cartels 
terrorist bombings and assasinations and its shipments of tons of 
cocaine to the united states and europe 
the damage caused to the cartel by the elimination of gaviria 
is incalculable vargas said in a telephone interview 
vargas who planned saturdays raid said medellin residents 
angered by the cartels attacks had tipped police off to gavirias 
whereabouts two weeks ago 
in the last year the cartel carried out nearly 300 bombings that 
left 301 people dead early this year the traffickers began 
gunning down medellin police killing 178 of them before the cartel 
declared a unilateral truce last month 
the truce is apparently intended to convince president cesar 
gaviria inaugurated tuesday to abandon the governments crackdown 
on traffickers president gaviria is not related to gustavo gaviria 
vargas said police had taken special care to study the layout of 
gustavo gavirias luxury apartment equipped with bulletresistant 
windows and a closedcircuit television monitoring system 
gaviria wanted in both france and the united states on cocaine 
trafficking charges battled police with his uzi submachine gun and 
an m14 automatic rifle vargas said 
witnesses quoted by newspapers said the gunbattle between 
gaviria and police lasted about 15 minutes 
police also captured one of gavirias associates alexandra 
tapias in the raid vargas said the police statement said that 
another woman was also detained she was not identified 
vargas said gavirias sister had claimed the suspects body 
which was to be buried in a medellin cemetary 
in the last eight months authorities have killed two other 
cartel leaders in gunbattles police killed jose gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha in december and john jairo arias earlier this year 
medellin police remain on alert fearing that the killing may 
prompt the cartel to carry out retaliatory attacks the police 
statement said 
gavirias name first entered police records in 1976 when he was 
arrested along with escobar and charged with transporting 40 pounds 
of cocaine in a car tire 
a judge subsequently freed the two men without explanation four 
years later the suspects were considered two of the richest most 
powerful drug barons in the country 
in 1987 authorities accused gaviria of responsibility for the 
assassinations of two colombian intellegence police officers a 
judge found him innocent citing a lack of evidence 
last year a french court convicted gaviria of smuggling nearly 
1000 pounds of cocaine into the country and sentenced him in his 
absence to 20 years in prison 
the united states has requested gavirias extradition on charges 
of cocaine distribution and money laundering in recent years 
florida authorities have confiscated two of gavirias luxury 
apartments in dade county and miami beach according to a report in 
bogotas el espectador newspaper 
the medellin cartel and a rival group in the city of cali are 
responsible for processing and smuggling 80 percent of the cocaine 
sold in the united states us authorities have said 
police have called gaviria the third most important member of 
the medellin cartel led by escobar and another trafficking 
suspect jorge luis ochoa

saddam hussein under international quarantine for his invasion 
of kuwait said sunday that one of his conditions for resolving the 
persian gulf crisis is israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories he said many will be burned if war breaks out 
the iraqi president demanded the withdrawal of us troops from 
saudi arabia and the end to un economic sanctions against iraq 
which forced him to ask his people to be thrifty with meat and 
clothing 
at the same time the united states announced it will intercept 
iraqi oil shipments to tighten the squeeze on iraq for its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait american and arab soldiers have been massing to 
defend saudi arabia from iraqi expansionism 
a group of iraqi pilots offered to fly suicide missions against 
us ships in the persian gulf britain france and other countries 
have joined us warships in the middle east in an attempt to deter 
a possible iraqi attack on saudi arabia 
in a televised statement read by a spokesman saddam suggested 
he would tie any iraqi withdrawal from kuwait to an israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied west bank and gaza strip and a syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon israel took the territories from egypt and 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
if america and its allies will not accept this initiative we 
will resist by force saddam said they will leave this country 
with their tails behind them 
he also warned if the spark of war is started many will be 
burned 
israel dismissed saddams proposal as cheap propaganda 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states 
categorically rejects saddams proposals and said it backs the 
un security councils call for the immediate complete and 
unconditional withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
these latest conditions and threats are another attempt at 
distracting from iraqs isolation and at imposing a new status 
quo fitzwater said 
saddams proposal appeared to be aimed at broadening the debate 
over his invasion of kuwait into a discussion of a host of middle 
east problems some of which remain unresolved after decades of 
talks and war 
gen h norman schwarzkopf commander of the us central 
command told pool reporters that deployment of troops is running 
ahead of schedule and us soldiers are aware of possible terrorist 
attacks against them in the middle east 
he also said of the iraqis if they do make an attack they are 
going to pay a price for it 
a us airman died sunday in saudi arabia as the result of an 
accident becoming the first american killed in the desert 
operation the pentagon said the dead man was identified as air 
force staff sgt john campsi the pentagon said the accident is 
being investigated but had no further details 
there were signs the iraqis are girding for a long siege one 
day after warning that black marketeers in iraq would be executed 
saddam urged iraqi women to cut meat consumption in half and be 
frugal with clothing 
what is demanded is that no one stockpile food supplies 
saddam said stockpiles will bring about shortages 
a un embargo on trade has choked off incoming shipments of 
food military parts and essential goods however the embargo may 
allow humanitarian shipments of food 
iraqs oil exports have virtually trickled shut but secretary 
of state james a baker iii said the united states would honor a 
request by the kuwaiti government in exile to intercept iraqi oil 
shipments 
lets not use the word blockade baker said on abctvs 
this week with david brinkley lets just say we have the 
legal basis for interdicting these things 
us and allied warships are poised to meet iraqi tankers coming 
from the persian gulf red sea or mediterranean sea iraq is 
dependent on oil exports to buy food and supplies for its 17 
million people 
iraq is virtually encircled on the ground with the possible 
exception of jordan turkish premier yildirim akbulut said sunday 
he will ask parliament for the power to declare a state of war and 
send armed forces into combat if the crisis worsens he called it a 
precautionary move 
to the south 10000 egyptian and moroccan troops are joining 
50000 us soldiers moving into saudi arabia syria on iraqs 
northwestern border has also pledged troops 
to the east iraq is still in a state of war with iran although 
a unsponsored ceasefire has been holding since 1988 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani called the takeover of 
kuwait one of iraqs more abominable acts but he also said the 
us intervention was illegal 
the presence of foreign forces has inflamed the persian gulf 
and the region has become like a powder keg rafsanjani said 
sunday 
in the jordan city of mafraq thousands of people converged for 
an antiamerican rally organized by the jordanian committee in 
support of iraq the rallies began after saddams call for a holy 
war against saudi arabia and western countries intervening in the 
persian gulf 
police stopped about 50 proiraqi protesters marching on the 
us embassy in the capital city of amman dispersing them 
peacefully a witness said 
an estimated 10000 palestinians staged a noisy demonstration of 
support for iraq at a refugee camp in southern lebanon chanting 
death to america the demonstrators hanged effigies of 
president bush british prime minister margaret thatcher and saudi 
arabian king fahd 
a plo official said 500 refugees at another camp had volunteered 
to go to iraq to fight against an american attack 
but in bangladesh hundreds of people demonstrated outside 
iraqs embassy to secure the safety of 110000 bangladesh citizens 
trapped in the invasion demonstrators shouted iraqi troops get 
out of kuwait 
in israel stores reported panic purchases of gas masks 
following iraqi threats to attack with chemical weapons 
a british citizen was reportedly shot in kuwait near the saudi 
border and scores of foreigners were returning to their homelands 
sunday with stories of rapes and killings by iraqi soldiers 
britains foreign office said sunday it could not determine 
immediately whether the reported shooting on saturday night was 
fatal foreign office minister william waldegrave said the report 
came from unidentified people who had crossed the border recently 
penelope nabokov the 10yearold california girl who was 
detoured by the blitzkrieg on her way to visit her mother fled to 
freedom saturday and was on her way to meet her parents sunday

it is heartening to see egypt exercising leadership in the 
strategy to force iraq out of kuwait for the united states and 
europe the primary interest in political stability there is the 
flow of oil iraqs neighbors have much more at stake iraq has 
made it clear that its intentions go beyond this months conquest 
it proposes to make itself dominant among the arabs saddam hussein 
has been claiming in recent days to speak for all the arab world 
in a great test of will and of strength with the americans but 
most of the arab world denounced him on friday in the arab leagues

no one in washington it seems wants to use the h word 
hostages to describe the several thousand americans who were 
caught in kuwait and iraq at the time of the latters blitzkrieg 
conquest of the former two weeks ago with every day that passes 
without their being allowed to leave however it becomes harder to 
avoid the conclusion that they are being held against their will 
president bush should set a deadline for the unconditional 
release of the americans failure to comply will result in attacks 
on iraqi oil fields and other targets harm to any americans would 
be considered an act of allout war

an arab force on the saudi border will signal that an attack 
will embroil him hussein in an interarab war it is hoped that 
this would also undercut his attempt to portray himself as the hero 
who would save arab oil fields and muslim holy places from unclean 
western hands 
the real test of global cooperation against iraq will be if 
that blockade holds it could take months for sanctions to move 
baghdad and saddam hussein will undoubtedly counterattack he may 
use hostages or terrorism or undermine arab leaders who stand up 
to him it will take patience and test white house leadership to 
keep a global blockade going but the best inspiration to stick 
together may come from listening to the words of saddam hussein

the crisis provoked by iraqs invasion of kuwait has escalated 
into the first major confrontation of the postcold war era and new 
realities both hopeful and sobering are emerging 
foremost among the latter is the realization that a world 
liberated from the threat of nuclear annihilation will not be free 
of mortal danger as the case of saddam hussein makes all too 
clear there remain good oldfashioned nationalist dictators every 
bit as aggressive and threatening as stalinist ideologues 
but much that has transpired so far should be a source of 
hope the willingness of the vast majority of the worlds nations 
to directly and collectively engage husseins challenge is as 
foreign policy analyst stanley hoffman put it quite 
remarkable in fact if the antihussein coalition holds 
together this crisis could as former diplomat richard n gardner 
has said constitute a landmark event in the history of this 
century

most washington residents dont want mayor 
marion barry to go to jail but they dont believe either that he 
should be retried on any of 12 unresolved federal charges against 
him poll results published sunday show 
a majority of respondents to the washington post poll said also 
that they do not want barry to seek another term as mayor or to run 
for a city council post 
better than half of those asked said they believed barry should 
resign from office immediately 
a us district court jury on friday convicted barry of one 
cocaine possession charge and acquitted him on another the panel 
was unable to reach a verdict on the 12 remaining counts and us 
district judge thomas penfield jackson declared a mistrial 
the survey of 603 randomly selected residents of the nations 
capital was conducted saturday for the post by chilton research of 
radnor pa the newspaper did not indicate a margin of error but 
said that because of the practical difficulties associated with 
doing a public opinion poll in one day the survey results 
should be interpreted with caution 
sixtyfour percent of the respondents said barry should not go 
to jail while 31 percent said he should serve time the remaining 
5 percent either had no opinion or refused to respond 
seventythree percent of the respondents said barry should not 
be tried again twentythree percent favored a new court case and 4 
percent either had no opinion or refused to respond 
barry has hinted to associates recently that he would not run 
for mayor but might attempt a return to the city council where he 
served for four years before ascending to the citys top office 
it is too late for him to file as a candidate for the democratic 
nomination in the sept 11 primary although he could still run as 
an independent in the nov 6 general election 
but 63 percent of the respondents said they would not vote for 
barry thirtytwo percent said they would while 5 percent either 
had no opinion or did not respond 
fiftytwo percent said barry should resign immediately while 45 
percent wanted him to remain in office three percent either had to

for the first time since world war i american 
troops stare across a nomans land at a potential enemy who has 
used chemical weapons and may do so again 
iraq is known to have stockpiled at least two chemical weapons 
one burns the skin like liquid fire the other kills in minutes by 
disrupting nervous system functions 
and iraqs army massed along a border across from us troops 
in saudi arabia is known to have used at least one of the 
chemicals in its war with iran and against kurdish dissident groups 
in its own country 
iraqs burning chemical is thought to be the same mustard gas 
that confronted the greatgrandfathers of todays us troops in 
the trenches of world war i europe it worked so well 70 years ago 
that civilized nations banned the use of such weapons mustard gas 
still does its work with ghastly efficiency 
the other chemical agent commonly called nerve gas is a group 
of compounds added to the arsenals of war by advances in chemistry 
and in biological understanding it takes but a drop of 
concentrated nerve agent absorbed by the skin to kill 
both chemical weapons can be delivered by bomb artillery shell 
or mine when the ordnance explodes the chemicals vaporize 
spreading quickly 
mustard in a gas or droplet form is readily absorbed by 
exposed skin and is quickly taken up by inner layers of tissue 
initially there are no symptoms says lloyd roberts a 
research administrator at the armys institute of chemical defense 
there is a delayed effect 
reactions vary depending on concentrations and individuals said 
roberts but generally within one to six hours a victim will 
experience itching and reddening of the skin within 12 hours huge 
blisters appear the blisters burst and the skin is sloughed 
leaving large gaping wounds ripe for infection 
it is very much like a third degree burn said roberts and 
thats how we treat it 
dead skin must be pulled away and the wound washed with sterile 
solution healing is slow and painful infection a constant threat 
the eyes are the most vulnerable to mustard said roberts 
even a medium exposure causes pain and swelling and the white of 
the eye turns an angry red in heavy exposures there are severe 
lacerations of the cornea some soldiers in world war i were 
blinded 
but mustard does its worst damage in the respiratory system 
it tends to be lethal only when inhaled roberts said 
just as it blisters the skin inhaled mustard gas blisters the 
lungs and the airway of the respiratory tract breathing becomes 
tortured patients cough blood internal surface tissue dies and 
pneumonia becomes a fearful threat 
medical care depends on the symptoms 
a mild dose said roberts causes hoarseness and sore throat and 
no treatment is required for a cough the army uses syrups for 
laryngitis there is sterile steam and bed rest 
for severe cases patients are hospitalized for months and 
treated aggressively with antibiotics to ward off pneumonia 
mortality from mustard gas in world war i was about one 
percent said roberts now with modern care it could be even 
less 
unlike mustard that can cause large obvious wounds nerve 
agents are sly quick killers attacking the body at the molecular 
level 
readily absorbed by the skin nerve gas goes to work 
immediately it kills by disrupting a chemical reaction that occurs 
each time a muscle moves 
roberts said nerve agents bind to a protein molecule called 
acetyclcholinesterase of ache and keep it from doing its job 
ache normally destroys another protein molecule called 
acetylcholine or ach this molecule is a neurotransmitter that 
moves from nerve to muscle each time a voluntary muscle operates 
it also works in the brain to carry signals from cell to cell 
normally when the neurotransmitter has done its job it is 
immediately inactivated by ache but if the nerve gas keeps the 
ache from working then the neurotransmitter builds up and 
continues to act on the muscles and brain cells 
muscle control is lost spasms set in as muscles contract time 
after time theres weakness and collapse respiration is 
depressed heart beat slows convulsions unconsciousness the 
diaphragm muscle stops working death 
the person suffocates said roberts unprotected a person 
is dead within 10 minutes tops 
as with any chemical weapon the effects depend on the 
concentration after a weak exposure symptoms can be mild and pass 
within hours a stronger nonlethal concentration may cause 
symptoms that last a day or longer but there are seldom longterm 
effects said roberts 
with a nerve agent if you survive you can return to duty 
within a week he said it either kills you or you recover 
one way to modify or even completely block the nerve gas effect 
is with a chemical antidote 
and roberts said american troops are issued two of these one is 
atropine and the other is called pralidoxime choride the drugs are 
carried in springloaded syringes 
at the first sign of exposure a soldier can slap the syringe 
against a thigh and the drugs quickly enter the body 
both atropine and pralidoxime choride said roberts work by 
inhibiting the excess ach neurotransmitter molecule in effect the 
drugs for a brief time do the job of the acetylcholinesterase that 
was attacked by the nerve gas 
the first line of defense against a chemical attack though are 
protective garments boots rubber gloves masks and hooded helmets 
on the battlefield of chemical warfare survival means every 
inch of skin must be covered and every breath filtered even in an 
arabian desert where midday temperatures may soar to 110 degrees

saddam hussein on sunday declared 
readiness to resolve the persian gulf crisis if israel withdraws 
from occupied arab territories syria pulls out of lebanon and us 
forces leave saudi arabia 
the iraqi president also demanded an end to international 
economic action against his nation 
in a statement read by an announcer on baghdad radio and 
television saddam said foreign powers intervening in the region 
were setting off the spark of war which would burn many 
the statement was translated by the associated press 
if the international community wanted foreign forces kept in the 
region he said they should be replaced by arab troops with the 
un security council making all the arrangements on which 
nationalities should be involved 
saddam said if the united states and its allies did not not 
accept his initiative iraq would resist its evil intentions and 
aggressive schemes 
we will be victorious with gods help he said the 
evildoers will regret their acts when they are driven out in shame 
from the region 
he said any arab force should not include egypt which he said 
was being used by the united states as a launching pad for 
conspiracies against the arabs 
egypt and morocco were the first arab countries to send troops 
to saudi arabia to face iraqi forces massed along that countrys 
border with kuwait 
the arab deployment came after the united states and other 
nations sent ships planes and thousands of troops to the region to 
defend strategic oilrich saudi arabia 
in his statement saddam called for all cases of occupation 
and those cases that have been portrayed as occupation to be be 
resolved simultaneously under the same principles and 
guidelines 
he linked any withdrawal from kuwait to an israeli withdrawal 
from the occupied west bank and gaza strip a syrian pullout from 
lebanon and the resolution of iraniraq land disputes stemming 
from their 198088 war 
all of those conflicts have remained intractable in the face of 
negotiations sometimes over a period of years or outright warfare 
by bringing them up now saddam could be seeking to buy time 
broaden the argument over his conquest of kuwait and attract arab 
support by calling for the surrender of the israelioccupied lands 
israel dismissed saddams call as cheap propaganda there 
was no immediate reaction from syria which was unlikely for 
strategic reasons to comply with the demand that it leave lebanon 
some arabs have criticized the united states and others for 
sending troops in response to the takeover of kuwait but not taking 
similar action to end israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip which it captured in the 1967 middle east war 
in his statement saddam demanded an end to international 
economic sanctions calling on all nations to freeze immediately 
all boycott and siege decisions against iraq 
but even as the iraqi leader made the demand the united states 
was pledging to tighten the economic noose 
secretary of state james a baker iii said sunday on abc that 
the united states would intercept iraqi oil shipments he said the 
move was in response to the exiled kuwaiti governments call for 
world governments to enforce united nations sanctions against iraq 
the un security council approved a worldwide trade embargo on 
iraq and kuwait on aug 6 
the iraqi president reiterated baghdads longstanding claims on 
kuwait which it annexed aug 8 
when kuwait a former british colony became independent nearly 
three decades ago iraq refused then to recognize its sovreignty 
iraq has never recognized the crime committed by the 
colonialists saddam said 
earlier sunday in a statement also read on baghdad radio and 
television saddam urged the iraqi people to prepare for hardships 
that may result from the international economic sanctions 
also sunday the iraqi news agency said a group of pilots has 
offered to fly suicide missions against us ships sent to the gulf 
as part of the multinational force being deployed to defend saudi 
arabia

by flying their mig warplanes to a base in northern saudi arabia 
diplomatic sources in the middle east said sunday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
sovietbuilt warplanes landed saturday at the hafr albaten base 
the main center for the foreign troop buildup in saudi arabia 
the us state department said it had not heard the report the 
kuwaiti embassy in washington said it had heard the report but 
could not confirm it 
us and other foreign countries are sending forces to saudi 
arabia to defend against any attack by iraq which invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 
the diplomatic sources said the planes were migs but they did 
not know the precise type the pilots were not identified and 
there were no other immediate details 
iraq has at least 70 mig23 ground attack fighters as well as 
70 mig21 and 18 mig29 fighters it also has eight mig25 
reconnaissance planes and a variety of mig training planes

slogans and banging their fists on parked cars 
scores of policemen stopped the protesters at a traffic circle 
about 100 yards from the embassy and they dispersed without 
incident said the witness who spoke on condition of anonymity 
minor demonstrations have been staged for most of the week in 
jordan giving vent to a growing wave of antiamericanism following

mayor marion barry is receiving conflicting 
advice on whether he should run for city council but is planning 
nonetheless to drop his democratic party affiliation as a first 
step aides said sunday 
barry convicted friday of one cocaine possession charge and 
acquitted of another plans to drop out of the democratic party and 
register as an independent on monday said top barry aides who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity 
that would be barrys first step toward reviving his political 
career with a campaign for an atlarge seat on the district of 
columbias 13member council the aides said 
monday is the deadline for switching parties if barry becomes 
an independent he would then have to gather the signatures of 
2000 registered city voters before his name could be placed on the 
ballot he would compete for two citywide council seats with 
winners of the republican democrat and statehood party primaries 
winning a council seat would allow barry to maximize his future 
city pension earnings and let him stay active in local politics 
which he has dominated since he was first elected mayor in 1978 he 
had been elected to the city council in 1974 
his life is politics and he doesnt know anything else one 
barry adviser said if he stays clean he can contribute a lot 
thats what he wants to do 
barry announced in june that he would not seek a fourth term as 
mayor he has 16 years of city government service and would be 
eligible for a full pension after 20 years 
but barrys supporters are deeply divided over whether the mayor 
should remain in politics other sources said 
while some believe barry has been exonerated and should resume 
his political career others are wary of antagonizing us district 
judge thomas penfield jackson or prosecutors 
there are some including his top government aides who 
believe he should do nothing to irritate either jackson or us 
attorney jay b stephens said one associate the feeling is 
dont do anything to draw attention to yourself 
jackson has not yet set a sentencing date for barrys 
misdemeanor cocaine possession conviction which carries a maximum 
penalty of one year in prison and a 100000 fine in addition 
stephens has not yet revealed whether he intends to retry barry on 
a dozen charges against the mayor on which the jury couldnt reach 
a verdict 
some of barrys advisers believe the government would be more 
likely to pursue the case and jackson would be more inclined to 
send the mayor to jail if barry is actively campaigning for 
office 
stephens has said only that the trial evidence will be reviewed 
before he decides whether to pursue the matter but politics have 
been intertwined with the case since barrys jan 18 arrest in an 
fbi sting operation during plea bargain negotiations the mayor 
has said stephens insisted that barry would have to resign his 
office as part of any agreement with the government 
law enforcement sources have corroborated barrys account of the 
negotiations 
and there are other more tangible indications that a barry 
candidacy might not be in the mayors best interests 
a washington post poll published sunday shows that while a 
majority of those interviewed believe the government should abandon 
is prosecution of the mayor a greater percentage believe barry 
himself should scuttle any plans to run for office this year 
in addition other sources said that barrys wife effi is deeply 
opposed to the mayor running for office 
she has been referring to politics as a thing of the past 
said one barry associate she has said in so many words that 
she is not interested in another campaign 
in the end he will do what he wants to do just like he 
always has said one longtime barry associate making the party 
switch will allow him to keep his options open to test the water a 
little while longer

israel on sunday rejected as cheap 
propaganda iraqi president saddam husseins proposal linking a 
possible iraqi withdrawal from kuwait to an israeli pullout from 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
but palestinian leaders on sunday welcomed saddams proposal 
saying it would boost their demands for a homeland 
if the americans will take the initiative seriously then we 
can get something good from a bad situation said faisal 
husseini the leading proplo activist in the occupied territories 
also sunday the israeli military refused comment on foreign 
reports that israel placed its air force on alert and moved 
antiaircraft missiles to the jordanian border following threats 
from iraq to use chemical weapons 
israeli stores meanwhile reported a huge increase in the 
purchases of gas masks 
the iraqi proposal was saddams third attempt in five days to 
involve israel in the persian gulf crisis to try to win grassroots 
support in arab countries 
in his statement 11 days after his conquest of kuwait saddam 
suggested he would tie any iraqi withdrawal from kuwait to an 
israeli withdrawal from the occupied west bank and gaza strip and a 
syrian withdrawal from lebanon syria maintains 40000 troops in 
lebanon 
i suggest that all cases of occupation or cases that are 
described as occupation be resolved at the same time saddam 
said in a statement read on baghdad television by an announcer 
saddam hussein is trying through all kinds of exercises to do 
away with the international force which is confronting him and to 
evade the economic sanctions which are being enforced against 
him prime minister yitzhak shamirs adviser avi pazner said in a 
statement his socalled initiative is nothing but cheap 
propaganda 
saddams idea was a propaganda ploy to divert world opinion 
from the main issue a large country devouring a small neighbor in 
naked unprovoked aggression said foreign ministry spokesman 
yosef amihud 
defense minister moshe arens speaking to foreign reporters in 
tel aviv before saddams demands were made public said there is 
no correlation at all between whatever success or lack of success 
we may have in dealing with the palestinian problem and saddam 
hussein 
the cabinet met sunday followed british reports that israel has 
placed its air force on alert and a report by the nbc network that 
americanmade hawk antiaircraft missiles have been moved to the 
jordanian border the military refused to comment on the reports 
the missile deployment could be linked to media reports quoting 
defense ministry aide dan naveh as saying iraq had no missiles 
armed with chemical warheads and other informed sources as saying 
that only the iraqi air force could strike israel 
in israel anxiety mounted 
in ultraorthodox neighborhoods wall posters spoke of a state 
of war with iraq and called on all the boys and girls youths 
and yeshiva students to cancel all vacations and return to 
classes to study torah and pray 
stores reported a record increase in the purchases of gas masks 
and other protective gear 
we have sold hundreds of gas masks since the gulf crisis a 
week ago we would only sell a few per week said ilan shalev 
sales manager at tel avivs gazit safety equipment store 
an army spokesman said there was no need to begin a mass 
distribution of gas masks 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said there 
were enough masks for all citizens of israel including israeli 
arabs as well as tourists 
there are about 810000 israeli arabs 
a former civil guard commander aryeh biro said there were no 
masks for the 17 million palestinians living in the occupied west 
bank and the gaza strip 
for residents of the territories unlike the israeli arabs we 
think we have no masks for them biro said on israel army radio 
we dont need to give them masks because we dont expect danger 
in these areas

call from a man claiming to be from the local social security 
administration office in texas the caller who golden believes was 
the cowboy wanted to confirm stanleys social security number 
mrs stanley said the caller was so sorry for my loss and he 
said that i would get a packet of information from social security 
i never got one 
a duplicate social security card was issued april 11 in the 
grand prairie texas social security office golden said the card 
was issued even though government computers showed stanley was dead 
and benefits were being paid to his family 
my husband was really an honest person and it breaks my heart 
to see his name drug through the mud mrs stanley said

green berets stationed in southeast asia 
illegally stockpiled millions of dollars worth of us ammunition 
and explosives and some of it may have ended up on thailands 
black market a newspaper reported sunday 
the san francisco examiner also said former army special forces 
officers tried to cover up the misuse of us military hardware 
the stockpiling of tons of bullets grenades mines and plastic 
explosives occurred as late as last year the newspaper said 
citing military documents and interviews with investigators and 
former members of the elite units 
us army special operations lost control of millions of 
dollars of american arms and ammunition over five years said 
mike bracy a former sergeant with the okinawabased 1st battalion 
1st special forces 
in two months alone 1 million dollars worth of ordnance 
dropped off the books he said 
bracy and another former battalion sergeant bob finley claim 
they were subjected to harassment psychiatric observation and 
death threats when they tried to alert superiors to the problems 
the examiner said 
finley retired bracy was honorably discharged last year after 
the office of us rep barbara boxer dcalif intervened 
boxer said the pentagon inspector generals office told her two 
weeks ago its investigation confirmed that munitions intended for 
training use were winding up on the black market and that the 
special forces were involved 
the special forces known as the green berets are experts in 
unconventional warfare and considered key to extending american 
military power into foreign trouble spots special forces units in 
southeast asia are involved in training soldiers from thailand the 
philippines singapore korea and malaysia 
the army has denied any wrongdoing by the special forces 
but an army investigation cited by the examiner said the 1st 
battalion 1st special forces specifically its 80man bravo 
company operating in thailand was torn by divisions rumors and 
criminal activity 
battalion members are doing business on bangkoks black market 
and there are lax controls on the main green beret stockpile the 
newspaper said quoting unidentified military and civilian sources 
finley and other bravo company members said munitions were given 
to thai units contrary to strict requirements that only the green 
berets themselves use them 
lt col robert suchke commander of the 1st battalion in 1988 
and 1989 said during an interrogation that he didnt know what his 
soldiers stored in thailand the examiner said he also said he 
didnt know who controlled the stockpile or who had the key to the 
biggest cache a bunker filled with munitions on a royal thai army 
base according to the paper 
bracy originally assigned to an internal military investigation 
of the matter claimed highlevel officers in southeast asia either 
were involved in illicit activities or turned a blind eye 
finley and bracy who collated all the munitions requisition 
forms inventory lists and other documents said they took their 
evidence and complaints to us military authorities in japan 
bracy said he was ordered last august to immediately halt any 
criminal investigation and turn over information to higherups 
finley said he was ordered to burn records of bravo company sgt 
maj edward gleason who started the stockpile in 1984 
gleason denied any involvement in criminal activity and claimed 
that the stockpile while against the rules was a convenience that 
avoided the trouble of turning in the ammunition 
gleasons courtmartial conviction for threatening to kill a 
superior officer were what initially drew attention to the 
battalions activities the examiner said the newspaper did not 
say whether the gleason case was related to the stockpiling claims

animal rights activists say they will appeal a 
verdict that awarded 42 million to a las vegas showman secretly 
filmed striking the pet orangutans used in his act 
we are appalled said ingrid newkirk national director of 
the washington dcbased people for the ethical treatment of 
animals i believe this ruling will be overturned 
entertainer bobby berosini said he planned a nationwide 
talkshow tour to expose the animal rights activists for what 
they are selfserving 
but an attorney for the animal rights group promised to appeal 
the award handed down late saturday afternoon by a state jury after 
four days of deliberations

counts of invasion of privacy and defamation jeanne roush an 
investigator for the group and former stardust employee ottavio 
gesmundo each was assessed 1 million in damages 
the jury found the defendants innocent of actual malice and 
declined to award punitive damages 
gesmundo videotaped scenes of berosini striking his orangutans 
before they went on stage for performances at the stardust hotel in 
july 1989 
the videotapes were circulated to animal rights groups including 
the performing animal welfare society of galt calif 
representatives of those two groups took the tapes to local and 
national media including entertainment tonight 
the performing animal welfare group and its president pat 
derby also were each assessed 100000 in damages for defamation 
and invasion of privacy 
berosini said he had to beat the primates with a stick because 
they were spooked by dancers in his performance show he claimed 
the adverse publicity from the animal rights groups damaged his 
career 
animal rights activists had descended on las vegas picketing in 
front of the stardust and encouraging the public to pass up the 
show 
i was used as a pawn to make money berosini said of attacks 
by the animal rights groups they were using this as a means of 
fund raising

east germanys prime minister preparing to 
mark the 29th anniversary the berlin walls construction said 
sunday it has created german divisions that even unification will 
not easily bridge 
prime minister lothar de maiziere made his remarks in a 
statement released by the official adn news agency on the eve of 
the annniversary of the wall once a notorious cold war symbol but 
now a crumbling relic in an era of reduced eastwest tensions 
de maiziere said the joy over the fall of the wall should not 
allow forgetting the lasting consequences of the division of 
germany 
the wall strengthened the distinct developments in both german 
states de maiziere said state unity of germany will not 
immediately lift differences in peoples thinking and acting 
de maiziere warned his countrymen that the rapid disappearance 
of the wall should not lead to expectations that an economic 
upswing could occur just as quickly 
on aug 13 1961 east german military and paramilitary units 
suddenly began laying the foundations for what was to become the 
berlin wall a barrier of concrete steel and barbed wire dividing 
east and west berlin 
communist authorities said the wall was necessary to preserve 
east germany from western subversion and prevent a mass exodus of 
skilled and professional workers to the west 
more than 25 million east germans had fled to the west from 
1949 until the wall went up the barrier watched over by armed 
guards with shoot to kill orders reduced that flow to a 
trickle more than 200 east germans were killed trying to escape to 
the west across the barrier that snaked through berlin and along 
the border with west germany 
on nov 9 1989 the reform communists who ousted hardliner 
erich honecker opened the wall in a lastditch effort to retain 
power they had hoped to stem a flood of east germans to west 
germany that had reached more than 200000 
by the end of this year east and west germany plan to merge to 
form one country 
east germans enjoyed the most prosperous economy in the soviet 
bloc but now face a major challenge in trying to catch up with the 
west german economic powerhouse the east german economy is reeling 
with growing unemployment and factory closings as it plunges 
into capitalism after 40 years of communism 
richard schroeder the social democratic caucus leader in the 
east german parliament said the wall concealed and postponed the 
economic ruin of east germany in a statement released by adn 
he said the enthusiasm that greeted the opening of the wall in 
november has disappeared because east germany has plunged into a 
deep crisis following its july 1 economic union with west 
germany 
the east german press once forced to praise the countrys 
communist leaders for erecting the wall joined the new 
democratically elected leaders in criticizing the former barrier 
the berliner zeitung said the wall in the long run failed to 
bring about the economic improvement the former communist leaders 
had promised after building it 
numerous ceremonies were planned for monday in both east and 
west berlin along the 100mile strip where the wall once divided 
the former german capital 
most of the wall has been removed from the central part of the 
city and the outer ring on the edge of the city is expected to be 
gone by 1991 
on monday night the rolling stones will perform at an outdoor 
stadium in east berlin the japanese symphony orchestra saito 
kinen conducted by seiji ozawa will also give what is being 
billed as the berlin wall memorial concert

the san francisco examiner in one of the 
first prolegalization editorials by a bigcity newspaper said 
sunday that the sale and use of drugs should be made legal in the 
united states 
an editorial called the federal war against drugs a colossal 
waste of effort money and human resources 
all antidrug laws should be repealed it said the war on 
drugs should be called off just declare victory play 76 
trombones and march out it always gets applause 
the federal government last week finished a muchpublicized 
sweep against marijuana plantations in humboldt county about 200 
miles north of san francisco the first time army troops were used 
against drugs in the united states 
the operation was termed a success by federal officials the 
examiner noted although the 1400 marijuana plants destroyed was 
not enough to put a dent in the supply of marijuana 
any way you slice it there is no denying that this 
politiciandeclared war has been just about effective as the war on 
poverty the war on crime and the war on cancer put together which 
is to say a complete defeat the editorial said 
the time has come to legalize the sale and use of drugs treat 
them all like alcohol which is legal though its sale is subject to 
controls

prevention of forest fires died of liver cancer in his pen at the 
national zoo veterinarians determined sunday 
the 20yearold black bear called smokey ii also known as 
little smokey began shaking late saturday and could not keep his 
balance prompting his keeper to summon veterinarians said zoo 
spokesman robert hoage 
doctors injected steroids via a blowgun late saturday but hoage 
said they had no effect on the bears condition because he was 
wild keepers and veterinarians could not get close enough to 
examine him

at the zoo sunday revealing advanced liver cancer the spokesman

a barge being loaded with heavy fuel oil at an 
arco petrochemical dock buckled sunday spewing at least 20000 
gallons of oil into the houston ship channel coast guard officials 
said 
its unusual in the way that it happened said coast guard 
senior chief dale eichmann it was just sitting there at the dock 
and apparently it just started buckling in half the metal deck 
folded down on top of it and cracked it down the middle 
no 6 fuel oil spilled from two center tanks as a crease cut 
across the barge at the dock in southeast houston 
cleanup crews from arco and lyondell petrochemical co were able 
to string containment booms around the area after the 10 am 
accident eichmann said and a cleanup company later joined the 
effort lyondell is a former division of atlantic richfield co 
we got a primary boom out there pretty quick eichmann said 
then we set up two containment booms stretched across the turning 
basin and stuck some absorbent pads in the cracks of the barge 
and that shut down the discharge pretty well 
the barge had been loaded with 630000 gallons of oil eichmann 
said it had a capacity of 840000 gallons 
david harpole of the lyondell salvage crew said another barge 
was located adjacent to the ruptured one helping to cut down the 
spread of the oil a third barge was brought to the area to 
transfer remaining oil from the ruptured vessel he said 
the houston ship channel remains open but coast guard officials 
warned ships in the area to slow down 
the coast guard on friday completed a twoweek cleanup of a 
700000gallon oil spill that occurred july 28 when a greek tanker 
collided with two barges under tow in the houston ship channel 
earlier this year the norweigan tanker mega borg spilled 39 
million gallons of angolan crude into the gulf of mexico off 
galveston when an explosion ripped through the vessel killing four 
crewmembers and injuring 17 others

a government plan to set aside more 
government jobs for low caste indians has sparked protests against 
reverse discrimination by other students 
sunday newspapers reported that police arrested scores of 
students and took up protective positions at key government 
buildings after four days of protests in the eastern state of bihar 
students sabotaged train engines burned wagons and disrupted 
rail traffic in bihar the nations poorest state the newspapers 
said they also stoned cars set fire to empty buses and a post 
office and torched several government cars 
in the capital delhi university was virtually emptied by a 
student boycott on friday police used tear gas and bamboo clubs 
to break up a student demonstration near the government and 
parliament complex 
the trouble began when prime minister vp singh announced in 
parliament on thursday that a further 27 percent of federal jobs 
would be reserved for people from socially and educationally 
backward classes 
that would be in addition to an existing quota of 22 percent for 
low caste hindus and tribes in public service and higher education 
jobs according to a list drawn up after india became independent 
in 1947 and included in the constitution the quota has never been 
filled completely 
if the governments plan is carried out 49 percent of 
government jobs will be set aside for low castes and 51 percent 
will be awarded purely on merit 
singh said he was endorsing a 10yearold report by an official 
commission which recommended expanding the quota for government 
jobs for people from disadvantaged classes defined by their 
income social position and education 
according to the sunday observer newspaper the disadvantaged 
castes identified by the commission comprise 437 percent of the 
population or about 385 million people 
in indias highly structured society hundreds of castes and 
subcastes have been delineated in a strict hierarchy by thousands 
of years of hindu tradition 
modern india an avowedly secular nation whose population is 82 
percent hindu is pledged to discard the caste system and build an 
egalitarian state 
but the caste system persists particularly in rural areas 
dictating rules of behavior occupation and association 
singh said implementing the commissions report was a 
momentous decision for social justice his announcement was 
greeted by congratulatory thumping on tables from all sides of the 
legislature 
critics in the indian press accused singh of engaging in a 
grandstand populist ploy aimed at boosting support for his party 
singhs 8monthold coalition government has been wracked by 
infighting leading some analysts to predict elections as early as 
next year

the united states citing the legal authority 
of united nations sanctions will stop oil shipments from leaving 
iraq and block food and other supplies from entering the country 
the government said sunday 
asked during a golf outing in maine whether the embargo would 
include food president bush replied just watch everything 
questioned later on whether a blockade would be considered an 
act of war the president said i consider interdiction of 
shipping to be in accord with the chapter vii action taken by the 
united nations no point getting into all these semantics 
the main thing said bush is to stop the oil from coming 
out of there and that is what were going to do 
earlier sunday both secretary of state james a baker iii and 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had underscored the extent 
of the us determination to squeeze iraq economically 
the united states will do whatever is necessary to enforce 
the sanctions fitzwater said in a written statement issued on 
behalf of the president 
although neither fitzwater nor baker would be specific about any 
us action the secretary of state said the us response would 
begin almost immediately 
kuwaits governmentinexile asked the world community to 
enforce the un sanctions and baker said that gave the united 
states legal authority to halt any iraqi oil exports 
baker was asked by reporters later whether the united states was 
considering blocking shipments of goods other than oil to iraq 
the request thats been received from the legitimate 
government of kuwait is that we we and the other countries 
countries that support the un resolution do what we can to 
implement these un sanctions said baker now those sanctions 
go beyond just oil 
on the cbs television show face the nation national 
security adviser gen brent scowcroft was asked about the prospect 
of sanctions eventually resulting in starving people in kuwait 
well well deal with that when we get to that point said 
scowcroft 
the president has decided that the united states will do 
whatever is necessary to see that relevant un sanctions are 
enforced fitzwater said from kennebunkport me where bush is 
vacationing the united states will coordinate its efforts with 
the governments of other nations to whom the kuwaiti government has 
made similar requests 
baker characterized the contemplated action as an 
interdiction rather than a blockade which in diplomatic 
parlance could be considered an act of war 
baker who spoke on the abc television program this week with 
david brinkley said iraq now has a significant presence in 
southern kuwait consisting of about 120000 troops in nine 
divisions 
theres not much to prevent him if he should decide to do so 
from launching offensive operations from there baker said 
but the commander of the us military effort in saudi arabia 
said sunday that us forces could repel an attack even though 
they are currently outnumbered on the ground american air and 
naval power could neutralize any iraqi attack he said 
we have built up a great deal of force over there now and 
if they do make an attack they are going to pay a price for it 
gen h norman schwarzkopf said at united states central command 
headquarters in florida before leaving for saudi arabia 
the united states france and britain have sent ships to the 
persian gulf region in an effort to force iraq out of kuwait and to 
defend strategic oilrich saudi arabia from possible iraqi attack 
the united states also has committed an estimated 50000 ground 
troops to the operation 
egypt and morocco also have sent troops to saudi arabia to 
counter iraqi forces massed along the border in kuwait 
baker would not comment specifically about what the united 
states intends to do if an iraqi tanker now off the coast of saudi 
arabia moves to claim iraqi oil shipped by pipeline across saudi 
arabia 
in baghdad iraqi president saddam hussein warned that many 
will be burned if war breaks out in the middle east he linked 
any possible iraqi withdrawal from kuwait to an israeli surrender 
of the arabclaimed territories it occupies 
hussein also demanded the withdrawal of us and other forces 
from saudi arabia and an end to international economic sanctions 
against his nation 
saddam said that if the international community wants foreign 
forces kept in the region they should be replaced by arab forces 
with the un security council making all the arrangements on 
which nationalities should be involved 
in maine bush said i didnt see anything pleasing in 
there saddams statement at all none nothing 
asked whether he would welcome irans participation in the 
effort against iraq bush said anybody to help enforce those 
sanctions thats who we want 
fitzwater said the united states categorically rejects 
saddams demands and repeated us and un calls for the immediate 
withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
scowcroft said the united states does not intend to overthrow 
saddam but rather to try to affect his behavior 
he declined to comment on reported us covert action against 
saddams government 
on another subject baker said he hopes world pressure on 
baghdad will soon force iraq to release some 3500 americans 
detained in kuwait and iraq americans 
we hope they will be allowed to come out soon he said 
the truth of the matter is that iraq has restricted the right 
of all foreign nationals to leave this runs against all 
international behavior norms 
abdul amir alanbari the iraqi ambassador to the united 
nations characterized the resolution adopted by last weeks arab 
summit in cairo to condemn iraq as having doubtful validity he 
predicted that any arab force sent to protect saudi arabia will be 
nominal 
and president turgut ozal of turkey said he is confident his 
nation will enjoy the support of the nato alliance if a shooting 
war breaks out with its neighbor iraq 
we have a strong army we can defend ourselves he said 
both the iraqi president and the turkish president commented 
while appearing on abc televisions brinkley program 
meanwhile the pentagon released details of the first american 
killed in the desert kingdom since bush ordered the us military 
deployment last week 
the pentagon identified the dead man as air force staff sgt 
john campisi the 30yearold aircraft maintenance technician was 
from covina calif and was assigned to offutt air force base in 
nebraska 
pentagon sources who spoke on condition of not being identified 
by name said a preliminary investigation indicated campisi was hit 
by a truck on a darkened runway the sources said campisi may have 
been wearing protective ear covering inhibiting his ability to 
hear the oncoming truck further details were not available

president bush on sunday firmly 
rejected conditions set by saddam hussein for ending the persian 
gulf crisis and put aside differences with syria long enough to 
cement an alliance against baghdad 
the white house reacted swiftly to saddams demand that israel 
surrender the occupied territories as a partial price for the 
withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait saddam also demanded an end 
to un economic sanctions against iraq and the pullout of us 
troops in saudi arabia 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater referring to 
saddams conditions said the united states categorically 
rejects them 
he said these latest conditions and threats are another 
attempt at distracting from iraqs isolation and at imposing a new 
status quo 
bush said he was determined that global economic sanctions 
against iraq will choke off its oil exports the white house cited 
a letter from the emir of kuwait as the legal basis for us 
efforts to insure that sanctions are immediately and effectively 
implemented 
while avoiding use of the word blockade bush said the 
unapproved embargo gave us broad authority working in 
conjunction with others to do whatever is necessary to see no oil 
goes out 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said the 
united states would intercept iraqi oil shipments lets not use 
the word blockade baker said adding that he preferred the word 
interdiction 
bush during a golf outing was asked by reporters whether the 
embargo would include food he replied just watch everything 
asked if he was pleased that saddam was talking about a 
negotiated settlement even if the terms were unacceptable bush 
said crisply i didnt see anything to be pleasing in there at 
all none nothing 
later in the afternoon bush was asked whether he regarded a 
blockade as an act of war 
i consider interdiction of shipping to be in accord with the 
chapter vii action taken by the united nations he said no 
point getting into all these semantics the main thing is to stop 
the oil from coming out of there and that is what were going to 
do 
asked whether he would welcome irans participation anybody 
to help enforce those sanctions thats who we want 
at his oceanside home the vacationing bush pressed ahead with 
his telephone diplomacy to isolate saddam whose troops invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 and now threaten the oil fields of saudi arabia 
bush an early riser called syrian president hafez assad at 6 
am later the president told reporters im very pleased that 
were looking at this in the same way 
likewise he said assad declared that he was pleased to be 
together on this since arriving here friday bush also has 
called egyptian president hosni mubarak king fahd of saudi arabia 
and the emirs of bahrain and qatar 
the united states says syria continues to support terrorism and 
the two differ sharply over israel but in this instance find 
themselves solidly united against iraq sensing an opportunity to 
topple its longtime foe syria went along with the arab league vote 
to send troops to the persian gulf as part of an arab force against 
saddam 
bush has committed an estimated 50000 troops to saudi arabia to 
face iraqi forces massed along that countrys border with kuwait 
fitzwater in a written statement said we join the rest of 
the un security council in unanimously calling for the immediate 
complete and unconditional withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait 
and the restoration of kuwaits legitimate government 
he said that bush had received a letter from sheikh jaber 
alahmad alsabah the emir of kuwait who fled his country as it was 
invaded asking the united states to enforce sanctions against iraq 
and kuwait 
in view of the emirs request fitzwater said the 
president has decided that the united states will do whatever is 
necessary to see that relevant un sanctions are enforced 
he said the united states would coordinate its efforts with 
other nations that have received similar requests from the emir 
while tracking developments in the tense persian gulf bush 
found time to go boating in foggy atlantic waters and to go jogging 
back and forth for 20 minutes on an undeveloped road off ocean 
avenue 
after two days of solid rain the weather was mostly sunny and 
warm bush planned an afternoon golf match 
accompanied by his wife barbara and nine grandchildren as

finance minister theo waigel said 
sunday that a united germany cannot afford to move its seat of 
government from bonn to berlin 
i need at the moment every mark for the people for 
investments and not for showcase building waigel said on the 
west german television program bonn direct 
he also estimated that a supplementary budget to keep east 
germany afloat the rest of this year would probably need to be 
something over 10 billion marks about 6 billion 
west germany has already budgeted nearly 16 billion for this 
year to cover east germanys budget deficit 
east germanys economic situation grows more dire with each day 
as it struggles to shift from 40 years of communism to a capitalist 
economy the two germanys merged their economies and the powerful 
west german mark became the official currency of both states on 
july 1 
more than 270000 east germans are out of work as businesses and 
factories fall to the rigors of capitalism and competition with 
west german producers some experts have predicted up to 3 million 
of east germanys 8 million workforce could ultimately lose their 
jobs 
allgerman elections are planned for dec 2 but there are 
increasing calls for east germany to exercise a provision of the 
west german constitution for an immediate merger 
proponents of that idea say it is the only hope to control east 
germanys economic downward spiral 
waigel said it is necessary to differentiate between the capital 
and seat of government in a united germany according to a 
transcript of the program on the west german network zdf 
he said moving the government from the west german capital bonn 
to berlin germanys old capital cannot be financed in the 
coming years west germany had not built so many government 
buildings in bonn just to abandon them he said 
east and west german negotiators have agreed berlin will be the 
capital of a united nation but they left open the question of 
whether the government would be located there 
their agreement must still be ratified by both german 
parliaments 
waigel leader of the conservative christian social union the 
bavarian sister party of chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democrats called the capital fight completely superfluous 
klaus rauen bonns deputy city manager estimates it would cost 
at least 31 billion to relocate government offices and employees 
to berlin

a registry of private cuban properties seized by 
the revolution of fidel castro is being compiled in miami by exiles 
eager to return home and recoup their losses if castro is toppled 
hundreds of exiles from as far away as italy are signing on to 
list the farms homes and businesses they lost to the communist 
revolution 
others are opposed to the idea of a registry saying castros 
diehard government is even less likely to implement reforms if he 
can cite the registry as proof exiles are bent on revenge and 
retribution 
the expropriated cuban properties registry is a private venture 
by metrodade commissioner barry schreiber and the university of 
miamis research institute for cuban studies the project was begun 
last week 
i think that a number of cubans once the system changes will 
want to make demands on their property said miami professor 
jaime suchlicki who is collaborating on the project once the 
regime changes theyre going to say i had a house there i had a 
business there can i get something out of it 
registry entries must list the address of the property say how 
it was acquired how and when it was lost and give its estimated 
value at the time applicants must include supporting documents 
such as deeds or wills or affidavits by neighbors or friends who 
knew of the property 
a listing costs 150 with 15 going to the university and the 
rest to schreiber to cover clerical printing costs and other 
expenses 
the onepage application states that a listing provides no 
guarantee that the claim is valid 
but schreiber and suchlicki say the registry will be useful 
especially if castro falls and cuba opens up the most likely 
scenario is some sort of settlement whereby the cuban and us 
government will sit down and work out a longterm repayment of 
these properties said the professor 
tony costa a director of the cuban american national 
foundation which has spoken against the retrieval of nationalized 
properties said the registry will be used by the castro government 
to disparage exiles 
if the goal is to help cubans it is negative costa said 
the exiles interest is not to recover properties but for the 
regime to fall 
alberto muller a former political prisoner in cuba agreed 
it is not the moment to talk about properties he said it 
is the moment to talk about freedom democracy reconciliation not 
property

the accident caused an estimated 1 million in damage at the 
main water station serving caracas officials said 
it was described as a short circuit at the plant on the 
mariposa reservoir 30 miles south of caracas no details were 
released and there were no reports of injuries 
about three quarters of caracas will be without water while 
authorities search for parts and arrange for repairs said city 
water official victor medina said 
many residents of caracas have already spent two days without 
water because of unrelated repairs on a major pipeline in the city 
officials said they would keep hospitals firefighters and other 
crucial services functioning by rerouting water from other suburban 
pipelines a few neighborhoods will receive severely rationed water 
through the same system 
trucking companies are expected to supply water to large 
companies and apartment buildings but residents of small buildings 
and private homes will have a tougher time getting water 
government spokesman luis vezga godoy called on residents for 
their understanding and solidarity he asked businesses 
families and friends to rely on each other for help 
weve never had an accident of this magnitude he said 
he added that the government was working as quickly as possible 
to restore water

lightning fires have 
burned more than 200000 acres of california forest in the past 
week and experts said sunday it could get get much much worse 
because of the lengthy drought 
in yosemite national park off limits to tourists since friday 
two fires had burned more than 15000 acres flames were within two 
miles of the merced grove a stand of giant sequoias and within 
two miles of the badger pass ski area 
across the state 14 fires were listed as major 
fires also burned sunday in parts of alaska idaho oregon utah 
and washington state said the boise interagency fire center in 
idaho a fire in southcentral montana was controlled late 
saturday the national firefighting command center said nearly 
20000 firefighters were at work on fires that had covered 856000 
acres more than half of that acreage in alaska 
about 2800 army soldiers have begun firefighting training at 
bases in washington state and colorado about 100 soldiers left 
fort lewis wash on sunday to relieve fatigued firefighters in 
oregon about 1100 more were to follow monday said maj john 
lundberg a base spokesman 
californias worst fire was in tehama county about 200 miles 
north of yosemite where two fires not far apart had burned a total 
of 124000 acres in the sequoia national forest southeast of 
yosemite and northeast of bakersfield a fire had burned over 
24000 acres and firefighters worked to protect the communities of 
kernville and alta sierra 
the 200000acre figure for the state is probably pretty 
conservative said karen terrill of the california department of 
forestry what i hear the experts saying is that this could get 
to be much much worse 
the largest tehama county fire called the campbell complex 
covered 112000 acres 
its probably going to become twice that chris parker of 
the cdf said what were seeing is the culmination of four years 
drought 
the campbell fire was considered only 40 percent contained the 
finley lake fire six miles away was burning uncontrolled over 
12000 acres and was expected to join the bigger one terrill said 
state highway 36 in the fire area east of red bluff was closed 
sunday 
the campbell is the most difficult to fight is eating up the 
most acreage and is in an area that hasnt burned for about 50 
years she added the finley lake fire is incredibly smoky 
the finley lake fire by sunday had destroyed 13 trailer homes 
two houses and 27 outbuildings a total of 127 structures have been 
consumed by fires since aug 3 across the state including 66 of 
the 84 houses in the town of foresta at yosemite 
people allowed back into foresta on sunday saw the black trunks 
of trees rising out of smoldering white ash 
a firefighter surveying the ruins drove a stake three feet into 
the earth then pulled it out the end was burned from ground 
temperatures of 300 degrees 
to save this town it would have taken a massive sprinker 
system said len mckenzie chief naturalist at yosemite 
yosemite firefighters took special precautions to protect the 
sequoia trees some of them 2000 years old in merced grove this 
included cleaning up forest debris in the area and treating the 
trees with a fire retardant 
but the thickbarked sequoias have lived through other fires 
terrill noted and probably could make it easily through another 
elsewhere in yosemite theres a degree of peacefulness if 
you are not caught up in the frantic business of firefighting 
said jeff nicholas 39 curator of yosemites ansel adams photo 
gallery 
this is the way it should be quite and peaceful without the 
sound of tour buses he said the park normally has up to 25000 
tourists visiting on summer weekends 
the yosemite fires were about 10 miles west of yosemite valley 
the heavily visited site of half dome el capitan and bridalveil 
falls 
in 1987 summer fires in california burned more than 750000 
acres 
last week we were saying this would be nothing like 1987 
there was very little humidity then terrill said sunday but 
it also wasnt the fourth year of drought in the state then 
lightning strikes almost 24000 were counted by detection 
equipment from aug 3 through the weekend were believed to have 
caused all of the california fires 
elsewhere firefighters appeared to be winning the battle sunday 
against five major groups of lightningcaused fires that have 
burned across 119420 acres of remote eastern oregon forest and 
range land 
the town of burns ore was about four miles from the pine 
springs basin complex of fires that had burned 73700 acres the 
blaze was 75 percent contained sunday morning and full containment 
was expected by monday evening 
firefighters took advantage of a break in the hot dry weather 
and contained idahos larger range fires including the 65000acre 
thorn creek blaze that damaged several outbuildings

halt the civil war a spokesman said sunday does announcement 
reversed an earlier promise to resign by october 
at least 18 civilians were killed when government soldiers 
attacked rebels trying to take an airport 
also sunday three western news agency reporters were detained 
and beaten by government soldiers who threatened to shoot them as 
spies after they crossed through rebel lines among the reporters 
was michael goldsmith 68 of the associated press 
the reporters were brought under guard to does heavily 
fortified mansion where they were released and met with the 
government spokesman 
does move reverses an earlier offer he made in may to resign 
before elections scheduled for october in order to end the 
fighting which has degenerated into tribal warfare and left 5000 
dead mostly civilians 
the rebels who have accused doe of corruption and human rights 
abuses during his 10 years in power have demanded that he step 
down immediately 
the best thing is for doe to stay his spokesman selley 
thompson told the reporters sunday 
if he decided to leave tomorrow there would be a bloodbath 
the soldiers would go on a rampage its likely that if doe 
decided to leave the governments soldiers might even take power 
thompson said does earlier offer to step down was no longer 
valid and he wanted to keep power for at least a year after the 
west african force intervened 
in freetown sierra leone the west african task force was 
assembling it was expected to arrive in monrovia later this week 
three ships carrying 1000 ghanaian soldiers arrived sunday in 
freetown after the leader of the fivenation west african 
peacekeeping force launched an urgent appeal for a ceasefire in 
the 8monthold civil war at least 400 nigerian troops have 
arrived by air in freetown

you jesus thank you jesus 
journalists counted the bodies of 15 civilians including those 
of small children lying in a halffilled culvert where they had 
tried to seek cover three other bodies lay in the road nearby 
the rebel troops from charles taylors national patriotic front 
had bypassed the 72nd battalion in its haste to lay siege to the 
capital there were no figures for the number of government or 
rebel fighters involved or for casualties among the combatants 
taylor and johnson are rivals and their forces have clashed in 
the past 
the three western reporters were detained by government troops

behavior 
you have to understand theyre very nervous said lt col 
moses thomas before the reporters were escorted to the barclay 
training center they later made their way back across rebel lines

a fourday manhunt for a parolee accused of 
murdering one woman and raping three others at an isolated 
campground ended with his capture sunday 
roy eugene perkins 30 was arrested in the woods just south of 
berry about 60 miles west of birmingham said robert flippo an 
aide to fayette county sheriff james lenard 
about 50 law officers and volunteers took part in the search 
officers were conducting a final search of a patch of woods when 
they found perkins one of the officers walked up on him and he 
said dont shoot said ronnie finch a reserve deputy 
perkins had suffered a bullet wound to the leg that required 
treatment at a hospital but officials said it wasnt serious he 
may have been shot in a struggle with one of his alleged victims 
last week said finch 
six of perkins relatives were arrested saturday night and 
charged with hindering prosecution said fayette county police sgt 
butch hudson 
they had been giving him food and helping him and we decided 
the next time we had any trouble out of them we were going to 
arrest them lenard said 
the focus of much of the search was a cinder block house tucked 
in a campground in the deep woods perkins grew up in the woods 
officers said and all three rape victims were taken to the 
camphouse 
in 1983 perkins was convicted of seconddegree rape and served 
seven years of a 10year sentence at the west jefferson 
correctional facility before being paroled in may

parked side by side the twin motorcades 
filled the narrow street in bogota colombia idling in opposite 
directions each with a black flagdecked limousine flown in from 
washington for the day 
at a radioed signal one rolled out turned sharp left paused 
while vice president dan quayle stepped into the limousine then 
sped from the city to the expressway on a tightly guarded trip to 
catam military airport 
anyone bent on harming the vice president in a city where drug 
terrorism still is a menace would have had to pick between 
motorcades and guess at a route out of town 
security was intensive at every stop on quayles threeday 
mission to latin america last week there were reinforced secret 
service guards swat teams cordons of police and military men in 
each nation 
rooftops were guarded routes swept in advance even so the 
trip was a bodyguards nightmare and some quayle aides had argued 
against it but agents who surveyed the sites said they could keep 
the vice president safe and they did 
the government will not discuss security arrangements for the 
officials it guards and that includes costs security doesnt come 
cheap especially in a foreign capital where violence is not 
uncommon 
traveling vice presidents are not usually provided with backup 
air force jetliners for emergency use when they travel one was 
sent to bogota for the quayle visit in case of trouble with air 
force two 
and while he was in bogota for the inauguration on tuesday at 
least four latin american officials who had come for the ceremony 
told him it was safer there than in lima peru his next stop they 
told him they wouldnt go to the peruvian capital just then 
fleets of five army helicopters were sent to each city to lift 
quayle and his traveling party to and from the airports in bogota 
the weather closed in while the vice president was at the 
inauguration of colombias president cesar gaviria so he drove out 
of town 
in lima helicopters flew quayle into the city tuesday night 
landing on the floodlit soccer field of the national stadium 
security men prefer it because air routes can be varied and 
motorcades are more vulnerable to attack 
hours before quayle arrived there had been bombpunctuated 
street demonstrations over soaring prices and an austerity program 
the new peruvian government was instituting to try to rebuild a 
collapsing economy the city was in a state of emergency visitors 
were advised against venturing from their hotels lest they be 
caught up in random violence 
early the next morning an explosion and gunfire could be heard 
from the us ambassadors residence where quayle spent the night 
none of it altered quayles schedule and he didnt see so much 
as a demonstrator despite the objections of his security staff he 
insisted on visiting san pablo presbyterian church in a slum 
neighborhood 20 minutes from downtown to tour a center for orphans 
of guerrilla violence in the peruvian mountains 
it is operated with support from the quayles church in mclean 
va and he was determined to go there sharpshooters patrolled 
slum rooftops scanning the maze of buildings and shacks as he came 
and went 
again no problems 
as quayle flew home from bolivia with a stop in haiti where 
random violence also is ordinary he said there had been warnings 
in advance that he would not be well received in the andean 
capitals 
he said hed been told that there might be antiamerican 
demonstrations and security trouble 
that just didnt happen quayle said he said it reflects 
new attitudes and improving relationships between the united states 
and latin american nations 
had he worried about his safety 
i didnt that much but my wife did and some others he 
said 
his trip to the capital cities contrasted with the brief 
heavily guarded bush visit to cartagena colombia feb 15 for the 
drug summit with the presidents of the same three nations that 
meeting was held at a colombian naval base with 5000 troops 
standing guard warships offshore and helicopters patrolling 
overhead 
even so bush faced advance criticism for going he said he 
wasnt going to do something stupid or macho but was going to 
show support for the colombian government in its drive against the 
cocaine cartels 
quayles trip to bogota where no such iron security was 
possible renewed that support for a successor government pledged 
to continue the antidrug effort the visits to lima and la paz 
were companion pieces in the followup to cartagena 
he was the highest ranking us official to visit lima since 
richard m nixon went there as vice president in 1958 and was 
jeered and pelted with tomatoes and spoiled fruit nixon like 
quayle had gone on to la paz no vice president had been there 
since none had visited haiti quayles last stop since nixon in 
1954 
the vice president did not go bearing gifts he carried no new 
messages no new aid commitments he came home satisfied that by 
going he had demonstrated us support for governments that are 
trying to cope with drugs and with economic woes 
the fact that he went at some risk served to underscore his 
point

iraqs invasion of kuwait forced economists to 
reevaluate their projections but left many even more convinced 
that the us economy is weakening while also facing the 
possibility of higher inflation 
developments in the weeks preceding the iraqi invasion already 
had economists warning of higher inflation and weaker economic 
growth 
in a sense the oil price increase only reinforces what was 
happening before said alan levenson an economist at the wefa 
group a balacynwyd pa economic forecasting firm 
weve been through oil shocks before now we have to make some 
judgments about where the dust will settle this time he said 
one key to the economys direction is how the federal reserve 
will act as a matter of policy the fed doesnt disclose its 
intentions but it has enormous power to influence economic growth 
through two principal means controlling the supply of money in the 
banking system and adjusting rates banks pay to borrow 
the spotlight on what the central banks strategy might be has 
brightened because of events in the middle east 
before the iraqi invasion there were signs of economic weakness 
which suggested the fed would move to ease credit 
julys unemployment figures showed the jobless rate reaching a 
2year high julys purchasing managers index slipped below 50 
indicating that the manufacturing sector might be in decline and 
the feds own regional survey showed economic growth was slowing 
wholesale prices in july edged down 01 percent the government 
said friday but analysts said the figures may indicate the last 
respite from inflation before the effects of soaring oil costs 
linked to the mideast crisis are felt 
the fed is faced with the same choices it had before the oil 
price increase how much should it ease the money supply to offset 
economic weakness but avoid increasing the potential for inflation 
the weakening economy and higher inflation put the fed in a 
common but no less troublesome predicament on how to deal with 
interest rates 
increasing the supply of money in the economy would lower 
interest rates and spur more spending possibly giving the economy 
a dose of vitality however with more money floating around 
inflation could accelerate prices may already be pulled upward 
across the economy by the increase in oil 
holding back on the money supply however could spur higher 
interest rates and make it more difficult to buy new cars and homes 
and build new factories irwin kellner chief economist at 
manufacturers hanover trust co said fears of inflation are 
exaggerated higher gasoline prices wont remain after the summer 
peak driving season ends labor day he said with less consumer 
demand it will be even more difficult for oil companies to pass 
along higher wholesale costs he said 
its been our assertion for some time now that the us 
economy entered into a recession in the second quarter kellner 
said 
assuming the middle east situation settles down kellner said he 
expects the fed to loosen the money supply after its policymaking 
federal open market committee meets aug 21 
if it hadnt been for the invasion we would have seen easing 
already kellner said 
the big question is will it stick or not no were not going 
to return to 20 a barrel anytime soon but will there be some 
decreases ray stone of stone amp mccarthy research associates 
inc said 
the higher oil prices makes it harder for the fed to ease 
the money supply now he said

fred curreys dream greyhound lines inc is 
getting a little frayed around the edges what with a strike by bus 
drivers and others doubts about his company paying its bills 
but the man who led the 1987 leveraged buyout of the bus company 
remains determined 
youre damned right i believe in the system and youre damned 
right i see it rebuilt currey said during an interview in his 
starkly modern office in a dallas skyscraper i intend to finish 
exactly what the hell i started 
others arent so sure 
we think the company is on the brink of extinction here 
said earle putnam general counsel of the amalgamated transit 
union the umbrella organization over greyhound drivers union 
some analysts privately wonder if greyhound this summer is 
building up the cash reserves it needs to survive the winters 
slack travel 
greyhounds 6300 drivers went on strike march 2 after 
negotiations broke down over a new contract to replace the one 
currey had negotiated in 1987 
three months into the strike greyhound filed for bankruptcy 
court protection from its creditors blaming increased legal and 
security costs required to combat the initially violent walkout 
the bankruptcy remains in its early stages with current 
management still running the company no reorganization plan is due 
until october and since extensions on initial plan deadlines are 
frequently granted greyhound spokesman george gravley says the 
companys plan should be ready by early november 
currey promises a highquality plan reorganized around a 
viable market 
the reorganized greyhound is likely to resemble the old 
greyhound streamlined somewhat 
our strategy at operating this business turned around a dying 
business he said so a reorganization plan will employ exactly 
the same strategies updated and enhanced that we employed 
before the bankruptcy 
currey a career bus executive led a team of investors in 1987 
that paid 270 million for the bus operations of greyhound corp 
since renamed greyhound dial corp a few months later the 
investors plunked down another 80 million for dallasbased 
trailways lines inc the largest trailways franchisee 
after merging the two operations currey ran the nations only 
intercity bus company 
ridership had been falling each year before the buyout 
bottoming out at 609 billion passenger miles in 1986 after the 
buyout ridership increased each year hitting 748 billion 
passenger miles in 1989 
greyhound also turned its first profit that year earning 
730000 on about 1 billion in revenues after losing about 20 
million over the previous two years 
although the company has continued to operate using replacement 
drivers the strike slashed ridership and the meager profits 
ridership slowly as returned to levels fluctuating between 70 
percent and 80 percent of last year 
were now through the 87 level currey said predicting 
it wont take three years to recover to profitable levels 
revenues are covering operating costs he said 
but in the transportation industry travel delayed is travel 
lost and the summer is the busiest time of the year 
the objective indicators are that this company has a very 
severe financial problem just operating said the unions putnam 
although he wont provide figures until the reorganization plan 
is ready currey says greyhound is building sufficient cash flow to 
attract new capital 
we are building cash balances gravley said were having 
a good summer things are going pretty well business as usual has 
been our theme song

communications workers of america which represents a total of 
2500 workers at western union

officer we cannot operate under the everpresent threat of an 
employee strike while continuing to bear the cost required to 
ensure that the company would survive one 
western union has a total of 16000 employees about half the 
employees represented by cwa are recording operators and the 
others are mostly customer relations clerks clerical workers and 
field technicians 
dan beckstead the chief union negotiator deplored the lockout 
saying the union had not given the company any indication it 
intends to strike 
in fact we told them we wanted to continue to negotiate in an 
attempt to reach an agreement beckstead said cwa workers have 
authorized their leadership to call a strike 
western union said many of the replaced cwa workers were from 
its central telephone bureaus in bridgeton miss and reno nev 
its computer centers in middletown va and bridgeton 
it temporarily replaced them with workers from western union 
headquarters and trained temporary replacements the company said 
the company has been negotiating with representatives of the cwa 
since july 23 the previous twoyear contract expired aug 6 but 
management and union negotiators have continued to meet to try to 
agree on a new pact 
management on aug 8 proposed a 90day extension of the old 
contract but the offer was rejected by the cwa 
the contract issues include wages health care and job 
classifications as well as western unions right to use outside 
contractors and hire parttime workers the operators average about 
10 an hour 
beckstead said western union has not responded to the unions 
latest offer made friday the company however said the union had 
until midnight sunday to agree to a 90day contract extension
