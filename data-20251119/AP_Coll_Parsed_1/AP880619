a drifter who supported himself 
and his flair for new wave clothing by gambling goes on trial 
monday on charges he sexually assaulting two aspiring teenage 
models and murdered their chaperones 
herbert james coddington 29 is accused of luring reno nev 
modeling school owner maybelle mabs martin 69 her friend 
dorothy dottie walsh 67 and the teenagers to his south lake 
tahoe mobile home last may with the ruse of making an antidrug 
videotape 
the women were strangled and their bodies stuffed in green 
plastic trash bags the girls then aged 12 and 14 were imprisoned 
in a sounddeadened room in the trailer where they remained for two 
days until fbi agents stormed in freed the girls and recovered the 
victims bodies 
defense lawyers have indicated coddington who faces death in 
the gas chamber if convicted will plead insanity 
we dont say he didnt do it said attorney steve tapson 
jury selection will begin monday in superior court in 
placerville calif where the case was moved because of extensive 
news coverage following his arrest here on may 18 1987 
last july coddington was charged with another murder he was 
accused of killing sheila keister 12 whose battered body was 
found in the desert in august 1981 just outside las vegas nev 
where she was abducted while playing 
in high school coddington was known as herb a quiet loner 
who didnt date and was said to be a math whiz possibly explaining 
his gambling abilities 
prosecutor ron tepper said the defendants successes at the 
poker blackjack and baccarat tables show were not dealing with 
somebody who is intellectually impoverished were dealing with 
somebody who has some gift 
although he had been unemployed for some time before his arrest 
coddington drove a new bmw on loan from a south lake tahoe car 
dealership which became the key link that led to his arrest and 
the rescue of the girls 
coddington had made the rounds of renoarea modeling agencies in 
the week before the girls and their chaperones disappeared looking 
for blonde allamerican girls for the purported videotaping 
session 
while most of the agency representatives remembered only a 
dirtylooking man with grimy hair who smelled bad one recalled the 
bmw and its dealers license plate 
neither side in the case has discussed any motive and tapson 
said his client is violently antidrug and opposed to drinking 
smoking and coffee

activist abbie hoffman said sunday he was ordered 
off a continental airlines plane at ohare international airport 
after a flight attendant unjustly accused him of smoking marijuana 
in the lavatory 
hoffman the 51yearold former yippie leader said some very 
strange things seem to happen to him in chicago where 20 years 
ago he was a key organizer of the august 1968 antivietnam war 
protests at the democratic national convention 
the incident occurred late friday afternoon just after he had 
boarded a flight bound for newark nj after visiting chicago to 
meet with playboy magazine editors hoffman said by telephone from 
northampton mass where he was speaking at an antinuclear power 
rally 
minutes before takeoff hoffman said he went into the lavatory 
to take some prescription medicine suddenly the fire alarm bells 
started ringing 
then the stewardess pushes in the door with her knee like a 
stormtrooper and starts shouting youve been smoking 
marijuana hoffman said i said like hell bring on the 
dogs im not smoking anything 
shes lucky i didnt have my pants down 
hoffman said he was ordered off the plane and as he was getting 
off some passengers asked for his autograph 
he said he was briefly questioned by an official who didnt 
identify himself and then allowed to board continentals next 
flight to newark but the airline lost his carryon bag he said 
ned walker a continental spokesman said it was company policy 
not to release passenger names but confirmed that a male passenger 
was ordered off the newarkbound flight 
he said several crew members and passengers smelled a burning 
odor coming from the lavatory after the smoke alarms went off 
while the plane was refueling 
smoking on the ground or in a lavatory is in violation of 
federal aviation regulations and could conceivably put the safety 
of passengers and crew members at risk said walker reached at 
his home in houston 
the passenger admitted to our personnel that he was in the 
lavatory smoking a cuban cigarette said walker adding that he 
did not know the cigarettes contents 
the man then apologized and assured our personnel that he 
would conduct himself in accordance with the law walker said 
in his northampton appearance hoffman criticized actress jane 
fondas recent apology for her 1972 trip to north vietnam and 
called her a fink 
fonda last week expressed regret for her trip to hanoi which 
has embittered many veterans and conservatives for years 
the times were extreme and maybe what we did was extreme but 
you need the generals to apologize for what they did hoffman 
told a crowd of about 300

dexterity in the operating room translates 
into sleight of hand on stage for an orthopedic surgeon who spends 
some of his nights performing at a hollywood magic club

medicine at century city hospital has appeared occasionaly at the 
magic castle for the past five years 
berman 36 makes coins disappear reassembles a rope cut into 
pieces and does seemingly impossible things with playing cards

to learn magic said berman 36 im used to performing 
intricate operations with my hands 
he began taking magic lessons from a professional magician 
friend after completing his medical education and residency 
both activities require exquisite attention to detail 
berman said in a recent interview 
he practices his tricks at home first by himself then with his 
wife nancy and baby daughter samantha as the audience 
berman appears at least once a month at the club as an unpaid 
performer but his hospital job doesnt allow him to keep a regular 
schedule 
its not the kind of thing i could do carrying a beeper he

the investigation of alleged bribery and fraud 
in pentagon weaponsbuying shows the good old boy network in 
the reagan administration was more worried about winning huge 
defense budgets than about making sure the government spent its 
money wisely four key legislators said sunday 
meantime president reagan attending a summit meeting of the 
leaders of western democracies in toronto refused to comment on 
news reports that former navy secretary john lehman jr may have 
warned his longtime ally military consultant melvyn paisley that 
paisley was under investigation 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the pentagon has had a serious management problem 
for a number of years 
i also knew that we did not have the kind of people in the 
pentagon at high levels that really had background in management 
said nunn we had people being selected for their ideological 
beliefs for their salesmanship but not for good sound management 
i think the emphasis has been on salesmanship and getting the 
money and the management end of it has been the last of the list of 
priorities he said on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of house armed services 
committee said on the abc show he agreed and added i do think 
that in one sense its surprising this hasnt happened before 
you know its always been advantageous to have inside 
information theres always always been a lot of money floating 
around 
they were referring to the twoyearlong investigation into 
allegations that defense contractors paid consultants and 
government officials for secret pentagon information that was 
useful in winning weapons contracts worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars the investigation under way for two years came to light 
last tuesday when fbi and naval investigative service raided the 
offices of pentagon officials defense contractors and consultants 
us attorney henry hudson has said that perhaps as many as 200 
indictments could be expected out of the investigation a 
government source said sunday 
sen charles grassley riowa a sharp critic of pentagon waste 
said the affair arises from the good old boy network its an 
ethic within the defense department that breeds an attitude among 
the defense industry catch us if you can 
grassley was interviewed on cbstvs face the nation along 
with rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee dingells panel has investigated pentagon waste 
as has the senate judiciary administrative practices subcommitte 
which grassley has chaired 
both said their committees turned up evidence of pentagon waste 
but nothing was done 
weve been aware of this stuff for a long time except nothing 
was done about it said grassley its both an institutional 
problem but its also a case of personal greed its part of the 
culture of the militaryindustrial complex and we have been trying 
to send this message for five years to prosecutors to the justice 
department to get interested in this sort of thing 
grassley said investigators have contacted his subcommittee 
staff members to discuss information which casme to light in a 
series of 1985 hearings which he said focused on similar 
allegations 
in answer to questions grassley said im not suggesting 
theres a coverup by top pentagon or justice department 
officials 
dingell complained that administration officials didnt want to 
act nothing discernable was done he explained 
we have found consistant instances where the buddybuddy 
approach would prevent vigorous actions by the defense department 
into these kinds of abuses 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger who resigned after 
seven years in november defended the administrations efforts to 
prevent procurement fraud but said he would support changes in the 
military contracting process if reports of extensive wrongdoing 
proved true 
if there are some procedures that permitted this to happen and 
its more than just simple greed and dishonesty then obviously the 
procedures need tightening weinberger said in a telephone 
interview with the new york times published in mondays editions 
federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the possibility 
that lehman tipped paisley off that he might be the subject of an 
investigation it was disclosed last week that paisleys home and 
office were wiretapped in the investigation he has emerged as a 
key figure in the probe 
paisley was a former top navy official under lehman before 
resigning in april 1987 and opening a consulting business paisley 
has emerged as a key figure in the investigation 
i am not going to comment until we have all the information 
reagan said in response to a question shouted at him during his 
arrival in toronto 
aspin noted that when lehman headed the navy he centralized 
power 
the thing about the lehman navy is that the decisions in the 
lehman navy were really highly centralized in a few people right 
around the secretary john lehman and he had a very strong view 
about people who were with him and people who were against him and 
some of the people who were with him may be a little shady 
characters 
but if you were with john lehman on his side in all of the 
fights boy you were on the inside said aspin and if you 
were against him even though you were honest and capable you were 
really kind of stiffarmed in the whole process

it works like an intricate telephone cable with millions of 
microwires carrying messages to and from body organs and 
extremities but if these wires fray or snap they cant be 
spliced glued or soldered 
injury prevents brain messages of balance and movement to reach 
the limbs messages of pain touch and temperature cant reach the 
brain 
you sit there and rot and wait to die sandy valentino 24 
paralyzed seven years ago in a car accident said of her initial 
devastation when you dont die you pick up the pieces and 
decide what youre going to do with the rest of your life despair 
makes you search for something anything to try 
miss valentino is now working to build her arm muscles in the 
biofeedback unit at the miami project 
when the spinal cord is injured bleeding and swelling kill off 
the nerve fibers and the eventual scars block messages to and from 
the brain any cure must come from regenerating the nerves to grow 
through or around the scar 
the problem is that spinal nerves are biologically programmed to 
grow only in the fetal stage peripheral nerves however such as 
those found in arms and legs can grow back and researchers are 
trying to transplant them inside the spinal cord 
in 1982 dr albert aguayo of montreals mcgill university 
medical school grafted cells from a rats leg nerve into its 
damaged spinal cord the nerve grew but stopped at the other side 
of the scar without making a functioning connection 
at the miami project one promising research effort toward nerve 
regeneration is being moved to sweden because of intense feeling on 
abortion here 
the particular research implants cells from aborted human 
fetuses into rats to see if new spinal cord nerves will sprout dr 
ake seiger director of basic research at the miami project also 
worked on the swedish research teams that used fetal cells to 
regenerate brain cells in victims of parkinsons and alzheimers 
diseases 
antiabortion groups in the united states oppose using fetal 
cells and the national institutes of health in april barred 
federal researchers from transplanting fetal brain tissue into 
parkinsons patients 
arthur caplan head of the center for biomedical research at the 
university of minnesota backs the use of fetal cells despite the 
abortion debate 
if it works it would revolutionize medicine it would offer 
cures and help to people who had nothing it will be almost 
irresistible to use no matter what the ethical questions are 
caplan said 
in other spinal cord research 
neuroscientist paul reier at the university of florida in 
gainesville is working with rat fetal cells to build a bridge 
around or through a spinal cord injury 
scientists using fetal cells on a thin splint got a damaged 
peripheral nerve that controls the toe of a rat to grow back into 
the spinal cord where it made connections to restore function the 
work was done by neurologists jerry silver of casewestern reserve 
university and michael kliot of columbia presbyterian hospital 
at purdue university biophysicist richard borgens has 
implanted tiny batteries above spinal cord injuries creating 
lowlevel electrical pulses that encourage nerves to grow through 
scar tissue of 200 paralyzed guinea pigs implanted 25 percent 
showed some movement borgens said 
when he played for the dolphins nick buoniconti was the heart 
of a unit of overachievers known as the noname defense that helped 
miami win two super bowls and go unbeaten in the 1972 season 
after his sons injury he helped coordinate existing research 
and assembled a team of doctors to try to beat paralysis 
in 2 years the miami project has raised 8 million and has 
spent 6 million on research it hopes to raise 20 million for a 
selfsustaining endowment 
weve replaced the word despair with hope weve given science 
an opportunity said the elder buoniconti 
his son just completed his first full semester at the university 
of miami where he made the deans list as a psychology major 
theres a great possibility ill live and die in this 
wheelchair buoniconti said but theres no reason to feel 
sorry for myself ive been taught that in all adversity never 
give up i wouldnt know how to give up

high schools and a hospital were opened to house the evacuees 
at least 150 people saturday and 125 people friday were treated 
at three city hospitals for skin burns and respiratory problems 
caused by the fumes authorities said there were no reports of 
serious injuries 
i dont need this and my kids dont need this said kathy 
trucx an evacuee at municipal hospital who said her two children 
suffer from bronchitis 
authorities said they were abandoning an earlier plan to use 52 
tons of neutralizing chemicals after dawn sunday to try to put out 
the blaze at the plant which makes swimming pool chemicals 
we just decided we cant wait until morning placanico said 
it was too dangerous to leave alone 
the center of the fire saturday was a room containing 600 to 800 
barrels each filled with 300 pounds of granulated chlorine the dry 
compound is 90 percent chlorine placanico said 
explosions from the room came three and four and six a 
minute after starting around noon saturday said john higgins 
regional director of the state department of environmental quality 
engineering 
higgins said authorities had planned to pump 26 tons each of 
boric acid and sodium sulfate through fire hoses into the room 
containing the barrels 
chlorine is flammable and can burn the skin and lungs it can be 
fatal in large concentrations 
around 6 pm saturday yellowgreen clouds rising several 
hundred feet were visible from a police and fire command post in a 
gas station about two miles from the plant shortly afterward the 
command center also was evacuated 
in some parts of town visibility was limited to about 50 feet 
witnesses said 
some residents in this city of 170000 were evacuated after the 
fire broke out friday morning and more than 6000 people were 
ordered from their homes friday night after the fire engulfed three 
stories of the brick plant 
all but about 200 people were allowed to return home saturday 
morning but when the evacuation area was expanded later in the 
day police with bullhorns herded many of the returnees into school 
buses to leave the area 
it smelled like pure bleach was coming through my window and 
burning my eyes said judy williams 34 an evacuee at municipal 
hospital 
more than a dozen firefighters also were injured including two 
who were knocked against a wall by an exploding barrel around noon 
saturday 
after fire chief raymond s sullivan ordered 35 firefighters to 
withdraw from the plant more barrels could be heard exploding 
firefighters in the building dove behind trucks 
the first fire was ignited around 10 am friday by rain that 
blew in an open window and set off highly reactive chlorine pellets 
lying in a hopper placanico said 
the first fire was small and quickly extinguished although the 
fumes forced the evacuation of about 1800 people including 1200 
schoolchildren he said however about 12 hours later a passing 
police officer spotted more flames and fumes 
the second fire consumed most of one wing of the plant 
orginally a section of the springfield arsenal and forced the 
second evacuation 
state commissioner of environmental quality engineering daniel 
s greenbaum said the old plant was equipped with a sprinkler 
system that may have dampened additional barrels of chlorine and 
sparked additional reactions and fires 
state and federal officials will investigate the companys 
operations greenbaum said

congressmen touring the droughtstricken plains promised farmers 
saturday they would introduce relief legislation while dredges 
continued cutting safe channels through shallow sections of the 
mississippi and ohio rivers 
this drought is very very serious it certainly the most 
serious one in my lifetime this early in the year sen patrick 
leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee said 
while visiting aberdeen sd 
leahy five other senators and two congressmen looked at acre 
after acre of dry land and stunted crops east of bismarck nd 
later saturday then headed for montana to continue their 
informationcollecting tour 
the drought has not been limited to farmers or the midwest it 
has left some bodies of water in the southeast too low to supply 
water to cool power plants officials of one illinois town voted 
saturday to cut off water completely to customers who violate 
conservation measures 
we havent had enough rain to amount to anything in five 
years its pitiful said david lee rhodes whose family grows 
apples near edneyville nc which hasnt had a soaking rain since 
midapril 
showers and thunderstorms developed in only a few areas 
saturday including parts of north dakota kansas and iowa but an 
area of high pressure building over the rockies was expected to 
extend the dry period 
the rev jesse jackson led a prayer for rain saturday in the 
droughtstricken cornfield of dan mau at chatham ill and then 
told the state democratic convention in nearby springfield there 
should be a national moratorium on farm disclosures no one 
should lose his land because of this drought he said 
in california which has water problems of its own los angeles 
mayor tom bradley asked participants at his annual mayors prayer 
breakfast to pray for farmers in dry regions of the nation 
those farmers suffer their families suffer and all americans 
suffer as well he said 
sen quentin burdick dnd told a group of farmers he has 
drafted legislation to allow them to collect price supports known 
as deficiency payments the bill will be put in the hopper monday 
morning he said 
under the 1985 farm bill the government wont make deficiency 
payments if prices are high and the drought is driving up prices 
but the drought may prevent farmers from producing a crop that they 
could sell at the high prices 
deficiency payments are caught in a catch22 that did not 
take into consideration a drought leahy said 
among the stops on the lawmakers itinerary was the fort benton 
mont ranch of mike ohara 
were completely out of stock water ohara said in a 
telephone interview the last rain that we got that amounted to 
anything was in august of 87

mississippi near greenville miss waiting for dredges to cut a 
deep channel while nearly 700 barges were stuck on the ohio 
awaiting dredging near mound city ill 
late saturday barges began to move on both rivers but traffic 
was limited authorities said 
bob campbell assistant chief of operations for the army corps 
of engineers vicksburg district said it would take two to three 
days to unsnarl the traffic along the mississippi once the channel 
was cleared 
the mississippi is at its lowest levels since authorities began 
keeping records in 1872 
authorities said tow boat owners were losing about 10000 a day 
while they waited to move the barges which carried grain 
chemicals coal and oil 
dixieportland flour mills in chattanooga tenn had a shipment 
of 50000 bushels of wheat sitting on the ohio river and wheat 
traffic manager george norris said the company may have to resort 
to more expensive rail shipping 
at least one ship had to delay leaving new orleans on friday 
because the barge tieup kept its load of export coal from arriving 
in time officials said 
the drought has cut the tennessee valley authoritys 
hydroelectric power production nearly in half this year and water 
dropping below intake pipes or rising too high in temperature 
threatens operation of the sequoyah nuclear power plant near 
soddydaisy and the allen steam plant near memphis said tva power 
manager robert c steffy jr he said the sequoyah plant which 
receives water from lake chickamauga must have cooling water of 
less than 83 degrees 
the drought already has cost tva more than 110 million in lost 
power production from its hydroelectric dams 
village officials in oak brook ill voted unanimously to shut 
off water to homeowners who repeatedly violate water restrictions

the iraqi capital of baghdad it said its fighters had battled two 
divisions of iranian troops around the town

was repulsed and only iranian moppingup operations were continuing 
a second dispatch said clashes between iranian and iraqi forces 
were intensifying west of mehran it said the iraqis sustained

a political scandal is drawing sharp criticism of 
the links between japans secondlargest opposition party and the 
huge buddhist organization that supports it 
junya yano secretarygeneral of the komeito or clean 
government party told reporters on june 10 that the removal of 
outspoken parliamentarian toshio ohashi from the party roster was 
not an effort to put a lid on dissent 
if there is criticism we must face it headon yano said 
according to komeito leaders ohashi was given the boot on june 
6 for womanizing and accepting bribes totaling 264000 
but the forced departure of ohashi 62 a member of the powerful 
house of representatives and a former kamikaze pilot came shortly 
after he published an article saying the partys independence had 
been usurped by daisaku ikeda honorary president of japans 
largest religious group the soka gakkai 
ikeda may publicly claim the separation of religion and 
politics but that is not the reality ohashi wrote in the june 
edition of bungei shunju a prestigious monthly magazine nothing 
happens in the gakkai or the party without his final ok 
ohashi quoted former prime minister kakuei tanakas description 
of ikeda as a sutrachanting hitler and said he was declaring 
war on ikeda to restore the integrity of the middleoftheroad 
komeito 
the komeito has 200000 members nationwide and holds 80 seats in 
the two houses of japans parliament all but eight of komeitos 
parliament members are soka gakkai adherents 
the soka gakkai founded on the ideals of a nationalistic brand 
of buddhism expounded by the 13thcentury priest nichiren has 12 
million members in japan and 12 million overseas including more 
than 330000 in the united states ikeda became its leader in 1960 
four years before the komeito was established 
in 1979 he retired as president following charges he was 
creating a personality cult but he has remained its honorary 
president 
the komeito is the secondstrongest opposition force after the 
japan socialist party which has 110 parliament seats when it was 
founded the komeito advocated buddhist democracy a platform 
later dropped as the soka gakkai officially withdrew from politics 
but the division between religion and politics has often proved 
to be a fine line 
this is not a religious party takenori kanzaki head of the 
partys international division said our party maintains clear 
independence from the soka gakkai on all matters of policy and 
personnel 
the komeito says ohashis decision to oppose ikeda was prompted 
by party retirement rules that would make this ohashis last term 
in office 
ohashi has denied this 
disciplinary action against an outspoken supporter of ohashi 
tokyo municipal assemblyman yukimasa fujiwara is pending 
according to kanzaki the komeito will not support fujiwara in 
the next assembly elections 
we decided last april to run another candidate kanzaki said 
in an interview with the associated press 
ikeda has made no public response to ohashis statement but 
kanzaki said ohashis comments were untrue and contain many 
perversions of the facts 
a party member who requested anonymity said rumors about 
ohashis misconduct had been making the rounds since late last 
year and the bungei shunju article was simply the last straw 
at his press conference june 10 yano said the komeito had not 
become a personal possession of ikeda though it incorporates 
several religious ideas 
the komeito is a public party not a religious organ he 
said though we do at times accept pleas from the soka gakkai to 
uphold public morals that is only natural it is the 
responsibility of our supporters to make such pleas

thousands of residents began returning 
to their homes early sunday as firefighters extinguished a chlorine 
plant blaze that spread a cloud of toxic gas over two cities 
injuring 275 people 
the fire which started friday was finally put out sunday 
morning and fire officials reduced the offlimits zone from 2 
miles to a quartermile 
its the worst public health and environmental disaster in the 
past 20 years said john j higgins regional director for the 
state department of environmental quality engineering the 
department took air readings in area churches to see if it was safe 
for people to attend sunday services 
authorities sunday lowered their estimate of the number of 
people evacuated from about 30000 to 10000 to 15000 some of 
those returning home sunday morning had been away for two nights 
fumes had stopped forming into the dense cloud of dangerous gas 
that had spread throughout the area earlier said fire commissioner 
darnell williams firefighters poured about 14000 pounds of water 
on the blaze every minute during the height of the battle 
seven of the 125 firefighters on the line were injured saturday 
night or sunday morning 
the old wood and brick building onetime home of the springfield 
arsenal was used by the advanced laboratories co to make chlorine 
products for swimming pools 
the fire engulfed the twostory blocklong building with 
threestory towers sending flames 100 feet into the air early 
sunday officials said a cloud of chlorine fumes about two miles 
long blew northeast across the city of 170000 
one large room in the building was believed to contain 600 to 
800 barrels each holding about 300 pounds of granulated dry 
chlorine fire department spokesman giorgio placanico said 
the fumes went into the adjacent community of chicopee where 
mayor joseph chesney ordered a voluntary evacuation of three 
neighborhoods near the city line 
fire officials said the clean harbors co of kingston a 
hazardous waste firm brought in a truckload of sodium sulfate a 
neutralizing chemical early sunday 
however williams said any use of sodium sulfate or boric acid 
would be held up until fire officials are sure they know what was 
stored in the big building for fear of creating other problems 
the city extended an evacuation order to residential 
neighborhoods one mile around the plant and 1 miles to the 
northeast 
placanico said 20000 to 30000 people were evacuated and 
several thousand were in four emergency shelters others went to 
stay with friends or relatives or waited in unaffected areas of 
the city in hopes the cloud would disperse soon 
two elderly residents declined to leave their homes and were 
brought out by police said james controvich city emergency 
response coordinator state troopers came in to help guard affected 
areas but there had been no problems with looters 
officials said 150 people were treated at three city hospitals 
saturday while 125 had been treated on friday for skin burns and 
respiratory problems caused by the corrosive chlorine fumes no 
serious injuries were reported 
chlorine is flammable and can burn the skin and lungs it can be 
fatal in large concentrations firefighters could get no closer 
than 100 feet from the building even with protective gear 
some residents had been evacuated after the fire broke out 
friday morning but most were allowed to return home later 
however more than 6000 people were ordered from their homes 
friday night after the rekindled fire engulfed a wing of the 
fourstory brick and wood plant 
two city high schools a hospital and the springfield civic 
center were opened to house the evacuees

the drought staggering americas farmlands may 
pose a danger for the rest of the nation too increased pollution 
in the rivers lakes and wells that provide drinking water and 
recreation 
millions of streams and rivers across the nation carry off 
sewage industrial wastes agricultural chemicals and other 
pollutants some people describe the process with the rhyme the 
solution to pollution is dilution 
just common sense would tell you that if you have less flow in 
a stream there is less dilution of whatever components are being 
carried by that stream pointed out ben jones assistant regional 
hydrologist for the us geological survey in menlo park calif 
there have for example been recent complaints from northern 
california that large volumes of sewage discharge had appeared in 
streams 
these were streams where there was normally enough water to 
handle the treated sewage jones said but because of dry 
conditions suddenly the volume of sewage exceeded that of clean 
water and people reacted to the sudden change 
droughtinduced low water in the mississippi and ohio rivers has 
attracted attention by stranding barges but it also has 
concentrated pollutants in those rivers which accept the runoff 
from much of the nation 
bob meade of the geological surveys denver office has just 
returned from a waterquality survey of the mississippi one of the 
things the scientists found was a broken sewer in memphis spewing 
thousands of gallons of what he termed floatable solids into 
the river 
meades detailed pollution measurements wont be completed for 
months but he concurred with jones that reduced river flows 
increase the concentrations of chemicals like nitrates and 
herbicides that are dissolved in the water 
warm weather and low water levels lead to stress on much aquatic 
life added gary pederson a survey hydrologist in atlanta 
for one thing warmer water can hold less dissolved oxygen 
pederson explained that in itself can be a problem for fish and 
other aquatic life moreover because oxygen is needed to help 
clean the water low water and less oxygen increases the chances of 
the water becoming toxic 
the surveys monthly analysis of the nations streams and rivers 
showed flows at below normal in may in the pacific northwest 
california the great plains and the southeast 
the mississippi marked its second lowest flow in 60 years while 
the st lawrence the nations second largest river fell below 
normal for the first time since 1967 
may saw five record low stream flows recorded at locations in 
florida alabama north carolina and arkansas the survey reported 
in addition to lakes and rivers known as surface water 
millions of americans depend on ground water those great 
underground pools tapped by wells 
as a drought deepens and strengthens people tend to go more 
and more to ground water supplies as a source jones added and 
in some cases they may start to pump water from underground 
aquifers which are not normally used 
ground water is already more concentrated with minerals because 
of its longer contact with them he noted as water supplies 
become less and less available for agriculture there will be more 
and more chance of arid areas having soil begin to salt up from 
water with a higher mineral content he said 
saltladen soil already has been reported as a problem in some 
parts of the southwest

louise lindblom surveyed the crowd that 
turned out for michael dukakis people whove worked in every 
campaign in alabama since 1960 they showed up this afternoon 
she said 
she pointed out billy joe camp who was a leading backer of 
george c wallace and a minister who was alabama chairman for 
george mcgovern in 1972 
ive never seen them all together at one time said 
lindblom a veteran of state and national democratic party politics 
it was a remarkable turnout in a state the massachusetts 
governor had little reason to think he could carry against 
republican george bush in the fall presidential election 
the democratic presidential candidate carried alabama only once 
in the last six elections 
a threeday trip through seven southern states that his staff 
described as the first swing of the general election campaign was 
marked by the turnout of democratic party officials people who 
often had kept their distance from their partys presidential 
nominees in recent elections 
folks who hid out before they aint hiding out on mike 
dukakis said larry harrington an aide to tennessee sen albert 
gore jr 
gore endorsed dukakis on this trip and so did gov ray maybus of 
mississippi and both talked about their willingness to campaign for 
the massachusetts governor 
equally significant if not more so was the willingness of 
party officials and members of congress to come out and be seen in 
public with the massachusetts politician who has locked up their 
partys presidential nomination the victory of a man perceived 
early on as a northern liberal was an outcome they had hoped to 
avoid when they banded together to get nearly all southern states 
to hold primaries on march 8 an effort designed to give one of 
their own a shot at the nomination 
but dukakis has shaken that label and the southerners appeared 
comfortable with him far more comfortable than they ever were with 
walter mondale in 1984 
everybody committed to help us put together the coalition we 
need to win in the fall said donna brazile deputy political 
director of the campaign 
will you help us she said the politicians were asked during 
private meetings at every stop they said yes 
it was a good three days dukakis said as he flew back to 
boston 
the southern trip was a statement by dukakis a challenge to 
bush on what the vice president thought was his own turf his 
political base 
i wanted so very much to make this first swing of the campaign 
in the south dukakis told the rally in the alabama capital 
he said he wanted to demonstrate that im serious and youre 
serious about campaigning hard in the south working hard in the 
south and winning the south 
he offered southern voters the kind of tough talk about crime 
and drugs that they want to hear and showed no sign of being 
rattled by the republican surrogates who preceded him at many stops 
and branded him a teddy kennedy liberal from massachusetts who 
was soft on crime 
dukakis pointed to statistics that showed his state has the 
lowest homicide rate of any industrial state and also had one of 
the largest drops in major crime 
the massachusetts governor dismissed criticism from one such 
surrogate sen john mccain of arizona as the words of someone who 
doesnt know beans from brown bread 
when bush attacked dukakis for a program under which criminals 
are permitted brief furloughs from prisons even convicted 
murderers the dukakis staff was quick to point out that 
california had a similar program under gov ronald reagan 
opinion polls certainly had a role in encouraging southern 
democratic politicians to stand by their certain nominee 
the day dukakis arrived in the region a new survey by 
atlantabased pollster clairborne darden of voters in nine states 
in the region said dukakis was leading bush by a narrow margin of 
45 percent to 42 percent within the polls 3 percent margin of 
error 
but those politicians knew better than to put much faith in 
polls at this stage of a campaign 
they also knew that most of their states have been regularly 
supporting republican presidential candidates for two decades with 
the exception of 1976 when georgian jimmy carter was the democratic 
nominee 
a lot of things can change the campaign mood in the months 
before election day 
dukakis still must deal with jesse jackson find common ground 
on issues without seeming to cave in to the former civil rights 
activist resist demands without alienating black voters who are an 
indispensable part of the democratic coalition 
theres a lot of indecision among blacks said brazile who 
worked with jackson in his 1984 presidential campaign 
people dont know who mike dukakis is she said all they 
know about mike dukakis is he was jesse jacksons competitor and 
hes a democrat and a good democrat 
ba mcdowell a doctor from bessemer stood at the back of the 
crowd and listened to dukakis 
a jackson supporter in the alabama primary mcdowell said he 
thought dukakis needed help in the south the kind of help hed get 
from a southern running mate somebody like gore or sen sam nunn 
of georgia 
the general consensus i think in the black community is 
jesse ought to be offered it the vice presidential nomination 
mcdowell said but the politicians who know how things work say 
if jackson is on the ticket hes going to run all the white folks 
off 
was mcdowell impressed with dukakis 
i think hes all right he said hes the closest thing 
weve got to a winner

sens patrick j leahy and strom thurmond have 
been locked in a partisan snit for months over the pace of 
judgeship confirmations and last week the feud just about reached 
the boiling point 
the two met privately senatortosenator in an anteroom 
outside a committee room as staffers outside the door could hear 
as one described it the decibel level rise 
the trouble began in the opening moments of a hearing for a 
judicial nominee from california when thurmond rsc asked that 
testimony get under way 
leahy a liberal democrat from vermont who was presiding chose 
instead to read his entire singlespaced 10page letter to 
thurmond denying that democrats were stalling president reagans 
court nominees 
it wasnt long before leahys cigar smoke wafted toward 
thurmond whose disdain for smoking is equaled only by his low 
regard for alcohol and liberals thurmond kept waving papers to 
deflect the thickening smoke 
later when thurmond asked witnesses opposing the nominee if 
they belonged to gay or lesbian groups leahy accused his rival of 
mccarthyism 
then as the hearing ended leahy cleared the area of staffers 
and the bluntspeaking former prosecutor from vermont and the 
85yearold former judge from south carolina had their meeting 
sometimes you need conversations that are senator to 
senator leahy said 
but lucky for leahy thurmond didnt resort to the method of 
resolving disputes that he used more than 20 years ago 
in that instance thurmonds opponent was former liberal 
democratic sen ralph yarborough of texas and instead of moving 
behind closed doors the two senators both 61 at the time 
wrestled on the floor outside a senate commerce committee room the 
issue was thurmonds attempt to stall a vote on a director for a 
civil rights panel 
still according to reports at the time the battle that july 
day in 1964 was good tempered with no sharp words exchanged 
before or after 
the feud between thurmond and leahy on the other hand has 
become a very personal affair especially to leahy who accused 
thurmond of hounding him to speed up confirmation hearings even 
while leahys son was hospitalized for surgery 
thurmond for his part denied that theres anything personal 
involved i feel sorry his son was hospitalized he said 
adding he has an obligation as ranking gop committee member to 
represent republicans who believe their court nominees are victims 
of a democratic stall 
leahy countered that most nominees are moving ahead in timely 
fashion but blamed any delays on his partys refusal to rubber 
stamp the presidents candidates and on justice department delays 
in responding to committee information requests 
to complicate matters judiciary committee chairman joseph r 
biden jr ddel has been recuperating at home from two aneurysm 
operations and is unable to act as a peacemaker 
when republicans controlled the senate and thurmond was 
judiciary committee chairman from 198186 biden developed a 
special relationship with the south carolina lawmaker the two like 
each other personally keep the level of animosity low when they 
disagree and often work out compromise legislation on key issues 
while leahy has handled confirmation hearings for the committee 
biden has been heavily involved in judgeship issues he has 
promised that every nominee would receive a fair hearing and a 
vote he likely would have tried to defuse the leahythurmond 
battle 
leahy said in an interview that gop senators who sponsored 
nominees and the candidates themselves have been complimentary 
on the fairness of their hearings 
i told thurmond i cant understand what his motives are in 
constantly raising questions of delay when other senators dont 
see that at all leahy said i said all the people who biden 
promised will get votes will get them 
i asked why he raised questions which he keeps asking over and 
over again he even did so in a week when i had a son in for 
serious surgery i didnt find his answers satisfactory 
thurmond in an interview said he told leahy theres been 
delay after delay i said biden promised to have these judges acted 
on and he leahy was not following that course 
one democratic source knowledgeable about the feud said i 
dont think theres any way to control what two senators do in the 
absence of the chairman 
theres no doubt thurmond would be going to biden and trying 
to work out something but to say biden could have kept this from 
hard feelings is an overstatement 
thurmond has shown an ability to behave as a true southern 
gentleman 
and thurmond decided to play the gentleman last week when asked 
if he resented leahy sending cigar smoke his way 
the wind was blowing that way he said

a study showing that as many as 100000 youths 
skip school daily to play slot machines has prompted the government 
to propose banning children under 16 from arcades a report said 
sunday 
the government will recommend the new law next month when the 
home office releases the study by a psychiatrist who estimates 
that 500000 british children are hooked on the machines the 
sunday times reported 
emanuel moran who conducted the study compared an addiction to 
slot machines to dependencies on alcohol or drugs the report said 
when children find themselves in that situation its a type 
of desperation the report quoted moran as saying 
even if they get over it they have wasted vital years he 
said if you go into the history of people who in adulthood had 
a serious gambling problem large numbers of them started in their 
teens 
moran was quoted as saying that young people addicted to the 
machines steal money from their parents or friends to gamble 
british laws say people under the age of 18 cannot gamble but 
the report said slot machines are available to children in 
amusement arcades railway stations and other public places 
a voluntary industry code says that children under the age of 16 
should not be allowed to enter gaming arcades unless accompanied by 
an adult 
in order to turn the code into law the report said the 
government plans to give local authorities stricter licensing 
powers and create penalties for arcade operators who break the new 
rules 
it quoted alan willis general secretary of the british 
amusement catering trades association as saying his group opposed 
the proposed changes 
we accept there are one or two young people with problems but 
the numbers are small he was quoted as saying 
he said his association was working to tighten its disciplinary 
procedures but felt that the voluntary industry code was effective 
in keeping young children from the arcades

radical students seeking revolutionary 
change are waging a violent struggle in the streets that poses a 
threat to south koreas fragile political stability 
the nation has been hit by a new wave of political violence in 
the past month as the radicals have battled riot police and staged 
firebomb attacks to press for the fall of the government expulsion 
of us troops and unification of the korean peninsula 
down with the military dictatorship yankee go home and 
unite our fatherland protesters have chanted 
radical leaders insist that president roh taewoos government 
is a front for military rule and domination by the united states 
which has 42000 troops stationed in south korea 
the radicals reject recent democratic reforms and say they are 
determined to topple the government and the ruling elite through 
violence 
analysts say the students have little chance of achieving their 
goals 
the radicals account for only about 10 percent of south koreas 
1 million college students 
they have lost support and become isolated as most koreans have 
welcomed recent political reforms and rejected the extremism 
but some analysts say the students are nevertheless an explosive 
and unpredictable factor in a nation with a history of violent and 
uncompromising political confrontation they say the radicals are 
dominating south koreas politics and derailing the political 
process 
this nation is now experiencing a most difficult period we 
have the still very serious problem of college campus unrest 
said rhee chongik a political analyst 
it is deplorable for the government to have become the 
prisoner of activist students said political commentator chong 
unbung 
the radicals come from all social and economic backgrounds 
children of senior officials and military officers join children of 
workers and poor farmers in campus groups that embrace a common 
idealism and anger at government abuses over the years 
the movement is bolstered by antigovernment dissidents and 
intellectuals who for years battled south koreas authoritarian 
governments some unemployed continue radical activity after 
college including many who are blacklisted because of their 
records and are unable to get good jobs 
observers worry about the longterm impact of radicalism since 
many bright and talented students with potentially important roles 
in the countrys future are attracted to the radical ranks 
the radicals who are often vague about their goals say they 
are fighting for the creation of an idealistic society of the 
masses with students workers and peasants uniting to end 
oppression poverty and exploitation radical leaders stress that 
the solution to the nations problems is to destroy the power of 
the military government bureaucracy and major corporations that 
dominate the economy 
we feel in our hearts that something must be done now people 
just talk and the government uses that to continue its rule we 
must act to force change said one leader who refused to be 
named 
the radicals philosophy of forcing change was demonstrated june 
10 when they attempted to march to the border with communist north 
korea to press for reunification of the korean peninsula divided 
since 1945 
the government blocked the march and radicals fiercely battled 
police 
many south koreans who fear the north is determined to conquer 
the south were stunned by the sight of the radicals embracing one 
of the worlds most oppressive regimes 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 to spark the korean war 
the radicals have also stressed antiamericanism accusing the 
united states of controlling south koreas governments and dividing 
the peninsula to rule the south 
protesters have attacked us diplomatic facilities 
government officials and critics accuse the radicals of being 
utopian romantics or communist dupes and say they are 
immature and ignorant about politics and ideology 
officials also worry the radicals will drift toward terrorism 
they point to japans red army and other terrorist groups that 
evolved out of similar radical movements 
but many south koreans have mixed feelings about the students 
because of the countrys long and honorable tradition of student 
activism 
students helped lead the struggle against the japanese colonial 
occupation during the first half of the century the students also 
played a key role in overthrowing the dictatorial regime of former 
president syngman rhee in 1960 and headed opposition to more recent 
authoritarian governments

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee has a simple response to those who insist the war against 
illegal drugs can be won with legislation requiring the military to 
seal us borders against narcotics traffickers 
if you passed it it would be like passing a law saying it 
shall rain two inches in the midwest by sunday morning said sen 
sam nunn dga you can pass it and it makes you feel good but 
its not going to do anything 
the house however passed such legislation just last month as 
part of its defense budget bill for fiscal year 1989 the senate 
also included an antidrug provision in its version of the defense 
bill although it did not go nearly as far as the house 
the senate bill would give the military a greater role in the 
detection and tracking of drug smugglers would allow the use of 
military equipment and personnel in border enforcement and would 
give the navy limited arrest powers outside us waters 
nunn who persuaded the senate two years ago to reject a similar 
house proposal to use the military to seal the borders against drug 
traffickers helped fashion the compromise amendment the senate 
attached to its defense bill 
but in an interview last week nunn said hes still not 
convinced congress should extend arrest powers to the military he 
described his involvement in the development of the senate drug 
interdiction plan as an effort to make some sense out of the bill 
that was inevitably going to pass 
you sort of sense the mood of a body and something was going 
to pass he said the senate of the united states was going to 
shake its fist and say to the people of the country we have dealt 
with the drug problem we have sicked the military on them 
nunn said the chorus of electionyear calls in congress for 
greater military involvement in the antidrug effort is just 
another example of the propensity on capitol hill for proposing 
easy answers to complex problems 
there is no easy answer he said this is a deep societal 
problem and we have to treat it in a multifaceted way with 
education and with health preventive measures and also with law 
enforcement and interdiction 
if you get all the effort on interdiction and you dont do 
anything about cutting down the demand side the drug user is going 
to find some way to get drugs in here he said 
since both houses approved their antidrug amendments to the 
defense bill during floor debate bypassing the normal committee 
process nunn took the unusual step two weeks ago of scheduling 
hearings by his committee on an issue that already had been acted 
on 
the message from most witnesses at those hearings was strikingly 
similar to what nunn has been preaching that past drug 
interdiction efforts havent been effective in slowing the flow of 
drugs into the country and that antidrug efforts should be focused 
more on curbing demand 
the most you can do with interdiction is make the price 
higher nunn said and making the price higher is a worthy goal 
because it cuts down consumption but making the price higher 
doesnt solve the problem 
nunn who now is heading the housesenate conference on the 
defense bill said he hopes the panel will not decide on a major 
increase in drug intediction efforts by the military 
the house proposal to seal the borders he said would cost 3 
billion to 5 billion and likely would do little more than force 
the drug smugglers to shift their operations 
ideally nunn said the militarys role in the drug war should 
be limited to gathering intelligence on the source of illegal 
drugs conducting surveillance of ships and planes suspected of 
carrying drugs and communicating that information to civilian law 
enforcement authorities 
if the military carries out those three tasks effectively he 
said then domestic law enforcement agencies should be able to 
handle the arrests of drug traffickers without any help from the 
military he said

the landmark cipollone cigarette liability 
case boiled down to a few key questions not all of which got 
definitive answers 
the question asked by the cigarette makers was should a company 
really be forced to pay money because a smoker contracted lung 
cancer when she knew people were saying cigarettes were dangerous 
attorneys for rose cipollone who died in 1984 at 58 after four 
decades of smoking put it another way shouldnt the makers of her 
cigarettes just like any other company be held responsible for 
their actions in making a potentially dangerous product 
and the 4month trial which ended a week ago monday with the 
nations first liability finding against the industry posed a 
broader question is the courtroom the place to change public 
policy 
the jury cleared liggett group inc lorillard inc and philip 
morris inc of conspiring to misrepresent the dangers of smoking 
but it granted 400000 to antonio cipollone in finding that 
liggett which made the cigarettes his wife smoked before warning 
labels were put on packs in 1966 violated advertising promises 
that its products were safe 
the jury also partly found against liggett on a failuretowarn 
claim determining the company should have told consumers of 
smokings risks before 1966 that the omission contributed to mrs 
cipollones smoking and that the smoking contributed to her death 
yet the panel said mrs cipollone was mostly responsible for her 
injuries and thus not entitled to damages 
aside from the industrys exoneration on the fraud conspiracy 
claim company lawyers said they essentially won the case because 
the jury found mrs cipollone responsible for her injuries 
supporting the classic industry argument that smokers make an 
independent intelligent choice to smoke 
but cipollones lawyers said the verdict supported the charge 
that smoking causes cancer which the industry denies has been 
proven and that actions by a cigarette maker can be blamed for a 
smokers disease 
industry victory proclamations caused some skepticism in 
antismoking ranks 
to me it seems like the captain of the titanic saying just 
a little ice folks said don davis an austin texas attorney 
whose firm handles cigarette liability cases 
both sides promised an appeal they have until june 29 to file 
posttrial motions with us district judge h lee sarokin with 
oral arguments expected toward the end of july 
antismoking advocates see liability cases as a way of reducing 
the number of smokers raising the price of cigarettes through 
mounting industry legal bills and drumming up public opinion 
against cigarettes but others dont see that as the role of the 
courts 
a jury rules in favor of a plaintiff or defendant but doesnt 
rule on the issue involved said boris yavitz a columbia 
university business school professor with a chair in business 
ethics 
consensus on rules of a society should be reached first through 
public debate and the actions of elected officials and the courts 
should then enforce compliance with what is decided in yavitz 
view 
but the courts have often been put to good use for important 
causes said john f banzhaf a george washington university law 
professor and antismoking activist 
environmental protection and rights for minorities prisoners 
and women have been won and maintained in courtrooms he said 
cigarette liability trials with an individual victim and 
testimony from bereaved family members take the impersonal face 
away from statistics about smokings casualties he adds 
a momentous verdict like in the cipollone case grabs the 
attention of legislators and an antiindustry verdict will spawn 
more filings spreading the industrys legal resources thin and 
creating more opportunity for errors by industry lawyers banzhaf 
contended

the government will allow two hospitals 
to open testtube baby clinics but only married couples can take 
advantage of the procedure officials said sunday

but will ban embryo banks and any fertilizations involving sperm 
from anonymous donors

bahrain said officials hope to establish a clinic at the hospital

under the slogan let toronto shine civic 
leaders and summit organizers launched a cleanup campaign of what 
is already one of the cleanest cities of north america 
but some of their efforts backfired 
faster than crews of industrious workmen could spray and scrape 
graffiti off some 200 buildings groups of university vigilantes 
were spraypainting the surfaces with fresh wall writings 
cancel the summit cancel the cleanup read one gaudily 
painted protest in northeast toronto the work of a political 
science major at the university of toronto 
this city has more graffiti now than ever before not that 
they had very much at all said the student who would only 
identify himself as john if they hadnt called attention to this 
with their cleanup no one would have noticed this graffiti 
but the rest of the 48000 summit spruceup was received with 
approval by local residents 
enterprising residents took advantage of a cleanup hotline set 
up by the city to rid their yards and basements of debris all they 
had to do was call the hot line and complain of an unseemly blemish 
on the summit landscape such as leftover cement or a garbage heap 
in their front yard and a cleanup crew would show up and cart 
away the offending items gratis 
many people just used the opportunity to get rid of things 
they didnt want people figured its free why not said carlo

concrete and glue 
the university of california at berkeley team won the event 
saturday which emphasized design principles canoe maneuverability 
and speed in the water the 15 teams from universities nationwide 
also were judged on design papers and formal presentations about 
their project 
dense concrete was needed to keep water from seeping into the 
canoe some vessels were only a quarterinch thick but weighed more 
than 100 pounds flotation foam was allowed in the bow and stern of 
the canoes the races were up to 600 meters long 
the canoes demonstrated the versatility of the material said 
edd parker of master builders which sponsored the event 
you walk on it every day he said the only thing some 
people feel about concrete is that it cracks and looks ugly

any need parker said its a simple material that can be 
complex in its uses

gov henry bellmon took the first bite of 
the famed okmulgee pecan pie and summed it up in six words 
its very big and very good he said at the citys festival 
saturday 
and while bellmon arguably could be called biased in his 
opinion this was no ordinary pie it measured 24 feet in diameter 
weighed 13000 pounds and contained more than 1100 pounds of 
pecans 
we used the same recipe that weve used for the past two 
years said glenn shoaf baking instructor at the oklahoma state 
university technical branch who supervised about 100 student 
volunteers in baking the pie 
we took it from a smaller scale put it on a computer and just 
increased the ingredients as much as we needed shoaf said 
okmulgee has been swapping winlost records for pecan pie sizes 
with folks in georgia for several years their latest pie appears 
to outdo a recent 22foot effort presented by the sunbelt 
agricultural exposition in moultrie ga 
i understand georgia is talking peanuts shoaf said 
referring to a switch festival organizers have made in their pies 
main ingredient well go after them again if necessary

thousands of journalists brushed up on 
international economics pored over the words of world leaders and 
searched sunday for a new angle on what has become an old story 
the annual economic summit of industrialized democracies 
with the possible exception of royal visits economic summits 
are the most overcovered nonevents on the media calendar wrote 
columnist jeffrey simpson in the toronto globe and mail 
bob asman executive producer of nbc news said the summits 
have become so institutionalized that they tend to be routine 
and routine things arent news 
moreover this years gathering is expected to be low key 
president reagan one of the seven world leaders at the meeting 
is a lameduck with only seven months remaining in his term 
in addition the world economy is showing few trouble signs 
only a possible dispute over the unglamorous question of 
agricultural subsidies threatens to mar the event the united 
states has proposed eliminating all agricultural subsidies by the 
year 2000 a suggestion that has raised the ire of europeans whose 
farmers are heavily subsidized 
yet summit organizers say nearly 3000 reporters editors 
technicians producers cameramen and others falling into the 
media category have been accredited to the gathering 
canadian reporters keeping tabs on their countrys performance 
as host of the 14th meeting account for about half the media crowd 
according to summit spokeswoman joan walters 
the united states has sent about 400 journalists and japan 212 
in all some fourdozen countries are represented by journalists 
working at computer terminals typewriters and sound booths 
spanning the length of 2 football fields in the metropolitan 
toronto convention center 
why the media crush 
we expect the amount of real hard news to be minimal but you 
never can tell said asman when the leaders of the free world 
nations gather you must be prepared to cover 
jeff goldman associate producer of pbs macneillehrer news 
hour agreed saying you cant ignore it certainly 
but does he expect much news from the event i dont think 
so he replied laughing i think its going to be more 
ceremonial than substantive this time 
but for susan zirinsky senior producer for cbs news and a 
veteran of about a halfdozen summits the gatherings are never 
boring 
they take on a life of their own its the nature of the 
beast she said i dont think ive ever been to a summit that 
i can say was dull theres always something she said 
but some news organizations have scaled down their coverage 
compared to past gatherings which rotate among the united states 
france italy japan canada great britain and germany 
the size of the effort here is smaller than it has been in 
other summits said michael g duffy senior producer for special 
events of abc news 
coverage has been reduced he said because of the limited 
amount of news expected from the summit 
moreover he noted it comes just weeks after the ussoviet 
summit in moscow which attracted about 5000 journalists 
unlike the moscow summit none of the principal anchormen for 
the major us television evening newscasts plans to broadcast his 
program from toronto 
the networks will carry coverage of the summit in their news 
programs but not to the extent of the historic meeting between 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev that reunion prompted 
widespread coverage of the soviet union a country still seen as a 
threat and an enigma by many americans 
duffy said the more limited coverage of the toronto gathering 
gives news organizations an opportunity to cover the economic 
summit a little more economically 
ms zirinsky described cbs effort as money conscious 
japanese journalists though appear to be pulling out all the 
stops 
hidetoshi fujisawa a washington correspondent for the leading 
japanese tv network nhk described their reporting as very very 
heavy maybe the biggest coverage among broadcasters 
japanese viewers he said are interested in learning how their 
country is perceived by the other leaders because of criticism in 
recent years of the nations enormous trade surplus 
how japan is seen in this summit he said is very very 
important 
we cover much heavier than the united states because we 
have the hours to cover and japanese people are very interested 
in international affairs he said 
but to simpson whose column ran in saturdays editions of the 
globe and mail summits represent the classic manifestation of a 
sensible idea gone wild put simply the media attention stands 
in inverse relation to the events importance

a bomb planted by sikh extremists 
exploded sunday in a crowd of people gathered outside an 
electronics shop to watch a popular hindu epic on television 
police said fifteen people died and 25 were wounded 
the bomb was hidden in a cloth bag and left among the mainly 
poor hindu laborers who were watching the program officers said 
the bomb apparently was detonated by remote control 
shortly after the bombing in kurukshetra in haryana state sikh 
radicals assassinated the head of a militant hindu group in 
neighboring punjab state the hindu leaders bodyguard and an aide 
also were killed 
in other violence in punjab sikh extremists shot and killed 
three police officers late saturday police said they also were 
blamed for the death sunday of a sikh farmer in central punjab 
a full alert was ordered in six states and in new delhi indias 
capital 
the bomb exploded a few minutes after the start of ramayana 
a popular weekly television serial the story recounts adventures 
of the hindu god lord rama and some radical sikhs had warned 
people not to watch it 
sikhs are a religious minority in india and claim discrimination 
by the majority hindus 
i had come to the market to buy food and then i realized it 
was time for ramayana said ram pal a 42yearold civil 
servant from his hospital bed 
i stopped outside the television shop suddenly there was an 
explosion i was hurled off my feet said pal whose left arm was 
cut by shrapnel 
the blast shattered glass cases inside the shop and started a 
stampede among the 150 people near the store 
blood and pieces of bodies covered the lane outside the shop 
police said bodies of 11 people could not be identified four 
others died on their way to a hospital 
police blamed the bombing on sikh extremists they said the 
explosive was left outside the shop 
authorities closed roads around the city of 500000 about 90 
miles north of new delhi but reported no arrests 
it was the second bombing attack by sikh extremists outside 
punjab in less than a month

the killings raised to more than 1325 the number of people 
killed in punjab by sikh extremists since jan 1 militants have 
been blamed for at least 42 more deaths in adjoining himachal 
pradesh and haryana states 
the sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war for an 
independent homeland in punjab since 1982 
sikhs religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam 
most of the extremists victims have been hindus or moderate 
sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign 
sikhs make up less than 2 percent of indias 800 million people 
but are a majority in punjab

a combination of national politics and capitol 
hill ill will ensures that house speaker jim wright wont soon 
shake the ethics allegations against him even if he proves his 
claim that he violated no rules 
wright wants the house ethics committee which announced it is 
examining six possible violations of house rules by the texas 
democrat to quickly dispose of the case 
but the committee is under pressure from republicans to hire 
outside counsel even though it is the only panel in the house 
where republicans hold the same number of votes as democrats 
sources familiar with the panels thinking say the case against 
wright is not considered strong but members are determined to 
avoid charges of a whitewash if an outside counsel is brought 
in the earliest a finding could be made would be september said 
one source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
even without an outside counsel at the minimum wright will 
remain under a cloud until after the democratic national convention 
next month in atlanta where wright is scheduled to serve as 
chairman 
and many republicans have made it clear they wont accept a 
finding of innocent if it comes because it was the democrats 
who wrote the current house rules and the loopholes that wright has 
taken advantage of 
power corrupts in my estimation and they the democrats are 
corrupt said rep barbara vucanovich rnev chairman of the 
republican study committee a group of house conservatives that 
this week called for an outside counsel 
although wright might proclaim he didnt violate any rules she 
said if he doesnt think its unethical i think he needs a 
course in ethics 
i dont think this blows over until after the november 
general election said rep beryl anthony dark citing the gop 
need to use wright to counter the charges of sleaze against the 
reagan administration 
house democrats have long made hay of the administrations 
ethical lapses with the house civil service subcommittee compiling 
a list of 242 officials implicated through march 30 some have been 
cleared but many have been convicted or resigned 
as a result republicans need to smear wright as much as 
possible anthony said outside of nailing the speakers hide on 
the wall theyre not going to be satisfied with anything he 
said 
however there is division among republican ranks over how far 
that campaign should go 
rep newt gingrich rga whose complaint launched the ethics 
probe against the speaker and others of the far right wing of the 
party have included attacks on the backgrounds of some of wrights 
employees 
the speakers top legislative aide john mack served two years 
in prison after pleading guilty 15 years ago to malicious wounding 
wright hired mack now 34 as a clerk at the urging of the 
speakers daughter after mack was put on a work release program 
mack is wrights daughters brotherinlaw 
also named in the attacks by republicans was a press aide and 
speech writer for wright george mair who once published a 
collection of excerpts from sex books 
peter flaherty chairman of citizens for reagan recently sent 
wright a letter with copies to the press calling for the speaker 
to fire the two men mr speaker your office is the epitome of 
sleaze the letter concluded 
johanna schneider spokeswoman for house republican leader bob 
michel of illinois said the attacks on wrights staff were coming 
from a tiny segment 
mack she said was well liked and i dont think anybody wants 
to make an issue of that at all but she said house republicans 
are united in their impatience with wrights legislative tactics 
which the speaker himself concedes are heavy handed 
the ethics case against wright timed to coincide with the 
presidential election campaign gives house republicans the 
opportunity to air their beefs nationally 
it puts a focal point on the fact that the democrats control 
the house and theyre doing a lousy job of it says steve 
lotterer spokesman for the republican national congressional 
committee which supports gop house campaigns gop challengers will 
point out that democratic house incumbents voted for wright for 
speaker 
jim wright is going to have a great deal of visibility as 
chairman of the convention he said it think it has risen to 
the point where people on main street know that jim wright has been 
engaged in some very questionable activities 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the likely democratic 
presidential nominee apparently has not yet asked wright to step 
aside 
i thought there was a presumption of innocence in this 
country he said last week when asked about the case 
the ethics committee has said publicly it is looking at a half 
dozen accusations 
those include whether wright is accused of improperly lobbying 
federal and foreign officials on behalf of texas oil companies with 
which he might have had a financial relationship the panel is also 
looking at whether he used undue pressure on federal authorities on 
behalf of texas banks 
wrights use of a friends fort worth condominium as his home 
while paying for the days he stayed there but no monthly rent is 
also under scrutiny 
but its the speakers book deal thats received the most 
publicity 
wright in 1984 had a collection of his remarks and writings 
printed by a texas friend who had also done more than half a 
million dollars of work on wrights campaigns 
the deal gave wright 55 percent of the royalties from the 595 
paperback when it wasnt sold through bookstores which accounts 
for most of the sales from the 20000 copies 
the arrangement gave wright 55000 in extra income beyond the 
regular limits in the house rules because book royalties are 
exempt many of the books were sold in bulk to political supporters 
of the speaker raising questions as to whether the book was merely 
a vehicle to steer around the limits that apply to speech honoraria 
and other methods of giving wright money 
while democrats concede the rules may need to be tightened 
there appears to be a rising anger at the republican attacks on the 
speaker 
there are house democrats who really believe this is wholesale 
partisanship of the worst variety and they are genuinely angry at 
gingrich and those who support him rep pat williams dmont 
said adding that he expects to see attempts at retribution 
wright himself has said he feels toward gingrich as a fire 
hydrant feels toward a dog 
republicans say wrights power may also be responsible for the 
lack of defection by democrats 
you dont want to be the one two years from now who didnt 
stand by the speaker if the speaker survives until then 
schneider said

a storm blew through leninakan in 
soviet armenia on a monday evening briefly dispersing the throngs 
of people who had gathered in theater square in the city center 
local estimates put the crowd which easily filled the 
treelined square at 50000 certainly there were many thousands 
on an ordinary night a few old men would have collected at the 
heart of the 2400yearold city to play checkers and drink the 
famed local cognac but this night was different 
it was june 13 the first day of a general strike to press 
demands for resolution of a territorial dispute groups of 
armenians wandered up and down kalinin street dropped by theater 
square to hear speeches and mingled with friends 
the citys center was closed to traffic several hundred 
policemen were on hand to maintain order they listened to the 
proceedings and politely directed motorists to side streets 
since late may crowds had gathered nightly on theater square 
and in many armenian cities to protest the 15year prison term 
given an azerbaijani convicted of killing armenians in ethnic 
riots armenians didnt think the sentence was harsh enough 
at least 32 people most of them armenians died in three days 
of rioting in the azerbaijani city of sumgait 
the strike was called by the karabakh committee a group that 
coordinates armenias popular protests protesters seek annexation 
of nagornokarabakh an armeniandominated region that has been 
attached to the republic of azerbaijan since 1923 
the stoppage was nearly total in leninakan a city of more than 
170000 a torrential downpour interrupted the flow of speeches in 
theater square but only briefly within 15 minutes speakers 
resumed calls for aid to the victims of the sumgait riots and urged 
unification of nagornokarabakh and armenia 
placards included official portraits of soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
armenia and nagornokarabakh are one proclaimed one red 
banner in armenian script 
were very angry that people in moscow are saying were 
hooligans said tigran a social worker who had not been to work 
that day he and others interviewed requested only their first 
names be used 
why dont they show this on television he asked were 
very peaceful people if theyd just give us nagornokarabach 
they wouldnt hear another word from us 
workers factory managers athletes sumgait refugees and others 
addressed the crowd 
it is important that we stay organized a man named gevork 
who identified himself as a manager of a local factory told the 
crowd 
we must do everything we can to help the victims of the 
massacre at sumgait he said the audience applauded but a 
heckler shouted why dont you make one of your dachas available 
to them 
those close enough to hear laughed a dacha is a summer home 
official figures published wednesday in the armenian newspaper 
kommunist say 2527 armenians have been resettled after leaving 
sumgait the communist party first secretary in armenia sg 
arutunyan told the republics supreme soviet that 86 families are 
still homeless 
the general strike nearly shut down leninakan for three days 
despite official appeals for people to return to work 
but authorities acted to protect the demonstrators 
when a few dozen protesters set out on foot for yerevan the 
armenian capital 40 miles away police provided an official escort 
elsewhere some office workers took advantage of the general 
strike to go into the mountains for a picnic 
in armenia the cognac flows in rivers explained viken a 
fireman who was roasting a slaughtered lamb over an open fire with 
friends you dip your bottle in and fill it up 
but when talk turned to nagornokarabakh the picnickers grew 
serious azerbaijanis are turks said levon a local party 
official theyre muslims and were christians weve been 
fighting each other for centuries stalin was wrong to put 
nagornokarabach under their control 
josef stalin was in charge of the nationalities policy when the 
republics boundaries were drawn 
on wednesday news spread swiftly of the armenian supreme 
soviets decision to petition moscow to put nagornokarabach under 
armenian control 
this is very good news said agonye a local bureaucrat 
they wouldnt have taken a decision like that without moscows 
approval 
wednesday night after the armenian government announcement 
theater square was quiet hundreds of cigarette butts strewn across 
the square were the only reminder of the recent days events 
but friday the azerbaijani supreme soviet announced it would 
oppose any move to take away nagornokarabakh the dispute is not 
over yet

pope john paul ii canonized 117 martyrs from 
vietnam on sunday in an event that drew thousands of vietnamese 
refugees from around the world and irked that countrys communist 
authorities 
the hanoi government had said that it wasnt against the 
canonization the largest in roman catholic history but it 
charged that vietnamese emigrants seized on the occasion to make 
anticommunist declarations 
an estimated 8000 vietnamese some of them boat people who 
fled vietnam since 1975 were among the 20000 people who attended 
the canonization mass in st peters square 
they later staged reunions in nearby restaurants or ate rice 
vegetables and grilled chicken from campers parked within the 
vaticans ancient walls 
the pope said he felt profoundly and particularly close to 
the estimated 35 million to 53 million catholics in predominantly 
buddhist vietnam 
we can say that the blood of martyrs is for you christians of 
vietnam a source of grace to progress in the faith the pope 
said during the noon angelus prayer following the mass 
the vietnamese were enthusiastic but orderly joining in the 
celebration without any apparent display of political sentiment 
its very special its great said tuan nguyen 14 who 
left vietnam eight years ago and now lives in kristiansand norway 
a chartered bus brought him and two brothers a sister and his 
mother to the vatican charters brought many of the vietnamese from 
their new homelands 
among those made saints were eight bishops 50 priests and 59 
lay people including the mother of six children 
the 96 native vietnamese 11 spanish and 10 frenchmen were 
killed for their faith in the southeast asian land in the 18th and 
19th centuries 
radio hanoi vietnams state radio reported thursday that a 
vietnamese bishop told roman catholics in his diocese not to 
celebrate the canonization of the martyrs after officials told him 
they were displeased with the ceremony 
it said bishop huynh dong cat wrote a letter to priests and lay 
followers also noting that before the communists defeated south 
vietnam and reunited the country in 1975 june 19 had been a day 
that honored the south vietnamese army 
the vatican has said the date was a coincidence 
since the 1975 communist victory the vatican has had no formal 
ties with vietnam 
the communist authorities had taken steps toward reconciliation 
with the countrys christian minorities until announcement of the 
planned canonization strained informal relations 
the pope who spoke briefly in vietnamese to welcome the crowd 
alluded to the problems of the church in vietnam and the delicacy 
of its relations with the government 
during the noon prayer the pope spoke of a sanctuary to the 
virgin mary of lavang which was burned during christian 
prosecution in the 19th century rebuilt in 1901 and reduced to 
rubble during this centurys battles 
nevertheless pilgrims today still gather around it despite 
difficulties to pray to invigorate their faith the pope said 
after saying he hoped that the sanctuary would be rebuilt soon 
in a spirit of freedom and peace the pope expressed a wish for 
national unity as well as the true civil and moral progress of 
the country 
the vatican said 130000 vietnamese have died for their faith 
since christianity arrived in the late 16th century 
in 1954 hundreds of thousands of catholics fled south after the 
country was divided into a noncommunist south and communist north 
the vietnamese church with its martyrs and by means of its 
testimony has been able to proclaim its will and its commitment 
not to reject the cultural tradition and the legal institutions of 
the country the pope said in his homily which was delivered in 
french and spanish 
on the contrary it has declared and demonstated that it wants 
to incorporate it in itself contributing with faithfulness to the 
genuine building of the country he said

the heroic 16day defense of this coral 
atoll in december 1941 by a small force of soldiers and civilians 
inspired a united states suddenly plunged into war 
remember wake island became a rallying cry for a nation 
wounded by pearl harbor 
after nearly four years in japanese prison camps the military 
survivors came home to tickertape parades almost as soon as the 
war ended a memorial to the 449 marine defenders was erected on 
wake 
but it took 47 years for the government to memorialize the 
civilians who fought and died with the military and desperately 
staved off a japanese invasion that began hours after the attack on 
pearl harbor 2200 miles to the east 
on thursday 42 civilian and 14 military defenders and more than 
100 others gathered here for the dedication of a monument to the 
civilians the rectangular monument of dark marble consists of 
engravings of heavy equipment and a plaque that tells the story of 
the civilians 
us rep ron packard rcalif whose father was among the 
captured and imprisoned civilian workers read congratulatory 
letters from president reagan and vice president george bush 
packard who for the last three years helped the survivors wage 
their struggle for recognition said what they wanted seemed 
pretty simple but i must say the government threw up roadblock 
after roadblock 
seventy civilians died during the siege more than 30 perished 
in prison camps and 98 civilians kept on the island as slave 
laborers were machinegunned to death in retaliation for an 
american air strike 
the onslaught began dec 8 1941 the attack on pearl harbor 
occurred only hours before the assault on wake but wake is west of 
the international dateline and it was a day later here 
the siege ended 16 days later with the surrender of 523 military 
personnel 449 marines 68 sailors and six army air corps members 
and 1150 civilian workers on the three small islets known as 
wake island 
more than 1000 japanese died during the battle and 2000 more 
later perished of starvation or sickness in 1957 japan air lines 
helped pay for a simple monument a few hundred feet away from the 
marine memorial asking that peace prevail on the waters of the 
pacific forever 
throughout the years the civilians were ignored 
when we started asking for veterans benefits the government 
wanted to know exactly what we did said walt moser 71 who 
lives in fremont calif sure the military guys did the main 
fighting but we passed the ammunition and patrolled the beaches 
and moved the antiaircraft guns at night 
we sandbagged and dug revetments and buried the dead we 
really did help we werent all just hiding out there under the 
brush 
in 1981 40 years after the siege the civilians were deemed 
eligible for veterans benefits 
for years the sole memorial to the civilians on the island was 
one they created themselves a large coral boulder painstakingly 
handcarved in may 1943 with the initials of the 98 men left as 
slave labor on wake after their comrades became pows in japan and 
shanghai five months later the 98 were massacred 
in 1985 a group of civilian survivors returned to the island to 
confront their memories compare experiences and renew old 
friendships they were joined by about 40 soldiers who had also 
surrendered here 
we had 98 men out here who were butchered and nobody cared 
said bill taylor a 71yearold retired contractor from provo 
utah there was nothing out here nothing at all it was really 
an injustice 
the civilians asked for help from the air force which maintains 
the island mainly as a refueling stop the air force gave them some 
concrete and the men poured a onefootsquare slab stuck on a few 
pieces of coral and inscribed civilian workers of wake 
122341 they left before the makeshift memorial was dry 
it just really bothered me and it kept bothering me taylor 
said i wanted to do something but i knew we were just a bunch 
of old guys with no clout not that much money and not a whole lot 
of organization 
taylor then found packard whose father was a civilian helping 
to build air strips and military facilities on wake when he was 
captured 
i remember what it was like not knowing if our father was 
alive or dead said packard 57 wake island was a significant 
part of our own family history and i wanted to help these 
survivors if i could 
packard helped get the memorial approved and persuaded the air 
force to help install and maintain it the survivors paid the 
4700 cost with help from idahobased morrison knudson 
construction co one of the main companies in the consortium of 
firms that contracted for the construction work 
the memorial stands between the one for the marines and the one 
for the japanese 
on thursday the rev joe mcdonald iii a catholic priest and 
the son of a civilian captured on wake asked the survivors to 
forgive not only the japanese but also the bureaucracy that 
thwarted them for so long

about 50 youngsters from a fundamentalist 
christian boarding home shut down earlier this month are missing 
and officials blame mississippis exempting such homes from 
licensing for the almost impossible task of finding the youths 
we started out with an unknown number of children and were 
still left with an unknown number of children state welfare 
commissioner thomas brittain said as youth court proceedings wound 
down for the 72 children taken into custody from the bethel home 
for children in lucedale 
the homes operator the rev herman fountain refused to tell 
state officials how many children he boarded although the court 
ordered him to provide a list fountain says the constitutional 
separation of church and state exempts him from state regulation 
you cant investigate in a reasonable manner unless you have 
someones name and something about where they came from and so 
forth brittain said 
fountain told reporters that he had about 120 children living at 
his 28acre independent baptist compound with 72 in state custody 
that leaves about 50 unaccounted for 
youth court judge robert oswald ordered the state welfare 
department on june 10 to take custody of the homes children 
ranging in age from 10 to 17 oswald ruled they were subjected to 
physical abuse medical neglect and detention amounting to 
imprisonment 
most of the children taken into custody were found roaming the 
streets of lucedale they reportedly were told to flee the home 
minutes after oswalds order and before state welfare officials 
arrived 
about 50 of those taken into custody were returned to their 
parents who in most cases were required to sign an agreement that 
they wouldnt be returned to bethel brittain said 
parents of 13 of the children were refused custody because of 
reports of child abuse before their children came to bethel he 
said 
many supporters claim action was taken against bethel to 
pressure the legislature into passing licensing laws 
brittain denies that absolutely not we went into bethel 
because we had repeated reports of runaways and abuse 
if this in fact helps lead to licensure wed be happy about 
it 
mississippi is among six states which exempt religious boarding 
homes from licensing said jake terpstra licensing specialist with 
the us childrens bureau of the department of health and human 
services in washington 
others are louisiana north carolina south carolina and 
missouri he said adding that florida requires registration but 
not licensing 
about 20 unlicensed religious homes are discovered around the 
nation each year in the 44 states requiring licensing said betsy 
rosenbaum project manager of the washingtonbased american public 
welfare association a national organization of child welfare 
administrators and agencies 
most states have had to deal with this terpstra said of the 
oversight problem 
every state supreme court that has considered the issue has 
ruled in the states favor terpstra said 
nela hughes licensing specialist for mississippi says there 
are 28 licensed residential childcare facilities in the state she 
estimates there are at least that same number of unlicensed 
facilities 
some of the unlicensed facilities could be nonreligious she 
said because there is no penalty for failing to comply with 
licensing regulations 
licensed childcare facilities must provide information about 
administrators and the children in their custody and must have 
written discipline and punishment policies she said 
this department does not recommend corporal punishment but 
there is no way we can prohibit it she said adding the law 
forbids cruel and inhumane punishment 
brittain said the welfare department has lobbied for licensing 
reform 
hattiesburg attorney dan wise a youth court judge who heard a 
similar case two years ago involving the nowdefunct bethesda home 
for girls in forrest county this week blamed legislators 
the members of the legislature who have obstructed passage of 
regulations of 24hour childcare homes by their unwillingness to 
face up to and deal with a serious problem have caused the state of 
mississippi and mainstream religious homes to suffer yet another 
black eye wise said 
paul nunnery executive director of the mississippi baptist 
conventions baptist childrens village in jackson said his 
facility has voluntarily submitted to state licensing even though 
it is exempt 
we are southern baptists and believe in the separation of 
church and state we have not found that state licensing of our 
childrens home has interfered in the least with the practice or 
tenets of our faith he said

hundreds of raucous english 
soccer fans have left town after three nights of trashing taverns 
breaking windows and waging drunken street brawls with fans from 
other countries police said sunday 
authorities in munich meanwhile said a group of west germans 
who incited some of the violence were part of an organized gang 
that travels to major events to cause trouble 
more than 800 people were arrested in six west german cities 
since the european soccer championships began on june 10 
but officials said many of the english fans returned to britain 
after their team was eliminated with a 31 loss saturday to the 
soviet union 
there are no rowdies in the streets theyve left the city 
frankfurt police spokesman axel dorff told the associated press 
the hardcore english troublemakers were estimated to number 300 to 
400 
british fans broke up taverns attacked patrons and chanted 
god save the queen as they roamed through the streets of the 
sachsenhausen district and near the train station 
english fans attacked two motorists stopped at red lights and 
forced many city residents to stay away from areas where clashes 
with fans of other teams were taking place 
intoxicated british and german soccer fans roamed the area near 
the citys main train station overnight following the soviet 
unions win 
drunken soccer fans started tearing up two bars at around 
midnight but police quickly arrived and restored peace officials 
said 
rowdies tore out a beer tap in one of the bars the bartender 
turned off the lights and called the police said another 
frankfurt police spokesman kurt kraus 
police picked up 76 british and 22 german rowdies overnight but 
most had been freed kraus said sunday 
about 200 people most of them english were arrested during 
three nights of disturbances in frankfurt 
earlier the english fans had left behind a trail of arrests and 
broken beer bottles in stuttgart cologne and duesseldorf the body 
of an irish fan was fished from the main river in frankfurt on 
thursday night police said he apparently drowned while intoxicated 
while most of the attention was focused on the english 
authorities also pointed the finger at west germans including 16 
rightwing extremists arrested saturday in frankfurt 
on sunday munich police said an organized horde of several 
hundred traveling thugs from three west german cities has also 
been going from match to match instigating violence 
these thugs seek out important events only for the purpose of 
causing trouble said munich police spokesman georg 
schratzenstaller 
schratzenstaller said the traveling groups of west german 
troublemakers were mostly from cologne nuremberg and gelsenkirchen 
a total of 120 rowdies were arrested in munich on friday and 
many belonged to that group schratzenstaller said 
the next round in the european soccer championships is slated 
for tuesday in hamburg west germany plays the netherlands in a 
semifinal match 
the violence by english fans already has prompted england to 
withdraw its application for readmission to european club soccer 
tournaments next season 
english clubs were banned after the 1985 heysel stadium tragedy 
in belgium in which 39 people most of them italians were killed 
in violence sparked by english soccer fans

secretary of state george p shultz on sunday 
labeled nicaragua a rotten apple in the barrel of emerging 
central american democracies and said neighboring countries must 
help the united states get them into this fold 
describing the central american mission he will embark upon late 
this month shultz said that im going to carry the us message 
of what our objectives are and our program and ideas for getting 
there 
in an interview on nbctvs meet the press the secretary 
said that he thought the reagan administrations doctrine of 
pushing democracy freedom and economic development in the region 
had been mostly successful and he cited changes in costa rica el 
salvador guatemala and honduras 
but when asked directly to name his no 1 foreign policy 
disappointment shultz pointed to the continuing rule of nicaragua 
by the marxist sandinista government headed by president daniel 
ortega 
in spite of the fact that weve made great strides there 
central america the fact is we still have this bad rotten 
apple in the barrel in the form of nicaragua he said 
shultz described the continuance in power of panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega as a gnawing problem but predicted anew 
that noriega will not surmount pressure to step aside 
the secretary of state refused to be drawn into lengthy 
questioning about the administrations options for getting new 
assistance to the contra rebels saying no decisions had been made 
on that matter administration officials have acknowledged that it 
would be very difficult to win congressional approval of direct 
us military aid to the rebels notwithstanding the failure of the 
contra peace talks with the sandinistas 
the state department announced on saturday that shultz would 
travel to central america on june 29july 1 for talks on the 
collapse of the peace negotiations veteran diplomat max kampelman 
who has been instrumental in ussoviet arms negotiations has 
been holding talks in the region 
shultz maintained in the nbc interview that administration 
policy in central america has been largely successful 
the odd man out is nicaragua its the rotten apple in the 
barrel he said and somehow or other nicaragua has got to be 
brought into this fold thats a problem and we want to somehow 
through some combination of pressure thats generated internally to 
nicaragua to get them into the fold 
the situation in nicaragua is really lousy both from the 
standpoint of the suppression repression and from the standpoint 
of the absolute terrible situation of their economy shultz said

cambodias premier said antigovernment 
rebels are losing strength and he pledged to resist their demands 
for a new regime 
however premier hun sen said in an interview seen sunday in 
bangkok that the army faces a great challenge as vietnam pulls out 
its troops which had bolstered his government 
the official also played down fears of a takeover by khmer rouge 
guerrillas the strongest rebel force opposing the government that 
vietnam installed after invading in late 1978 
hun sens declarations came as his government the three 
guerrilla factions vietnam and other nations prepared to attend 
unprecedented peace talks in jakarta indonesia in july 
the makeup of a new government was a key point of contention 
that led to the breakoff in previous talks between hun sen and 
prince norodom sihanouk head of the resistance coalition 
hun sen made no reference to the jakarta talks but said if a 
political solution could be achieved the main thing we must strive 
for is to safeguard the gains of the revolution we are not so 
naive or venturesome as to seek a solution which might lead to the 
abolishment of the regime and state of the peoples republic of 
kampuchea or cambodia 
the premier was interviewed by vietnams all peoples national 
review a text was carried by an official vietnam news agency 
report dated saturday 
on vietnams planned withdrawal of 50000 troops this year hun 
sen said no doubt this is a big trial for the kampuchean army 
and people 
but he said his forces were gaining strength faster than the 
largest guerrilla force the khmer rouge diplomats are skeptical 
of that claim 
we may liken the situation to a shortdistance race between us 
and the enemy he said we have outpaced them by 10 yards and 
as of now we continue to push on a higher speed so how can they 
overtake us 
vietnams pullout starting this month and its pledge to 
totally withdraw by 1990 have renewed concern about the return of 
the chinesebacked communist khmer rouge which killed hundreds of 
thousands of people and attacked the vietnamese and thai borders 
before hanoi ousted the group from phnom penh 
vietnam is believed to have already withdrawn some troops 
some diplomats say the khmer rouge has been avoiding direct 
clashes to store arms and establish bases for an allout offensive 
in 1990 
but hun sen said in our view the present low level of enemy 
actions does not stem from as others believe their intention to 
keep their force in waiting for the opportunity but actually from 
their dwindling strength

than we have today stone told a meeting of associated 
pressaffiliated radio and television reporters 
with two weeks left in the julyjune precipitation measuring 
period western nevada is on the verge of being the driest its 
ever been for that 12 months since records began at the end of the 
civil war state climatologist john james said 
western nevada is dependent on the spring and summer meltoff 
from winters snowpack in the sierra nevada which also supplies 
much of californias water reserve but that snowpack was half of 
normal this past winter for the second straight year and stone 
said water reserves in lake tahoe and other reservoirs are near an 
end 
by the end of august lahontan will be empty that will end 
any irrigation below lahontan he said the vast majority of 
irrigation above lahontan will end in the next three weeks 
lahontan reservoir about 35 miles east of reno is a narrow 
20milelong lake in the heart of one of nevadas few agricultural 
areas and a prime destination for boating swimming and fishing in 
this arid region 
stone said the truckee which runs out of lake tahoe to supply 
the reno area is flowing at just under 500 cubic feet per second 
by oct 1 that flow will be down to 50 cfs stone said 
while westpac utilities which supplies water to the renosparks 
area has first dibs on that dribble bob firth the utilitys 
manager for water resources said the company will have to turn to 
limited storage in donner and independence lakes just west of the 
californianevada state line and to its wells 
i think well make it through but if we have a third winter 
with less than 70 percent of our average snowfall well have major 
problems he said 
stone said he expected to be able to maintain the current flow 
in the truckee river through the end of july but it will drop 
off dramatically after that 
by the first week in august most of the irrigation ditches in 
the truckee meadows will be off he said 
lake tahoe currently is just 155 feet above its natural rim 
when it falls below that federally mandated minimum level around 
oct 1 stone will have nothing left to tap for the truckee 
meadows which encompasses the renosparks area 
the region has received 313 inches of rain and snow since july 
1 compared to 315 inches for the same period in 188283 the 
previous driest julyjune in the past 118 years james said the

a soviet jurist called sunday for strong new laws 
to protect citizens rights while the soviet union evolves into a 
more open society under mikhail s gorbachev 
a system of laws and judicial mechanisms should regulate 
citizens access to statistics and archives guarantee open 
information on changes in political leadership and state what can 
be published legal scholar yuri baturin said 
in material published in the communist party newspaper pravda 
baturin said new laws will have to make up for the soviet unions 
lack of experience in guaranteeing citizens rights 
publication in pravda indicated there was some highranking 
support for baturins ideas 
with the background of our current political culture and as a 
temporary measure this kind of law is necessary he said in 
20 or 30 years if todays political tendencies dont change the 
need for them will be gone 
the soviet constitution theoretically guarantees broad citizens 
rights but they often are ignored by communist party and 
government officials 
both the czarist governments of the early 19th century and 
todays soviet government have censorship but the czarist 
governments openly published what the law was baturin said 
in contast it is almost impossible to mention in print our 
glavlit the agency that decides questions of censorship he said 
the soviet academy of sciences institute of state and law has 
presented to the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys top 
executive body a law fixing not only the basic rights and 
freedoms of citizens and their associations touching glasnost but 
the corresponding obligations of responsible officials and state 
organs he said 
glasnost is gorbachevs effort to allow freer flow of 
information and greater criticism on selected topics 
in the past year the presidium has made no decision on the 
institutes proposal 
laws and judicial procedures should guarantee access to 
archives statistics and ensure that citizens are given full 
information about the appointment and firing of officials baturin 
said 
eleven years since a constitutional article permitted 
referendums on important national questions a similar law is not 
in force a law regulating the mass media has been debated for many 
years not openly but in the corridors baturin said 
a program adopted by the partys policymaking central committee 
for a party conference that begins june 28 bluntly tells communist 
party members that they must obey the constitution and the laws of 
the soviet union

an almost spiritual meeting between 
vietnam veterans and actress jane fonda who angered them by 
traveling to north vietnam has changed some feelings and led the 
local vfw commander to take down an antifonda poster 
fonda met privately for 3 hours saturday night with about 25 
veterans from connecticut and massachusetts where her plans to 
film part of a movie this summer have been met with vigorous 
protests by some veterans 
the meeting came a day after she apologized on national 
television for hurting veterans with some of her antiwar 
activities including posing for photos on a north vietnamese 
antiaircraft gun during a trip to hanoi in 1972 and saying 
prisoners of war were lying about having been tortured 
there seemed to be a genuine bonding between jane fonda and 
the vietnam veterans who were present said brian powell a 
naugatuck mailman who served in vietnam in 196970 there was 
finally some clarity about her feelings about why she did what she 
did why she went to hanoi 
powell 37 said fonda told the veterans that in her antiwar 
passion she did some things that were very stupid and very hurtful 
to vietnam veterans 
the atmosphere at the meeting was almost spiritual in 
nature powell said adding that fondas message was that she 
was not antiveteran she was antiwar 
fonda said in a statement issued sunday by her spokesman steve 
rivers that she had wanted to meet with local veterans since 
january when protests heated up over her plans to film union 
street in waterbury next door to naugatuck and holyoke mass 
ive met with vietnam veterans many times over the years and 
ive learned from that experience the importance of doing away with 
preconceptions and stereotypes fonda said that opens the way 
for the healing process 
i thought it was a very good meeting we were totally honest 
with each other and i think we learned a lot about each other it 
was a very moving experience and i hope a helpful one for all of 
us 
the meeting was set up by rivers powell veterans of foreign 
wars post 1946 commander robert l genovese and the rev john 
mccolley rector of st michaels episcopal church and also a 
vietnam veteran it was held at st michaels 
james sparrow executive director of vietnam veterans agent 
orange victims in stamford said fonda apologized a hundred 
times while the veterans listened then the veterans asked 
questions 
genovese said that after the meeting he had a sign promoting 
sale of antifonda bumper stickers and a poster featuring a 
caricature of the actress taken down in the vfw hall to go along 
with the spirit of the evening 
everybody learned a lot from everybody else im not 
completely convinced but we both have a little better 
understanding about each other now said clayton hough a former 
marine from holyoke mass who lost both legs in vietnam and wore 
an antifonda button into the church 
the antifonda coalition held three rallies in waterbury 
including one in april attended by more than 1000 people the 
holyoke board of alderman voted in february to approve a symbolic 
resolution protesting fondas film plans in the area 
the waterbury republican and american newspapers have printed 
about 450 letters on the controversy including letters in fondas 
support from former first lady rosalynn carter and former senator 
and presidential candidate george mcgovern 
the movie union street which also will star robert deniro 
is about a workingclass woman fighting her way up the social 
ladder who teaches an illiterate man to read waterbury and 
holyoke mass were chosen because of their workingclass 
industrial characters

from home on the range to home on the 
grange wild mustangs that once faced hunger out west find love and 
care on heartland farms and in east coast stables 
the federal governments adoptahorse program has found new 
homes and owners for about 84000 of these mustangs since the 
mid1970s helping to thin out the wild herd 
they are wild when you get them but they turn into 
affectionate puppy dogs that follow you around like household 
pets said cesi bell attending the latest adoption session in 
danville over the weekend youve got to convince the horse you 
are not going to hurt him hes got to trust you 
charlie most of the federal bureau of land management said there 
is at least one opportunity a month in the eastern united states 
for people to adopt a wild mustang 
some people expect some scruffy shaggy potbellied thing but 
these are very fine looking animals said most they are not 
mean but they are afraid at first they need confidence 
he expected no trouble finding homes for the 125 horses brought 
to this eastcentral illinois city 
this place is swarming with people and there is lots of 
enthusiasm said most as the adoptions began friday 
tens of thousands of the animals are roaming free in several 
western states eating forage meant for cattle under a 1971 law 
passed in response to complaints from ranchers the bureau is 
required to round up excess wild horses on the western range 
it used to kill the surplus animals but abandoned that practice 
in 1982 and started adoptions after protests by animal rights 
activists 
prospective owners must promise good care and adequate 
facilities they pay 125 which helps cover the cost of catching 
the horses bringing them to the adoption site and providing exams 
and shots by a veterinarian 
if someone likes horses and has the facilities this is a 
remarkable opportunity said most normally you couldnt buy a 
decent horse for less than 400 
it also takes about 30 a month in good feed fresh water and a 
stall with 6foot wooden fences 
mrs bell was at the danville livestock commission as people 
arrived to look over the selection of horses she is a member of 
the midwest mustang and burro association and offered advice to 
those adopting their first mustang 
it takes patience and time to tame the horses perhaps a month 
and having a radio in the corral with the animals helps them get 
used to human voices she said but not rocknroll that just 
gets them agitated like someone at a disco

president daniel ortega called sunday 
for another round of talks this month between his leftist 
sandinista government and the ussupported contra rebels to reach 
a permanent truce in the war 
we consider it very important to hold another meeting here in 
managua before june 30 ortega told a news conference a truce 
that began march 21 ends at the end of june 
in a first meeting march 23 in the southern border post of 
sapoa the two sides signed an agreement on steps to end the war 
but they have remained deadlocked on details for implementing the 
accord 
the two sides mostly differ on a timetable for the peace process 
and on democratic reforms to be taken by the government 
the contras lobbied in washington last week for renewed us 
military aid that aid ended at the end of february and congress 
voted down a renewal 
the sapoa agreement bars the rebels from receiving anything but 
humanitarian aid 
the rebels said at the end of the last talks on june 9 that 
there would be no further meetings 
at the last minute they presented a proposal that called for 
moves previously rejected by the sandinistas 
the proposal urged the sandinistas to free all political 
prisoners immediately rather than gradually as stipulated in the 
sapoa accord disband the supreme court establish an assembly to 
rewrite last years constitution and allow soldiers to drop out of 
military service if they so desired 
the contra proposal was dessribed as absurd by the 
sandinistas 
the reagan administration blamed the breakdown in talks on 
alleged sandinista intransigence 
on sunday ortega said a new round of talks to start june 26 
would be to work on a 32point government plan he claimed the two 
sides had already agreed on 20 of the points 
we are aware that the situation is not easy ortega said 
adding that the reagan administration was trying to kill the 
negotiating process 
the sandinista proposal offered earlier this month bowed to a 
key contra demand that democratic reforms should take place before 
the rebels lay down their weapons but the rebels said the 
government proposal did not go far enough

premier turgut ozal visited wounded party 
delegates at a hospital sunday and newspapers reported seven 
underground groups claimed responsibility for his attempted 
assassination 
the 61yearold leader his right hand bandaged and in a sling 
told reporters he felt close to death when an escaped convict fired 
at him saturday but he said i was not afraid 
ozal later told state television that all politicians had 
enemies as well as supporters so such incidents are 
unavoidable 
the premier was delivering an opening speech at a convention of 
his motherland party when a gunman fired twice at him 
police shot the assailant in the arm as people ran for cover 
sixteen delegates suffered bullet wounds and four were bruised in 
the stampede ten were hospitalized sunday 
ozal uffered only a hand wound and completed his speech 
a government prosecutor said the gunman identified as 
32yearold kartal demirag would be charged with attempting to 
kill a member of parliament if convicted he could be sentenced to 
death said prosecutor ulku coskun 
turkish newspapers reported sunday that demirag gave 
contradictory testimony following his detention 
i have psychological problems i did not shoot to kill but 
fired to get killed he was quoted as saying 
the newspapers said seven groups claimed responsibility for the 
attack including the outlawed kurdish labor party the turkish 
communist party and several organizations not previously known 
the papers also said demirag was a member of the now defunct 
neofascist national movement partys youth organization before 
1980 
the partys youth branch known as the gray wolves was active 
in a wave of terrorism that killed 5000 people from 1978 to 1980 
and prompted the military takeover of 1980 
mehmet ali agca the turkish gunman who wounded pope john paul 
ii in 1981 also was accused of belonging to the gray wolves 
the newspaper claims could not be verified independently 
after the shooting police discovered demirag was carrying 295 
in west german marks and turkish lira according to the reports 
the assailant is a prison escapee who carries foreign 
currency he needs to give explanation to these things it requires 
deep investigation ozal said 
police tightened security at the convention hall for the second 
day of the motherland party convention conducting searches and 
doublechecking the identification of delegates 
demirag 32 was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 
10 years in prison last year ankara gov saffet arikan beduk said 
demirag had been in hiding since he escaped from a lowsecurity 
mugla prison in january the governor said 
beduk said the gun a britishmade eightshot pistol jammed 
after two shots 
prosecutor nusret demiral said demirag did not seem mentally ill 
he might have given his early testimonies under shock he is 
not giving us trouble at the moment but we are not going to reach 
to a conclusion only with his testimonies demiral told the 
associated press 
demirag spent friday night in a hotel near the convention hall 
under the name of a repairman in the southern province of adana 
policemen tracked down the repairman and sent him to ankara for 
questioning the anatolia news agency reported sunday no other 
details were given 
newspapers also reported that demirag had one or two accomplices 
who escaped later but police officials did not confirm the reports 
newspapers also said the showing of the american movie 
executive action on state television friday might have given 
the idea to the assailant the movie is about the 1963 
assassination of president kennedy 
ozal was first elected when a military government ceded power in 
1983 
the premier told state television some people may not like his 
policies which include an end to cigarette smuggling into the 
country or his recent talks with greece the two countries nearly 
went to war over aegean seabed rights last year

yellowtail who died at his home saturday studied law and 
planned to become a lawyer but instead became involved in tribal 
affairs and politics the university of montana school of law

their case fell to yellowtail then a 28yearold law student 
the gallery was jammed full of spectators yellowtail once 
recalled they said i would have 18 minutes to answer sen walsh 
but i took 4 hours

the interior ministry has approved changes 
that will make it easier for poles to travel to the west the 
official news agency pap announced sunday 
the regulations which take effect monday will allow poles 
temporarily staying abroad to invite anyone to visit rather that 
just close family as in the past 
all poles must have some form of invitation to apply for a 
passport a regulation introduced after the imposition of martial 
law in 1981 
poles still will not be allowed to keep their passports at home 
but prospective travelers will be able to pick up their passports 
immediately after submitting a short request form 
poles still face obstacles before they go abroad because they 
must obtain visas to visit western countries it can take weeks and 
even months to obtain a visa for such popular destinations as 
england italy or west germany 
about 6 million poles will travel abroad this year compared to 
52 million in 1987 according to the interior ministry 
government spokesman jerzy urban said at a news conference 
sunday that lack of a computer system to keep track of passports is 
the main reason poland does not allow citizens to keep their 
passports with them

the states allrepublican board of 
canvassers has declared democratic former gov bob kerrey whos 
seeking the us senate seat held by republican david karnes the 
nominee of an independent party as the result of a primary in 
which he received 20 votes 
under state law kerrey can only run as the candidate of one 
party although its believed hell continue his candidacy as a 
democrat kerrey has said he wont immediately decline the 
nomination of the new alliance party 
at first the board which includes republican gov kay orr and 
four other high state republican officials said the partys 
nomination was won by ernie chambers an unconventional state 
legislator whose political hero is libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
some observers believed that chambers the states only black 
legislator might harm kerreys chances for election by drawing off 
liberal and black votes 
although karnes appointed by mrs orr in 1987 to fill the 
unexpired term of the late democratic sen ed zorinsky made a 
strong showing in the republican primary the most recent poll 
showed him trailing kerrey by 16 percentage points 
on friday however the board reversed itself and said kerrey 
not chambers had received the most votes 20 from those 
requesting ballots for the nap chambers the board said actually 
finished fourth with five votes originally it said he won the 
nomination with four votes 
in the democratic primary kerrey had 153500 votes or 92 
percent of the total cast 
the situation revealed this week may possibly be no 
accident kerrey said in a prepared statement thursday 
this doesnt appear to be a simple mistake he added 
referring to chambers candidacy 
mrs orr who succeeded the highly popular kerrey in 1986 when 
he declined to seek reelection said the democrat overreacted 
the lesson from the confusion she said was that the states 
election laws need to be modified 
four votes certainly to my mind or 20 or 50 or 100 do not 
duly constitute a viable nominee or candidate for a statewide 
election she said 
however state attorney general robert spire a republican and 
also a member of the canvassing board said he would appoint an 
independent special assistant to examine the activities of the 
board 
kerreys campaign manager bill hoppner said friday the issue 
isnt who was nominated by the new alliance party but how the votes 
were counted 
we need to know why the votes werent counted correctly the 
first time he said 
the new alliance party had only 14 registered voters in nebraska 
going into the may 10 primary that number has reached at least 15 
since chambers switched his registration from that of an 
independent 
in the may 10 primary the party had only a space for writein 
votes 
on a national level the partys presidential candidate lenora 
b fulani of new york received 205565 in federal matching funds 
in january shes seeking the partys nomination on some state 
ballots and is trying to run under the banner of other political 
parties in other states 
chambers a barber who has a law degree from creighton 
university said he wants to run for senator because both kerrey 
and karnes are young kerrey is 44 and karnes is 39 and whoever 
is elected may serve a long time the 50yearold legislator still 
has several options to get on the november ballot 
chambers who represents a predominantly black district in north 
omaha said he also intends to run for the legislative seat he has 
held since 1971 his reading of state law leads him to believe he 
may run for both offices he said 
nebraskans have learned to expect the unexpected from chambers 
who wears a sweatshirt or tshirt jeans and tennis shoes in the 
legislature he refuses to take the bar exam because he says the 
state shouldnt have the authority to issue the license 
instead he rents a chair in a barbershop in his north omaha 
district but he spends most of his time in his capitol office 
where mountains of newspaper clippings reports and other papers 
cover his desk posters and pictures of khadafi decorate the walls 
chambers said he admires khadafys resilience his neversaydie 
attitude and what he has done for the libyan people in social 
services 
last year he successfully sponsored a bill to pay university of 
nebraska football players and athletes in the big eight conference 
however mrs orr vetoed it

the defense department is ill prepared to 
guard against security breaches when teams of soviet inspectors 
arrive on us military bases july 1 as part of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty a magazine reported 
sunday 
the pact sealed in moscow may 31 by president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev provides for the elimination of 
nuclear missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3400 miles 
it also allows the soviets to send inspectors to 26 sites in the 
united states and europe to make sure the missiles have been 
destroyed as agreed the us military will send inspectors to 133 
sovietbloc bases 
however us news amp world report said in this weeks edition 
that the united states does not have enough trained personnel to 
prevent the soviets from seeing facilities and equipment they are 
not supposed to see 
the magazine said the number of trained us agents assigned to 
the pentagons technical surveillance countermeasures program 
which guards us bases from electronic surveillance by hostile 
intelligence agencies has been cut from 160 to 32 in the past six 
years 
only 10 of those agents are assigned to bases in the united 
states while the others are at us bases overseas however us 
news said pentagon sources which it did not identify said at 
least 30 such agents are needed in the united states 
the soviets are arriving in less than two weeks yet it takes 
eight months to train a countersurveillance agent the sources told 
the magazine 
the magazine also said mock soviet inspections of us bases 
conducted by the defense department during the past four months 
turned up a number of mistakes 
us officials playing the part of soviet inspectors were able 
to elude their trained escorts for up to an hour copy down 
classified information on data plates on weapon systems and enter a 
sensitive weapons facility on the way to an inspection area

four members of parliament flew to tehran sunday 
to seek improved relations with iran and they warned against 
raising hopes the visit might lead to the release of foreign 
hostages held in lebanon 
we are cautiously optimistic said cyril townsend at 
heathrow airport before he and the three others boarded an iranair 
jet this is very much a toeinthewater type operation 
members of the delegation are townsend and robert hicks of the 
governing conservative party thomas clarke of the labor party and 
lord tordoff a social liberal democrat 
tordoff told an airport news conference that reports of the trip 
had blown out of proportion the hope for winning the release of 
three british hostages believed held in lebanon 
the britons are among 18 foreign hostages held in lebanon 
including nine americans it is believed most were kidnapped by 
proiranian moslem extremists 
tordoff said the delegation does not know if it will discuss the 
hostages during the visit to the iranian capital 
its clearly something that is at the back of our minds and is 
important in the general relationship between the two countries to 
say that we have a specific item on our agenda would be quite 
wrong he said 
the legislators said they were not taking any messages from the 
hostages families 
we are fully aware of how strongly they the families feel 
and thats one of the reasons it would be quite improper for us to 
build up peoples hopes said clarke 
the delegates said they did not know their program how long 
they would be in iran or with whom they would be meeting although 
they expected to see parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
the mission arranged privately through the office of the 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie is not sponsored by the 
government and the delegates said their purpose is to try to ease 
strains between britain and iran 
but there have been many expressions of hope that an improvement 
of relations might increase the chances for the release of the 
british hostages 
one of the britons 49yearold anglican envoy terry waite 
disappeared jan 20 1987 in beirut while on a mission for the 
archbishop of canterbury to help free the hostages 
british television journalist john mccarthy 31 has been 
missing since feb 17 1986 and alec collett 64 a new yorkbased 
journalist disappeared march 25 1985 while on assignment for the 
un relief and works agency 
an islamic extremist organization reported collett was killed 
but there has been no proof he is dead 
most of the missing foreigners are believed to be held captive 
by the hezbollah or party of god a proiran shiite moslem group 
the longestheld hostage is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped 
in beirut march 16 1985 
relations between britain and iran deteriorated sharply last 
summer after retaliatory diplomatic expulsions the beating of a 
british diplomat in tehran and the shoplifting arrest of an iranian 
diplomat in britain 
mohammad jawad larijani irans deputy foreign minister for 
european and american affairs said the recent agreement to pay 
claims for damages to each others embassies was a sign of growing 
cooperation 
larijani speaking in an interview carried by tehran radio and 
monitored in nicosia cyprus said the visit by the four britons 
could pave the way for cooperative exchanges in economic 
scientific and cultural matters

educating people that everyone stands at 
risk of aids ranks as the most important duty facing doctors 
members of the american women in medicine association say 
dr virginia anderson director of the pediatric aids study 
group in new york told the gathering of about 60 female 
healthcare professionals that all categories of society face the 
danger of becoming infected with hiv adding 
if the behavioral change could follow the education there 
need not be another new case of hiv or human immunodeficiency 
virus 
since we have nothing to treat aids with our job is to 
teach to change our behavior association president doris 
bartuska said 
the doctors meeting to discuss the impact of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome on women and children were told by anderson 
and other speakers that people must be made to realize that hiv 
exposure is not limited to homosexual men and to intravenous drug 
users two of the population categories at highest risk 
aids is in the heterosexual population it is in the 
heterosexual female population and it is not always in the groups 
that have been highrisk groups in the past said dr mary 
guinan assistant director for science at the centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
guinan gave cdc data showing that of 4738 reported cases of 
aids in women as of april 30 the majority 52 percent 
contracted the disease through intravenous drug use of the 12684 
heterosexual men with the disease 69 percent contracted it through 
intravenous drug use 
but the percentage differed greatly when heterosexual contact 
was determined to be the cause of the infection in heterosexual 
men 2 percent contracted aids through sexual contact with the 
opposite sex while 24 percent of the women were infected the same 
way 
its not kinky sex that puts people at risk guinan said 
its sex normal sex and the number of sex partners 
she said cdc data also show that women are the source of 80 
percent of aids cases in infants infecting their children either 
through childbirth or before birth 
guinan said the best method of fighting the spread of aids is to 
fight for better sex education which includes a healthy sexual 
lifestyle 
she told the physicians to encourage condom use but even 
better to call for celibacy or monogamy

general motors corp helped the maryland 
attorney generals office in an undercover investigation of an 
automobile repair business according to a published report sunday 
the giant automaker made cars and transmissions available as 
part of a nationwide program to help combat fraud in the industry 
the baltimore sun quoted david a collins a lawyer for gm in 
detroit as saying he said the company has contributed to 
investigations in other states as part of a threeyear program that 
has received virtually no public recognition 
a consumer advocate questioned the ethics of gms role because 
of the companys financial interest in the auto repair industry 
the nations largest automaker not only provides replacement parts 
but also has paid out millions of dollars for repairs in a 1983 
settlement of a case involving allegedly faulty transmissions in 
about 5 million cars 
from an attorney generals perspective a lot of them could 
use some help in ferreting out these bad repair shops but im not 
sure they should accept help from a business that has a financial 
interest in it said russell j shew a spokesman for the center 
for auto safety an independent nonprofit consumer group based in 
washington 
its kind of a muddy ethical question no question about it 
said lawrence p mutter executive vice president of the automotive 
parts rebuilders association 
gm cars and transmissions were among those used in a maryland 
sting operation resulting in consumer fraud charges against cottman 
transmission systems inc based in fort washington pa according 
to court documents cited by the sun 
the state attorney general alleged that 11 of the 13 cottman 
shops in maryland violated consumer laws by making unnecessary 
repairs charging for work not performed and withholding cost 
estimates until after work was begun on cars that had been in 
perfect repair or had only minor problems 
attorneys for the cottman chain have denied the charges 
maryland attorney general j joseph curran jr and william 
leibovici an assistant attorney general who heads the offices 
consumer protection division declined to comment they cited a 
partial gag order imposed by a baltimore judge 
telephone calls by the associated press to the homes of gm 
spokesmen donald postma and john f mueller went unanswered sunday 
but collins acknowledged that the carmaker had approached the 
state of maryland and offered to supply automobiles and 
transmissions for sting operations in other states 
collins declined to say how many other states have used gms 
services in undercover operations but put the overall national 
cost at under 1 million and probably less than half a million 
dollars

an old city jail with medievalstyle turrets and 
thick stone walls would be transformed into a complex of 67 
lowcost apartments for working poor people under an ambitious 
project by an urban ministry 
the atlanta stockade once a debtors prison is listed in the 
national register of historic places from 1897 until the 1920s it 
housed criminals except for limited use by the citys school 
board the building has been empty for most of the past 60 years 
the renovated prison to be called glencastle would be a 
partial answer to the housing crisis faced by working poor people 
according to renny scott project coordinator for the family 
consultation service 
the apartments he said in an interview last week will be for 
precisely the person whos being priced out of the housing 
market there are people who spend 75 percent of their income on 
housing 
in 1985 two developers bought the stockade property which 
includes a 25000squarefoot warehouse formerly the prison 
stables and an old blacksmith shop they planned to turn it into 
luxury condominiums 
but they were unable to get the financing they needed they 
couldnt sell it to another developer and they couldnt even tear 
it down and start over the cost of destroying the stockades 2 to 
3footthick walls would have been too high 
family consultation service located in the southeast atlanta 
neighborhood around the stockade was looking for space to store 
and sell home fixtures 
we wanted the warehouse scott said it was perfect for 
what we wanted to do but the guys that owned it said we had to 
take the prison too 
officials of fcs which helps innercity residents contemplated 
uses for the building scott suggested housing a local businessman 
spent 210000 to buy the property for fcs and scott 43 was 
named coordinator 
it took us about six months to figure out which questions to 
ask and another six months to get them answered he said 
were about 60 days away from the end of our predevelopment 
phase 
individuals and groups from the atlanta area have donated time 
and skills to produce architectural plans and cost estimates 
the total cost of the glencastle project including the 
conversion of the blacksmith shop into a chapel and community 
center may reach 3 million scott said 
were looking for about onethird of it to come from inkind 
donations from the plumbers and electrical people and so forth 
another onethird we hope to get from corporations foundations and 
sources like that 
the final third we hope to get from a public campaign he 
said fcs wants to encourage people to purchase units for the cost 
of their conversion approximately 20000 and donate them for 
rental 
each of the one and tworoom efficiency apartments will measure 
about 300 square feet and will rent for no more than 200 per month 
glencastle residents will enjoy a life far different from that 
of their predecessors 
adult male convicts from the stockade were forced to work on 
chain gangs female and young male prisoners cleaned cooked and 
worked the prisons farm 
all the inmates toiled in a quarry near the stockade though 
most had been convicted of minor offenses prisoners were kept in 
chains which they forged in the blacksmith shop scott said 
despite its harsh history the jail is a distinctive building a 
broad porch with five fluted columns stretches across the front 
barred windows are generous some offer a view of atlantas 
skyline each corner sports a turret once used as a guard tower

iranian fighters opposed to the regime of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini captured this iranian border town 
sunday iran claimed iraqi army units attacked the town using 
chemical weapons on a large scale 
the town mainly a pile of rubble from earlier battles between 
iranian and iraqi armies was filled with cheering fighters of the 
national liberation army including many women 
mehran beside the border on the central front and about 100 
miles east of the iraqi capital of baghdad has changed hands four 
times since the outbreak of the iraniraq war in september 1980

no bodies no wounded no destroyed vehicles or fires 
leaders of the antikhomeini iranians said most of the fighting 
occurred in the foothills of the mountains to the north and south 
where artillery controls the town and that the offensive punched 12 
miles into iran at its deepest point 
a press officer at the baghdad headquarters of the national 
liberation army told reporters the groups fighters liberated 
mehran in a major offensive that started saturday night 
in a statement sent to the associated press office in baghdad 
the groups commander massoud rajavi said the capture of mehran 
sunday morning is a great victory and a basic step toward the 
overthrow of khomeinis oppressive regime 
thousands of of enemy troops under khomeinis command have 
either been killed wounded or captured the statement said but 
it gave no specific figures 
liberation army leaders in mehran said 1400 iranian government 
troopers were taken prisoner they acknowledged 48 of their 
fighters were killed and said casualty figures were incomplete 
a report by irans official islamic republic news agency irna 
monitored in nicosia cyprus said a large number of iranian 
moslem combatants were martyred and injured when iraqi warplanes 
chemically bombed the changuleh region east of mehran 
earlier in the day iraqi warplanes had chemically bombed the 
town of mehran 
irna said iranian special units were dispatched to neutralize 
the cheical weapons using special techniques and that hundreds of 
iraqis were killed in fighting near the town 
it also reported iranian warplanes flew five missioons to bomb 
iraqi positions in the mehran area 
an earlier dispatch from irna said a sixpronged attack on 
mehran was repulsed and that iranian troops were mopping up enemy 
positions 
iraq denied its forces were involved in the attack on mehran or 
that chemical weapons were used 
iranian claims that chemical weapons had been used against its 
forces in mehran are nothing more than a pretext to explain away 
a new military setback said latif nusayyif jasim iraqs culture 
and information minister 
the attack was mounted by forces of the national 
liberation army of mujahedeen khalq which have no chemical weapons 
in their possession jasim said according to a statement carried 
by the official iraqi news agency ina 
iraq said its combat aircraft flew 553 combat missions sunday 
the highest number since fighting renewed last monday with an 
iranian offensive in the salamcheh region east of the southern 
iraqi city of basra 
iraq also said its forces reclaimed 13 mountains in heavy 
fighting along the northern border and that an iranian helicopter 
was shot down there iran denied the claim saying all its aircraft 
returned safely 
the national liberation army statement said the mehran 
offensive named forty stars was the largest operation 
undertaken by its forces and involved 22 brigades of combat and 
support troops and covered a front 30 miles wide 
but the statement did not say how many troopers are in each 
brigade or give an overall figure of the number of fighters 
involved 
the group formed last june is built around the mujahedeen 
khalq peoples warriors that helped khomeini overthrow shah 
mohammed reza pahlevi it later was outlawed by khomeinis islamic 
fundamentalists and created a base in baghdad 
members of the mujadedeen khalq describe themselves as islamic 
socialists seeking a secular regime in iran 
supported by iraq the national liberation army has been playing 
a small but growing role in the war western diplomats in baghdad 
put the number of the groups fighters at about 15000

she was being held for ransom at gunpoint was found shot to death 
sunday in a wooded area authorities said 
the body of sally weiner 37 wife of pennbank branch manager 
harry weiner was found by a farmer about 8 am in a clearing 
about about 100 yards off a dirt road and five miles northwest of 
corry state police said 
her body which was fully clothed was taken to an erie pa 
hospital for an autopsy said erie county coroner merle wood he 
said the cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the head 
i would say she died instantly wood said 
no information regarding the time of death or the kind of gun 
used was released 
dozens of state and local police officers and fbi agents had 
combed erie county in northwest pennsylvania for the woman since 
friday afternoon thats when she told her husband she would be 
killed if he didnt meet an unspecified ransom demand said thomas 
doolin president of eriebased pennbank 
state police cpl harold eberhardt said sunday he could release 
no other information other than that the body had been found 
doolin said mrs weiner appeared to be reading a prepared 
statement when she telephoned her husband who runs pennbanks 
branch in corry a community of 7100 people 
she said they were holding a gun to her and that there was a 
death threat doolin said saturday she said he would find 
instructions on what to do in a paper bag in the parking lot 
outside the bank 
weiner was told to buy a walkietalkie set it at a certain 
frequency and go to an isolated wooded area outside corry at 9 
pm friday doolin said 
we followed the instructions and went to the designated place 
and they were supposed to make contact and they never did he 
said 
in one way this thing looks to be well organized and in 
another way it looks amateurish this is a tiny little branch 
office in a tiny little community so its hard to figure out why 
this has all taken place

four divers claimed records for the 
longest and deepest traverses of an underwater cave system sunday 
after emerging from an 8440foot limestone tunnel near where a 
companion died in a preliminary dive 
they surfaced several minutes after 5 pm edt they had spent 
more than an hour breathing specially blended gases to decompress 
from the journey that took them 240 feet beneath the surface of 
leon and wakulla counties south of here 
my lungs are a little scratchy from breathing all that 
oxygen other than that im fine said parker turner director 
of safety for the national association for cave diving it went 
real smooth but boy if you had a problem it would have been 
distressing 
turner 36 ran into trouble almost immediately after starting 
the dive four hours earlier in sullivan sink when his 
highintensity light shortcircuited he could have been stranded 
in the lightless waters if not for a smaller backup and his 
companions beams 
the previous record for the longest cave traverse was set by a 
6400foot dive in kelds head england and the deepest cave 
traverse was set during a 230foot dive in the sullivan system 
said turner 
the diving team had measured the 40 millionyearold sullivan 
tunnel system in january in separate dives by stringing lines from 
each end setting a record for connecting the longest underwater 
cave but the divers had not traversed the entire system in one 
dive until sunday 
aimed primarily at mapping the tunnels collecting rock samples 
and studying the caves geologic structures the expedition could 
result in evidence linking the caves to underwater rivers that flow 
into the gulf of mexico some 20 miles south 
the caves are part of what is believed to be a 40000foot 
system which would make it the longest documented underwater 
limestone cave system the secondlongest is the 36000foot 
lucayan tunnel beneath grand bahama island said lisa burkett the 
diving teams publicist 
team member bill mcfaden 32 died on may 15 while exploring the 
little dismal sinkhole after exhausting his air he floated upward 
about 100 feet but developed an embolism while his partners tried 
to maneuver him to safety through the system of caves 
his companions had to abandon his body but it was recovered 
later 
ms burkett estimated the cost of the expedition will be about 
8000 that money will come from the divers and other private 
sources she said

caricatures of the seven world leaders attending the economic 
summit sunday and police said more than 100 were arrested by the 
time authorities cleared the streets 
some 2000 demonstrators carrying placards and colorfully 
dressed defied a police ban and attempted to march one mile from 
the front of the provincial legislature to summit headquarters 
they shouted arrest the g7 as they went referring to the 
summit group of seven countries 
their intent was to deliver a citizens warrant for the arrest 
of the seven leaders for alleged crimes against humanity 
when police barricaded university avenue the broad thoroughfare 
leading to the summit at metropolitan toronto convention center 
more than 60 demonstrators hurled themselves over crowdcontrol 
barricades into the arms of tactical squad officers in dark blue 
uniforms 
the demonstrators espoused a host of causes ranging from 
opposition to us aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels to urging 
more help for victims of the deadly aids disease and saving the 
rain forest 
after they burned the caricatures flag and three newspaper 
boxes containing the wall street journal and usa today busloads of 
tactical squad officers linked arm to arm and rushed across the 
intersection shouting move move move they arrested those who 
refused to clear the street 
about 30 demonstrators sat on the road singing give peace a 
chance and flashing the peace sign phalanxes of police scooped 
them up and dragged them away 
supporters shouted the world is watching as the dramatic 
scenes unprecedented in toronto developed 
police supt bob guay said when it was all over at least 101 
had been arrested and charged with breach of the peace 
organizer james ensley of the alliance for nonviolent action 
said i think people are showing today that its wrong for the 
streets of toronto to be shut just because seven people come to 
town

that president reagan and the six other world leaders have been 
involved in militarism and economic policies that abandoned the 
poor and the homeless 
reagan arrived here sunday from washington to begin a series of 
talks with the leaders of canada japan britain italy france and 
germany the summit is the 14th annual gathering designed to focus 
primarily on international economic issues

denied permission for them to march

is an unlawful parade please disperse 
one protester shouted these are our streets man this isnt 
russia 
just outside a 15foothigh chain link fence surrounding the 
convention center eight japanese buddhist monks wearing yellow 
robes chanted for peace and pounded drums they stood under a 
banner calling for a new human consciousness of nonviolence 
gisela ramacher of west germany said the protest was a special 
prayer of peace for creating world peace and the victory of

the worlds seven richest countries agreed sunday 
in principal to grant wideranging debt relief measures to the 
poorest countries of africa officials reported after the economic 
summits opening session 
a british official saying the united states had softened its 
position said the leaders reached a general agreement to 
action based on a mixture of writeoffs of loans rescheduling of 
debt and concessionary interest rates 
the americans at this summit have shown they are willing to go 
further than they had previously said an aide to british 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson the official spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
canada the host said the leaders of the united states 
britain france italy west germany and japan had agreed they have 
a responsibility to developing nations to find a solution to the 
overwhelming debt problem 
the british official said the summit leaders will send a very 
strong signal to the paris club of western creditor nations to 
allow relief in these ways 
canadian finance minister michael wilson said the final 
communique will show clearly the direction we feel we should go 
and will provide industrialized countries members of the paris 
club with flexibility 
the british official said the leaders agreement meant that 
creditor nations could choose from a menu of options outlined in 
separate but overlapping initiatives put forward by lawson 
britains top financial official and french president francois 
mitterrand 
the british plan first put forward and rejected a year ago by 
most major creditor nations called for a threepronged approach of 
writeoffs rescheduling and concessionary interest rates the 
french proposal allows creditor nations a choice of options 
before the summit lawson said in london that the american 
attitude to third world debt relief was inadequate 
the united states has said it cannot legally writeoff loans or 
grant concessionary interest rates but can grant extended interest 
repayment periods 
the third world debt issue dominated sundays discussions by the 
seven finance ministers meeting separately and also apparently was 
a major topic in the talks among the heads of government 
french officials quoted mitterrand as saying the poverty of 
the third world destroys their societies and threatens ours 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said in an otherwise 
upbeat speech that the poorest countries are not sharing in world 
economic success and we must do something to help them 
the reported consensus means that each country can choose relief 
measures that do not conflict with its laws on writeoffs and 
special interest rates fears that differing regulations in 
creditor countries would mean some nations paying a much heavier 
price than others to help the poorest have helped block previous 
attempts at agreement 
there was no word on any new initiative to help the 
middleincome debtor nations mainly latin american countries 
which owe by far the most but are not as badly off as the poorest 
nations the countries of africa below the sahara desert 
the debt of the poorest african countries totals around 85 
billion dollars a small fraction of the 1 trillion debt owed by 
all third world countries

eagle bone whistle and peace pipe tried to summon rain sunday for 
this droughtstricken community 
four days from now theres going to be thundering lightning 
rain crow dog said after performing a 30minute sioux ritual 
that he says has never failed to bring rain 
cliff doebel of rural sandusky county who owns a greenhouse and 
plant nursery paid 2000 to bring crow dog and eight other 
indians from the rosebud indian reservation in south dakota 
this northern ohio town has received onethird of an inch of 
rain in the past month and the fiveday national weather service 
forecast held no chance of showers or thunderstorms until friday 
without water there is no life without the direction of the 
wind there is no breathing crow dog said the thunder being 
knows when there needs to be rain 
crow dog 49 said his first rain ceremony was in 1953 when he 
participated with his grandfather he said he has done 126 
ceremonies since then all of which have been successful 
although crow dog performed no dance at the ceremony the red 
eagles a columbus ohiobased indian organization performed 
several folk dances unrelated to the rain ritual the group also 
chanted and played drums while crow dog assisted by sioux indian 
chuck grignon blew a whistle toward the north south east and 
west toward the sky and toward the ground 
we blow to the four winds to the creator and mother earth 
crow dog explained 
the sioux tribesmen who were to assist crow dog had car trouble 
and arrived after sundays ceremony had ended but they will assist 
him in rituals to be held each day through wednesday 
many of those in the crowd were dubious about crow dogs 
rainmaking claims but said they were willing to try any solution 
to end the drought 
they pray by dancing we pray by going to church its the 
same god said mary lou noftz one of the spectators

more than 20000 people returned home 
sunday after a twoday evacuation of neighborhoods choked by toxic 
fumes from a chemical plant fire that sent 275 people to the 
hospital 
but 4600 residents were barred from returning to their 
neighborhood near the smoldering factory that continued to flare up 
and spew deadly yellowgreen gas the plant makes chloride pellets 
for swimming pools 
authorities said they would wait until monday to pour 52 tons of 
neutralizing chemicals on the remaining chloride firefighters 
continued pumping water on the remains of the advanced laboratories 
plant 
the neighborhood around the plant was kept closed because small 
explosions continued throughout sunday anyone entering the area 
was subject to arrest officials said 
i understand the difficulty of the inconvenience for the 1800 
homes involved but we think its absolutely necessary to 
conduct ourselves in a prudent manner said kevin kennedy an 
aide to springfield mayor richard neal 
two schools two housing projects for the elderly and a nursing 
home remained off limits evacuees stayed for the third straight 
night in city shelters 
im miserable inconvenienced sweaty hot uncomfortable and 
i want to go home said shellie spencer jr 30 from his cot at 
municipal hospital where he and his family stayed since early 
saturday 
the last of the three weekend fires at the plant was finally 
brought under control about 6 am sunday after a huge chlorine gas 
cloud moved over this city of 170000 people and forced the 
evacuation of 20000 to 30000 residents from springfield and 
neighboring chicopee 
the corrosive fumes also sent 275 people including 22 
firefighters to area hospitals with complaints of skin burns and 
breathing problems but only two residents were admitted both with 
respiratory problems they were reported in stable condition sunday 
this is the worst public health and environmental disaster in 
the 20 years ive been here said john j higgins regional 
director of the state department of environmental quality 
engineering 
fire chief raymond sullivan called the blaze the largest in 
memory and kennedy said the disaster would cost the city millions 
of dollars 
the fires began when rain blew in a window in the twostory 
factory and reacted with chlorine tablets in a hopper the heat 
from the reaction started a blaze at the precivil war factory 
authorities said 
the fire was quickly extinguished but another began just before 
midnight friday about 30 feet away investigators initially 
speculated that the sprinkler system that dumped 4 inches of water 
in the plant started the second blaze but then ruled that out 
that fire appeared under control by noon saturday and 6000 
evacuees began returning to home but watersoaked barrels of 
chlorine exploded throwing two firefighters against a wall and 
prompting the extensive evacuation 
the last fire was brought under control about dawn sunday after 
sending a huge gas cloud over the city of 170000 people 
chlorine is used in diluted form for bleaching clothes and 
cleaning swimming pools but is deadly in its pure gaseous form 
at the core of the fire was a room containing 600 to 800 
barrels each filled with 300 pounds of granulated chlorine that 
was 85 percent pure 
firefighters pumped 14000 pounds of water per minute in an 
attempt to turn the plant into a big swimming pool according 
to fire department spokesman giorgio placanico more than 50 tons 
of sodium sulfate and boric acid were then mixed to pour on the 
chloride in hopes of turning it into harmless table salt 
some of the chemicals were flown in overnight from maine in 
response to a plea from the fire department but officials said it 
wasnt enough we dont have anything near the amount needed to 
neutralize it said higgins 
although they risked reigniting the chloride firefighters said 
they needed to control the fire and dissipate the gas cloud with 
water if allowed to go on the cloud would have stayed for 
weeks said sullivan 
at its height the gas cloud measured two miles long and four 
blocks wide and it drifted with changing winds its fumes could be 
smelled as far as palmer 15 miles to the east 
the cloud forced police and fire officials to move their command 
post a halfdozen times once at the order of panicked officers 
yelling get out of here as the cloud rolled up the street 
police twice invoked emergency powers to forcibly remove elderly 
tenants who refused to leave according to kevin sullivan an aide 
to neal

a leading israeli diplomat will travel to 
washington this week for renewed efforts to settle a dispute with 
egypt over a strip of desert beach held by israel a foreign 
ministry official said sunday 
the controversy over taba a 250acre strip of land that 
includes a beach resort dates to 1982 when israel relinquished the 
bulk of the peninsula to egypt in keeping with a 1979 peace treaty 
both countries claimed the tiny enclave 
in 1986 both countries agreed to send the issue to a panel of 
international arbitrators which was expected to announce a 
decision this summer 
an israeli foreign ministry official said prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and two top ministers decided sunday to send ronnie sabel 
legal adviser to the foreign ministry to washington this week to 
discuss the issue with american and egyptian officials 
the official said israel agreed to negotiate a compromise 
because egypt dropped a condition that israel acknowledge egypts 
right to the beach 
israel radio said the compromise negotiations would take the 
place of the arbitration by the fivemember panel 
but egyptian foreign minister ismat abdelmeguid appeared to 
contradict the israeli version when he told reporters saturday in 
cairo that his country would accept the arbitration decision 
the israeli daily davar reported last week that the arbitrators 
would rule in egypts favor israeli officials refused to comment 
on the report

amid extraordinary security leaders of the 
worlds seven richest nations opened an economic summit sunday 
expressing confidence and optimism about the future but still 
firmly at odds over president reagans push to abolish farm 
subsidies 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney the host of the 14th 
annual summit of industrialized nations described the first 
session as a productive and spontaneous discussion and said 
there was a vigorous and comprehensive review of major concerns 
of the leaders 
indeed the meeting lasted 45 minutes beyond the two hours 
planned 
we just had a lot of things to talk about reagan said later 
as he posed for pictures on the lakefront lawn of a country club 
with the six other leaders 
he said they talked both about foreign policy and economic 
issues and that reducing agricultural subsidies was still on the 
agenda believe me its going to be discussed reagan said 
a 3000person security force was deployed on the ground on 
rooftops in boats and in helicopters to protect the leaders as 
they conferred in a windowless underground room in a convention 
center sealed off by concrete barriers and a high chainlink fence 
reflecting the high level of caution a red alert was 
declared as reagans motorcade took him from the airport to 
downtown causing his armored limousine to slow noticeably white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater explained later that security 
forces had spotted a man carrying a bag marked ammunition but 
that it merely contained his lunch 
many demonstrators defied police orders and tried to march to 
the summit compound carrying a warrant for the arrest of the 
leaders more than 100 protesters were arrested by the time 
authorities finally cleared the streets 
the meeting the 14th annual summit brought together the 
leaders of the united states japan britain france west germany 
italy and canada 
mulroneys statement issued on behalf of all the leaders and 
read by canadian finance minister michael wilson said we feel we 
have made real progress in recent years our message is and should 
be one of confidence and optimism in dealing with the challenges 
confronting us 
injecting a note of caution the statement said the leaders 
agreed there is no room for complacency difficult problems 
remain 
with the world economy in good shape there were no problems 
requiring immediate answers no dramatic initiatives or 
breakthroughs were expected and the biggest threat to an 
argumentfree meeting was the volatile issue of agricultural 
subsidies 
british prime minister margaret thatcher usually an ideological 
soulmate of reagans said the presidents plan to abolish all 
agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 was very courageous but 
not very realistic according to hubert vedrine a spokesman for 
french president francois mitterrand who opposes reagans idea 
vedrine said mrs thatcher gave a long and vigorous 
criticism of the subsidies and said they could ruin our 
economies reagan said there was no simple answer and that we 
all subsidize vedrine said 
the agricultural subsidies which cost major industrialized 
countries upwards of 200 billion a year are extremely popular 
with farmers european negotiators have said they would be willing 
to talk about cutting them but not abolishing them 
reagan has indicated the dispute could wait till the end of the 
year and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged the 
idea was going nowhere here 
we realize it will not be resolved at this summit nor do we 
expect any sweeping conclusions or admonitions or directions on 
agriculture to come out of the summit he said but we do want 
to begin building the internal political and social pressure for 
change in this area 
on another subject the leaders also discussed the overwhelming 
debt problem of the poorest nations in africa a british official 
said they agreed in principle to a mixture of proposals involving 
both loan writeoffs rescheduling and concessionary interest rates 
after economic discussions at the afternoon session the leaders 
were free to delve into political subjects over dinner at a country 
club fitzwater said he expected reagan would discuss his recent 
summit in moscow with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the spokesman also said the summit would produce a statement on 
eastwest relations stressing the importance of strength and unity 
among us allies 
summing up the talks reagan told reporters that it was 
fine mrs thatcher agreed saying all had gone very well 
fitzwater said that reagan suggested to new summit participants 
that the meeting be on a firstname basis and added my name is 
ron 
wilson said the leaders agreed that our countries must develop 
further our economic coordination efforts sound policies must be 
continued 
specifically he said the response to the oct 19 wall 
street stock market crisis and the betterthanexpected 
performance of the world economy since then show just how far this 
cooperation has developed and succeeded 
on trade wilson said they all agreed to resist protectionism 
and to insure that a midterm review in montreal gives a strong 
signal of progress 
unlike many earlier summits there were no foreign policy issues 
or outside matters likely to dominate the agenda as the persian 
gulf war did last year in venice and terrorism did a year earlier 
in japan 
each of the vistors was welcomed onebyone earlier at a 
ceremony featuring the honor guard of the 48th highlanders militia 
clad in kilts and black bonnets and playing bagpipes and drums 
behind the pageantry there were everpresent reminders of 
concern about possible terrorism 
many demonstrators hurled themselves over the barricades and 
into the arms of bluesuited police tactical squad officers the 
fracas took place a mile from the place where the leaders were 
holding their first round of formal talks 
the demonstrators dressed in colorful garb espoused a host of 
causes ranging from opposition to us aid to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels to urging more help for victims of the deadly aids disease 
outside the fence eight japanese buddhist monks in yellow robes 
chanted for peace and pounded drums under a banner calling for a 
new human consciousness of nonviolence 
security fears were underscored by the arrest of michael derrick 
collins suspected of being a lowkey irish republican army 
operative on charges of overstaying his visa collins 31 is 
being sought by authorities in britishrun northern ireland 
according to a spokesman for mrs thatcher 
under rules of protocol reagan the longestserving head of 
state was the last to arrive at the official welcoming ceremonies 
the first was jacques de lors president of the european economic 
community followed by italian premier ciriaco de mita japanese 
prime minister noboru takeshita west german chancellor helmut 
kohl mrs thatcher french president francois mitterrand and 
reagan 
reagan and mitterrand met for 35 minutes in a downtown hotel 
just before the first session discussing disarmament and the 
challenge of improving education in their countries said vedrine 
said 
mrs thatcher apologized to kohl for the hooligan behavior of 
british soccer spectators in west germany and urged stiff jail 
sentences officials said

in 1979 it was overproduced and undernourished 
the story of the friendship between a likable everresourceful 
jew and an aristocratic antisemitic polish army officer often was 
swallowed up by the shows lavish production how could it compete 
with a fullscale automobile that trundled across the stage 
singing nuns an elaborate railroad car a chorus of exuberant 
hasidim a gargantuan flag of poland that served as the focal point 
of a big dance number and a colorful circus scene the show died 
in two months 
now a streamlined and much simpler version of the grand tour 
has opened at offbroadways jewish repertory theater the result 
is an absolute delight a show brimming with tuneful songs and a 
touching funny and immensely human story that is finally allowed 
to shine its a joyful revival on par with last seasons engaging 
resurrection of flora the red menace another musical 
obscurity 
the transformation in the grand tour from more to less has 
been startling director ran avni makes do with two wooden 
turntables for the set designed by jeffrey schneider gone are the 
nuns and the polish flag the automobile is conjured out of a few 
pieces of wood and a turntable the circus atmosphere has been 
reduced to a few colored pennants 
what expands into this spartan atmosphere is the plot and 
characters jacobowsky and the colonel band together to flee the 
nazis as they advance through the french countryside in 1940 they 
are accompanied by the colonels french girlfriend who inevitably 
becomes the focal point in a love triangle 
the revival with a revised book by michael stewart and mark 
bramble puts these three people back in focus the story of their 
journey to freedom is important but it doesnt surplant their 
growing affection for each other 
that affection is expressed in hermans music which piles melody 
on top of melody its a dizzying display of song the evening 
starts with jacobowskys entrance number ill be here 
tomorrow a survivors song worthy of dolly levi or mame dennis 
but there are several other number particularly marianne a 
haunting love song for the colonel and i belong here 
mariannes hymn to home that deserve to be heard again 
joel grey was the original jacobowsky in the grand tour 
stuart zagnit is his worthy successor here its a performance that 
straddles a very difficult line zagnit is able to be appealing 
without descending into cloying cuteness and hes got one of those 
terrific musical comedy voices that makes every lyric count 
zagnit has a worthy opponent and finally friend in paul 
ukena jr who turns the colonel into someone more than a buffoon 
patricia ben peterson who plays marianne manages to make the 
woman into more than a bone of contention between the two men 
the show succeeds this time around because it has taken the 
trouble to care about its characters and now so does the 
audience the grand tour is a grand musical comedy a worthy 
journey for anyone to take

barges got moving sunday in new channels cut in the shrinking 
ohio and mississippi rivers but rain on the upper mississippi 
valley did little to ease the drought that has withered wheat and 
seedling christmas trees alike 
an ohio newspaper columnist offered sunday to print the names of 
akrons worst water wasters 
i keep hearing from farmers about how bad it was in 36 53 
and 54 said james craig wood 33 who farms near westfield 
ind but its the driest ive ever seen 
each week without rain we lose 10 percent of the crops said 
tim shank spokesman for the ohio grain and feed association 
lee jones who lives west of bloomington ind found that her 
200foot well had gone dry leaving her no water for her 8 acres 
of herbs vegetables and fruit were very lucky to be members of 
the y so we can go there for showers she said 
in washington dc rep ron marlenee rmont proposed sunday 
that commodity credit corp and agriculture credit insurance fund 
money usually used for loans be made available for disaster 
relief and to supplement federal crop insurance 
the rapidly worsening drought situation mandates congress to 
move quickly to complete some reasonable assistance package which 
will help producers who are on the brink of financial ruin and 
mental distress marlenee said it would be cruel and unfair 
for us not to act now 
showers and thunderstorms moved across sections of minnesota and 
wisconsin overnight pouring 172 inches of rain in 24 hours on 
duluth minn but minnesotas driest farms are on the opposite side 
of the state which got only spotty rain 
even if hard rain had fallen in the farming regions much of it 
would have rolled off because the ground is too dry said 
meteorologist rainer dombrowsky 
limited barge traffic resumed late saturday on the mississippi 
river near greenville miss and on the ohio river near mound 
city ill and moved slowly sunday 
both rivers have been dwindling because of the lack of rain in 
the midwest and northern plains the lower mississippi is at its 
lowest level since the start of record keeping in 1872 
an estimated 1800 barges had been backed up on the mississippi 
waiting for dredges to cut a channel through a shallow area and 
nearly 700 barges were stuck on the ohio bob campbell assistant 
chief of operations for the army corps of engineers vicksburg 
district said it would take two to three days to unsnarl traffic 
along the mississippi 
the mississippi was closed during the night north of memphis 
tenn because a towboat ran aground in the dark 
dredging continues said bill schult of the corps of 
engineers its like fighting scattered fires now 
stuart warner a columnist for the akron beacon journal in ohio 
offered readers a coupon to clip out of sundays newspaper with 
which to report people who waste water 
they shower every day alone their cars are clean their 
lawns are green these big drips must be stopped warner wrote 
he said he would publish the names of worst water wasters 
by sunday one day after the ordinance was passed water service 
to seven households had been shut off in the chicago suburb of oak 
brook because they had broken water restrictions more than once 
village manager stephen berley said sunday he said four had paid 
the 200 fee required to get back service 
rain fell on mississippi during the weekend but it was too 
little and mostly in the wrong place to save parched crops state 
agricultgure commissioner jim buck led a prayer ceremony for rain 
sunday in jackson 
the drought could affect christmas observances years from now 
steve latzig of badger evergreens at merrill wis estimated the 
operation has lost 2 percent of its new trees and could begin 
losing 1 percent a day this week if no rain comes 
the drought could cost north dakota tens of millions of dollars 
in tax revenue a state budget forecaster said that would 
virtually wipe out any chance of triggering pay raises for state 
workers on jan 1 and could be severe enough to force spending 
cuts said dave clark executive budget analyst 
last week north dakota state university economist arlen leholm 
predicted the drought would cost the states economy at least 27 
billion through loss of crops lower federal farm subsidies and 
reduced farm spending clark said at least 40 percent of the 
states wheat crop has been wiped out

for three men and their families the best fathers 
day present was meeting their newly adopted children sunday after a 
congressman cut through eight months of frustration and 
bureaucratic delays 
the four children from the dominican republic ages 16 months 
5 7 and 9 years old entered the united states on probationary 
visas after rep william lehman dfla intervened for the parents 
and adoption agency 
lehman blamed the delay on the us immigration and 
naturalization service misinterpretating a 1986 law dealing with 
us servicemen adopting sons and daughters born out of wedlock in 
southeast asia 
the ins said it was only following the law 
in the meantime the four children were living in foster homes 
and most of the adoption paperwork was completed 
after months of appealing to ins administrators lehman received 
permission to bring the children into the country on rarely granted 
humanitarian parole 
i think the ins is like many government agencies in enforcing 
technicalities beyond their intent lehman said while waiting for 
the childrens arrival 
added dianne racheleaumalaret new mother of the youngest 
child ive dealt with bureaucracies before but this is 
ridiculous 
the 5 and 7yearolds are a brother and sister adopted by the 
same family a third family adopted the 9yearold 
lorri kellogg executive director of the miamibased universal 
aid for children adoption agency accompanied the children from the 
dominican republic 
the bureaucracy has to show a little more sensitivity she

the cabinet said sunday it will force soviet 
jews emigrating with israeli visas to travel directly from the 
eastern bloc to the jewish state to prevent them from settling 
elsewhere 
a senior us embassy official said the decision appeared to 
contradict the united states position supporting freedom of travel 
for soviet jews 
emigration activists said the decision may reduce the influx of 
soviet jews to israel 
the cabinet said in a statement that it decided to act in the 
framework of legal means available that jews who ask for an exit 
visa from the soviet union in order to come to israel would indeed 
reach israel directly 
israeli officials say the decision is aimed at boosting soviet 
jewish immigration and reducing the number of dropouts jews 
who prefer to go to the united states and other western countries 
instead of israel
