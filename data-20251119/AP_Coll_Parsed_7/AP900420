milton and emmie douglas had seen photographs 
of children who needed parents they wanted a closer look and got 
it at a special shopping mall fashion show 
a 9yearold boy who had been left on a doorstep as an infant 
won their hearts by walking offstage and asking yall gonna be 
my mother and father he just picked us out of the crowd 
said douglas we dont know what drew him to us but were 
glad it happened that way 
what made me think they were my parents was the way they 
looked at me said larry now 11 and the douglases adopted son 
like this is a nice kid why couldnt he be our child 
using spring fashion shows as a way to find families for 
hardtoplace children may be unique to louisiana 
jc penneys puts on the shows and for the past eight years has 
invited the state department of social services to bring children 
who have been ruled free for adoption but dont have a family 
waiting for them 
penneys supplies clothes for the children to model and a 
social worker tells shoppers about the need for foster and adoptive 
parents and says a sentence or two about each child 
im not familiar with anybody else that does fashion shows 
that doesnt mean its not being done said mary beth seader 
vice president of the national committee for adoption 
some viewers like gloria mitchell were offended 
were going back in time this is like slavery said 
mitchell who went to a show march 17 to see if an advertisement 
shed read was real were auctioning off these kids 
but state social workers say it finds families and officials 
with other adoption agencies say that as long as the children 
understand theres no guarantee theyll find parents and are 
treated with sensitivity it sounds like a reasonable technique 
i would love to not have to have to do this i would love it 
if we had more families than children but thats not the 
reality said kerry ermon one of two family recruitment workers 
for the social services agency let me tell you it is a very 
effective recruitment campaign 
in the month after this years shows about 80 people called to 
ask about fostering or adoption as a direct result of seeing the 
shows or news reports about them according to ermon 
larry was one of hundreds of thousands of children around the 
country who were in state custody because they were orphaned 
abandoned abused or neglected because their parents couldnt 
control them or for some other reason 
most eventually are returned to their parents or raised by 
relatives but more than 15 percent eventually are released for 
adoption according to the national committee for adoption a 
washington dcbased advocacy group 
in 1985 the last year for which figures are available an 
estimated 276000 children nationwide were in what bureaucrats call 
substitute care according to the organization 
of about 5000 children in louisianas custody 800 are eligible 
for adoption half will be adopted by their foster parents but 
caseworkers are still trying to find homes for 416 said bobby ann 
clark of the department of social services 
when larry sauntered across the stage at a suburban mall he had 
been in foster care for two years 
mrs douglas said he had been left as an infant on the doorstep 
of a couple who raised him for seven years but after the woman 
died state welfare workers decided the man was too old to take 
care of the boy she said 
larry knew the fashion show didnt guarantee him parents he was 
optimistic when he walked onto the stage but became nervous when 
couples walked up afterward 
i thought they were going to pick either nina or jerry but 
they came and picked me he said i thought wowwwwww ill 
finally be adopted i was happy 
representatives of state and local adoption groups said their 
main concerns about the fashion shows were that all applicants for 
foster care or adoption be carefully screened and that children be 
prepared for the show and treated during it with understanding and 
sensitivity 
you dont want to expose the child to a situation where there 
may be embarrassment and a big letdown if the child is prepared in 
a sensitive manner i guess it could work very well said seader

last year poles showered soviet soldiers 
with rocks and bottles 21 times during a 210mile training march 
this year prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki opposes a speedy red 
army withdrawal 
they have disdained soviet soldiers for decades but poles seem 
to understand mazowieckis point 
poland has not joined czechoslovakia and hungary in the rush to 
be free of the red army not because it loathes the occupiers 
less but because it fears the army of a reunited germany at least 
as much 
the solidarity prime minister leader of the first noncommunist 
government to take office in the former soviet bloc envisions a 
soviet withdrawal only within an overall security arrangement for 
europe 
a survey by televisions center for public opinion research in 
march indicated 47 percent of poles felt the red army should go 
but the date should depend on events in germany 
maybe a year ago people would say the soviet troops shouldnt 
be here that their presence was more like a political presence 
said franciszek grzywacz a magazine editor in the garrison town of 
legnica now people are saying it is a kind of a shield against 
germany 
polands predicament is as old as its geographical position 
between germany and russia and has led new voices to utter a 
version of the old regimes argument 
for decades the communists used the danger from germany 
combined with the general threat from the west to support polands 
alliance with moscow and the red army presence 
most estimates put the number of soviet soldiers in poland at 
40000 to 45000 well below the 380000 in east germany 80000 in 
czechoslovakia and 65000 in hungary 
those in poland however form the supply link from the soviet 
union to the east german frontier of the warsaw pact 
one of the most important soviet military headquarters the 
western theater of military operations is in legnica in 
southwestern poland 55 miles from east germany the headquarters 
would coordinate a warsaw pact offensive using the baltic fleet 
air force support and troops from across eastern europe 
legnica 250 miles southeast of warsaw is one of the few places 
in poland where the red army is visible the wellpreserved painted 
brick architecture is a reminder of the towns place in the swath 
of silesian territory taken from germany after world war ii 
most of its 100000 people however are poles uprooted from 
eastern territories annexed by the soviet union under josef stalin 
that adds emotion to the atmosphere as soviet officers stroll 
the streets and black russian limousines rush commanders to and 
from prewar mansions in a vast red army compound enclosed by by a 
7foot concrete wall 
tales of soviet army abuses are legion secret installations in 
the forest bombs gone astray ditches running black with leaking 
fuel from military airports lowflying planes buzzing farms 
russianbashing is a popular sport soviet soldiers live 
rentfree and make slums of the scarce apartments denied to poles 
cover windows with copies of pravda instead of curtains throw 
garbage out the windows favor strip shows are above polish law 
when they commit crimes or cause traffic accidents 
if the soviets go home people in this town will have nothing 
to talk about said grzywacz the magazine editor 
teacher jolanta tochinecka does not see the red army as a 
safeguard poles know they can rely only on themselves he 
said that was shown in 1939 when the german invasion of 
poland started world war ii 
scrawled slogans may say tanks to the volga and one roughly 
translates to soviets go back to your garbage but the soldiers 
are an economic benefit to legnica 
there is a brisk trade in soviet gold and television sets 
outside the elegant turnofthecentury officers center 
shopkeepers rely on the wellpaid soldiers and their families who 
relish the relatively comfortable fiveyear tours in poland 
residents speak gratefully of access to sophisticated hospitals 
and some other facilities the soviets have their own schools 
police force book stores and work crews but the communities are 
largely separate 
there are not two sides of town grzywacz said there are 
two cities 
soviet troops came to poland temporarily under a 1956 
agreement that contains assurances of polish sovereignty and 
provisions that the kremlin will pay for their upkeep 
in czechoslovakia and hungary negotiations already have turned 
soviet soldiers toward home the red army has been in those 
countries since it crushed hungarys antistalinist uprising of 
1956 and the czechoslovak prague spring liberalization of 1968 
it was moscow that proposed talks on leaving poland 
mazowieckis government announced in march that discussions would 
begin on finances and the inconveniences suffered by 
communities where soviet soldiers are stationed 
the polish subsidy for the troops amounted to 26 billion zlotys 
27 million in 1989 according to statistics compiled by radio 
free europe 
solidarity leader lech walesa has demanded the soviets withdraw 
this year but government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said 
in midmarch 
poland is at work on the proposals to be presented during the 
vienna negotiations regarding the overall withdrawal of soviet 
troops in the context of a new european security system

president fernando collor de 
mellos drastic economic plan has brazilian psychiatrists working 
overtime to give the nations wealthy a shoulder to cry on 
ive been working 14 hours a day since the plan was announced 
the rich feel a mixture of panic astonishment anger and 
depression and they want to talk about it said flavio gikovate 
director of the institute of psychotherapy 
collor decreed his plan mar 16 one day after taking office it 
set an 18month freeze on savings accounts of more than 1200 it 
also limits withdrawals from money market funds to 600 or 20 
percent of an account whichever is greater 
the measure froze about 115 billion 80 percent of all bank 
deposits 
most of brazils poor majority were not directly hit as few had 
savings that were affected and with record inflation drastically 
reduced during the past month many of the worseoff say their 
salary is buying more 
but the wealthy are hurting financially and psychologically 
according to the prominent newsweekly veja at least two deaths 
have resulted directly from collors new brazil plan 
a sao paulo lawyer identified only as walter z had his entire 
lifes savings frozen in a bank and was unable to pay debts he 
shot himself to death three weeks after the plan was decreed 
and 39yearold altair rodrigues a married father of two who 
had almost all proceeds frozen from the sale of his sao paulo home 
and bar died of a heart attack 
while most wealthy brazilians have adapted to their new 
circumstances with less trauma many are still reeling from the 
blow 
a joke making the rounds reveals the degree of anger many rich 
brazilians feel toward the president 
as the story goes a businessman was waiting in a long bank line 
behind irate customers trying to sort out their financial affairs 
the businessman finally lost patience screaming thats it im 
going to kill collor an hour later he was back at the bank 
explaining to the manager the line was longer at the 
presidential palace 
for the poor money is simply a means of buying things for 
the rich money means status many of my patients are depressed 
because they can no longer afford the lifestyle they were 
accustomed to and feel their social standing has fallen gikovate 
said 
brazils rich are very spoiled the poor have always paid for 
the countrys difficulties and the wealthy are not used to 
sacrificing he added 
another sao paulo psychiatrist marcelo burkhard sobrinho said 
his work load has increased 40 percent since the plan was announced 
i thought id lose clients as theyd be short on money but 
its just the opposite those who cant pay now are begging me to 
keep them on with promises that theyll pay as soon as possible 
he said 
the psychiatrist joked that the content of his sessions had 
changed so drastically he was considering taking a class in 
economics 
before the plan it was the usual talk of sex love careers 
shyness and insecurities now at least 70 percent of the time my 
clients talk about the economic plan he said 
rio analyst jorge alberto costa e silva said the middleclass 
may have been harder hit than the rich 
twenty percent of 1000 is nothing while 20 percent of 1 
million can go a long way toward easing the pain he said 
referring to the limit on money market withdrawals 
costa e silva who in may assumes the presidency of the 
genevabased world association of psychiatry said the middleclass 
was orphaned by collors measures 
bank savings gave many people the opportunity to dream to 
make plans for the future thats been taken away and for many in 
the middleclass life now means only eating working and going to 
bed he said 
the analyst said he knew of at least 10 suicide attempts that 
were related to desperation caused by the plan a number he called 
frighteningly high 
wealthy brazilians with aids are having an especially difficult 
time dealing wih the bank freeze 
the government allows those who became unemployed because of 
their illness to make unlimited bank withdrawals but that accounts 
for few of the 9555 confirmed aids victims in brazil which has 
one of the the worlds highest rates of the disease 
aids is a terminal disease and those who have it feel they 
may die at any moment knowing their money is blocked for the next 
18 months causes tremendous anguish said lahire dutra de 
carvalho neto a therapist who counsels aids patients at a rio 
hospital 
he said many of his clients are bitter as they are unable to 
travel or make plans to enjoy the time they have left 
aids patients feel that first they were robbed of their lives 
now they say the government is robbing them of their money 
carvalho neto said

president bush is expected to name a female 
career diplomat as us ambassador to nicaragua as that country 
prepares for a new era under presidentelect violeta chamorro 
according to informed sources 
the sources said thursday it is virtually certain the 
appointment will go to melissa wells 57 currently ambassador to 
mozambique 
they said the administration believed a female ambassador could 
relate better than a man to mrs chamorro who takes office 
wednesday 
they also said the administration is eager to have more women in 
key posts only rarely have us ambassadorships in latin america 
gone to women 
in choosing ms wells the administration passed over several 
male career diplomats with long experience in that region said the 
sources who asked not to be identified 
ms wells who was born in estonia has no prior experience in 
latin america her personnel record indicates she speaks spanish 
wells name was submitted to the white house by secretary of 
state james a baker iii for the managua post and approval is 
considered 999 percent certain one source said 
the united states and nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each 
others capitals since july 1988 
the sandinista government expelled thenus ambassador richard 
melton and seven other us diplomats on the grounds they were 
interfering in nicaraguas internal affairs 
the reagan administration retaliated by expelling nicaraguan 
ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the 
nicaraguan embassy here 
but a new era in usnicaraguan relations is expected to open 
with the inauguration of mrs chamorro who defeated president 
daniel ortega in elections this february 
vice president dan quayle and a large congressional delegation 
are expected to represent bush at her inaugural 
the administration has asked congress for 300 million in 
assistance to nicaragua part of which would be used for resettling 
contra rebels but the request has been stalled by senate 
democrats some of whom believe that eastern europe has a greater 
claim on us resources than nicaragua 
wells nomination as ambassador to mozambique in 1986 
encountered strong opposition from senate conservatives who held up 
the appointment for 11 months in protest against us policy toward 
that country 
the nomination finally was approved in september 1987 
sen jesse helms rnc a leader of the campaign to hold up 
wells nomination said he wanted to pressure the administration 
into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to mozambiques 
marxist government 
mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the 
us governments list of countries under marxist rule

andrew youngs campaign to become the nations 
second black elected governor has run into a pair of obstacles 
slow fund raising and claims by his chief democratic primary foe 
that he is soft on crime 
the former atlanta mayor seeking to repeat in georgia what l 
douglas wilder did last year in virginia has attempted to avoid 
race as an issue 
recently he said voters at a campaign stop asked if he thought 
the state was ready for a black governor 
i said that when the university of georgia was ready to be 
no 1 in football they didnt care what color herschel walker was 
they just wanted to know could the big dog run young said 
and i said im about as close as youre going to get to herschel 
walker in politics 
youngs major opponent lt gov zell miller has attacked him 
as soft on crime miller cites fbi statistics that showed atlanta 
was the nations bigcity crime capital during the last two years 
of youngs eightyear tenure 
young left the mayors office in january he served in congress 
from 197377 and was president carters un ambassador after that 
young and miller the states no 2 official for the past 16 
years are the frontrunners in a contest that includes former gov 
lester maddox and two state legislators 
the primary is july 17 with a runoff aug 7 if no candidate 
wins a majority the democratic nominee will face the winner of a 
republican primary contest most likely state rep johnny isakson 
gov joe frank harris a democrat is completing his second term 
and cannot seek reelection 
miller had raised 276 million through april 3 according to 
disclosure reports and his campaign is believed to be the 
wealthiest 
young has not yet filed a disclosure report he has said he is 
struggling to raise money from local businesses and has raised only 
about 1 million overall 
young said the crime statistics cited by miller were skewed by a 
change in the reporting of crime information and other factors 
miller who has proposed marine corpstype boot camps for young 
first offenders and other lawandorder measures called the 
response a dodge 
this election is going to boil down to a choice between andy 
young who wants to run from the crime and drug problem and zell 
miller who wants to run right at it miller declared 
but franklin o greer youngs consultant predicted millers 
strategy would fail 
zell just wants to point fingers people dont think thats a 
fair attack said greer who helped manage wilders successful 
campaign in virginia 
maxine goldstein vice chairwoman of the state democratic party 
said she has not heard crime discussed as an issue in the rural 
middle part of georgia 
the whole focus of his crime control effort was atlanta for 
people down here i dont think thats as strong as it would be in 
the metro area she said 
added rep larry walker democratic leader of the state house of 
representatives race is not the issue it once was 
but emory university political science professor merle black 
who studies southern politics said the fact that georgia has a 
larger black population than virginia 27 percent to 17 percent 
will not necessarily work to youngs advantage 
what weve found in the past is as long as blacks remain a 
minority as the black share of the population goes up you do have 
an intensification of color consciousness on the part of whites 
black said 
for example he said george wallaces 1968 presidential 
campaign did best in rural southern areas with substantial black 
populations and wallace was obviously not drawing votes from 
blacks 
youngs platform stresses economic development for rural areas 
where he hopes to recruit white voters

john kelly the us official whom lebanese 
kidnappers want to deal with spent two turbulent years as 
ambassador to that country during which he was shot at by 
christian gunmen and once was reprimanded for his role in the 
irancontra affair 
a possible deal to release an american held hostage in lebanon 
may have fallen apart this week over president bushs refusal to 
have kelly get involved 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine a proiranian 
group believed to be holding three american educators hostage 
demanded that kelly fly to damascus to coordinate some final 
steps in the release of a hostage 
but bush refused saying the united states does not knuckle 
under to demands 
kelly 50 is a career foreign service officer who worked in 
obscurity until president reagan sent him to lebanon as us 
ambassador in 1986 
he quickly found himself involved in back channel 
discussions with the white house on secret negotiations for the 
release of americans held hostage 
kelly consulted with robert mcfarlane the presidents national 
security adviser john poindexter the successor to mcfarlane 
oliver l north a national security council aide and richard v 
secord a retired air force general who was in the arms business 
mcfarlane poindexter north and secord all have been convicted 
of crimes arising from the us sale of weapons to iran and the 
diversion of profits to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the discussions involving kelly were so secret that even 
secretary of state george shultz was kept in the dark about them 
and when shultz found out he was shocked that kelly had 
discussed the hostages and the use of arms sales as an 
inducement to win their release 
shultz summoned kelly to washington to reprimand him in person 
for dealing behind the secretarys back the state department said 
kelly did not take part in unauthorized negotiations for the 
release of the hostages 
kelly was described at the time as a bythebook diplomat 
who may have been under orders not to inform the state department 
of his activities 
in 1988 kellys bulletproof limousine was hit by gunfire in a 
brief shooting exchange between his bodyguards and a christian 
militia patrol in east beirut he was not hurt but less than four 
months later he left the country because of a heart ailment

its carpenter bill beatons job to make sure 
that when the speaker of the house of representatives flies off the 
handle the handle wont fly off his gavel 
beaton and his threeman crew in the us capitol carpentry shop 
produce about 50 handtooled gavels every year for the speakers 
use in admonishing the often rambunctious house to shut up and 
proceed with business 
it takes a sturdy gavel to silence a chamber full of legislators 
whose backslapping gossip and guffaws are stealing an orators 
thunder but beaton says his 14inch gavels of american sugar maple 
are equal to the task 
they can last for years if you dont abuse them beaton 
says one handle cracked when the gavel was hit real hard years 
ago im told but i guarantee you the head will never come off the 
handle 
the gavels are banged on a sounding board thats even tougher 
beaton fashions them from an expensive imported wood called lignum 
vitae or ironwood once used to make selflubricating bearings for 
old ships its so hard and dense that it sinks in water 
its practically bulletproof and it makes just the right 
sound beaton says other woods are too soft and wont echo 
but when the speaker hits his gavel on this ironwood board you can 
hear it all over the chamber 
even using a new electrically powered lathe that shapes gavels 
from a pattern somewhat like the machines that make duplicate car 
keys the 45yearold shop foreman spends up to two hours making a 
single gavel 
starting with a block of raw wood beaton makes grooves bevels 
and flutes with an assortment of hand chisels and woodburning 
devices and applies several finishing coats of clear acrylic 
lacquer 
beaton follows a fixed design that he says has been traditional 
for a century or more though nobody knows for sure 
when i came here nearly seven years ago i was told this is 
the way weve always made them and i should make them just like 
this he says ive never done it any other way 
the shiny blondhued gavels which beaton estimates are worth 
75 apiece are kept in a drawer at the speakers marbletopped 
rostrum for the exclusive use of the speaker or the legislator he 
appoints to preside over the house during floor action on 
legislation 
although a washington newspaper article published in 1923 
claimed that some years ago it was not unusual for 100 gavels or 
more to be smashed in one congress broken gavels are a rarity 
today 
their replacement is necessary instead because the speakers 
like to autograph their gavels and present them as gifts to 
constituents friends or to fellow legislators who have steered 
major bills to final passage 
veteran house parliamentarians recall that some house speakers 
notably sam rayburn of texas have wielded their gavels with a 
heavy hand but none has banged one into smithereens in recent 
memory 
former speaker thomas p oneill a big irishman from boston 
frequently tapped gently with his gavels handle to persuade 
lawmakers to quiet down 
one of the loudest gavelbangers was former rep richard 
bolling dmo who presided over floor debate and voting on scores 
of bills from the speakers chair during his 34year house career 
bolling interviewed by telephone from his retirement home in 
rural maryland remembered breaking two gavels in those years 
fortunately nobody got hurt he said

two leading congressional republicans are 
squabbling over who has the stronger credentials as a supporter of 
israel 
the dispute began on thursday after senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan said a resolution recognizing jerusalem as the 
capital of israel has damaged middle east peace efforts 
dole cited the resolution as an example of hastily passed 
dangerous nonsense and accepted partial blame for its senate 
passage on march 22 
four house republicans led by gop whip newt gingrich rga 
called a news conference to denounce doles statements and imply 
that he was out of step with republican policy 
the nonbinding resolution stating that jerusalem is and 
should remain the capital of the state of israel was approved 
without debate two days after it was introduced it is set for 
house action next tuesday 
doles senate floor speech was just the latest in a series of 
actions this year that have worried israel partisans dole first 
called for a cut in us aid to israel as part of an 
acrosstheboard trimming of foreign aid to free money for other 
friendly countries 
later he questioned the need for 400 million in us housing 
loan guarantees for israel and lashed out at the israeli embassy 
for lobbying against a resolution on armenian genocide 
the four house republicans in a letter to dole took exception 
to his reported comments that the threat to israel has lessened 
they said the united states cannot undermine its security by 
cutting aid 
we continue to firmly support as do the vast majority of the 
elected members of our party the republican platform that 
recognizes the importance of our unwavering commitment to israel 
the lawmakers wrote 
besides gingrich the group included reps duncan hunter of 
california vin weber of minnesota and bill mccollum of florida 
the news conference brought an angry response from dole who 
released a letter to gingrich in which he said the lawmakers had 
based their criticism on comments misquoted or taken out of context 
unfortunately some people seem to think that if you disagree 
with a single policy or practice of the israeli government or 
criticize anyone who lobbies on behalf of israel you should be 
characterized as antiisrael dole wrote 
that is bunk and i am surprised that you have joined in the 
narrow but shrill chorus of people who take that tack 
in a postscript dole added that gingrich seemed to have 
forgotten his private words of praise for doles proposal to 
cut israel aid by 5 percent or werent those words for public 
consumption he wrote 
in his criticism of the jerusalem resolution dole said many of 
the measures sponsors had not even read it he conceded that he 
had made a mistake by joining 84 colleagues in sposoring the 
measure and by failing to realize its repercussions in the middle 
east 
during a trip last week to the middle east dole said leaders 
of four arab countries egypt jordan syria and iraq all 
brought up the jerusalem resolution during discussions which had 
been meant to explore prospects for pushing the peace process 
forward 
the leaders feared the document was a signal that the united 
states might be headed toward granting legitimacy to israels 
occupation not only of east jerusalem but also of other lands 
occupied as a result of the 1967 middle east war dole said 
the resolution dabbles in a subject that our government and 
many outside observers see as better left to negotiations among the 
parties involved rather than decided by unilateral action dole 
said 
jerusalem is revered by moslems christians and jews as a holy 
city and each can point to history to buttress claims of 
sovereignty the eastern half of the city was seized from jordanian 
control by israel in the 1967 war 
the real point is not whether i believe or even whether 100 
senators believe that jerusalem should or should not be the 
capital of israel dole said 
the issue is whether the senate should be jumping into the 
middle of an extremely sensitive situation without looking or even 
thinking first

cocaines spread has kept the nation from meeting 
some of its goals for fighting drug abuse according to a new 
report from federal health researchers 
goals set in 1980 for curbing drunken driving deaths alcohol 
consumption and cirrhosis of the liver by the end of 1990 have been 
met the national centers for disease control reported thursday 
but goals set for teenage and young adult abstinence from drugs 
and booze have been met only in part amid a noticeable increase in 
cocaine use the cdc said 
the percentage of persons using cocaine at least once a week 
has increased from 53 percent in 1985 to 105 percent in 1988 
the atlantabased cdc reported 
since 1980 substantial progress has been made toward 
increasing public knowledge and awareness of the adverse social and 
health consequences associated with the misuse of alcohol and 
drugs risk perception has generally increased 
but the agency said the increased use of cocaine among 
adolescents is of particular concern 
the report noted previously published studies which say people 
who are younger when they first try drugs or alcohol have more 
substance abuse problems as adults 
the goals for the end of 1990 were outlined in a 1980 report 
from the us department of health and human services 
of eight major goals for curbing drug and alcohol abuse the cdc 
said three have been met one is likely to be met and four have 
been met only in part 
already achieved 
fatalities from all alcoholrelated car crashes should be less 
than 95 per 100000 population per year that level was reached in 
1988 after years of decline 
cirrhosis deaths should be less than 12 per 100000 per year 
the rate fell from 135 in 1978 to less than 10 by 1986 
per capita consumption of alcohol should not exceed the 1978 
level of 27 gallons by 1987 it stood at less than 26 gallons 
the lowest level since 1958 
probable 
more than nine in 10 women should be aware of the risks of 
pregnancy and drinking specifically fetal alcohol syndrome such 
awareness measured at 73 percent in a 1979 poll had risen to 88 
percent by 1985 
achieved only in part 
adolescents ages 12 to 17 abstaining from booze or drugs 
should exceed 1977 levels alcohol abstinence rose from 69 percent 
in 1977 to 75 percent in 1988 and marijuana abstinence rose from 
83 percent to 94 percent but cocaine abstinence fell 03 percent 
from 992 percent of adolescents to 989 percent 
young adults ages 18 to 25 reporting frequent drug use five 
days a month should not exceed 1977 levels frequent use of 
marijuana in this group declined from 19 percent in 1977 to 7 
percent in 1988 but frequent use of other drugs rose from less 
than 1 percent to 13 percent primarily due to the increase in 
the use of cocaine 
adolescents ages 12 to 17 reporting frequent drug use five 
days a month should not exceed 1977 levels frequent marijuana 
use fell from 9 percent to 2 percent but frequent use of other 
drugs including cocaine went from less than 1 percent to 08 
percent 
eight in 10 high school seniors should perceive great risk 
with frequent regular smoking marijuana use intoxication or 
barbiturate use in 1988 89 percent surveyed found great risk in 
regular cocaine use but only 68 percent for smoking 77 percent 
for smoking marijuana 43 percent for intoxication and 70 percent 
for barbiturate use

farmers trying to reduce use of chemicals 
would get millions of dollars in help from the federal government 
under legislation approved by the senate agriculture committee 
the research section of the panels 1990 farm bill approved 
thursday includes 40 million annually during the fiveyear life 
of the measure for a new lowinput sustainable agriculture program 
sometimes called organic farming the method employs natural 
methods for controlling pests and promotes crop rotation to sustain 
the soil 
traditionally the government has promoted farming methods that 
encourage use of chemicals this year for example it is spending 
only 45 million on sustainable agriculture 
farmers across the nation want to reduce chemical use and they 
want help from washington to do it said sen patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the agriculture committee its time we 
offered some real help not just idle words 
the bill would also authorize 10 million each year for training 
the nations 5500 extension agents in nonchemical farming methods 
other provisions of the bill include 
establishment of a groundwater office in the agriculture 
department to determine the extent of damage done by agricultural 
chemicals to drinking water supplies and what to do about it 
a usda study of the effects of climate change on food crops and 
forests 
400 million over five years for research grants to companies 
institutions and individuals studying plants animals nutrition 
and health natural resources and the environment new products and 
marketing and trade 
creation of partnerships among researchers state and local 
governments private businesses and the federal government for 
developing and selling industrial products made from farm and 
forest crops 
new funds for laboratory and onsite research education and 
training 
a 5050 statefederal matching grant program to encourage 
research 
the senate and house agriculture committees have been working 
since january on the 1990 farm bill which will set policy for 
virtually all federal agriculture programs during the next five 
years 
the panels are in different stages of completion on the various 
parts of the legislation which they hope to have before the full 
congress by summer

in the odd world of diplomacy its sometimes 
easier to lecture friends so israel is taking the heat right now 
while the bush administration steps gingerly around the soviet 
union and the islamic jihad 
the soviets are putting the squeeze on lithuania in a carefully 
calibrated scheme to choke off independence for the baltic republic 
president bush has threatened several times to retaliate if the 
soviets cross a line that he has not delineated for the american 
public but said thursday the kremlin had no trouble perceiving 
according to lithuanian leaders the soviets have cut off 
supplies of oil and reduced the flow of natural gas 
but bush is holding his fire 
the islamic jihad meanwhile is holding at least three 
americans as hostages on thursday the militants withdrew a 
promise to release one of them after the administration turned down 
a demand that assistant secretary of state john kelly be sent to 
damascus syria to conclude the details of the release 
again bush at a joint news conference with president francois 
mitterrand of france in key largo fla kept cool 
he reminded iran which many analysts think has considerable 
control over the islamic jihad that goodwill begets goodwill 
otherwise the president said simply that kelly could not go to the 
syrian capital because the united states does not knuckle under 
to demands 
by comparison with the squeeze on lithuania and holding innocent 
americans as hostages the actions by israel that drew us wrath 
are tame 
prime minister yitzhak shamir in charge of the caretaker 
government is going ahead with settling more jews on the west bank 
and in gaza despite us warnings that such settlements are an 
obstacle to peace with the arabs 
and shamir reiterated in jerusalem that he could not accept the 
formula proposed by secretary of state james a baker iii for 
negotiations with palestinians in cairo 
that was not news to baker after months of patient dickering 
shamir last month did not submit the us plan to the israeli 
cabinet for approval the hardline prime minister objected to 
including in the talks palestinians expelled from the west bank or 
others who were residents of jerusalem 
through margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman 
baker on thursday came down hard on shamir without referring to him 
by name 
its our view that progress at this point depends on the 
emergence of a government that is capable of making decisions and 
willing to move forward on peace ms tutwiler said 
the statement was issued while israel was trying to form a new 
government to replace the ruling coalition headed by shamir that 
fell apart over the baker plan 
it prompted israeli foreign ministry spokesman yosef amihud to 
remark the process of forming a new government is currently 
under way in israel it is therefore to be expected that another 
country be it as friendly as it may be will not interfere 
criticizing israel is virtually riskfree for the bush 
administration everyone understands that the united states is 
israels best friend and trusted ally 
but cracking down on the soviet union or on the islamic jihad is 
anything but riskfree 
bush and baker do not want to jeopardize the political reform 
the kremlin has ignited in eastern europe or the withdrawal of tens 
of thousands of soviet troops and tanks 
the two are aware that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is 
in a tough position trying to prevent the disintegration of his 
country they want gorbachev to negotiate terms for lithuanian 
independence but they dont think backing him into a corner with 
us pressure would help 
the islamic jihad meanwhile is holding americans captive 
eight americans in all are hostages in lebanon 
the administration is following a delicate course it does not 
want to deal with terrorists or even appear to be cutting deals 
with them but us officials also are aware of the hostages 
precarious plight 
so the president and the secretary of state are not hurling 
threats at the islamic jihad or at iran and they are measuring 
their words to moscow although bush said thursday there are 
limits to his patience

forget granola bean sprouts and smoothies a new 
restaurant called evans aims to sell health food as haute cuisine 
without giving up its mission to serve food with a conscience 
customers dine in candlelight on starched white tablecloths but 
make their guiltfree orders from menus printed on recycled paper 
all cleaners used in the restaurant are biodegradable aerosols 
are banned and do it for the trees signs remind employees to 
separate trash for recycling 
the atmosphere is decidedly upscale with valet parking 
original works of art and fresh flowers on the tables and the food 
is fancier than most people expect from health food says owner 
evan daily who opened the restaurant this week in houstons trendy 
montrose neighborhood 
a lot of people think that if its healthy theyre not going 
to like it unfortunately theres a certain stigma thats attached 
to it daily said 
flower petals and herbs adorn the entrees made from organically 
grown foods whenever possible 
the menu includes fresh vegetables freerange chicken and beef 
venison raised on a new zealand farm fish and even some desserts 
billed as healthy 
daily and chef kathy ruiz cook with infusions the essences of 
various foods such as red peppers carrots and roses that are 
distilled in oil the results include wokcharred tuna with mango 
tomato and scallions shrimp on lime jalapeno pasta and salmon 
with a citrus vinaigrette the house salad consists of mixed 
greens herbs and flowers 
this is the restaurant weve been waiting for said brian 
long an automobile executive who had dinner with his wife martha 
butler a dancer with the houston ballet company 
the couple went to the restaurant after a fellow dancer who had 
lunched there urged ms butler to try it 
its good and its good for you thats rare ms butler 
said 
opening night drew an unanticipated 175 people to evans 
daily said he hopes the eatery will become a mainstay for people 
who want to put earth first even when theyre dining out 
but he admits thats not an easy task in a city where barbecue 
and chickenfried steak are considered culinary treasures 
in houston people are meat and potato eaters they want their 
red meat their jack daniels and cigars he said we want to 
replace those cravings with suitable substitutes 
daily said he sacrificed some of his values to get more people 
in the door 
when he first envisioned evans he wanted it to be free of 
meat alcohol and smoking but there is a full bar and smoking is 
allowed in the restaurant which seats up to 200 
at 28 daily long has been committed to environmental issues 
his interest in cooking stems from his mother who owns a cooking 
school in houston 
were not a couple of leftover hippies who decided to get 
together to just do something fun daily said of himself and ms 
ruiz 
while he attempts to alter some eating habits daily also tries 
to set an example as an environmentally conscious business 
evans uses recycled paper for business cards stationery and 
toilet paper employees get a recycling manual and they sign an 
agreement saying they will do their best to separate wastes 
although the amount will be small daily says the money received 
from recycling will be added to employee benefits the restaurant 
also uses a longdistance telephone company that donates 1 percent 
of its customers net bills to nonprofit environmental groups

more than half of the 46 billion pounds of 
toxic chemicals released by industry go into the air demonstrating 
the need for tougher clean air legislation federal officials say 
the epa reported thursday that the amount of hazardous chemicals 
released by the nations factories in 1988 declined about 9 
percent but the agency said that might only be because of better 
recordkeeping 
in 1987 the first year under the reporting requirement the 
amount of toxic chemicals released by industry was put at slightly 
more than 5 billion pounds with close to half going into the air 
epa officials cautioned that they are unable from the raw 
figures the latest available to assess the health risks to 
individuals the figures do not take into account levels of 
toxicity release concentrations and actual exposure 
nevertheless federal officials have been surprised at the high 
volume of releases of toxic chemicals in 1987 and 1988 the 
reporting requirement covers 332 toxic chemicals 
the figures are absolutely shocking declared rep gerry 
sikorksi dminn this is almost 20 pounds of hazardous 
chemicals per man woman and child 
sikorski and sen frank lautenberg dnj said the volume of 
pollution demonstrates the need for tougher air pollution control 
laws the senate has approved a clean air bill that would require 
industry to equip factories with the best available control 
technology to cut releases of toxic chemicals a similar bill is 
before the house 
we need a tough new clean air bill and action on pollution 
prevention said lautenberg 
weve got to bring these pollution numbers down agreed epa 
administrator william reilly who said the pending clean air 
legislation when enacted into law will significantly cut toxic 
emissions from factories 
the releases reported to the epa by 19762 industrial plants 
nationwide are legal and within current federal or local 
requirements officials said the reports are required annually 
under a citizen righttoknow law that took effect two years ago 
about 243 billion pounds of toxic chemicals were reported 
released into the air by industry in 1988 compared with nearly 27 
billion the year before the rest was put into onsite landfills 
into lakes rivers and streams or injected far into the ground 
another 18 billion pounds not counted in the overall figure 
were sent away for treatment such as to municipal waste treatment 
centers or private treatment and storage facilities the epa said 
epa spokesman sean mcelheny said the 18 billion pounds is 
presumed not to have been released to the environment the epa 
however has been critical of the handling of industrial wastes at 
many municipal treatment facilities neither the municipal plants 
nor private wastehandlers are subject to the toxic release 
reporting requirement 
among the chemicals routinely emitted from industrial sources 
according to the 1988 data were 77 carcinogens the most widely 
released cancercausing chemical 115 million pounds was 
dichloromethane a chemical often used as an industrial solvent and 
paint stripper 
industry released a total of 281 million pounds of carcinogens 
including chemicals such as arsenic benzene and vinyl chloride 
chemical and allied industries accounted for about half of the 
total releases two states with a concentration of petrochemical 
plants louisiana and texas accounted for more than onefourth 
of the pollution totals 
the epa announcement provided only general release statistics as 
provided by 19762 industrial facilities and no information on 
specific plants 
but information released by sikorski from data contained on epa 
computer tapes showed that amax magnesium co of rowley utah had 
by far the highest volume of releases into the air nearly 110 
million pounds 
amax was followed among the top five industrial air polluters in 
1988 by tennessee eastman co kingsport tenn 40 million pounds 
avtex fibers in front royal va 34 million pounds triad 
chemical donaldsonville la 27 million pounds and eastman kodak 
co rochester ny 216 million pounds 
the avtex fibers plant in virginia closed in november after a 
lengthy battle with the state over pollution issues 
the states with the largest volume of toxic chemical releases 
overall were louisiana 716 million pounds texas 596 million 
pounds ohio 229 million pounds florida 226 million pounds 
indiana 213 million pounds and tennessee 203 million pounds 
according to the epa

two of every three aids patients suffer a 
mental decline that may be caused by an aids virus protein that 
forces brain cells to absorb a lethal dose of calcium harvard 
university researchers said in a study published today 
the study suggests that a calciumblocking drug already in wide 
use may be able to protect the brain cells and prevent patients 
from developing what is known as the aids dementia complex 
dr stuart a lipton a researcher at harvard and the childrens 
hospital in boston said more studies must be conducted however 
before the calciumblocking drug could be safely used for aids 
patients 
in the study appearing today in the journal science lipton and 
three coauthors said a laboratory experiment proved that minute 
amounts of an aids virus protein gp120 can cause nerve cells to 
die by forcing the cells to absorb up to 33 times their normal 
amount of calcium 
an additional experiment lipton said thursday showed that the 
calcium blocking drug nimodipine could protect nerve cells from the 
effects of gp120 
nimodipine not only blocks the rise of calcium but also 
prevents cell death lipton said in a telephone interview 
the experiment was performed in laboratory dishes using rodent 
nerve cells experiments using human nerve cells are planned he 
said 
lipton cautioned that although nimodipine worked to protect the 
nerve cells in the laboratory there is no proof that it would work 
on human cells or in human patients 
nimodipine would not treat the underlying infection but there 
is hope and its just hope that it might prevent the neurological 
manifestations he said its not a sure bet to work in these 
patients 
lipton said before nimodipine is used by aids patients 
researchers need to make sure it would not affect the action of 
antiviral drugs used to fight the aids infection 
many studies have shown that aids dementia complex develops as 
the immune deficiency disease progresses the dementia effect can 
cause patients to lose the ability to walk reason or function 
normally 
the cause of the brain problem has remained a mystery because 
researchers have not been able to isolate the human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes aids from the brain tissue of 
affected patients 
the harvard study suggests that the dementia is caused by a 
reaction to the gp120 protein and not by a direct viral infection 
of brain cells 
douglas brenneman a researcher at the governments national 
institute of child health and human development said his lab 
conducted experiments similar to the harvard studies and also found 
that gp120 could kill some types of brain cells 
im very pleased to see it the harvard study because it 
confirms our finding he said a vanishingly small amount of 
gp120 is lethal to the nerve cells 
brenneman said the harvard use of nimodipine to protect the 
cells is intriguing but that more study would be needed before 
the drug could be used on aids patients 
lipton said his group used two types of gp120 a highly purified 
form and a specimen removed from the blood of aids patients the 
harvard experiment showed that both types of gp120 would kill the 
nerve cells 
the protein gp120 coats the surface of the hiv virus that causes 
aids lipton said the virus can shed this protein like you would 
take off a coat and the protein has been found in brain tissue 
from aids patients 
both lipton and brenneman said they dont understand precisely 
how gp120 forces nerve cells to absorb lethal levels of calcium 
liptons coauthors in the study were evan b dreyer peter k 
kaiser and jeffrey t offermann all with harvard medical school 
and related institutions

advancement of science

they were considered six of the best apache 
helicopters in the army fleet but during the us invasion of 
panama electronic parts in the allweather aircraft failed to work 
when wet 
congressional investigators described for congress on thursday 
an array of problems that have plagued the attack helicopter in 
both army operations and the incursion into panama last december 
citing those flaws the general accounting office said the army 
should not buy the last 132 apache helicopters as planned and use 
the 149 billion already appropriated to repair the aircraft in 
the fleet 
why buy more headaches richard davis director of the gaos 
army issues group told a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
use the money to operate and fix existing apaches 
army secretary michael pw stone said the service did not 
dispute the gao findings but is making progress in rectifying the 
problems 
the apache is the finest attack helicopter in the world an 
aircraft that has given the united states a capability that is the 
envy of the world said stone formerly the armys top 
acquisition executive 
the gao reported that during the panama invasion hydraulic 
failure grounded one aircraft a failed fuel cell stopped another 
and a target detection system forced yet another to return to the 
base 
complicating matters were the helicopters sensitive electronic 
components that failed to work when rain and humidity caused a 
buildup of moisture troops were forced to dry the parts in kitchen 
ovens the gao said 
the betty crocker approach to apache maintenance quipped 
rep gerry sikorski dminn a member of the subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations 
the army plans to buy 807 apaches from mcdonnell douglas corp 
at a cost of 12 billion of that total the service had received 
534 apaches from its first delivery in 1986 through last december 
investigators said the helicopter could perform all assigned 
missions an average of 49 percent of the time a low rate for an 
army helicopter 
in addition the gao found that as the apache flight hours 
increased its ability to perform decreased 
reliability and maintainability have been a nightmare said 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the investigations 
subcommittee 
members of the panel also questioned the armys warranty with 
mcdonnell douglas 
the gao said the warranty is similar to a health insurance 
policy in which those requesting payments must meet a deductible 
before being paid 
the army has found 166 problems with the apache and taken steps 
to solve 90 but none of the costs associated with fixing the 
problems has been passed on to mcdonnell douglas under the 
warranty the gao said 
not all failures count against the warranty davis said 
only those that come up to the depot for repair 
questioned about the threshold davis said it would take about 
2000 to 3000 failures before the army would be reimbursed for the 
cost of repairing the apache 
thats a ripoff for taxpayers said rep ron wyden dore

a sharp drop in government payments in recent 
years continues to bear heavily on farm income prospects 
for example according to agriculture department economists in 
1986 the net cash income of farmers rose 11 percent to a record 
then of 518 billion from 467 billion in 1985 the first time 
over the 50 billion mark 
meanwhile direct federal payments to farmers soared 53 percent 
to 118 percent in 1986 from 77 billion the year before 
net cash income focuses on the value of commodities sold in a 
calendar year plus government payments less all costs the 
departments economic research service said in the april issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine 
in 1987 net cash income continued its recordsetting pace 
rising to 545 billion a 5 percent increase direct payments rose 
42 percent to a record 167 billion 
but drought ravaged crops in 1988 and forced market prices to 
shoot up although disaster payments soared the overall effect was 
to cool off total federal payments to farmers 
as market prices rose that lessened the need for paying out so 
much as deficiency payments to help bridge the gap between 
market levels and target prices used to compute the subsidies 
nationally according to usda figures net cash income in 1988 
climbed to a record of 572 billion while direct government 
payments edged down to 145 billion 
one characteristic of the bulge in 1988 net cash income was that 
many farmers even some who lost crops to drought were able to 
sell commodities stored from previous harvests at the higher market 
prices that counted as cash income in the calendar year 
in 1989 with most commodity market prices still much higher 
than they had been before the drought and the consequent 
tightening of us inventories farmers put more land back into 
crops thereby incurring larger expenses 
the upshot was a dip in net cash income in 1989 to around 53 
billion according to current usda estimates it was still much 
higher than at any time prior to 1986 federal payments dropped to 
less than 11 billion in 1989 down 25 percent from 1988 and 33 
percent below the 1987 peak 
payments are projected to drop another 15 percent this year 
the report said most of the decrease reflects less disaster 
assistance 
the disaster aid last year totaled nearly 3 billion but may be 
less than 500 million in 1990 barring widespread drought 
according to a new outlook report for may 1990 net cash income 
is expected to be in the range of 54 billion to 58 billion 
unchanged from the april forecast federal payments could drop to 
between 9 billion and 10 billion

the farm price of milk has dropped sharply 
from the record highs of last winter and probably will ease down 
further this year a cording to an agriculture department report 
analysts said this is a time of conflicting indications of the 
supplydemand balance in the dairy markets 
milk production has resumed expansion and falling 
international prices of nonfat dry milk have demolished 
opportunities for commercial exports the report said thursday 
but domestic demand has been strong both commercially and to 
rebuild depleted inventories 
milk prices at the farm probably will slip in the coming months 
and the onset of seasonal increases may be delayed the report 
said overall the farm price of milk in 1990 may average 4 percent 
to 9 percent below last years allmilk price of 1351 per 
hundredweight 
cheese use is not expected to be strong enough to compensate 
for the loss of commercial exports of nonfat dry milk as well as a 
likely 2 percent increase in annual milk production the report 
said although a surge in cheese sales would not be 
unprecedented it has rarely occurred 
consumer prices of dairy products as a group in early 1990 rose 
more than 10 percent from a year earlier greatly exceeding the 
overall increases in retail food and consumer prices 
retail dairy prices probably will trend down in coming months 
although any signs of strength in wholesale prices will tend to 
lessen and delay retail price declines the report said

a klansman wearing a white mask and 
hood during a oneman demonstration struck a powerful chord of 
violence and should have to abide by georgias antimask law a 
lawyer for a jewish advocacy group said 
the tradition of the klan is a tradition of violence and 
terrorism charles f wittenstein southern counsel for the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith testified thursday i 
think its hard to live in georgia and not be aware of that history 
and tradition of the ku klux klan 
somebody seeing that mask would indeed feel threatened 
wittensteins testimony came during a hearing in gwinnett county 
state court on the klan members challenge to a 1951 georgia law 
that prohibits wearing a mask in a public place 
klansman shade miller jr 27 of calhoun is trying to have a 
misdemeanor charge dismissed contending it violates the 
constitutions guarantee of free speech he testified thursday he 
wore the mask because he feared for his safety and his familys 
safety 
the offense for which miller was arrested carries a maximum 
1000 fine or a year in prison 
judge howard e cook said he will rule on the case in about a 
month 
miller was arrested in february after his demonstration in 
downtown lawrenceville northeast of atlanta he said he joined the 
invisible empire of the knights of the ku klux klan in july 1988 
miller testified thursday that he wore the mask with the klans 
white robe and hood because he feared for his job and was afraid of 
the consequences if his identity were known 
a lot of people would most likely take my life if they knew 
who i was miller said 
david fuller gwinnetts chief assistant solicitor said the 
truck driver wasnt employed at the time 
millers lawyer michael hauptman of atlanta asked him whether 
the klan robe mask and hood which were displayed on a mannequin 
in the courtroom had any symbolic meaning for him 
yes it makes me feel very good miller said i like it 
hauptman argued that the antimask law is vague and open to 
interpretation and he called as a witness edward k fields a 
former klan organizer who said he believed the use of masks and 
hoods helped people overcome fears of joining the kkk 
state officials contend the law is clear and specifically 
targeted at hate groups such as the klan 
the law prohibits the wearing of a hood or a mask to conceal 
ones identity when on public property exceptions include holiday 
costumes on the day of the holiday masks for use in sports 
theatrical garb or gas masks 
both wittenstein and earl shinhoster southeast regional 
director of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people said they feared kkk membership would grow if the antimask 
law were repealed 
shinhoster said the klan has a history of invoking terror 
harassment intimidation or carrying out acts of violence

black women are more likely than white women to 
undergo testing for cervical cancer but their death rate is more 
than twice as high federal health researchers say 
annual cervical cancer death rates in the united states declined 
from 42 deaths per 100000 women in 1980 to 34 in 1987 the 
national centers for disease control reported thursday 
but although the rate among black women fell from 101 per 
100000 in 1980 to 76 in 1987 that remains more than twice the 
white rate which dropped from 36 to 29 
the racial difference in cervical cancer rates is substantial 
and persistent the atlantabased cdc said 
the cdc attributed the disparity in death rates to generally 
lower socioeconomic status among blacks and a higher incidence rate 
of cervical cancer 
the racial disparity comes as preliminary cdc reports indicate 
that black women are actually more likely than whites to undergo 
cancerscreening pap tests 
a higher proportion of black women report having been 
screened the cdc said citing a yet unpublished study further 
details are not yet available cdc researchers said thursday 
lower screening rates for black women in previous years may be 
contributing now to higher death rates in older black women said 
cdc cancer researcher eddas bennett 
previously black women were screened less frequently than 
white women and it takes some years for it to catch up in 
decreased deaths she said 
but the cdc said for younger black women who were screened 
more frequently than their white counterparts disparities in 
followup and treatment may have contributed to excess cervical 
cancer mortality 
if youre screened it often comes down to a question of 
whether you actually received the appropriate followup 
treatment bennett said 
overall the cdc said deaths from cervical cancer in the united 
states dropped 11 percent in seven years from 5537 in 1980 to 
4951 in 1987 the latest year for which detailed reports are 
available 
thats primarily from the increased use of screening 
bennett said 
virtually all cervical cancer deaths are preventable with early 
detection chiefly through pap test screening and treatment when 
necessary the cdc said

a system that uses a computer voice to tell a 
jetliner pilot how to avoid an impending midair collision is being 
installed for the first time in a commercial air carrier fleet 
climb climb climb ordered a male voice generated by the 
traffic alert and collision avoidance system built into a new usair 
jetliner all large airliners must have the units by the end of 
1993 
a miniature air traffic screen in the cockpit showed a red dot 
pinpointing a plane that was coming dangerously close ordinarily 
pilots have to rely on what they see out the cockpit window or what 
air traffic controllers tell them is in the vicinity 
with a series of maneuvers between a small plane and the boeing 
737400 airliner carrying industry and government officials and 
news people thursday pilots demonstrated the system known as tcas 
ii that must be installed in all airliners with more than 30 seats 
by the end of 1993 
commuter airliners and other smaller passenger planes are 
required to have a lesssophisticated version tcas i which emits 
traffic warnings when other planes come too near but does not tell 
the pilot what to do 
congress has ordered that onefifth of each carriers airliners 
have the tcas ii units installed before the end of this year at a 
perplane cost of about 125000 
the bill for the entire us fleet is expected to exceed 450 
million airlines put the cost at closer to 1 billion figuring in 
labor and lost profits during installation which takes about five 
days 
repeatedly on thursdays flight from washington national 
airport the small plane came on a collision course with the usair 
jet 
each time the tcas screen showed the location of the intruding 
aircraft and a voice from a speaker in the cockpit ceiling gave 
quick precise instructions to the pilot they began with 
traffic and ended with clear of conflict as passengers 
watched the small plane whiz by within a few hundred feet of the 
airliner 
if two tcas computers meet in the sky they communicate with 
each other and one pilot is told to climb and the other to 
descend or maintain altitude 
an even more sophisticated third generation of the system tcas 
iii is being developed to give pilots horizontal instructions as 
well 
the tcas system gives the pilot a miniature air traffic control 
system in the sky displaying aircraft within a 40mile radius it 
can only detect planes with transponders that emit radar signals 
all but the smallest private planes have transponders 
usair officials said their boeing 737 is the first commercial 
airplane to be equipped and certificated by the faa with the tcas 
unit 
northwest united and piedmont now apart of usair equipped 
planes with test versions of tcas when the system was being 
evaluated by the faa 
three companies manufacture tcas systems that meet faa 
specifications the ones being put on usairs fleet are made by 
alliedsignal aerospaces bendixking air transport avionics 
division 
other manufacturers are the air transport systems division of 
honeywell inc and the collins division of rockwell international 
corp 
from the pilots perspective the new tcas technology provides 
an added margin of safety said capt norman bush usair flight 
training manager he said pilots would have to undergo only about 
90 minutes of training to learn to use the system which is 
expected to be put into operation in the first dozen or more planes 
by midjune 
tom mcsweeney an faa official aboard the demonstration flight 
said the system would have the added benefit of making it easier 
for pilots to maintain proper separation from other aircraft during 
landings and give them more information in areas not covered by air 
traffic controllers 
the system however is seen only as a backup to controllers who 
monitor all flights and have responsibility for maintaining safe 
distances between aircraft particularly those the pilots cannot 
see out of the cockpit window 
the faa originally required that all large airliners have tcas 
by the end of 1991 but last week issued final rules which require 
them to be phased in by the end of 1993 
the phasein period will enable the faa to evaluate the system 
after it has been installed in 20 percent of the fleet

a sheriff who commandeered a national 
guard armory because he was fed up with turning criminals loose for 
lack of jail space has forced state authorities to provide a new 
temporary jail 
nine weeks after hampden county sheriff michael j ashe jr 
seized the armory in springfield its 44 inmates were moved 
thursday to a closed renovated armory in the neighboring western 
massachusetts city of holyoke authorities said 
our intent was to be able to implement sentences whether 
it requires the springfield armory or the holyoke armory said 
ashe quietly savoring his victory were now able to sentence 
people and take them to jail in this county 
ashe who is wellknown for his innovative rehabilitation 
programs dubbed his new jail a community service center and 
assigned to it prisoners working on various projects around the 
county 
some of the prisoners work at an office furniture factory at the 
jail others at the jail farm or picking litter along state 
roadways a special contingent of 15 prisoners is being detailed to 
work on holyoke projects including cleaning vacant lots and 
helping street crews fix potholes in the financially strapped city 
said jail spokesman richard mccarthy 
ashe who has a masters degree in social work gave up asking 
the state for help and seized the springfield armory feb 16 since 
1988 when the inmate population reached 724 his centuryold 
lockup for 279 prisoners has been under a federal court order 
limiting occupancy to 500 
armed with a 17thcentury statute allowing sheriffs to demand 
aid and assistance in the execution of their office ashe simply 
walked in and occupied the armory 
his action on the eve of the threeday presidents day weekend 
caught state and national guard officials by surprise when they 
returned after the holiday the sheriff had installed more than a 
dozen prisoners obtained a court order prohibiting the state from 
evicting him and had public opinion firmly in his corner 
state officials initially condemned the move but three weeks 
later proposed a compromise under which the sheriff agreed to 
vacate the facility being actively used by the national guard and 
move his overflow prisoners to the holyoke armory renovated with 
118000 in state funds 
most of the money went to fix up a basement in the 84yearold 
building for a large inmate dormitory

reducing the 100 billionplus gap between the 
federal income taxes owed and paid on legal earnings could impose 
some unpleasant burdens on those who dont cheat congressional 
auditors say 
it could mean higher prices for a roof replacement or fresh 
vegetables more paperwork for small businesses and perhaps even 
withholding taxes from interest and dividends 
the internal revenue service told congress on thursday that the 
tax gap is growing and likely to reach 100 billion this year and 
127 billion by 1992 its a pile of money that large draws heavy 
interest from lawmakers concerned about a lingering deficit and 
demands for new programs 
there are no quick fixes irs commissioner fred t goldberg 
jr reminded the house ways and means oversight subcommittee 
closing the gap he said will require tougher enforcement efforts 
as well as better assistance to taxpayers 
paul l posner associate director of the general accounting 
office said catching the wayward dollars will require some risks 
new administrative or paperwork burdens may be opposed by irs 
and others posner said taxpayers support may diminish when 
better enforcement such as expanded information reporting 
increases paperwork burdens along with the prices of goods and 
services from businesses and informal suppliers such as roadside 
vendors and homerepair workers 
the gao an investigative arm of congress offered these 
suggestions for improving enforcement 
require that income taxes be withheld from some payments made 
to oneowner businesses the gao noted some nongovernment 
authorities are calling for restoration of withholding from 
interest and dividends an idea that congress approved in 1982 and 
repealed because of public opposition a year later 
use information from local licensing records to identify 
informal suppliers who may not report income including childcare 
providers and others who usually deal in cash 
require that those who make certain payments to corporations 
file reports with the irs in much the same way that a bank now 
must report payment of interest to an individual 
crack down on corporations that use taxes withheld from workers 
to support a failing business 
goldberg said the irs will be able to close only about 
onequarter of the tax gap with existing enforcement efforts 
in 1987 the latest year for which complete figures are 
available us individuals and businesses should have paid 505 
billion in income tax goldberg said without any prodding by the 
irs they paid 411 billion leaving a gross tax gap of 94 billion 
irs enforcement measures including audits and computer matching 
of earnings reports against returns brought in 22 billion and 
left a net gap of 72 billion 
the biggest causes of the tax gap were informal suppliers 
failure to report income accounting for 243 billion or almost 26 
percent of the gap large corporations almost 17 billion failure 
to pay taxes due at the time a return is filed nearly 8 billion 
failure to file individual returns more than 7 billion cheating 
on capital gains 67 billion and overstated deductions and 
exemptions over 6 billion 
the tax gap includes only income tax on legal earnings it does 
not count social security excise or estate taxes on legal income 
or any type of tax on illegal earnings such as drug peddling and 
prostitution it also excludes taxes assessed by the irs but left 
unpaid for several years these accounts receivable now total a 
cumulative 87 billion 
the irs estimates that individuals voluntarily pay about 83 
percent of what they owe corporations about 88 percent 
rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the ways and means 
subcommittee said the tax gap is a major threat american 
taxpayers who voluntarily pay their fair share of the countrys 
revenue needs will not support a tax system that tolerates 
widespread cheating he said

a republican threat to force senate action on 
president bushs proposed capital gains tax cut has stalled a pair 
of the biggest bills before congress child care and central 
american aid 
sen robert packwood rore a leading backer of the bush tax 
plan said through a spokeswoman thursday that he may try to force 
a vote on the tax cut when the senate takes up child care 
but majority leader george mitchell dmaine strongly opposes 
the capital gains change and congressional sources said he decided 
this week to hold up action on aid bush wants for panama and 
nicaragua until the threat to add the tax amendment is withdrawn 
the administration wants to cut the tax on capital gains the 
profit on the sale of investments from the current 28 or 33 
percent to less than 20 percent on the theory that it would help 
spur the economy 
although the senate and house have already passed 
multibilliondollar child care assistance bills a parliamentary 
vote is needed in the senate before negotiations with the house 
over a final version can begin 
julia brimedwards packwoods press secretary said the senator 
considers the child care bill a good vehicle for adding a 
childcare amendment 
fred mcclure the white houses liaison to congress told 
reporters that the administration had been informed that its 
request for 800 million for the two central american countries 
would go nowhere unless the child care measure is released 
house speaker thomas foley dwash also a supporter of the 
child care bill said wednesday that he hoped conferees would be 
named on the measure relatively soon but sidestepped the question 
of whether there was a problem the bills progress 
mitchells spokeswoman diane dewhirst said he hoped to get the 
child care bill into a conference committee quickly 
the white house had hoped to have its supplemental aid package 
passed by next tuesday when violeta chamorro is sworn in as the 
new president of nicaragua replacing the leftist sandinista 
government strongly opposed by the bush and reagan administrations 
but even before this dispute arose the measures progress had been 
slowed by a host of unrelated issues 
the house late last month approved its child care bill which 
would expand tax credits for poor families for the cost of child 
care and would provide federal money for local governments to set 
up new daycare programs in the public schools 
it would also expand the heat start program for poor children 
and create a system of stateissued subsidy vouchers for parents 
who want to use religious daycare centers 
the capital gains cut passed the house last year

some london subway riders are sniffing the 
fragrance of apple blossoms and hyacinths instead of what one 
transport official calls the armpit atmosphere usually wafting 
through the citys dank tunnels 
a pilot project that began thursday will scent subway cars on 
the busy east london line which carries 6 million people each year 
between whitechapel and new cross gate under the thames river and 
through 61 miles of tunnels nearly 150 years old 
passengers generally approved of the new sweet smells but not 
without reservation 
its better than the usual smell of wet dog said john 
oconnor on his way to work at a london hospital i just hope 
they dont put on too much 
ian derbyshire general manager of the east london line who is 
overseeing the project said we conducted a survey last year and 
people did not appreciate the armpit atmosphere 
there was a certain lavatorial smell which is a historic 
feature especially in the stations near the river that seemed to 
get stronger at low tide 
we reckoned it would be better to have a nicer aroma like 
in a bathroom he said as a cloying chemical scent drifted up 
the stairway from the track 
like potpourri sachets buried in a lingerie drawer small paper 
packets of fragrance have been hidden behind seats on each car 
when a passenger leans back the packet emits a whiff of apple 
blossoms roses hyacinths lemons mandarins wood or a sea breeze 
the scents were selected by cpl fragrances for their ability to 
make people feel relaxed and friendly said tony satchell a 
salesman with the company which provided the sachets free 
just think when you are sitting at the seaside you feel 
relaxed dont you well its because of the way it smells he 
said 
satchell is hoping that fragrances will soon be found throughout 
the london underground known as the tube 
wed like to go on to other smelly places like paris 
satchell said i hear austria smells too 
london transport says this is the last part of a 16 million 
program to improve the east london line more trains are being 
added cars are getting coats of graffitiresistant paint signals 
and security are being improved and stations are being renovated 
officials insist the improvements are unrelated to the recent 
rise in the number of young professionals now riding the line 
which runs through slums to the expensive docklands housing and 
commercial development 
not all riders were delighted with the new olfactory ambience 
however 
rosella beltrane a vacationing teacher from italy sniffed i 
think they should clean the trains first they are revolting it is 
like a person who doesnt wash and puts on perfume instead its 
nice but its not enough 
and not everyone noticed 
my sense of smell is not that good said ac onile on his 
way home from work as a night guard i heard somebody say 
something smells but the only thing i can remember smelling on 
this train was vomit so i didnt pay much attention

michael dukakis was on the receiving end of 
the andreas familys generosity on may 25 1988 to the tune of 
8000 
the eight 1000 donations to the democratic presidential 
candidates campaign from members of the family came just a day 
after nine members contributed 1000 each to another party cause 
the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
those checks would barely have time to clear before the 
republican party got a 35000 share of the andreas familys 
wealth on june 1 seven family members made 5000 donations to 
the republican national committee 
for the andreas family the bipartisan generosity was not at all 
unusual 
led by dwayne andreas chairman of the graintrading giant 
archer daniels midland co family members are prolific donors to 
campaigns and causes associated with both major political parties 
giving more than 500000 in the past decade alone 
the familys coordinated approach to campaign contributions is a 
textbook example of how major donors can enlist their families to 
broaden their political impact critics of the campaign finance 
system complain that these coordinated donations allow rich donors 
to circumvent contribution limits adopted after watergate to lessen 
the influence of the wealthy 
indeed even with contributions flowing from other members of 
the family both dwayne andreas and his wife dorothy inez andreas 
in the 1988 election cycle exceeded the 25000 limit on 
contributions to federally regulated campaigns according to an 
associated press review of fec records 
the ap review of fec records for the past decade shows dwayne 
andreas exceeded the 25000 limit in the last four election cycles 
198182 198384 198586 and 198788 and is nearing the cap 
with six months left in the current twoyear cycle 
andreas and his wife are by no means the only wealthy americans 
to exceed the 25000 limit exposing what critics call a glaring 
weakness of the fecs enforcement efforts 
it is a difficult provision of the law for us to monitor 
said commission spokeswoman sharon snyder we dont always have 
the resources for that kind of audit work particularly in election 
years 
in fundraising circles dwayne andreas ranks among the elite of 
the switchhitters influential donors who spread their 
contributions among both major political parties 
in business circles he is a legend for his friendships with 
washingtons power brokers including presidents dating back to 
harry s truman and more recently his private meetings with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
asked for comment claudia madding an aide to andreas said 
we do not discuss personal donations made by members of the 
andreas family andreas himself did not immediately return a 
telephone message ms madding said she would forward to him 
dwayne andreas once a major backer of democrat hubert humphrey 
more recently has emerged as a major supporter of senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas donating hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to doles campaigns political action committee and 
taxexempt foundation 
when dole was seeking the presidency in 1988 andreas his wife 
children and their spouses gave 10000 to the dole effort but also 
contributed 30000 to six other presidential hopefuls 
the contributions included 9000 to fellow greekamerican 
michael dukakis and 1000 to the man who defeated dole for the 
republican nomination george bush andreas later was among the 
100000 donors to the gops socalled soft money campaign 
archer daniels midlands political action committee also gave to 
four of the presidential candidates 
fec records show andreas family members donated at least 
550000 to house senate and presidential candidates and political 
party organizations involved in elections over the last decade 
the giving appeared to cross party lines indiscriminately while 
perhaps favoring lawmakers in states where archer daniels midland 
has major plants such as illinois 
one of that states favorite sons house republican leader bob 
michel was the andreas family favorite last sept 6 seven family 
members in three states each donated 1000 that day to the 
michels 1990 reelection 
before the day was out another 7000 came into michels 
coffers in 1000 donations from seven archer daniels midland 
officials three weeks earlier the companys pac had donated 
2000 to michel whose district abuts adms headquarters in 
decatur ill 
for florida sen bob graham a democrat his day as the family 
favorite would come two months after michels on nov 10 1989 
when eight family members donated 500 each to his campaign 
that 4000 was dwarfed by the 14000 received by massachusetts 
democrat joseph kennedy from the family on april 28 1986 
kennedy facing a primary race in his successful attempt to take 
retiring speaker thomas p oneills seat in the house received 
1000 donations from 14 members of the andreas family

a house committee that last year focused on 
helping children born addicted to drugs is shifting its attention 
to highrisk mothers 
a former drug addict and alcoholic who blames her substance 
abuse for her daughters retardation told her story thursday as the 
house select committee on children youth and families launched an 
investigation into these womens needs 
the woman identified only as kathleen x said she was 14 when 
she began using heroin and alcohol 
she said that over the next 16 years she had five children two 
are normal two died in infancy and one is mentally retarded 
diagnosed this year as suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome 
we now recognize that fetal alcohol syndrome is one of the 
greatest causes of birth defects and mental retardation in the 
united states said iris smith project director of the georgia 
addiction pregnancy and parenting program in atlanta 
infants born to alcoholic women are often premature have low 
birth weight and later display learning or behavioral disorders 
growth retardation and deficits in memory or attention smith told 
the house panel 
kathleen x testified that she would promise her children she 
would stop using drugs and alcohol but i could never keep that 
promise 
she said she finally became clean six years ago when she entered 
a longterm treatment program she is now regional director of 
community outreach and education for a drug treatment center in the 
maryland suburbs of washington 
committee chairman george miller dcalif noted that kathleen 
x is white and grew up in an affluent area he said her story 
illustrated that the problem affects all socioeconomic groups 
dr sheila b blume of south oaks hospital in amityville ny 
said efforts must be made to identify addicted women early 
pregnancy is the best time to treat an alcoholic woman or a 
chemically dependent woman she said the incentive to have the 
healthiest possible infant is the best motivator 
kathleen x concurred when i became pregnant i would stop 
using the illegal drugs because in my mind i said i cannot shoot 
heroin any more she said so i drank white wine back then no 
one said there was anything wrong with that 
education can work for some women at risk smith said she 
referred to a 1986 study by the emory university school of medicine 
that found that 35 percent of women informed of the potential harm 
of alcohol use during pregnancy stopped drinking

nicole ravesis baby sitter was awfully fond of 
the girl so fond that her mother got a court order to keep the 
baby sitter away 
but a week after denise ravesi told kenneth cole he could never 
see her daugher again 5yearold nicole disappeared and police 
say cole kidnapped the girl 
police have received tips on coles whereabouts milford police 
detective edward pomponio said thursday night 
in the meantime mrs ravesi is crossing her fingers 
i have a lot of hope that the fbi is doing the best they 
can she said cole 24 was described as a quiet shy young man 
mrs ravesi said he became obsessed with the little girl for whom 
he frequently babysat 
nicole reciprocated coles affection and neither mrs ravesi 
nor investigators felt the girl was in danger 
he has genuine strong feelings for her welfare i dont think 
he would intentionally harm her said fbi spokesman paul cavanagh 
but mrs ravesi is convinced that cole intends to take her and 
raise her as his own girl 
when nicole was hospitalized for a hip infection cole visited 
often and was seen kissing the little girl on the lips hospital 
staff said 
by february nicoles parents had become so concerned they 
obtained a court injunction prohibiting cole from seeing their 
daughter for five days but when the ban was lifted cole was still 
attached to the child 
it was like an addiction said mrs ravesi 34 he could 
never separate from her that was a big deal he could never just 
say hi and bye and everywhere he went whatever he did he 
needed nicole nearby wouldnt that be obsession 
in late march the ravesis told cole he could never see nicole 
again others told cole the ravesis planned to move from their 
suburban milford home before the summer was out 
on april 3 cole allegedly abducted nicole as she waited with 
her older sister in a parked car for mrs ravesi a school bus 
driver to finish her route police said 
i think the biggest reason he did this was he felt she might 
forget him over time and he was right in time she would mrs 
ravesi said 
investigators found coles mothers car parked outside an amtrak 
station in providence ri april 7 hundreds of phone calls have 
come in since nicoles story was featured on the television program 
americas most wanted 
mrs ravesi who has taken a leave of absence from her job said 
she wishes that nicole would be allowed to contact her 
the message i would give to him would be to allow nicole to 
draw a picture and send it to me mrs ravesi said a letter 
from her would be real nice just so i know shes all right

lincoln savings and loan associations real 
estate and loan portfolio included hundreds of millions of dollars 
in unrecorded losses says the regulator in charge of the 
institutions takeover 
keith seibold of the federal deposit insurance corp on thursday 
countered charges by lincolns owner charles h keating jr that 
regulators arbitrarily reduced the value of the thrifts holdings 
seibold said officials spent three months evaluating the 
security of each loan and physically inspecting lincolns real 
estate holdings in arizona texas colorado and other states 
when they were through they estimated the sampl was 631 million 
in the red at the end of june 1989 up from a negative net worth of 
66 million only three months earlier he said in us district 
court 
the losses had swelled to 15 billion by the end of the 1989 
and continue to mount at a rate of 20 million a month he said 
thursday testifying in the 26th day of hearings in keatings suit 
to recover lincoln from regulators 
seibold also testified that regulators found records missing on 
the day of the takeover april 14 1989 and that they immediately 
were forced to stem a severe run by depositors 
it is probably one of the most chaotic situations i have been 
involved with in my 20 years with the fdic seibold told judge 
stanley sporkin 
to obtain missing loan documents and credit files regulators 
had to resort to bartering with officials of american continental 
corp of phoenix the parent company of irvine califbased 
lincoln seibold said 
he said they swapped artwork in lincolns offices for files in 
possession of the holding company 
thats ridiculous keating told reporters later dismissing 
seibolds sworn testimony as total misstatement and lies 
seibold also said that lincoln had so few assets capable of 
being easily sold that it became the first sampl forced to seek an 
emergency loan from the federal reserve board to meet the demands 
of depositors who withdrew 110 million in the first three days 
under government control 
a run itself is not that unusual but this was something 
entirely different in the hostility and virtual panic on the 
part of depositors seibold said we searched the asset 
structure to find some assets good enough to sell or pledge but we 
couldnt find them 
seibold said only 3 percent of lincolns loans were traditional 
home mortgages most of the rest were construction and development 
projects in 79 percent of the loans lincoln had either provided 
the borrower with the money to meet the first several years of 
interest payments or required no interest payments until the loan 
came due he said 
that disguised the fact that many were bad loans seibold said 
adding that delinquent loans went from 182 million at the end of 
march 1989 to 1 billion a year later 
meanwhile rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the 
house banking committee called on the justice department to seize 
the assets of sampl owners such as keating living high on the hog 
off their illgotten gains 
people like charles keating are free to fly first class across 
the nation stay in luxury hotel suites hire armies of attorneys 
and file suits against the federal government using funds that 
should be part of the recovery for the deposit insurance funds 
gonzalez said 
the justice department does not have to stand by while the 
governments money is being dissipated in this manner he said 
gonzalez made the lincoln case prominent nationwide by holding 
hearings on the failure last fall keating asserted his 
constitutional protection against selfincrimination in refusing to 
testify to gonzalezs panel but he took the stand for eight days 
in his own suit 
the congressman doesnt like to see the truth come out in the 
courtroom keating told reporters it conflicts with his view 
of the case 
sporkin is holding the court hearings before ruling on the 
governments motion to dismiss keatings suit he has set today as 
the last day of testimony and scheduled closing arguments in the 
case for june 8

they shop for castles gangplagued neighborhoods and other 
locations preferred by movie and commercial makers trying to outfox 
a more discerning public 
with commercials we usually like large kitchens large rooms 
crew members can work in ms bulinski said but with a 
movie its a character and you have to have some look that 
surrounds them 
ms bulinski and mccarville are partners in a 2yearold company 
called location consultants 
theyve been to wisconsin for farms and steam engines michigan 
for train stations suburban chicago for a castle and southern 
illinois for a forest 
ms bulinski said tv and movie directors prefer real homes and 
places rather than stage creations because they want an authentic 
look 
viewers are getting a little too smart and look out a back 
window of a filmed scene and see the difference between real 
trees and a backdrop mccarville said 
ms bulinski has been in the locationscouting business for five 
years mccarville 10

millions of americans who take cruises each 
year to rock in the lap of luxury are ignorant of dangers like 
crews unprepared for emergencies and a lack of qualified 
physicians according to testimony at a congressional hearing 
a disaster involving us passengers is waiting to happen 
national transportation safety board chairman james l kolstad said 
thursday arguing for greater us control over safety and health 
conditions on foreignflag cruise ships operating from this country 
the passenger industry operating from us ports has had 
accidents with a potential for large loss of life he told a 
house merchant marine and fisheries subcommittee 
kolstad mentioned an engineroom fire in november 1988 as well 
as two rammings by cruise ships of docked vessels and one ramming 
of a boardwalk all happening in florida last year 
the subcommittee is considering tighter restrictions as a result 
of the blossoming of the domestic cruise ship industry in the last 
15 years 
according to testimony 80 percent of the worlds passenger 
cruise ships operate from us ports carrying american passengers 
although their owners are primarily us companies the ships sail 
under foreign registry socalled flags of convenience 
allowing them to avoid us labor and tax laws 
those mostly panamanian and liberianregistered ships are 
governed by the laws of their flag country when on international 
waters 
referring to the scandinavian star fire that killed more than 
160 people in the north sea kolstad said the ntsb would have been 
unable to investigate that accident had it happened in 
international waters off florida 
the ntsb investigated a major fire aboard the same ship two 
years ago in the gulf of mexico and identified some of the very 
problem areas survivors have reported this past week he said 
but the ntsbs recommendations were unenforceable he said 
among the complaints voiced by kolstad and echoed by other 
witnesses was that many ships lack licensed certified doctors 
many ships he said rely on medical students or paramedics 
many of the doctors on ships cannot communicate in english and 
the infirmaries often are illequipped witnesses said 
kolstad noted that on most ships the crews are so 
linguistically diverse that they can hardly communicate among 
themselves let alone communicate with passengers in an emergency 
kolstad and other witnesses said crews often are not adequately 
drilled for emergencies 
he argued for spot inspections in us ports by the coast guard 
rather than scheduled quarterly inspections 
opponents say the cruise operators would simply move to the 
bahamas and offer cheap flyandcruise packages for americans if 
they wanted to escape us regulations 
coast guard rear admiral joel d sipes disputed many of 
kolstads assertions saying that international agreements are 
addressing safety concerns 
he said language is less important than training in emergency 
drills and argued that the core of ships officers often speak the 
same language 
we find most ships to be in compliance he said urging 
respect for the national sovereignty of the ship

despite a pact to disband the contras 
president daniel ortega said nicaraguans cant be sure their 
9yearold civil war is over until the last rebel lays down his gun 
the contras signed an accord thursday with the united national 
opposition and the sandinistas to begin turning in their weapons 
next wednesday the day the 14party bloc and presidentelect 
violeta barrios de chamorro are to take office 
the contras are to give up all of their arms by june 10 and all 
sides agreed to a ceasefire that went into effect at noon thursday 
there has been widespread speculation the sandinista government 
might not transfer power as pledged despite its loss in feb 25 
elections if the contras did not disarm 
the situation has created an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and 
ortega appealed for trust 
we still cant say that peace has arrived but we can say 
today that we are much closer to peace and are distancing ourselves 
from war he said after a meeting with bernard aronson the us 
assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
the war will have disappeared on the moment that all the 
contras have disarmed and the deadline is june 10 he said 
aronson made no comments during his oneday visit to managua 
except when he came out of mrs chamorros home and told reporters 
the two had discussed economics the transition the peace 
process and the economic assistance thing 
president bush has asked congress to approve 300 million in aid 
to help mrs chamorro revive nicaraguas battered economy 
an estimated 30000 people were killed by the civil war in this 
country of 3 million there are about 9000 contras in nicaragua 
they waged their insurgency against the sandinistas from 
honduran border camps and with us aid but the united states cut 
off military aid in february 1988 the fighting tapered to sporadic 
battles and most of the rebels have slipped back into the country 
mrs chamorro and ortega had asked them to disband 
im very happy we dont want war any more we want peace we 
want reconciliation she said after meeting with aronson like 
i told daniel ortega yesterday all of us have to give each 
other a helping hand forgive 
following 14 hours of talks the contras the 
sandinistacontrolled army uno officials and roman catholic 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo of managua signed the accord 
the agreement also calls for sandinista military forces to 
complete their withdrawal from five rebel security zones and for 
the guerrillas to begin concentrating immediately in those areas 
another agreement between the sandinista army and the miskito 
indian rebels who are allied with the contras established a 
ceasefire that started at midnight thursday in the sparsely 
populated eastern half of nicaragua it calls for the 
demobilization of the indian rebel force by may 18 
missions of the united nations and organization of american 
states were charged with supervising the accords 
the incoming uno government seemed to gain the most 
the sandinistas had threatened general strikes and other actions 
if the contras did not demobilize by inauguration day and there 
was always the threat of armed clashes and even renewed civil war 
earlier the contras had demanded the sandinista army be 
neutralized as a condition for disbanding their forces 
thursdays accords do not address that demand however under an 
accord with mrs chamorros coalition the sandinistas had already 
agreed to depoliticize the army and reduce its size in exchange 
the incoming government promised to respect the integrity and 
professionalism of the armed forces 
the fears of disruption in the transfer of power have hinged 
largely on whether the army would be willing to yield authority to 
the new government 
with this accord we conclude the peace process that started 
with the elections said antonio lacayo senior negotiator for 
mrs chamorro 
let it be clear that what has been signed here is something 
serious something formal and i think that we all have the good 
will to fulfill this signed document said oscar sovalbarro the 
contras senior negotiator 
sandinista army gen humberto ortega the defense minister and 
brother of the president said he was satisfied with what he called 
a peace effort reached in a profound serious way with a great 
spirit of responsibility 
however not all sandinistas were happy with the idea of letting 
the contras retain their arms after april 25 and a prosandinista 
mob surrounded a us embassy station wagon carrying aronson as it 
was leaving the managua airport thursday morning 
the mob pounded on the sides and windows of the vehicle 
demanding that the contras demobilize immediately no one was 
reported injured

while not yet acting on president bushs 
request for 300 million in aid to the incoming nicaraguan 
government of violeta chamorro the senate is moving to restore 
trade benefits to the central american country 
on a voice vote without dissent the senate approved an 
amendment thursday lifting trade sanctions imposed in 1985 as part 
of an embargo against the regime of president daniel ortega 
the amendment by sen christopher j dodd dconn was one of 
several to a bill making permanent the dutyfree status given a 
wide variety of imports from 24 caribbean and central american 
nations under the caribbean basin initiative 
the house approved a similar bill last fall making the 
initiative permanent beyond 1995 when it is scheduled to expire 
however the house rejected attempts to expand the list of 
dutyfree items to include shoes and clothing that would compete 
with usmade products 
bush called for the aid package and the restoration of trade 
relations with nicaragua after ortega was defeated by mrs chamorro 
in a feb 25 election mrs chamorro is to be inaugurated next 
wednesday 
the house approved the aid package before easter among the 
trade benefits are restoring nicaraguas sugar quota which could 
bring the country 33 million by the end of the year according to 
state department officials 
prior to the embargo nicaraguan exports of coffee bananas and 
other products to the united states totaled 57 million in 1984 
and us exports there totaled 112 million by last year twoday 
trade between the countries had dribbled to less than 5 million 
also without dissent the senate approved an amendment urging 
bush to consider extending the dutyfree status now enjoyed by the 
caribbean and central american countries to peru colombia and 
bolivia 
sen joseph biden ddel said the amendment is intended to 
encourage the countries to develop economic alternatives to cocaine 
the andean region of south america is the source for 100 
percent of the worlds supply of cocaine he said we all agree 
that all routes to reducing cocaine production should be explored 
approved on a 903 vote was an amendment by sen william roth 
ddel making it easier for importers to win temporary suspensions 
of tariffs if no one raises valid objections 
such suspensions now have to be approved by congress roth said 
some importers now must wait for years because of delays in acting 
on duty suspension requests by the house ways and means committee 
where trade and tax legislation must originate 
the amendment would allow a president to suspend a tariff after 
an investigation by the international trade commission if congress 
does not act on a request within a year 
sen john heinz rpa opposed the amendment saying it 
forfeits to the president powers specifically delegated to congress 
by the constitution 
also voting against roths amendment were sens john danforth 
rmo and dave durenberger rminn

senate republicans are divided on how far to 
go in trying to limit the influence of corporate labor and 
ideological political action committees in election campaigns 
but they say they are united in wanting to stop the socalled 
soft unreported money spent on campaigns by unions 
we made i think substantial progress in developing a unified 
position sen mitch mcconnell rky said upon emerging from an 
hourlong gop strategy meeting thursday on campaign finance reform 
however others among more than 20 republican senators who 
attended the meeting in party leader bob doles office said there 
was no resolution on several issues 
with majority leader george mitchell dmaine intent on 
beginning senate debate next week on a campaign finance bill 
democrats were planning to huddle today on their strategy 
this is the most partisan issue that the senate will deal with 
this year said mcconnell whose selection by dole to manage the 
gop side of the debate is viewed by several democrats as an omen of 
a bitter fight ahead 
mcconnell was among the leaders of a republican filibuster that 
democrats failed to break two years ago when they unsuccessfully 
tried to establish taxpayer financing of campaigns and limit how 
much candidates can spend 
democrats want to impose a spending limit of 400000 on house 
candidates and ceilings ranging from 950000 to 55 billion in 
senate races depending on a states votingage population 
democratic leaders however have abandoned any attempt to win 
public financing 
lawmakers anticipate that after a few days of debate party 
leaders and the administration will begin working on a compromise 
behind closed doors just as they did with a clean air bill 
approved before easter 
bush wants an outright abolition of pacs which have tended in 
recent elections overwhelmingly to favor incumbent lawmakers since 
democrats hold majorities in both the senate and house they have 
enjoyed pac largess more than republicans 
the democratic bill would retain the current 5000 limit a pac 
can contribute to a candidate for each primary runoff and general 
election but impose a ceiling on the total pac contributions a 
candidate can receive 
we spent a lot of time talking about the pac issue and how far 
to go in bashing them mcconnell said we republicans do have 
some strong defenders of pacs 
mcconnell divided members of his party into three camps on the 
issue 
those who want to go along with bush and abolish pacs outright 
those who would reduce the amount a pac can contribute to a 
candidate for each primary runoff and general election to 1000 
and those who want to abolish labor and corporate pacs but 
allow contributions of up to 1000 from issueoriented 
unconnected pacs such as those of the national rife association and 
environmental groups 
a few republicans mcconnell said also endorsed the idea of 
socalled flexible ceilings placing no limit on how much a 
candidate can raise from homestate residents but capping 
contributions from outofstate donors 
i still believe that the president a former chairman of the 
republican national committee will veto a bill that has spending 
limits in or out of state said mcconnell a strong opponent of 
ceilings 
republicans he said are united on abolishing the use of 
socalled soft unreported money by unions and other taxexempt 
organizations for voter registration drives 
academic experts have estimated that unions spent up to 45 
million of such money in the 1988 election almost all of it 
benefiting democrats 
and it was through a taxexempt california voter registration 
project headed by the son of senate democratic whip alan cranston 
that phoenix savings and loan operator charles h keating jr gave 
850000 of the total 13 million contributed to five senators 
if youre taxexempt you shouldnt be playing the political 
game said dole if were really concerned about cleaning up 
the campaign sewer money then its about time to spray the sewer 
stench with a big can of legislative lysol

model marla maples declared her love for donald 
trump on national television but declined to characterize her 
relationship with the developer whose billions are in the sights of 
his estranged wife 
maples said to be the other woman in the muchdiscussed 
divorce case of donald and ivana trump was interviewed on a 
segment of abcs primetime live that aired thursday night 
her frosted blonde hair cascading in waves over the shoulders of 
her peachcolored suit maples spoke demurely haltingly at times 
but she never appeared flustered by the questions even the meaty 
ones which she politely declined to answer 
she would not say how she met trump nor would she comment on a 
reported confrontation she had with mrs trump in aspen colo 
where the trumps vacationed last year 
the segment was taped wednesday in a house owned by trumps 
friends jack and caroline davis in atlantic city nj where 
trump recently opened the glitzy taj mahal casino 
was she the reason for the trump split 
only the two of them know what really went wrong with their 
marriage but im not the reason for that marriage having 
problems she said adding as donald has said himself people 
just grow apart 
asked about a story in which an unnamed friend of maples quoted 
her as saying the best sex i ever had was with trump maples 
responded its just an absolute total lie that i said it 
when interviewer diane sawyer asked her straight out if it was 
the best sex she ever had maples said diane that has nothing 
to do with why im here 
maples said trump approved of her doing the interview 
apparently her first since the divorce story broke in february i 
made sure of that 
settlement of the divorce suit in which mrs trump is 
challenging the legitimacy of a marital contract that limited her 
alimony to a mere 25 million might depend in part on questions of 
fidelity 
do you love him sawyer asked maples 
i do love him answered maples 
do you want to marry him sawyer asked 
im taking my life day by day i am just hoping to go on 
maples said i mean who knows what life is going to bring in the 
future i have no control over that

the world health organization which 
considered withdrawing as sponsor of an upcoming aids conference in 
protest of us immigration policies will participate but is 
urging the bush administration to drop all entry restrictions on 
people with aids 
who directorgeneral hiroshi nakajima in a statement released 
in geneva and in washington on thursday welcomed the 
administrations effort to make it easier for people infected with 
the aids virus to attend the conference in san francisco in june 
however who views the situation as not completely 
satisfactory and strongly urges the united states to continue its 
efforts to drop all travel restrictions against hivinfected 
persons the head of the united nations agency added 
the administration last friday announced a new 10day visa for 
foreigners attending certain white houseapproved professional 
business and scientific conferences in the united states 
travelers obtaining the visa will not have to reveal whether 
they are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
which causes aids 
pressure had been building on the administration to take action 
that would quell the growing protest of us travel restrictions 
dozens of organizations and the governments of france and 
switzerland have indicated they will not send representatives to 
the conference because of the restrictions additionally the 
european parliament has called on scientists not to attend the 
conference 
nakajima gave initial indications to the us government on 
wednesday that who would announce thursday that it would remain 
cosponsor of the conference but would delay a decision on whether 
to attend said administration sources who demanded anonymity 
however after consulting with health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan and others nakajima decided that who 
would attend one source said 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said the administration has 
no plans to ease travel restrictions further but obviously we 
continue to study the situation 
dana van gorder a spokesman for the sixth international 
conference on aids said the administrations announcement of the 
visa last week has had virtually no impact on the groups that 
have said they will boycott 
i know of no organization that has changed its policy based on 
last fridays announcement van gorder said by telephone from san 
francisco 
he said that about onethird of the 7000 delegates that have 
registered for the conference are from other countries but he said 
he knows of about 100 organizations that have indicated they would 
not participate because of the travel restrictions 
van gorder said he welcomed the who decision to attend as well 
as the organizations promise to continue efforts to get all travel 
restrictions 
who participation in the conference is important to the major 
goal of ours which is distributing updated scientific information 
particularly in developing countries he said

the chairman of the national endowment of the 
arts is accusing a pornographyfighting minister of using 
distortion and intimidation to eliminate federal funding for his 
agency 
john e frohnmayer said thursday he was drafting a letter to the 
rev donald wildmon founder and executive director of the american 
family association in tupelo miss 
i simply have suggested to the rev wildmon that he should pay 
attention to the commandment against bearing false witness the 
nations top arts official said 
i respect his right to speak freely on the issue but i do not 
respect his use of falsehoods or halftruths or intimidation 
frohnmayer said i have repeatedly stated my opposition to 
obscenity in any form 
wildmon so objected to homosexual images from the catalogue of a 
federally funded exhibition at illinois state university that he 
photocopied and mailed them to all members of congress 
sealed inside envelopes marked extremely offensive material 
enclosed were 14 explicit photographs and drawings from the 
david wojnarowicz tongues of flame show mounted with a 15000 
nea grant the exhibition at the university galleries in normal 
ill ran through early march 
wildmons accompanying letter which asked the lawmakers to 
clean up the nea or abolish the agency altogether included 
several distortions frohnmayer said 
he said wildmon wrote that the illinois show went on view in 
january after frohnmayers appointment and after congress forbade 
nea financing of art that may be considered obscene and without 
serious literary artistic political or scientific value 
but frohnmayer said the grant was approved before the fall 
passage of the restrictions and prior to his appointment by 
president bush 
since receiving wildmons mailing several lawmakers have 
questioned whether to reauthorize the independent federal agency 
it provides seed money for such mainstream activities as opera 
dance and theater 
rep james saxton rnj says hes ready to deny funding to 
the nea 
they have got to adopt policies that keep this type of 
pornographic art from being displayed saxton said his office 
received nearly 300 postcards from constituents contacted by 
wildmon 
his colleague rep dean gallo rnj complained in a letter 
to frohnmayer that in supporting the illinois exhibit the nea 
jeopardized worthy local projects 
frankly support for the nea is fast disintegrating among 
members of congress and our constituencies gallo wrote 
but some lawmakers said they hadnt seen wildmons letter and 
the photos 
the offices of three congressmen involved in arts funding rep 
sidney yates dill rep pat williams dmont and rep bob 
carr dmich reported thursday that they had not seen the mailing 
staffers for rep christopher smith rnj said they threw it 
out before it reached the bosss desk 
such conservative lawmakers as sen jesse helms rnc and 
rep dana rohrabacher rcalif have attacked the nea for 
supporting exhibitions of controversial art by the late 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano 
in recent testimony before committees handling nea 
reauthorization frohnmayer has proposed modifying the grant 
process to make sure we know exactly what were being asked to 
fund before the money actually goes out 
but overall frohnmayer says the issue has been distorted 
it seems to me that the rev wildmon and others have whipped 
up a fair amount of hysteria on the basis of a very few images 
frohnmayer said 
were talking about maybe 20 images out of a million that we 
funded and maybe 20 to 25 grants out of 85000 grants that we have 
given in the last 24 years frohnmayer said 
to suggest that this agency is a purveyor of pornography or is 
somehow out of control simply ignores the 9999 percent of the work 
that we have done that has received nothing but praise

currency dealers said the dollars weakness followed from its 
overnight decline in new york where it fell to 15725 yen from 
158125 yen wednesday 
many dealers attributed the yens modest recovery after weeks of

treasury officials that they viewed the dollar as too strong 
masaaki tanahashi a dealer with mitsui taiyo kobe bank said 
trading was more active in crosstrading between the yen and west 
german mark rather than between the dollar and the yen 
the dollar seems to be in a box range tanahashi said 
securities dealers said the yens strength helped support the 
stock market 
the stock market began making a fullfledged recovery in the 
past couple of days though there remains some some mixed 
sentiment said toshiyuki nishiguchi an analyst with daiwa

iiis prank maia brodie vowed revenge and she got it taking a 
27500 bite out of his wallet 
i feel the damages were appropriate brodie said thursday 
after jurors upheld her civil lawsuit against hurth for biting her 
buttocks in a bar 2 years ago 
brodie said the reward would help ease her humiliation 
she was at the bar near st louis university where she studied 
law in september 1987 when hurth grabbed her hips and bit her 
brodie testified hurth and his friends laughed pointed and 
exchanged highfives she said 
the bite broke the skin on brodies buttocks causing searing 
and throbbing pain so severe she couldnt sit down for three days 
and was unable to attend classes said gerald greiman her lawyer 
hurth a lawyer admitted biting brodie but said he did not mean 
to hurt her and considered his action a compliment hurth testified 
he had previously bitten the buttocks of two other women at 
fraternity parties in 1981 and 1982 while attending vanderbilt 
university 
jurors deliberated about 90 minutes after hearing two days of 
testimony awarding brodie 2500 in actual damages and 25000 in 
punitive damages 
david hoven who represented hurth described brodies injury 
and the lawsuit as superficial arguing she should be awarded

crashed shortly after takeoff wednesday they were in stable 
condition in a hospital on thursday

oceans currents carried the wreckage from the crash site three 
miles south of the island 
the plane is practically intact except for the front part 
and was found in 90 feet of water fabrega said 
he declined to confirm the airlines statement wednesday that 
birds colliding with the right engine caused the crash 
something happened with the right engine but anything i would

the army has rejected a suggestion for a 
fouryear test to see how women would do in combatrelated jobs 
the army does not feel that a test is warranted we feel our 
current policy reflects the intent of congress by excluding women 
from the highest risk of direct combat the army said thursday in 
a statement 
the proposal from a test came last fall from the defense 
advisory committee on women in the services a panel founded in 
1951 to advise the department of defense on womens issues 
in its statement the army said its policy of barring women from 
direct combat is in line with the other services 
we currently offer women full career opportunities and 
maintain equitable advancement in schooling and promotion selection 
rates the army statement said 
by law women in the navy air force and marine corps can not be 
assigned on vessels or in aircraft that are engaged in combat 
missions 
but it is army policy not law that bars women from 
participating in its primary fighting elements such as infantry 
tank and most artillery units 
as experience in the invasion of panama showed women do serve 
in many of the armys supply or support units that could place them 
in the thick of battle 
last fall the committee said the limitation denies women 
handson experience to learn and to progress in a specialty 
the services can ill afford to continue to limit these women and 
their experiences in the face of the anticipated manpower shortages 
of the 1990s 
at the end of 1989 there were some 229000 women in the army 
navy air force and marines or 11 percent of the 2 millionstrong 
uniformed services

his threat and the other two were given 14 days each for mocking 
the religious beliefs of a fellow soldier an army spokesman said 
the army bars the eating of bread on bases during passover 
which commemorates the flight of the jews from slavery in egypt 
jews eat unleavened matzah during the eightday holiday to 
symbolize the hasty escape in which the jews did not have time to 
make real bread 
the confrontation came at a base in central israel where the 
three soldiers were talking politics israeli newspapers and radio 
reported 
when the two secular soldiers criticized rabbi eliezer schach 
and began eating bread the religious soldier cocked his gun and 
threatened to shoot them according to the reports the two secular 
soldiers calmed him down the reports said

this is the text of the statement 
released thursday by islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
it was translated from arabic into english by the associated press 
in beirut 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the occasion of the international day of jerusalem the 
organization of the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
reminds islamic nations throughout the world of the sacred central 
cause and calls upon the free revolutionary strugglers to mark this 
day with demonstrations and parades to whip up sentiments to uproot 
the cancer and continue the struggle against global arrogance 
this year the issue of jewish emigration is throwing an added 
burden on the shoulders of revolutionaries in the whole world 
prodding them to exert efforts and take measures to stop it by 
suicidal operations against all who participate in this matter 
especially those countries offering transit facilities 
the organization serves this final warning after the advice had 
been handed down on all those participating in this matter 
especially those countries offering transit facilities all 
civilians should stay away from the airports airlines and 
jetliners that will be the targets for operations mounted at times 
we deem adequate 
it cautions the revolutionary holy warriors that the principal 
danger which threatens them is the deviationist proposals that 
undermine our peoples uprising seeking to grab the helm of the 
uprisings leadership while it is in fact following a policy that 
gives israel peacefully what it has failed to get up till now by 
war the palestinian deviationist leaderships will not be immune 
from the just revenge and punishment 
our people should realize that all schemes hatched by global 
arrogance for elections or for the destiny of the west bank and 
the gaza sector are aimed at shielding the zionist nazis and 
finishing off the uprising they do not intend to help our people 
because the criminal arrogance seeks to slaughter this struggling 
people and not grant it any of its rights 
let no one imagine that he can achieve anything from hosni 
mubarak or the traitor king hussein or deviationist arafat or the 
others their treason shall remain stamped in our peoples memory 
the hands of the strugglers will reach all of them 
on this occasion we salute our brethren in zionist jails we 
shall spare no effort to liberate them and freedom god willing 
will be soon we single out the struggling sheik abdulkarim obeid 
whose detention stands as a slap to the cowards 
as for the release of the american hostage arrangements had 
been under way on the basis that they would be concluded and 
finalized but john kellys failure to respond has so far 
frustrated the release which made us postpone this operation until 
the picture is cleared 
until then we hope that brig gen ghazi kenaan president 
assads envoy will head to beirut to wrap up the issue upon 
arrival of kelly in damascus

bob hope is donating about 1800 acres of his 
mountain property and selling another 3800 acres for 20 million 
to a state agency to spare the rugged canyon country from 
development his attorney says 
this is a wonderful earth day present from mr hope to the 
people of california and the wildlife of the santa monica 
mountains said carl pope deputy conservation director of the 
sierra club sunday is the 20th celebration of earth day the event 
that kicked off the environmental crusade 
the agreement signed by hope yet to be finalized will open his 
coastal parkland to hikers and allow it to continue to serve as a 
corridor for migratory wildlife 
the 86yearold comedian has endured negative publicity in 
recent months over his sale of mountain lands to prospective 
developers and his refusal to consider giving or selling the land 
to park agencies hope has been acquiring land in the region for 35 
years 
the 20 million price tag on some 3800 acres in the santa 
susana mountains is below market value hopes lawyer payson 
wolff said thursday most of the property lies inside ventura 
county and the rest is in los angeles county 
once again bob hope has proven to be a generous supporter of 
the city mayor tom bradley said 
the deal is certain to be ranked as one of the largest parklands 
bequests in southern california 
wolff credited madge schaefer chairman of the ventura county 
board of supervisors with planting the seeds in hopes mind more 
than a year ago that yielded his bequest 
im delighted schaefer said thursday night it took quite 
a bit to ask him to give one more dime but im glad i did 
hopes contribution will help create public parklands extending 
from the inland santa clarita valley about 50 miles out to the 
pacific ocean schaefer said 
wolff said hopes change of heart came after meeting with 
conservationists 
i believe that he was motivated by the sincerity of some of 
the real responsible conservationists who impressed on him and 
convinced him the importance of having this property preserved in 
public parklands forever wolff said 
the criticism thats been leveled at mr hope as not being 
charitable as not being a good citizen was 
counterproductive wolff said as recently as march hope told 
the associated press that the criticism bugs the hell out of me 
the proposed agreement would transfer more than 80 percent of 
the entertainers land to the mountains recreation and conservation 
authority a public agency 
the centerpiece of the deal is the 4369acre runkle ranch that 
straddles the los angelesventura county line the rugged property 
above the santa susana pass includes canyons meadows and 
spectacular rock formations 
in addition the agreement would put an end to plans to build a 
golf course and country club on land hope owns in corral canyon in 
the seaside colony of malibu hope would proceed with the sale of 
adjacent land to a la jolla developer which still proposes a 
scaleddown residential development

the kennedys are fighting plans to 
designate as an historical site the seaside estate where john f 
kennedy held cabinet meetings and played touch football on the 
beach with family and friends 
the kennedy clan has hired a prominent local attorney to fight 
palm beachs efforts to give official landmark status to the 3 
million la guerida compound which served as a winter white 
house three decades ago 
but there can be no winner in the dispute said james sullivan 
chairman of the palm beach landmarks commission which today 
examines the towns proposal to designate the mediterranean 
revivalstyle mansion and its grounds 
no matter what happens the damage has been done sullivan 
said the kennedys have lost an opportunity to acknowledge the 
significance of a home that played such an important role in our 
nations history 
and its a slap to the local community who have welcomed the 
kennedy family for years 
if the commission approves the landmark status a final vote 
will be taken by the town council on june 11 
elizabeth burden an attorney for kennedy family matriarch rose 
kennedy said she will fight the historical designation on the 
grounds that it violated mrs kennedys right to due legal process 
the estate built in 1925 for department store mogul redman 
wanamaker will be among more than 30 structures up for landmark 
consideration sullivan said 
its very very unusual for any homeowner to fight the 
designation and none have done so to the extent of the kennedys 
said sullivan they have spent oodles of money on this and i 
really cant figure out why 
the kennedy family maintains it wants to retain complete control 
over the estate and that might be compromised by the landmark 
designation such a designation also could make the house less 
marketable to others desiring to change the property 
under town ordinance residents considering more than 2000 
worth of structural or cosmetic changes to their homes must receive 
approval from one of two boards if the home is deemed a historical 
site the landmarks commission must authorize the changes 
although 99yearold rose kennedy no longer spends winters in 
palm beach the estate is still used by family members including 
sen ted kennedy dmass

fortysix australian veterans some 
over 100 years old left today for turkey to commemorate the world 
war ii campaign at gallipoli regarded as one of the great military 
defeats of the war 
they flew on board a specially configured qantas boeing 747300 
jet that included a minihospital staffed by royal australian air 
force surgeons in case any of the veterans became ill during the 
trip 
prime minister bob hawke and other members of the government sat 
in the back and the veterans traveled firstclass in front of the 
plane 
the oldest was 103 and the trip was expected to be difficult 
for some of the veterans all at least 90 to break up the journey 
the group was to spend 30 hours in singapore before flying to the 
site of the battles 
the veterans were scheduled to arrive in istanbul on sunday 
jack hazlitt 92 was a runner or dispatcher of military 
cables at gallipoli 
we thought it was a glorious chance to see the world for 
nothing he said that attitude didnt last long very few of 
us survived you could say im one of the lucky ones 
australia lost more than 8000 soldiers 
most of the australian soldiers were called diggers and 
93yearold george mitchell said the term developed because all 
we did when not fighting was to dig dig and dig trenches 
the veterans will take part in ceremonies on the gallipoli 
peninsula on wednesday to commemorate the troop landings in 1915 by 
australian new zealand british french and indian troops 
in world war i the ottoman turkish empire was allied with 
germany and austria against britain its dominions france and 
russia 
the gallipoli peninsula lies on the northern side of the 
dardanelles strait in northwestern turkey the object of the 
campaign which military historians call the first combined naval 
and land operation of modern warfare was to open the turkish 
straits to russia capture istanbul then known as constantinople 
and take the ottoman empire out of the war 
gallipoli was a battleground for nine months until the invading 
forces were evacuated in december 1915 and january 1916 
the total casualty list for the invaders was 33532 killed 
78518 wounded and 7689 missing of these 8587 australians were 
killed and 19367 wounded 
the battle gave the turks a modern hero kemal ataturk who made 
his name as a military genius in gallipoli 
australia commemorates the campaign each year with a national 
day of remembrance for those killed in the 191418 war and for 
those who gave their lives in other wars 
in the australian consciousness two things stand out about 
gallipoli said bob carr leader of the labor opposition in the 
state of new south wales first the courage and valor of our 
troops and second that it was a defeat a military disaster

the latest in a nervewracking series of 
aftershocks to a feb 28 earthquake rattled parts of southern 
california but no injuries or damage were reported 
the temblor thursday night centered about 5 miles west of 
upland registered 35 on the richter scale said robert finn a 
spokesman for the california institute of technology in pasadena 
were becoming a model city for earthquakes you know 
police sgt dan milakovich said we must be leading the nation 
the tremor felt in areas of san bernardino county and eastern 
los angeles county was an aftershock of a 55magnitude quake that 
struck near upland on feb 28 finn said 
hundreds of noticeable quakes have shuddered through the area 
since the upland quake including a 46magnitude temblor and 
several smaller aftershocks tuesday 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 55 reflects a quake 10 times as 
strong as one of 45

the british parliament voted to guarantee 
citizenship to about 225000 hong kong residents but china 
complained today the move will hasten an exodus from the colony 
before the chinese takeover in 1997 
defying predictions of possible defeat prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative administration comfortably won a house of 
commons vote on the issue thursday night 
the chamber approved the bill 313216 supporters triumphed over 
opposition from rightwingers in the governing party who oppose 
more immigration and leaders of the socialist opposition labor 
party who called the bill elitist 
because of that allied opposition the bill was regarded as one 
of the toughest legislative tests for mrs thatchers government 
since she took power in 1979 
it now will be examined by a commons committee but it is 
virtually assured of becoming law later this year 
british officials say the bill would help prevent a mass flight 
of residents from the colony on the southeastern coast of china 
hong kong is suffering a crisis of confidence because of worries 
over what will happen once communist china takes over more than 
1000 people are emigrating each week including many who are among 
the colonys best educated 
home secretary david waddington has argued that giving british 
citizenship to 50000 key hong kong residents and their families 
would prevent a brain drain and maintain confidence in the colony 
before it reverts to china in 1997 
china has said the colony can keep its capitalist economy for 50 
years after the transfer and it has pledged to allow local 
autonomy 
a statement released today in hong kong by the xinhua news 
agency which is the chinese diplomatic mission there said the 
plan would be divisive and encourage more talented people to flee 
the territory 
in the statement released just hours after the vote xinhua 
reiterated that beijing regards hong kong chinese as its citizens 
whose nationality can be determined only by its laws 
it said the british plan was a scheme to have british people 
governing hong kong after 1997 but it did not elaborate 
china will reserve the right to take appropriate measures in 
response the statement said again without elaborating 
labor party leaders had told their members to vote against the 
bill on grounds that only hong kongs elite business people 
administrators senior police officers and others would be given 
passports 
a report today from the henley center an independent economic 
forecasting group said such immigrants would likely fill skill 
shortages in britain in the coming decade because they are 
professional people who speak english 
the report commissioned by the british broadcasting corp was 
written by economics professor bernard corry of london university 
and two other professors 
it said hong kong immigrants are likely to be highly 
adaptable they should thus be quickly in a position to adjust to 
the new labor market circumstances in which they find themselves

owners of restaurants and bars where alcohol 
is served are fighting a law forcing them to post signs warning 
that beer wine and liquor can cause birth defects addiction and 
intoxication 
the florida restaurant association filed suit wednesday in 
circuit court challenging the constitutionality of the hillsborough 
county ordinance 
the restaurants were ordered to post signs warning patrons not 
to drink during pregnancy before driving or while taking either 
prescription or nonprescription drugs the signs were to include 
the postscript it can be fatal 
attorneys for the trade group claimed the signs will cause 
irreparable injury to the establishments restaurateurs complain 
that the warnings are ineffective and stigmatize moderate drinkers 
if one person reads that sign and it prevents someone from 
getting hurt that sign would be worth it countered commissioner

mikhail s gorbachev has offered latvia and 
estonia special status in a new soviet confederation in a bid 
to prevent them from following lithuanias secession drive baltic 
journalists and officials said 
however an estonian government official said his republic was 
unlikely to back down and declared that it was in the same boat 
as lithuania 
the soviet presidents proposals came at separate meetings in 
moscow on thursday with leaders of the two baltic republics 
however endel lippma estonias minister for intergovernmental 
negotiations said gorbachev also threatened the republic with 
economic action and said he would not negotiate unless the 
estonians rescind a declaration that their republic is an occupied 
independent state 
the soviets have imposed an energy embargo on lithuania which 
declared independence march 11 
estonian and latvia have not formally declared independence but 
have said they want to pursue it 
gorbachev reportedly told their leaders the republics could 
belong to a confederation which could imply a major concession 
because the russian word is used for a loosely allied organization 
like the british commonwealth 
gorbachev previously spoke only of a federation like the 
united states where the states have specific powers but the 
national government is strong 
however gorbachev did not define what he meant by 
confederation lippma said 
lippma reported in a telephone interview that gorbachev said 
if some kind of blockade has to be imposed part of the 
population might get very angry and there would be bloodshed and 
in that case he would impose presidential rule 
and then we would find out what occupation really is lippma 
added 
presidential rule can include martial law and suspension of 
parliament 
lippma said president arnold ruutel of estonia likely will heed 
gorbachevs request that parliament formally reconsider the 
estonian declaration probably on monday however he said a 
reversal was very unlikely 
we have no clearcut commitment of what we would get in return 
if we canceled it he said so estonia and lithuania are very 
much in the same boat 
similarly gorbachev told president anatoly gorbunov of latvia 
and his delegation that he would not talk further if they declare 
independence on may 3 as planned said aris yansons gorbunovs 
assistant 
gorbachev has said he believes disintegration of the soviet 
union would lead to great ethnic violence but that danger is 
considered more likely in the volatile south than in the baltic 
region 
gorbachevs tone with the latvians was highly critical said 
raimons lochmelis of the information office of the latvian peoples 
front he based that assessment on comments on the meeting by 
another participant peoples front president dainis ivans 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov also promised that if 
latvia remains in the union he would consider the republics 
demand that its draftees serve in the soviet army only on latvian 
soil yansons said 
lochemelis quoted ivans as saying they found it very difficult 
to persuade gorbachev that independence is supported by most 
latvians not just a few fanatics

plans by a large new york public relations 
concern to direct an antiabortion publicity campaign for the 
nations roman catholic bishops have incited rebellion in the 
companys ranks 
hill amp knowlton inc said thursday it will go forward with the 
project despite continued protest from its workers the bishops 
intend to pay the firm up to 5 million over three to five years 
about onethird of the companys headquarters staff signed a 
letter of protest arguing that the bishops seek to deny women a 
basic right others have complained individually and one quit 
there could be other fallout two minor clients have withdrawn 
and many others have expressed disappointment according to 
dissident executives who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear 
of jeopardizing their careers 
playboy enterprises inc which has hired hill amp knowlton in the 
past is undecided about using it again 
our decision will be impacted by our principles weve been 
longstanding supporters of reproductive rights said playboy 
spokeswoman robyn radomski 
whatever playboys decision she said we feel its 
regrettable that such a big powerhouse pr firm has put itself in 
such a bad pr situation 
the irony dissident executives said is that one of hill amp 
knowltons specialties is advising companies how to avoid just such 
turmoil they said its own failure could reflect poorly on the 
company 
we have used extraordinarily poor judgment in our very own 
area of expertise one said the firm violated everything we 
would advise a client to do about consulting employees every basic 
rule was violated 
hill amp knowlton conceded no error 
i dont think weve made a mistake as a firm in taking on this 
account said john berard a spokesman in the companys 
washington office which will handle the work we knew it was 
going to be controversial 
the reaction of the companys staff was reflective of 
society berard said he said employees are not compelled to work 
on projects to which they object 
although some hill amp knowlton employees objected primarily to 
the companys lack of consultation with its staff the protest 
letter to chief executive officer robert dilenschneider focused on 
the issue of abortion itself 
for management to seek out as well as accept an assignment 
whose ultimate goal is to limit our fundamental rights leaves us 
with a stinging sense of betrayal the letter said in part our 
rights it seems mattered less than the promise of additional 
revenue 
employees said 136 out of about 400 headquarters workers signed 
the letter moreover they said several employees have offered to 
provide free public relations advice to groups that advocate 
abortion rights 
berard would not specify how the firm was responding to its 
employees concerns saying that was an internal matter 
were certainly not denying that some of our people have 
raised complaints he said were not ignoring the comments of 
some of our people and were moving forward to service our 
client 
the public relations campaign for the bishops is undefined but 
is to start with a public opinion poll to gauge attitudes about 
abortion then proceed with a classic public information effort 
seeking to promote the bishops antiabortion views berard said 
a spokesman for the bishops conference had no comment on the 
hill amp knowlton controversy

sen john glenn is pressing the pentagon to 
find out how much radioactive material is buried on military bases 
so the government can figure out cleanup costs and the impact on 
baseclosing plans 
none of the three services has a complete grip on what type 
and how much lowlevel radioactive waste it has generated said 
glenn dohio on thursday he made public a report prepared at his 
request by the general accounting office 
glenn said he wanted the auditors to figure out how much it will 
cost the military to deal with its waste but they didnt have 
enough information to even attempt an estimate all they could say 
with certainty was that the cost of disposing of the waste is going 
to skyrocket 
the army has found that surcharges tacked onto the cost of 
disposing of its lowlevel radioactive waste over the next few 
years will be higher than the actual disposal cost the senator 
said 
we cant even take a guess as to what the navy and air force 
may have to pay because they dont have accurate records glenn

the house budget committee has approved a plan 
that preserves spending on the super collider at more than 300 
million next year a level that falls short of the presidents 
request but exceeds democratic leaders initial recommendations 
a plan backed by democratic leaders could have brought spending 
on the huge particle accelerator to 278 million in the fiscal year 
that begins oct 1 according to rep john bryant dtexas 
but bryant said he was able thursday to convince budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif to restore 40 million 
of a proposed 60 million cut in spending on department of energy 
science projects 
had the 60 million cut gone through bryant said twothirds of 
it or 40 million would likely have been shaved from the super 
collider bringing down ssc spending from 318 million to 278 
million 
under the plan approved thursday the ssc would receive 304 
million said bryant a member of the committee 
the ssc spending is part of a 124 trillion budget for fiscal 
1991 approved on a 2114 partyline vote debate in the full house 
was scheduled for next week 
the budget resolution serves as a general guide for 
congressional authorizing and appropriating committees

with a new colt semiautomatic rifle comes 
pressure on president bush to support legislation banning 
domestically produced assaulttype weapons 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio wrote thursday to bush saying 
colt manufacturing cos new sporter just now arriving in 
stores is only slightly modified from the ar15 assaultstyle 
rifle which colt industries stopped producing for the civilian 
market last year 
colt manufacturing co the successor to the colt firearms 
division of colt industries inc says the sporter differs 
substantially from the ar15 and is not an assaultstyle weapon 
when your administration banned foreignmade assault weapons 
last year i said that it was a good first step toward protecting 
the lives of innocent crime victims in general and law enforcement 
officers in particular metzenbaum wrote to bush 
however the failure to take the next logical step to 
implement restrictions on americanmade assault weapons defeats 
the very purpose of your initiative he said 
metzenbaum urged bush to support a crime bill now in congress 
that would ban domestic assaultstyle weapons

the leader of albania eastern europes 
last hardline communist state has said he wants to restore ties 
with the united states and the soviet union 
communist leader ramiz alia also outlined economic reforms to 
increase production and improve supplies including some private 
farming however he rejected any notion of following the reforms 
that have ended communist rule in most soviet bloc countries 
alia spoke at the closing session of a communist central 
committee meeting tuesday an english translation was provided by 
the state ata news agency thursday 
we have wanted and want friendly relations with all the 
countries irrespective of their social system alia said 
the problem of the reestablishment of the diplomatic 
relations with the united states of america and the soviet union is 
on the agenda alia was quoted by ata as saying 
although the united states and the soviet union have offered 
diplomatic relations in the past alia charged that moscow and 
washington were responsible for the lack of ties 
he said albania was also interested in relations with britain 
since becoming party leader in april 1985 alia has pursued a 
policy of slowly opening the country establishing diplomatic 
relations with dozens of countries 
albania a country of more than 3 million is considered the 
last bastion of stalinism it broke with the soviet union in 1961 
over moscows policy of destalinization and with china in 1978 
because of beijings perceived deviation from marxistleninist 
tenets 
in his speech alia said albania also is interested in 
establishing diplomatic ties with the european common market 
the communist leader said albanias economic reforms would in 
some cases link wages to production force some companies to become 
selfsupporting and allow prices at least partially to be 
determined by the market 
alia said that in an effort to increase the food supply 
peasants working on cooperative farms could decide for themselves 
whether they prefer to work individual plots

june 1989 its application with the us patent and trademark 
office is pending 
sharon green director of accounting at the sweet adelines 
tulsa office said the group plans to pursue the name change

zealand japan and canada 
the group was founded in 1945 for women who wanted to experience 
the bliss of barbershop harmony

adelines said the group has come a long way since its founding and 
the adoption of the name from harry armstrongs 1903 song youre 
the flower of my heart sweet adeline 
some people dont think sweet adelines indicates what our 
organization is about ms jacobs said

a shiite moslem leader reputed to have 
influence with kidnappers holding three americans said today the 
release of one captive is certain despite a cowboy mentality on 
the part of the united states 
hussein musawi who heads a prosyrian wing within the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god said in a telephone 
interview the delay is certain the complications are certain 
but the release is also certain 
on thursday proiranian kidnappers said they would postpone 
indefinitely freeing an american hostage 
musawi said the delay was caused by washingtons rejection of 
the kidnappers key demand that assistant secretary of state for 
the near east john kelly fly to damascus syria to finalize the 
release 
but kellys failure to respond is not going to cancel the 
release the hostage might be released in another manner maybe 
dialogue i cannot speculate further i cant lie musawi said 
asked when he expected the release to take place he said 
that depends on how farsighted the americans might become so 
far their behavior is arrogant and one of cowboy mentalty 
if someone decides to return a hostage the other side is 
supposed to take the hostage musawi said 
syria said late thursday that it was working to secure the 
release of a hostage by this weekend 
musawi heads islamic amal or islamic hope a faction within 
hezbollah that advocates strong links with syria 
he is believed to be the mentor of the underground islamic jihad 
for the liberation of palestine the group holds professors alann 
steen a native of boston who turns 51 on sunday jesse turner 
42 of boise idaho and robert polhill 55 of new york 
the three were kidnapped from the campus of the usaffiliated 
beirut university college on jan 24 1987 by gunmen posing as 
riot police 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine said wednesday 
it would free a hostage by this evening if the united states met 
its conditions 
but it announced thursday that it was postponing its plans after 
the united states refused to dispatch kelly 
president bush said the united states does not knuckle under 
to demands 
as ambassador to lebanon during the reagan administration kelly 
was involved in secret discussions with the white house on 
negotiations for the release of american hostages in return for 
arms sales to iran kelly now is us assistant secretary of state 
for near eastern affairs 
peggy say the sister of american hostage terry anderson said 
she was totally puzzled by the attitude of reluctance to move 
forward and get on with this if they want john kelly send them 
john kelly 
mt mehdi president of the americanarab relations committee 
in new york said in a statement that the united states fumbled 
an opportunity to help gain freedom for a hostage 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa expressed optimism late 
thursday however he said his government had been exerting a 
great deal of influence to secure a release by sunday he would 
not elaborate 
he spoke amid a series of meetings with the us ambassador to 
syria edward djerejian djerejian who had been at a diplomatic 
meeting in west germany with kelly flew to damascus thursday he 
did not speak with reporters 
syria and iran have urged kidnappers to end the hostage crisis 
and free the 18 westerners held in lebanon 
the announcement by the kidnappers that they would release one 
captive implied some sort of exchange was involved and the 
communique was accompanied by an instant photograph of turner the 
first of him alone since three months after his abduction 
the statement announcing the postponement was accompanied by an 
instant photograph of polhill 
the group also renewed threats to attack jetliners and airports 
used to transport thousands of soviet jewish emigrants to israel 
much of the 500word statement released thursday was devoted to 
the rising number of jewish emigrants who arab leaders say could 
strengthen israel and displace palestinians in the occupied 
territories 
as for the release of the american hostage arrangements had 
been under way on the basis that they would be concluded and 
finalized the statement said 
but kellys failure to respond has so far frustrated the 
release which made us postpone this operation until the picture is 
cleared it said 
a senior us official said kellys participation would have 
engaged the united states in hostage negotiations or at least given 
that appearance 
the release would have been the first of an american since david 
jacobsen director of the american university hospital was freed 
on nov 2 1986 after more than 17 months in captivity 
eight americans are among the western hostages held in lebanon 
by proiranian groups the longestheld is anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985

a court today rejected an appeal for political 
asylum from a chinese man accused of hijacking a chinese airliner 
to japan lawyers said 
if a final appeal to the justice minister fails zhang zhenhai 
36 of chinas hebei province will be extradited to china and 
could face execution one of his lawyers said after the tokyo high 
courts decision was announced 
in a statement released through his lawyers in january zhang 
said the hijacking was a lastditch attempt to flee political 
persecution following his involvement in prodemocracy protests in 
beijing last spring chinese authorities crushed the studentled 
protests in beijings tiananmen square 
police said zhang hijacked the plane on dec 16 threatening to 
blow it up with a bomb he did not actually have the boeing 747 on 
a flight from beijing to new york with 233 people aboard flew to 
fukuoka in southwestern japan after south korea refused to let it 
land there 
after landing zhang was shoved out of the plane by a crew 
member and hospitalized with a broken pelvis the plane was 
returned to china on dec 17 with 208 passengers on board 
including zhangs wife and 13yearold son 
yaeko takeoka one of three japanese lawyers representing zhang 
said she was shocked that despite the evidence that mr zhang was 
actively involved in the tiananmen protests they ruled against 
him 
a prodemocracy activist yue wu testified during the trial 
that he had met zhang three times in beijing during the protests 
yue escaped china after the crackdown and was granted asylum in 
france 
prosecutors maintained however that zhang was not involved in 
antigovernment activities and that he hijacked the aircraft to 
escape criminal charges in china and seek work in japan 
china demanded that zhang who has been in police custody since 
dec 31 be returned to stand trial 
chinas staterun television has carried reports on the 
hijacking that said zhang had been arrested in october on charges 
of embezzling from a factory 
chinese authorities have executed hijackers in the past 
ms takeoka said zhangs lawyers were filing an appeal to the 
justice minister however she said she thought it would be 
difficult to overturn the decision on his extradition 
zhangs japanese lawyers also said todays decision indicated 
the japanese legal system was still slow in recognizing human 
rights 
the japan branch of the londonbased human rights group amnesty 
international said in a statement it was deeply concerned about 
the courts decision it made an appeal to justice minister shin 
hasegawa 
a foreign ministry official however defended the decision 
zhang should be tried for the hijacking there is no evidence 
suggesting that he is a political refugee ministry spokesman 
taizo watanabe said

shops and offices were closed in the west bank 
and gaza strip today in a strike called by islamic fundamentalists 
who lead the uprising against the israeli occupation 
plobacked leaders of the palestinian uprising also called for 
new tactics in the 28monthold revolt including using general 
strikes as confrontation days with israeli authorities 
confrontation days typically include increased 
stonethrowing blocking roads slogan writing and antiisraeli 
demonstrations 
in the past most palestinians have stayed home during strikes 
often making them calmer than other days in the occupied 
territories 
during todays strike which coincided with the final friday of 
the moslem fasting month of ramadan the islamic fundamentalist 
movement hamas or zeal allowed taxis and buses to operate so they 
could carry moslems to prayer services the strike also closed 
businesses in arab east jerusalem 
the call for tactical changes in the revolt against israeli 
occupation came in a leaflet issued thursday by the unified 
leadership of the uprising 
among the new tactics is a call for palestinians to turn out 
their lights for 15 minutes on may 5 to protest the continued 
closure of palestinian universities on april 28 drivers were 
asked to halt their vehicles and honk their horns for five minutes 
to show solidarity with arabs deported by israel 
new modes of protest had been demanded by the marxist popular 
front for the liberation of palestine which accused the united 
leadership of complacency and threatened to break away the marxist 
front and other factions of the palestine liberation organization 
which back the leadership issued a joint statement earlier this 
week promising a change in tactics 
the latest leaflet also called for new controls in dealing with 
palestinians suspected of collaborating with israel 
at least 207 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs since 
the start of the uprising most on suspicion of informing on 
uprising activists the leaflet said collaborators should be 
ostracized socially but there should be no killings without 
special orders issued by highranking circles 
aside from the collaborator deaths israeli soldiers or 
civilians have killed 674 palestinians in the uprising and 43 
israelis have died

lech walesa won an overwhelming vote of 
confidence from solidarity at the unions second national congress 
today after delivering an impassioned defense of his 10 years as 
the movements leader 
on the congress second day and just 24 hours before an expected 
reelection bid walesa asked for a show of support delegates 
present responded with a vote of 357 in favor one against and 22 
abstentions 
walesas earlier impromptu address highlighted internal tensions 
in the movement that weathered repression and toppled the communist 
government since it last met as a whole in 1981 
the victory i am giving to you the mistakes are ours but 
all the mistakes we made you should correct here and today he 
said 
i did this only for poland not for myself it was our 
mutual victory i was only the driver 
walesa still immensely important in poland despite some 
slippage in popularity polls accepted the vote of confidence with 
his arms extended in the traditional solidarity v for victory 
the crowd chanted the fond diminutive of his first name 
lechu lechu lechu 
walesa is to run for reelection as union chairman saturday he 
was likely to retain control of solidarity as it struggles to 
decide how much of a union and how much of a political force it 
will be in postcommunist poland 
parliament member andrzej malachowski appealed to fellow 
delegates to end intrigue saying stop it please lech walesa 
has well served the fatherland 
walesa called for the confidence vote in a second speech after 
delegates criticized his morning address one delegate said it had 
served only to raise the temperature of emotions 
the scheduled sixday meeting is being held in the same olivia 
sports hall where the union met for 18 stormy days in the autumn of 
1981 
communist authorities declared military rule to crush solidarity 
only two months later forcing the union into an eightyear battle 
to regain legal status and worker rights 
recalling how he led solidaritys founding during a 1980 gdansk 
shipyard strike walesa said today it was just my luck that i 
jumped over the shipyard fence but you liked my jump and that is 
why you chose me to lead this vehicle called solidarity 
from the begining driving this vehicle was very hard he 
said today after 10 years of experience we still have trouble 
several times during the speech he acknowledged making mistakes 
i thank all who worked together with me and against me i 
apologize to all those i offended he concluded 
before walesas speech the congress voted to admit as 
nonvoting guests all members of the 1981 union leadership not 
among the 487 elected delegates included were several who have 
broken with the mainstream of solidarity 
in the past some accused walesa of undemocratic rule others 
opposed any compromise with the former communist government 
including the negotiations that led to junes partly free elections 
and last falls installation of the first noncommunist government 
in the east bloc 
walesa threatened to leave the hall if certain members of the 
former leadership showed up although he did not specify who he 
meant 
i will leave this meeting for all the offense for distruction 
of the union for talking about losing ideals i will not sit 
with those gentlemen at the same table he said to applause from 
the hall 
walesa then declined to offer the scheduled report on the 
unions activities since the last congress and turned the 
microphone over to someone not so emotionally linked janusz 
palubicki a longtime solidarity leader 
palubicki recounted the battle to preserve solidarity amid 
jailings of its leaders and thousands of supporters confiscation 
of equipment and public attacks by communist authorities 
even as it faces deep questions about its future solidarity 
launched the congress thursday celebrating its triumphs present 
for the first day was prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki once 
imprisoned for his solidarity activism 
the union regained legal status only on april 17 1989 then 
after the june elections took control of the government 
but solidarity has managed to sign up only 22 million of the 10 
million members it had in 1981 opinion polls show confidence 
dropping as the public undergoes economic hardships associated with 
the strict austerity program being pursued by the 
solidaritycreated government 
economic restructuring is forcing plant closures and raising 
unemployment among the industrial workers who comprise the backbone 
of solidarity 
the delegates are expected to debate how much they want 
solidarity to be confined to union issues decide whether to create 
a solidaritylinked political party and draw up a union program 
before the congress closes tuesday

a group hunting nazi war criminals said today 
it will give the united states west germany and australia the 
names of 223 lithuanians and poles believed to have taken part in 
the murder of nearly 200000 jews in world war ii 
efraim zuroff israel director of the los angelesbased simon 
wiesenthal center said the names were among 1284 mentioned in 
documents given last year by leibl kunichowsky an elderly 
holocaust suvivor who now lives in sunrise fla to the archives 
of the yad vashem holocaust memorial 
kunichowsky a civil engineer who lived in kaunas lithuania 
went from refugee camp to refugee camp in 194549 taking testimony 
from survivors each statement was signed and witnessed 
unlike other areas of europe where jews died mainly in nazi gas 
chambers the interviews show that many of the jews in lithuania 
were shot by local partisans zuroff said 
they werent deported to death camps he said they were 
murdered locally and the collaborators played an extremely 
significant role often carrying out the killing themselves 
the lists name nazi collaborators suspected of taking part in 
the murder of nearly 200000 jews he said 
so far zuroff said researchers have carefully examined only 
half of kunichowskys list he said there was a chance of 
prosecuting only about onethird of the suspects because many have 
died others are too old to stand trial and some cannot be traced 
because full names and other details are missing 
what we will be able to achieve in bringing some to trial is 
only symbolic justice which will serve as a warning to the 
murderers of tomorrow he said 
zuroff said the names of 38 prime suspects will be sent to the 
us justice departments office of special investigations next 
week the names of 130 other suspected collaborators will be turned 
over to the west german embassy and 55 will be given to the 
australian embassy on monday 
other lists of names will be sent soon to canada and england 
kunichowsky had kept his material in hopes of writing a book 
but he turned the documents over to yad vashem last year 
the weisenthal center researchers crosschecked the names with 
other records at yad vashem and files from an international red 
cross tracing service in west germany some of those listed were 
already known as war crimes suspects but most were new zuroff 
said 
he said the names would not be made public so as not to tip off 
the suspects and because in some cases further investigation is 
needed to establish identity 
the 1683 pages of testimony were taken in yiddish the 
daytoday language of many european jews and contain graphic 
accounts of the terror faced by 171 jewish communities that were 
uprooted

is titled cartoon allstars to the rescue a halfhour special 
warning youngsters about drug and alcohol abuse 
in what participants call an unprecedented show of industry 
cooperation the networks cable channels and more than 200 
independent stations will show the program saturday morning 
they want to be able to reach every single kid who watches 
television and we know from experience with kids that the way to 
grab their attention is to use characters they know to convey a 
story and a message said phyllis tucker vinson nbc vice 
president for childrens programming 
the participating cable networks are black entertainment 
television the disney channel nickelodeon and the usa network 
ted turners tbs and tnt cable networks and lifetime also will run 
the program but at different times 
allstars which will have no commercials tells the story 
of michael a 14yearold drug abuser who is saved with help from 
bugs bunny garfield the chipmunks alf slimer and other cartoon 
characters familiar to children 
george c scott provides the voice of smoke a sinister 
drugpushing apparition 
the program financed with nearly 2 million from mcdonalds 
corp and its charities was produced under the auspices of the los 
angelesbased academy of television arts and science 
in a speech in los angeles last month president bush praised 
the show and said that the days when popular culture glorified 
and glamorized drug use are fading fast 
a 15minute preview thursday in washington won applause from 
members of congress with a hint of skepticism 
i hope this doesnt devolve into a mere selfpromotion 
activity in which we finally hear from hollywood and this is the 
final shot said rep john conyers dmich showing this once 
or twice isnt really going to change anybodys mind whos going to 
use drugs 
vinson in a phone interview from her nbc office in burbank 
calif said there have been no discussions yet for further 
programs 
we have not talked about it she said i think it will 
depend on what the reaction to this show is but of course there 
are other subjects that we could get involved in 
vinson who has four children and expects her fifth next month 
said she plans to watch the cartoon with her two oldest children 
and then ill talk about it with them i hope a lot of parents do 
that 
because the show is unsponsored it wont be rated by the ac 
nielsen co she said i wish it were so that we could tell how 
many kids were watching she said 
the shows saturday air times in the different time zones are 
1030 am edt 930 am cdt 830 am mdt and 930 am pdt

gov roy romer urged a gun club to call off 
a prairie dog shooting contest that has drawn protest from animal 
rights groups 
romer said he lacks the power to stop the july 1415 event 
billed as the top dog world championship prairie dog shoot but 
argued that it is wrong to make a spectacle of the killing of 
prairie dogs 
participants will compete in 50 twomember teams and attempt to 
kill the most praire dogs at the greatest distrance the contest is 
to take place on private farms and ranches around naturita and 
nucla two hamlets in western colorado about 100 miles south of 
grand junction organizers said 
hours before the governor made his announcement thursday us 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo accused him of dodging the 
controversy romer had said wednesday he wouldnt try to stop the 
event because it is a local issue 
to think people would turn it into a bloody circus is 
macabre said campbell from washington i know its an election 
year but roy should think about this again this is something he 
should take a stand on 
stan austin one of the organizers said of romers stance 
well those things happen we realize there are people on both 
sides of this issue 
austin said he doesnt understand how the contest could be 
regarded as a circus its a group of sportsmen competing he 
said i believe its more humane to kill them with a rifle than 
poison 
residents of the area complain that prairie dogs multiply 
rapidly and create burrows in which cattle can break their legs 
they also damage irrigation systems in a state where water is at a 
premium wide poisoning is banned by the federal government because 
the poison can be picked up by eagles and other predators of 
prairie dogs 
an animal rights activist said the contest is promoting 
killing for killings sake 
im a vegetarian but i have respect for people who eat what 
they kill said robin duxbury president of the rocky mountain 
humane society but these people arent hunting for any reason i 
dont know anyone who eats prairie dog stew

the crew of the uss iowa lined the rails of 
the battleship as families of the 47 sailor killed in a gun turret 
explosion came together on the anniversary of the tragedy 
more than 300 family members attended thursdays memorial 
service aboard the world war ii battleship at the norfolk naval 
base the ceremony ended with the dedication of a plaque mounted on 
gun turret no 2 where the explosion occurred 
capt fred p moosally commander of the iowa praised the 
families for their support 
there are many of the families of our fallen shipmates 
themselves who realized that the crew was as much a victim as they 
were and who despite their own personal sacrifice lovingly 
offered their own special support and encouragement he said 
the memorial service to mark the april 19 1989 explosion was 
private but the navy released copies of remarks among those 
attending was kathy kubicina sister of the iowa sailor accused by 
the navy of causing the blast 
seven weeks after the explosion in gun turret no 2 the iowa 
left for six months in the mediterranean and moosally said he and 
the crew were encouraged by the letters from the families 
they lifted us up when we were down they gave us 
understanding when we were being categorized in neat little sound 
bites they helped us feel that we were not alone he said 
likewise the crew has remembered the families 
robert jones of newport news whose son brian died in the 
explosion spoke before the ceremony of four iowa sailors who drove 
all night from norfolk to be at his sons burial in kennesaw ga 
today the loss of my son hangs deep within me just as i know 
it does in the hearts of the 46 other families who lost their 
sons jones said but when i am feeling low i think of those 
four iowa sailors my sons shipmates and what they did for us on 
that sad day almost a year ago 
it is a memory that will remain with me forever he said 
questions still remain about the explosion during gunnery 
exercises off the coast of puerto rico a fivemonth navy 
investigation concluded the explosion was sabotage by gunners mate 
clayton hartwig who died in the blast 
a subcommittee of the house armed services committee held 
hearings and found the navys conclusion was not supported by the 
facts hartwigs sister and other families are trying to get the 
investigation reopened 
kreig brusnahan an attorney representing the hartwigs and two 
other families said his clients are considering suing the navy 
some of the families are trying to get the navy to donate the 
battleship for a museum the ship is expected to be retired later 
this year 
as far as im concerned the ship belongs to us said john 
hague of la mesa nm whose stepson lt jg philip buch died

associated press that the 15man executive committee met in an 
overnight session under chairman yasser arafat

necessary to confront the influx of soviet jews israeli threats 
against iraq and to esclate the intefadeh or palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation which has raged since december 
1987 
western reports have suggested that iraq is trying to build 
nuclear weapons iraq and other arab countries said the reports 
were part of a campaign aimed at preparing international public 
opinion for an attack on iraq

supported iraqs threat last week to use chemical weapons against 
israel if it is attacked by israel 
the news agency quoted arafat as calling the warning an 
assurance of a longawaited arab deterence in the face of israeli 
arrogance and american hegemony 
the executive committee authorized arafat to contact arab 
leaders on the need to convene the emergency arab summit soon 
arafat arrived on thursday from amman jordan where he 
discussed with king hussein the arab summit issue he is expected 
to fly to saudi arabia on saturday for similar talks with king fahd 
arabs fear that thousands of soviet jews emigrating to israel 
will settle in the occupied territories captured from israels arab 
neighbors they fear that the influx will lead to a forced exodus 
of palestinians to jordan

the head of east germanys former communist 
party today criticized the new governments plan for unification 
and said it would allow the country to be colonized by west germany 
gregor gysi a respected lawyer who took over the battered 
communist party after its hardline leaders were ousted last year 
said both germanys should instead work together to build a new 
nation 
in bonn a spokesman for the west german government said the 
soviet union also has expressed misgivings about the quick 
unification that both germanys favor 
lawmakers today debated the unification plans of the coalition 
government led by prime minister lothar de maiziere whose cabinet 
includes most of the major political factions in parliament 
there was wide support for much of de maizieres plans for a 
fast unification but some opposition lawmakers said it gives east 
germany too little say in creating a unified germany 
gysi told fellow members of parliament that east germans must 
have a chance to go upright into unification 
gysi leads a reformed communist party now called the party for 
social democracy which finished third in east germanys first free 
elections on march 18 
his delegation walked out of the session after a member of the 
archconservative german social union joachim hubertus nowack 
linked the new communists to the former hardline regime and 
compared that government to the nazi dictatorship preceding it 
earlier gysi criticized the method under which east germany 
would merely adopt the constitution of west germany 
he backed instead a much slower form of unification under which 
the constitutions of both nations would be abolished and new laws 
written for a united germany 
the present form backed by the de maiziere government would 
amount to little more than annexation and colonization gysi 
said 
but economics minister gerhard pohl denounced a slower process 
and said the nation should brook no more socialist experiments 
wolfgang thierse of the leftleaning social democrats who have 
joined de maizieres government said the quicker process is the 
realistic way to unity 
east germanys economy is in shambles and in the march 
elections voters overwhelmingly backed leaders advocating quick 
unification with the wealthy west 
west german government spokesman dieter vogel confirmed reports 
bonn had received a message from moscow expressing misgivings about 
quick unification of the germanys 
west german media also reported last week that kremlin officials 
had contacted de maiziere and told him they opposed the quick 
method because it would allow east germany to be integrated into 
nato east germany now is in the warsaw pact 
also today the head of the department of defense and 
disarmament rainer eppelmann was quoted as saying he favors 
reducing the east german army from 135000 members to about 50000 
and later eliminating the force entirely 
eppelmann spoke to the express newspaper in cologne west 
germany

the wife of a hemophiliac with aids became 
infected with the deadly virus after undergoing artificial 
insemination in an effort to conceive a child officials say 
the national centers for disease control said fertility 
specialists had attempted to remove the virus from the husbands 
sperm through separation and filtration but the woman tested 
positive for the virus in january after inseminations last august 
october and december she did not get pregnant 
how the woman became infected with aids can never be proven but 
the couple was using condoms during sex and did not engage in oral 
or anal sex which are high aidsrisk behaviors the cdc said 
thursday 
the husband a hemophilia patient had tested positive for aids 
infection since 1985 many hemophilia patients became infected in 
the first years of the aids epidemic through contaminated 
bloodclotting products 
there are thousands of couples in this situation and many of 
them are actively seeking some way of inseminating safely dr 
scott holmberg the cdcs chief of special aids studies said 
thursday 
but there are clear cdc recommendations against doing this 
and many physicians have continually counseled such couples not to 
run this risk he said 
the cdc said aids is transmitted through blood and semen and 
there is no evidence that any procedure can reliably eliminate 
hiv from semen 
the couples identity was not disclosed 
the cdc has received reports of at least two other couples who 
have tried artificial insemination despite one spouses infection 
one attempt resulted in pregnancy and the other did not no 
infection has been detected yet in the noninfected spouse 
the outcome of doing this very risky procedure is by no means 
assured holmberg said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

estonias foreign minister said today 
his baltic republic rejects soviet threats and inducements and 
refuses to rescind a declaration proclaiming itself an occupied 
independent state 
lennart meri told finnish national radio that estonia would 
ignore soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs threat on thursday 
to impose economic reprisals unless the estonians repealed the 
decision 
in a carrotandstick approach gorbachev also offered special 
status within a soviet confederation if estonia abandoned its 
path toward independence 
the kremlin has imposed an oil and gas embargo on estonias 
baltic neighbor lithuania for refusing to rescind laws promoting 
independence 
gorbachev really should know that if a nation has elected its 
own parliament and that parliament has declared in the name of the 
people that estonia is an occupied independent republic then it is 
impossible for our parliament to repeal such a law said meri 
who is on a previously unpublicized visit to finland 
we cannot elect ourselves a new nation he added 
unlike lithuania estonia did not declare independence but 
passed a resolution march 30 stating that it is a sovereign but 
occupied state that was illegally annexed by the soviet union in 
1940 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania estonia and latvia 
in 1940 as part of a secret agreement between josef stalin and 
adolf hitler 
meri said estonia would not continue negotiations with moscow as 
long as soviet authorities refused to recognize the declaration by 
the 105member estonian supreme soviet 
meri said estonias foreign policy is based on the 1920 tarto 
peace treaty in which the soviet union recognized estonia as an 
independent republic

some inmates at a prison run by an israelibacked 
militia in southern lebanon have been tortured and held as many as 
five years without trial a british newspaper reported today 
the independent said some prisoners have spent months in total 
darkness and solitary confinement at the prison on a hilltop above 
the christian village of khiam in israels security zone 
israel set up the prison during its 19825 invasion of lebanon 
it is now run by the south lebanon army which is trained and 
financed by israel 
in jerusalem an israeli army spokesman declined to comment on 
the report 
we do not deal with khiam he said it is under the sla 
we do not represent the sla he spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to military rules 
the independent quoted unidentified former prisoners as saying 
suspected guerrillas held there had been tortured by having 
electric wires attached to their bodies and that some had received 
savage beatings 
the story named one present inmate as selma salam 23 an 
interpreter for the united nations norwegian battalion in southern 
lebanon it said three gunmen in plain clothes took her away in a 
car from her home at the shia moslem village of blat last july 11 
it said her mother has not been allowed to visit her and her 
un employers had sought in vain for information about her from 
the israelis and from the south lebanon army 
the independent said neither the international red cross nor 
amnesty international nor any other humanitarian organization has 
been allowed to visit the prison 
israel has refused the red cross permission to visit the jail 
on the grounds that it is controlled by the sla but since the 
israelis themselves control the sla red cross officials have 
privately told the independent that they believe israels excuse is 
unacceptable it said 
it said kidnappers of western hostages in lebanon had repeatedly 
demanded the release of khiam prisoners 
the newspaper said about 325 men and women were held in the 
prison some because they were suspected of antiisraeli guerrilla 
activities and others because their families sympathized with the 
lebanese resistance movement 
it said the israelis had suspended all family visits to the 
prison since spring of last year 
neither the israelis nor the sla provide lists of inmates nor 
will they allow the red cross to compile such a list it said 
but the independent has acquired the names of 58 prisoners all 
of whom come from just seven small villages in the far southeast of 
lebanon two men one 25 the other 30 have been incarcerated in 
khiam for five years it said 
united nations records show that they were originally escorted 
there not only by sla men but by plain clothes israeli shin bet 
agents a 20yearold has been held since january 1987 and 20 
others since 1988 
the sla admitted that two prisoners were killed last year 
while trying to escape united nations officers have been told 
they were asphyxiated with tear gas during a riot 
the shin bet is israels domestic security service

objection 
on march 6 denison ordered 25 british newspapers and tv 
companies to turn over film of the riot which engulfed londons 
theater district folowing a huge demonstration against a new tax 
police who are still examining film then sought film held by 
the agencies and london weekend television on the ground that it 
was needed to help identify rioters 
britains 1984 police and criminal evidence act provides that a 
judge can order news media to turn over material in the case of 
serious offenses 
the judge said ap press association and london weekend 
television were right to oppose the application 
orders such as this should not be made as a matter of 
course he said 
it would be wrong if the media were to back down and concede 
every application that is made he said they are perfectly 
entitled to come to court and put their arguments 
the order which the judge is to sign monday means ap and press 
association must give police all negatives of the riot 
the violence broke out after demonstrators led by anarchists 
tried to storm prime minister margaret thatchers 10 downing street 
office they then attacked police and rampaged across londons west 
end 
nearly 500 police officers and 86 civilians were injured and 
hundreds of shops were looted and cars burned 
if applications routinely succeed there is a loss of the 
perceived independence of the media robin oppenheim legal 
counsel for the three news organizations told the court 
in 1988 british television companies initially refused to hand 
police film of an irish republican army funeral in northern ireland 
at which two british soldiers were murdered the companies later 
released their film saying they had to comply with the law

adem demaqi believed to be 
yugoslavias longestserving political prisoner with a total of 
nearly 28 years in detention has been pardoned a senior official 
announced today 
the name of 54yearold demaqi an ethnic albanian was included 
on a list of 108 political prisoners pardoned wednesday said stipe 
suvar a member of the collective leadership demaqi was one of 103 
ethnic albanians among them 
two yugoslav republics are holding free elections this month in 
line with the wave of reforms sweeping eastern europe and the 
pardons were seen as indicating some relaxation of communist rule 
on the federal level 
another 190 political prisoners will remain in detention suvar 
added he said that some will be granted amnesty however and 
their number will be reduced to 70 before 1991 
demaqi was one of the key ethnic albanian activists in kosovo 
province the site of historic tensions between slavs and 
albanians he was sentenced to three years in jail in 1958 for 
attempting to set up an illegal separatist organization 
six years later he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for 
founding the revolutionary movement for the unification of 
shiptars as albanians call themselves 
he served 10 years of his second sentence before he was given a 
concurrent 15year term in 1975 for conspiring against the people 
and the state he had been due for release in october 
kosovo where ethnic albanians comprise a 90percent majority 
was rocked in march by violent protests over constitutional 
amendments giving serbia yugoslavias largest republic nearly 
complete control over the province 
the amendments were said to be necessary to protect slavs in 
kosovo from alleged harassment by ethnic albanians and to prevent 
the secession of kosovo from yugoslavia 
yugoslav authorities lifted a state of emergency in kosovo on 
wednesday at serbias request after serbia completed its takeover 
of the provinces police serbia had charged that local police were 
inactive during the unrest that claimed more than 60 lives 
demaqis pardon also appeared to be part of a recent move by the 
federal government to cool albanian tempers in kosovo on thursday 
charges against azem vlasi the popular former kosovo communist 
party chief were modified to remove the threat of execution he is 
accused of fomenting unrest among fellow ethnicalbanians last year 
the move was seen as preparing the ground for vlasis release 
and an eventual start of negotiations with the ethnic albanian 
opposition something hardline serbian leaders have rejected so 
far

clashing theories of racial superiority espoused 
by two tenured professors one white and one black have prompted 
an inquiry by city college into the limits of academic freedom the 
new york times reported in todays editions 
the schools student body is 39 percent black 28 percent 
hispanic 17 percent white and 16 percent asian 
the white teacher michael levin a professor of philosophy has 
written at least three articles for academic journals contending 
that it has been amply confirmed over the last several decades 
that on average blacks are significantly less intelligent than 
whites the times said 
levin has argued that a deficiency in intelligence rather than 
discrimination or poverty accounts for the underrepresentation of 
blacks in fields like medicine engineering and philosophy the 
times said levin holds a doctorate in philosophy 
the black professor leonard jeffries jr chairman of the black 
studies department calls people of european ancestry the ice 
people and portrays them in his classes as fundamentally 
materialistic greedy and intent on domination he calls people of 
african descent the sun people and says they are essentially 
humanistic and communal the times said 
he has passed out booklets to his students that argue that an 
abundance of skin pigment gives blacks intellectual and physical 
advantages over whites 
in a class wednesday jeffries said rich jews who financed the 
development of europe also financed the slave trade the times 
said jeffries has a doctorate in public law and government 
levin has been rebuked by the faculty senate and barred for one 
semester from teaching an introductory philosophy course 
dr bernard w harleston the college president said thursday 
he had decided to name a committee to review the question of when 
speech both in and outside the classroom may go beyond the 
protection of academic freedom and may become conduct unbecoming a 
faculty member 
he said the committee would review both cases

once we got into it it was like cancer myers said we 
kept cutting away at the bad stuff trying to get at the good stuff 
until we got down to the foundation and the foundation didnt have 
any steel in it so we couldnt build on that and we had to keep 
going

israels supreme court today allowed 150 jewish 
settlers to remain in a compound in the citys christian quarter 
until the high court hears more arguments in the case 
the high court ruled in response to an order by attorney general 
yosef harish on thursday that the settlers immediately leave the 
72room fourbuilding complex inside jerusalems walled old city 
the settlers created a furor and ignited demonstrations by both 
christians and moslems when they moved into the building owned by 
the greek orthodox church on april 11 
the church claims that a former tenant illegally sold his user 
rights to the building to the settlers 
harish backed by two lower court decisions on thursday ordered 
the settlers to leave because their presence had harmed 
christianjewish relations in jerusalem 
but the threejudge supreme court panel issued a restraining 
order against the eviction today and asked harish to show at a 
hearing next thursday why his order should not be annulled 
the settlers will be allowed to stay until there is a final 
decision by the high court said attorney dan aviyitzhak who 
represents a panamabased company that bought the rights to use the 
complex 
yohanan altbauer an attorney representing the church said the 
judges offered a compromise under which the settlers would have 
left the building but a few company representatives would have 
remained until lower courts decided on tenancy rights 
both sides rejected the compromise altbauer said 
uzi atzmon an attorney for the settlers said on thursday that 
a second appeal would be filed with the court challenging the 
entire eviction process 
also thursday a leaflet issued by the underground leadership of 
the palestinian uprising threatened to execute the former tenant 
an armenian and others involved in the deal 
the leaflet said however that the order will not be carried 
out until further notice 
in athens greek foreign minister antonis samaras instructed 
greeces representative in israel to urge the israeli government to 
carry out the lower courts eviction order immediately 
tensions rose because the settlement upset the traditional 
division of the religious communities in the old city there are 
about 50000 moslems 7000 christians and 4000 jews in the old 
walled city 
the settlement also has political implications since the old 
city is part of the area captured by israel from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war 
israel annexed the area into its capital but most countries 
including the united states do not recognize israels claim to 
sovereignty palestinians have demanded jerusalem become the 
capital of their wouldbe independent state 
when attorney general harish told the settlers to leave 
thursday he said he took the action to prevent a further 
deterioration of relations between the christian and jewish 
communities in jerusalem 
however supreme court justice gabriel bach stayed harishs 
order allowing the jews to remain

pete rose pleaded guilty today to felony tax 
charges for failing to report income including winnings from his 
illegal gambling that led to his banishment from baseball 
rose former player and manager of the cincinnati reds baseball 
team admitted that he did not report 354968 in income over four 
years 
the two felony counts of filing false federal income tax returns 
carry a maximum penalty of three years in jail on each count he 
also could be fined up to 250000 on each count the government 
agreed not to pursue any other tax charges against rose in return 
for the plea 
us district judge s arthur spiegel accepted roses guilty 
plea but gave no indication when he might sentence rose 
rose stood with his hands folded and clearly answered yes 
sir to questions the judge asked before accepting the guilty 
plea he made no comment as he walked from the courtroom to meet 
with probation officers 
last august rose accepted a lifetime ban from the game after 
admitting he bet through bookmakers although he denies betting on 
baseball or his team 
the plea agreement ends a oneyear investigation by federal 
prosecutors into whether rose claimed all of his income from 
gambling autograph appearances and memorabilia sales 
assistant us attorney william hunt said the probe found no 
evidence of involvement by rose in the drug activities of his 
former associates but did show that rose was a chronic gambler 
who hid large amounts of income from his financial advisers 
hunt said for example that rose owned a share of a 47646 
racetrack payoff and that he sold the baseball bat he used for his 
4192nd hit which made him baseballs alltime hits leader for 
129000 
as part of his plea agreement rose admits he underreported his 
income from 198487 he reported a total of 46 million in income 
for those years paying 2 million in taxes but hid 354968 
hunt said rose has repaid the internal revenue service 
36604286 in back taxes interest and penalties 
thursday rose said he was unconcerned about a possible jail 
sentence 
i know im not a bad person but i did make some mistakes and 
its in the eyes of the judge rose said during his weekly talk 
show thursday night on wckyam in cincinnati all you can say is 
its up to the judge

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said today that president bushs 1991 military budget 
must be slashed but not as severely as proposed by the 
democraticontrolled house budget committee 
sen sam nunn dga proposed defense spending of 297 billion 
for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 15 billion more than the 
committee approved on thursday bush has proposed a 303 billion 
defense budget 
i believe this range is a realistic and responsible target 
nunn said in a speech on the senate floor 
nunn proposed limiting spending on the strategic defense 
initiative to about 4 billion the amount congress appropriated 
for the antimissile shield last year 
the armed services chairman also called for delaying the 
pentagons plans to move the multiplewarhead mx nuclear missile 
from fixed silos to railroad cars 
in the first element of the new military strategy nuclear 
deterrence these and other actions could save on the order of 3 
billion to 35 billion in fiscal 1991 and between 20 and 30 
billion over the next five years nunn said 
house democrats plan to bring their proposed 124 trillion 1991 
budget to the floor next week in what looms as a test of their plan 
to begin slashing tens of billions of dollars in military spending 
the house budget committee approved the spending package on a 
2114 partyline vote as majority democrats dealt a blow to bushs 
plans to only slightly trim the defense budget the action marked 
the formal beginning of the battle over how federal spending 
priorities should be reshaped in response to the dismemberment of 
the soviet bloc 
we live in a far different world from the one which we have 
known for most of our lifetimes said committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif 
the defense figures are supported by democratic leaders and are 
meant as a compromise between the partys liberal and conservative 
wings nonetheless the size of the cuts is distasteful to 
conservatives raising questions about whether their support can be 
counted on for final passage next week 
with democrats holding a 258176 house majority defections by 
large numbers of the partys conservatives could make approval 
uncertain republicans want the budget to be written after 
negotiations between the white house and congressional leaders and 
virtually all gop lawmakers are expected to oppose the democratic 
package 
it gives a lot of us conservatives real heartburn rep 
jerry huckaby dla said of the defense proposal at this 
point there isnt a conservative consensus about whether well be 
able to support the democratic measure 
huckaby estimated there were 40 conservative democrats who 
shared his concerns 
panetta predicted passage of the proposal arguing that 
conservatives would ultimately see the defense figures as 
bargaining positions in future negotiations with the senate and 
perhaps the white house 
overall the democratic package claims to trim the deficit by 
36 billion to just less than 64 billion just within the target 
required by the grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
besides defense cuts it relies on 139 billion in new taxes 
the same figure bush wants and 14 billion in user fees 
it also calls for 93 billion in savings from a combination of 
sources improved tax collections by the internal revenue service 
user fees that congressional committees have rejected in the past 
and other efforts 
an additional 38 billion would be saved by limiting the growth 
of medicare and other benefit programs the budget committee had 
said it expected to save 42 billion in this category but leaders 
of the house ways and means committee which oversees medicare 
said they did not want such deep cuts in the health care program 
for the elderly 
the proposal would also boost federal aid for scientists 
aviation safety and the head start program for poor preschool 
children 
the senate budget committee hopes to begin working on its own 
version of the spending plan next week 
the budget which does not require the presidents signature 
lays out a fiscal blueprint congress will consider separate bills 
that will make the final spending and tax decisions

the hubble space telescopes 
batteries have enough power after 130 hours of recharging to permit 
five launch attempts next week of the craft that will carry it into 
space nasa says 
were right on schedule lisa malone a spokeswoman for the 
national aeronautics and space administration said thursday 
there are no problems 
the shuttle discovery is due to lift off 831 am edt tuesday 
the space agency has until april 28 to launch the shuttle 
carrying the 15 billion telescope otherwise the mission must be 
delayed eight days so the telescopes six nickelhydrogen batteries 
can be recharged more 
recharging the batteries in a laboratory from sunday through 
thursday provided enough strength for one additional contingency 
day for a launch attempt said nasa spokesman george diller 
its a full charge we got everything that we set out to 
get diller said 
nasa finished recharging the batteries at noon thursday 
technicians then prepared the batteries for transfer from a 
laboratory to the launch pad 
nasa opened discoverys payload bay doors today and the 
technicians began installing the batteries in the telescope the 
batteries were to be tested late tonight and early saturday and 
the payload bay sealed sunday in preparation for tuesdays 
scheduled liftoff 
they havent had any problems and they are running ahead of 
schedule malone said 
the batteries will power the telescope nasas most expensive 
and complex payload from the time it is disconnected from the 
shuttles power system until its energycollecting solar panels are 
unfurled in space 
the countdown to launch was to begin saturday afternoon 
discoverys five astronauts were to arrive sunday 
once in orbit 380 miles above earth hubble will be capable of 
detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater 
clarity than the best groundbased observatory astronomers expect 
to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been 
traveling for 14 billion years close to the beginning of time

three crewmen were reported missing after a 
panamanian freighter sank friday following a collision with another 
panamanian vessel about 75 miles east of this british colony the 
government said 
a statement said 16 crewmen from the regent kapuas were rescued 
by the ocean blessing a container ship that was involved in the 
collision 
it said a royal navy patrol craft picked up the survivors 15 
filipinos and one japanese from the oceas up to two hours making a 
single gavel 
starting with a block of raw wood beaton makes grooves bevels 
and flutes with an assortment of hand chisels and woodburning 
devices and applies several finishing coats of clear acrylic 
lacquer 
beaton follows a fixed design that he says has been traditional 
for a century or more though nobody knows for sure 
when i came here nearly seven years ago i was told this is 
the way weve always made them and i should make them just like 
this he says ive never done it any other way 
the shiny blondhued gavels which beaton estimates are worth 
75 apiece are kept in a drawer at the speakers marbletopped 
rostrum for the exclusive use of the speaker or the legislator he 
appoints to preside over the house during floor action on 
legislation 
although a washington newspaper article published in 1923 
claimed that some years ago it was not unusual for 100 gavels or 
more to be smashed in one congress broken gavels are a rarity 
today 
their replacement is necessary instead because the speakers 
like to autograph their gavels and present them as gifts to 
constituents friends or to fellow legislators who have steered 
major bills to final passage 
veteran house parliamentarians recall that some house speakers 
notably sam rayburn of texas have wielded their gavels with a 
heavy hand but none has banged one into smithereens in recent 
memory 
former speaker thomas p oneill a big irishman from boston 
frequently tapped gently with his gavels handle to persuade 
lawmakers to quiet down 
one of the loudest gavelbangers was former rep richard 
bolling dmo who presided over floor debate and voting on scores 
of bills from the speakers chair during his 34year house career 
bolling interviewed by telephone from his retirement home in 
rural maryland remembered breaking two gavels in those years 
fortunately nobody got hurt he said

oklahoma teachers returned to classrooms 
today after their fourday strike forced state lawmakers to forge a 
compromise on education spending that would raise teachers minimum 
salaries 
it shows that with solidarity the system works now we can go 
back to school said carolyn meyer an elementary music teacher 
in stillwater 
the democraticcontrolled senate approved an emergency clause 
thursday that allows a 230 million education reform and tax bill 
to become law as soon as it is signed by republican gov henry 
bellmon the governor said he will sign the bill 
everybodys just feeling great stillwater superintendent 
bill hodges said 
the emergency clause had been a stumbling block to the package 
and the senates failure to pass it last week prompted the 
31000member oklahoma education association to call for a fiveday 
walkout republicans opposed the bill 
it calls for spending 681 million to raise minimum teacher 
salaries by 1500 a year for four years oklahoma teachers say 
they rank 48th in pay among the states making 22000 a year 
compared with the national average of 29648 
the teachers association said the passage would end the 
walkout except for teachers in schools already set to close today 
a thankyou rally that had been planned for the capitol was 
canceled because of the rain 
also today the union voted to recommend its political action 
committee endorse house speaker steve lewis chief architect of the 
school bill for the democratic nomination for governor two 
delegates spoke against the recommendation but it passed by a wide 
margin 
the association said schools in 145 districts were closed 
thursday among those were tulsa oklahoma city and lawton the 
three largest districts in the state with about 95000 students 
the union did not have a count today on the number of districts 
closed 
state education officials have said the walkout has affected 
about 60 percent or 343200 of the states 572000 students the 
state has 606 school districts 
the education package was enacted by a 3214 vote after five 
senate democrats switched their votes in return for support for a 
bill that would give lowincome families a tax break the package 
needed 32 votes to pass 
sponsors said the measure will put oklahoma in the forefront of 
education reform 
its going to connect us to the rest of the country said 
sen stratton taylor a democrat were not going to be a third 
world state 
a new day is dawning for education in oklahoma said the 
governor who supported the education plan but drew virtually no 
backing from the senates republican minority 
oklahoma will no longer take a back seat among the states 
where education is concerned bellmon said from now on others 
can look to oklahoma for leadership in education 
the unions president kyle dahlem said teachers had never had 
such a comprehensive program with which to work now its up to 
the people of oklahoma to make us accountable for seeing that the 
program works she said 
the measure was passed after an eightmonth special session

a mexican physician accused of participating 
in the 1985 killing of a us drug agent wont be returned home 
even if his arrest violated mexican sovereignty the justice 
department said today 
justice department spokesman david runkel said he did not 
foresee any circumstances under which humberto alvarez machain 
would be returned to mexico rather than face charges in los angeles 
of participating in the 1985 kidnapping and murder of drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena 
alvarezs attorney charges that the guadalajara gynecologist was 
kidnapped and taken to el paso texas where he was arrested by dea 
agents 
the arrest sparked a diplomatic protest from the mexican 
government 
in los angeles on thursday us district judge edward rafeedie 
ordered prosecutors to explain how alvarez was brought to the 
united states 
attorney general dick thornburgh who returned thursday from a 
hemispheric drug enforcement conference in ixtapa mexico has 
ordered dea to give him a full report on the arrest 
runkel said talks thornburgh had with mexican attorney general 
enrique alvarez del castillo before he left ixtapa assuaged mexican 
officials who had threatened to stop cooperating with us 
antidrug efforts 
we were assured that relations between mexico and the united 
sates remained strong and that cooperation on drug law enforcement 
would continue runkel told reporters 
any threat if one existed to continued cooperation was 
substantially lessened as a result of the bilateral talks in 
ixtapa runkel said 
the mexican attorney general said wednesday that the arrest 
might hinder continued cooperation by his country with us 
authorities in the war on drug trafficking 
on thursday mexican president carlos salinas de gortari had 
unusually strong words for the united states in a speech to the 
ixtapa conference on drug trafficking 
mexico will not permit anybody not drug traffickers nor their 
pursuers to violate mexican rights he said 
in the fight against drugs the law is rendered useless by 
illegal actions or by trying to measure justice with a ruler of 
one country in foreign territory salinas said 
runkel said thornburgh and his mexican counterpart held their 
final meeting after salinas speech 
thornburgh assured the mexican attorney general that he had 
insisted upon a full complete and immediate investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding the apprehension of alvarez 
appropriate action would be forthcoming when a report of the 
results of that investigation was in hand runkel said 
but runkel said federal authorities would not return alvarez to 
mexico if thornburgh had determined that dea had violated any 
justice department policies mexican sovereignty or law 
i dont foresee any circumstances under which he would be 
returned to mexico runkel said he faces criminal charges in 
this country 
a long line of us court decisions have held that a fugitive 
can stand trial in this country even if his arrest overseas was 
improper

a family that has been ranching for four 
decades has learned that becoming more environmentally sensitive 
deosnt mean sacrificing profits 
the sims family headed by 84yearold patriarch roy sims is 
one of a few wyoming ranch owners using an innovative grazing 
technique that increases profits as it improves the land 
were trying to make a living but not at the expense of the 
land said 35yearold scott sims who with his brother olin 
and father don own and operate the 10000acre mcfadden land and 
livestock co 
the family was awarded wyomings 1989 outstanding conservation 
farmer and rancher award and sees this sundays earth day 1990 as 
an opportunity to illustrate that ranchers care about the land 
weve got environmentalists accusing livestock men of tearing 
up the earth olin sims said i hope its a time 
environmentalists realize ranchers are environmentalists too 
a visit to the southern wyoming ranch on a warm april afternoon 
found bawling calves stumbling alongside their mothers on meadows 
that have only recently turned from a frozen gray to spring green 
cottonwoods and elms cast long shadows across a frothing creek 
bulging with snow melt 
but a closer look reveals that the ranch operations are not 
typical 
last year scott and olin sims began using the intensive grazing 
technique instead of allowing their hundreds of cows to roam 
freely over large expanses they sliced the land into small 
pastures so cattle graze each section intensively for two to three 
days before being moved onto another plot 
with 300 cows denuding 300 acres instead of one cow on 40 acres 
munching here and there grass is allowed to regrow and much 
erosion is eliminated 
were severe grazing you go back the next year and its the 
nicest grass on the ranch scott sims explained 
on the heavily grazed sections the cows act as rototillers with 
their trampling and fertilizers with their manure thus encouraging 
healthy new growth rain is absorbed more efficiently on the 
trampled fields rather than running off hard overgrazed land and 
noxious weeds are inhibited and so fewer pesticides are needed 
on the smaller plots bothersome flies that usually hatch in 
manure piles on the open range are trampled to death saving 50 
cents per head in fly abatement costs 
the sims say the healthier lusher grass growth adds an average 
of 20 pounds per weened calf 
if we can double the grass production we can double our 
cattle numbers olin sims said adding that the increased fencing 
pays for itself its nice to see these cows cultivate the land 
and make money for you too 
with this holistic resource management technique we never 
allow that cow to bite that plant a second time before its fully 
recovered he said 
since the cattle are restricted to 5 percent of the ranch at any 
one time the rest of the range is open to wildlife 
the simses also plant 150 trees each year use solar power for 
the electrified fencing and water pumps and maintain enough water 
in the creeks for fish to survive 
with some environmentalists calling for a cattle ban on public 
lands or cattlefree by 93 olin sims said he has to be 
careful a small part of his ranch is leased from the state and 
federal governments 
id like to keep the ranch in the family for years and 
years he said when youve got congress and earth firsters 
breathing down your neck to forbid grazing on public lands youve 
got to be careful its worth it 
asked what his grandfather thought of the changes he and his 
brother have made olin sims said thats the way this whole 
ranch family has been always looking for a better way and not 
getting stuck in a rut

pope john paul iis weekend visit 
to czechoslovakia the first by a pope will be a symbolic release 
for many of the nations roman catholics from their communist past 
it also marks a further step in the vaticans move into eastern 
europe as new noncommunist governments restore longbroken ties 
in my opinion this is a truly historic event president 
vaclav havel said in an easter sunday radio broadcast 
it is happening one week after easter let us contemplate 
about the importance of easter sacrifice resurrection and 
redemption 
it was havel who invited the polishborn pontiff to visit 
czechoslovakia he issued the invitation only two days after taking 
office dec 29 the pontiff is to arrive saturday 
czechoslovakias peaceful revolution toppledthe hardline 
communist leadership of milos jakes in 10 days of street protests 
and mass rallies 
it practically coincided with the canonization of st agnes a 
czech by the pope nov 12 and havel drew a playful link between 
the two events 
many believers think it all went so well because it was a bit 
of a miracle from st agnes i am sure you feel the symbolic 
relation havel said in his radio speech 
the sterility of the communist dogma brought about a christian 
renaissance in the late 1980s that was unparalleled in recent 
czechoslovak history 
the past rulers had nothing to offer vaclav maly a former 
underground priest and human rights activist said of the religious 
rebirth after some time the natural longing for dignified life 
led to the creation of a community where people can trust one 
another 
on march 25 1988 police used dogs and a water cannon to 
brutally disperse thousands of believers peacefully rallying in 
downtown bratislava the capital of slovakia for more religious 
freedom 
the crackdown became a symbol of religious persecution in 
slovakia the eastern and strongly catholic part of czechoslovakia 
the same year more than 600000 believers signed a petition for 
greater freedom of worship 
while constraints on religious freedom were tightened followed 
the crushing of the 1968 prague spring reforms the roots of 
churchstate conflict go back to the late 1940s after the 
communists seized power 
authorities suspended diplomatic relations with the vatican on 
april 24 1950 they increased pressure on catholics whose 
allegiance to a foreign power the vatican was seen as a 
threat to stability christianity was erased from official history 
religious education was banned in schools 
the state often refused to give state licences to bishops 
appointed by the vatican leaving up to 10 of czechoslovakias 13 
bishoprics vacant 
in 1970 fearing increasing diplomatic isolation officials 
launched talks on possible renewal of ties it was not until 
czechoslovakias revolution opened the way to spiritual freedom 
that relations with the vatican warmed considerably 
on march 29 1990 an official czechoslovak delegation in rome 
presented pope john paul ii with a request to renew diplomatic 
ties they were formally restored thursday 
czechoslovakia was the third warsaw pact nation to restore 
relations with the holy see after poland and hungary in his drive 
to strengthen the church in the east john paul has visited his 
native poland three times as pope and has scheduled trips to 
hungary and poland next year 
for cardinal frantisek tomasek 90 the visit will be a 
vindication of decades of courageous resistance to communist 
pressures 
it will be a great awakening of consciousness said tomasek 
who spent four years in a labor camp in the 1950s 
some 3 million believers from czechoslovakia as well as 
neighboring poland and hungary are expected to flood prague 
velehrad and the slovak capital of bratislava over the weekend 
when john paul gives his blessing to the countrys estimated 9 
million catholics 
the visit also has an indirect political dimension coming 50 
days before the countrys first free postcommunist elections on 
june 89 
it could significantly boost the popularity of the increasingly 
strong alliance of czechoslovak christian democrats who dominated 
elections in east germany and hungary

the white house said today that new 
terrorist demands over the promised release of an american hostage 
were a smokescreen and part of a troubling pattern 
they do it every time presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said when asked if kidnappers holding three americans 
were toying with the united states 
syria still believes theres a possibility of release well 
just have to wait and see if theyre sincere and hope that they 
are fitzwater said 
president bush on thursday defended his decision not to send a 
us envoy to syria as the kidnappers demanded before they would 
release a hostage the united states does not knuckle under to 
demands the president said 
fitzwater spoke aboard air force one as bush flew here today 
from key largo fla to help raise money for an underdog 
republican candidate for the senate 
bush was in birmingham for a fundraiser for state sen bill 
cabaniss a conservative businessman trying to oust incumbent 
democratic sen howell heflin he was then flying to orlando fla 
for another political fundraiser before returning to key largo for 
a weekend of fishing 
in his speech at the cabaniss fundraiser bush renewed his plea 
for passage of a capital gains tax cut from the current 33percent 
top to 19 percent or lower the tax in japan on stocks and bonds is 
only 1 percent bush said and other asian trading rivals dont 
tax them at all 
once again i call on the congress to pass that bill its time 
we stop giving the edge to other countries said bush he also 
called for rejecting the ideas of extremists on both sides of 
the environmental debate and passing a clean air bill that doesnt 
throw people out of work 
more than 1500 people attended the event which raised over a 
half million dollars for the candidate 
asked about the complaint from the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine that bush had not dispatched the envoy they 
requested to syria fitzwater said that was just a 
smokescreen he said the united states had an ambassador in 
damascus capable of conducting any talks that were necessary 
he called the terrorist demand which came after they had 
proomised to release an american by today part of troublesome 
patterns that weve seen before he cited the terrorists release 
of a photograph of one hostage one day and of another hostage a 
day later 
the pattern is very much the same fitzwater said they 
announce the release put out pictures for videotape or letters and 
then theres some demand or reason why it cant happen so our 
attitude is to be prepared to take all the precautions and the 
preparations necessary to facilitate it if it does happen but not 
to get overly optimistic 
on the crisis in lithuania fitzwater said us officials were 
still talking with allies around the world about appropriate 
responses to intensified soviet pressures on the breakaway 
republic theres still a lot of unknowns were trying to work 
out fitzwater said 
at a marathon waterside news conference in key largo thursday 
with visiting french president francois mitterrand bush indicated 
he is moving cautiously on the lithuanian crisis because of the 
importance of the ussoviet relationship to arms control and 
freedom for eastern europe 
but there are limits to us patience said bush 
the lithuanian and middle east hostage situations overshadowed 
other topics that bush discussed at his key largo meeting with 
mitterrand who paid a ninehour visit to the united states 
the united states is consulting with france west germany and 
other allies on what steps to take but bush was unwilling to 
signal his hand 
my reluctance stems from trying to keep open a dialogue and 
discussion that affects many many countries on such sensitive 
issues as arms control and the growth of democracy in eastern 
europe he said 
i am greatly concerned by this escalation in terms of using 
energy to push the lithuanians into line said bush he added it 
still was not clear exactly whether the oil and gas supplies to 
vilnius have been cut off 
on the hostage situation the president said weve been 
disappointed before hopes raised only to have them dashed by 
excessive speculation 
asked why he had not sent john kelly assistant secretary of 
state for middle eastern affairs to syria to facilitate the 
release bush said the united states does not knuckle under to 
demands 
eight americans are among the 17 western hostages believed to be 
held in lebanon 
bush praised syria for trying to play a constructive role in 
the hostage release 
he repeated the overture to iran first made in his inaugural 
address 15 months earlier goodwill begets goodwill

bush administration officials said friday they 
would prod japan to import more us automotive parts but refused 
to say whether retaliatory action would be taken 
japanese automakers have shown no serious commitment to 
increasing purchases of us parts despite recent announcements of 
changes in their procurement system said mary a toman deputy 
assistant commerce secretary 
although the us motor vehicle trade deficit with japan has 
narrowed slightly the parts deficit continues to grow and hit 
105 billion in 1989 she said 
until there are significant increases in sales we will not be 
convinced that japan truly has opened its markets to the world 
ms toman told the senate subcommittee on innovation technology 
and productivity 
richard j roberts whose mount clemens mich company 
manufactures molds for plastic auto parts said his efforts to 
break into foreign markets had been rebuffed 
this is most discouraging to a company that wants to grow and 
have the same opportunity their companies receive here in the 
united states roberts said 
under a 1988 law the administration can restrict imports from 
countries that engage in unfair trading practices the next round 
of import restrictions is scheduled to be announced by the end of 
the month 
ms toman and assistant us trade representative don phillips 
declined to say whether japanese auto parts would be on the list 
japanese and us negotiators agreed on a plan april 5 to reduce 
trade friction by making broad reforms in both countries 
economies president bush has praised japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu for promising vigorous efforts to open his nations 
markets 
ms toman said the japanese had taken some steps toward 
improving the situation citing toyotas plan to increase its 
imports of parts 250 percent by 1992 
talks begun in 1986 helped boost us auto parts exports to 
japan from 214 million that year to 638 million last year 
although the trade deficit widened at the same time she said

the head of the 20campus california 
state university system abruptly resigned today at a special 
meeting of the trustees who then rolled back large pay raises she 
had given herself and top executives 
chancellor ann reynolds who heads the nations largest 
fouryear and graduatelevel university system would have had her 
annual salary rolled back 59000 from 195000 to 136000 
the trustees voted to cut salaries for 26 executives to last 
julys levels meaning college presidents will earn 110000 
instead of 145000 
a trustee subcommittee recommended the rollback thursday after 
taking testimony on raises that ranged from 43 percent for reynolds 
to 17 percent and 26 percent for deputies and college presidents 
the raises sparked a furor in part because the salaries of the 
bestpaid professors at csu campuses scattered around the state 
rose only 48 percent 
committee members on thursday focused their protests on the 
process in which the raises were approved in private trustees who 
had delegated authority for salaries to reynolds and board 
chairwoman marianthi lansdale complained they were not consulted 
board members said they were kept in the dark about a 
consultants study of comparable higher education markets and 
salaries commanded by their top executives 
reynolds chancellor since 1982 said her resignation would be 
effective dec 31 1990 but she told trustees she intends to take 
a leave of absence beginning oct 1 and become a professor in the 
future 
before her resignation reynolds had apologized for the 
controversy but stood behind the salary raises she said they were 
years overdue but that she failed to get that information out 
i think i was remiss in recognizing the impact this would 
have reynolds said at thursdays meeting i take 
responsibility for it

the social security administration is seeing 
warning signs of deteriorating service and rising workloads that 
could overwhelm the system a top agency official says in an 
internal memo 
there are signs of this early warning pattern developing in 
all areas of ssas basic operations said the march memo to 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king 
deputy commissioner herbert r doggette jr wrote the memo 
shortly before he retired last month he said both the numbers of 
claims pending and the length of time needed to process them 
increased in 1989 
when this pattern appears it is an early warning of 
deterioration in levels of service doggette wrote 
the possibility clearly exists that at some point workload 
growth could overwhelm our ability to respond given our limited 
resources the memo said 
the memo obtained friday was first described in a report in 
the washington post 
the number of claims pending at social security field offices 
rose 4 percent in 1989 resulting in longer processing times for 
three of four claims filed doggette reported the number of cases 
pending in the agencys six major service centers rose 143 
percent and processing times in the agencys office of disability 
operations rose 6 percent the memo said 
staffing levels at the social security administration were 
slashed from 80000 to 63000 during the reagan years as part of a 
campaign to streamline and modernize the system many agency 
employees have complained that the cuts left them overworked and 
unable to provide good service to the public 
mrs king who took over the agency last august this year has 
dispatched strike teams to visit social security field offices 
and approve hiring additional employees paying overtime and 
obtaining more equipment where needs are the greatest she said 
friday the agency is adding about 500 workers 
im confident now that with the changes we made by the end 
of this fiscal year we will have our workloads well under 
control mrs king said 
she added that with the recent release of 48 million by the 
presidential office of management and budget were fine where we 
are right now if i see that our workloads are increasing even 
more then well go back for even more 
mrs king said the administrations budget request of 42 
billion for the social security administration in the coming fiscal 
year appeared adequate 
however seven senators on friday sent a letter to members of 
the senate appropriations committee requesting an additional 120 
million for 4000 more employees 
the results of understaffing can be devastating for our most 
vulnerable citizens such as povertystricken elderly blind and 
disabled recipients of supplemental security income the senators 
wrote 
the senators said demands on the social security administration 
could balloon next year due to a supreme court decision requiring 
the agency to review an estimated 250000 children for ssi 
eligibility and as 100000 babies addicted to crack are born each 
year who may qualify for ssi 
from past experience we all know how service delivery 
problems can hurt public confidence in the social security 
program the senators wrote we should act now to prevent 
further erosion of confidence in this vital program

the already crowded and polluted cities 
of asia face massive population increases that will exacerbate 
their problems in the decades ahead a un study said friday 
many of the worlds largest cities will be in the asiapacific 
region by the year 2000 according to the report released in 
bangkok the united nations economic and social commission for asia 
and the pacific will hold its 46th annual meeting of 48 nations in 
the thai capital june 4 
bombay with 1179 million and shanghai with 1196 million are 
among the regions largest cities said mohammed rahmatullah chief 
of the human settlement unit of the commission 
and with urban population growth at between 3 percent and 4 
percent a year in the asiapacific region several other cities 
will soon pass the 10 million mark the report said jakarta 
manila karachi tehran and bangkok are all expected to top that 
figure by the centurys end rahmatullah said 
bombay is projected to have 16 million people shanghai 1326 
million jakarta 1325 karachi 12 million manila 1107 million 
bangkok 1071 million and tehran 10 million rahmatullah said 
migration to the metropolis will not ease in the foreseeable 
future the report said pointing to higher salaries more jobs 
and better health and education facilities in urban areas 
migration is exacerbating already pressing urban problems such 
as pollution slums housing shortages excessive traffic and 
shortages of water and electricity 
most asian cities have slums in some cities 50 percent of the 
population lives in shanties squatter settlements or illegally 
divided houses some slum communities are as big as cities it said 
the report called for new lowcost housing land distribution 
and innovative financing to allow urban poor access to bank 
loans 
but urbanization is not an entirely negative force cities 
contribute more than half a countrys gross national product the 
report said 
economic development fuels urbanization and urbanization in 
turn fuels other economic development it said 
the challenge for authorities is to promote economic growth and 
at the same time find ways to solve urban problems rahmatullah 
said 
the commission recommends governments encourage settlement of 
secondary cities set up factories near smaller cities and 
improve job opportunities and services in rural areas

the senate agriculture committee responded to 
concerns about global warming friday by including a forestry 
section in a farm bill for the first time 
in light of the numerous issues that have developed pertaining 
to forestry global warming timber production threatened and 
endangered species air and water quality it is time we 
reexamine our commitment to state and private forestry and the 
numerous owners of small private forests said sen wyche 
fowler dga 
fowler is chairman of the subcommittee on conservation and 
forests and comes from a state where small privately held forest 
acreage generates about 9 billion and provides 80000 jobs 
including forestry in the farm bill underscores an important 
fact said sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the agriculture 
committee the total value of our timber harvests exceeds that of 
any crop including corn soybeans wheat and hay 
about half the timber used commercially in the united states 
comes from the 482 million acres of private forests most of which 
grow wild about 21 million acres are managed to assure certain 
timber supplies are available 
the national forests which supply the rest of the nations 
timber are carefully managed by the federal government 
leahy said one goal of the legislation is to put another 25 
million acres of private forestland under management programs 
the bill which will be in the version of the 1990 farm bill 
that goes to the full senate makes the most significant changes in 
forestry laws in 14 years 
it would 
set up a publicprivate partnership with 8 million private 
forest owners so the private sector could get technical assistance 
already available to government foresters 
establish an easement program through which the government 
would buy development rights from forest owners to assure that 
environmentally sensitive forestlands arent threatened by 
commercial building 
create federal state and local coordination committees to help 
carry out the programs offered by the bill 
money for the programs would be determined later 
the house has not acted on any similar legislation in the 
version of the farm bill it is writing

sen john heinz rpa is calling for 
immediate senate hearings on problems surrounding the 1990 census 
the stakes are too high and the implications too farranging 
for congress not to take an active role in responding to the 
problems heinz said friday 
his comment came only a day after a group of house members took 
the census bureau to task 
mailback response to the census has been slower than expected 
and problems were experienced in getting forms delivered to 48 
million people in several areas 
this is being corrected census director barbara everitt bryant 
told a house census subcommittee meeting on thursday 
she said the accuracy of the count is not in danger but she 
estimated it will cost at least 100 million more than originally 
planned to count people who havent responded by mail 
subcommittee chairman thomas sawyer dohio said the cost 
overrun could be 150 million or more and others have put the 
figure as high as 190 million 
the 1990 census is expected to cost a total of 25 billion 
with 13 billion being spent this year 
although the bureau has not yet begun its detailed doortodoor 
effort to count people who did not respond by mail several house 
members expressed concern that the final count will be inaccurate 
i think we are facing a crisis said rep mervyn dymally 
dcalif who has been pressing for establishment of local census 
coordinators to be appointed by each member of congress 
democratic national chairman ron brown said thursday that the 
possibility of adjusting the final numbers to account for those who 
are overlooked should be considered 
the commerce department parent of the census bureau has 
resisted the idea of adjusting the final figures but says it is 
still considering the possibility 
heinzs call for a hearing on census problems came in a letter 
to sen john glenn dohio head of the governmental affairs

haitians 
by early afternoon traffic was badly snarled even by manhattan

the brooklyn bridge manhattan bridge and all local streets in 
the area of lower manhattan city hall and federal plaza are 
rapidly going to be gridlocked fred feldman spokesman for the 
city department of transportation said 
lt ray odonnell a police spokesman who provided the crowd 
estimate said a lack of organization and leadership among the 
marchers created the traffic disruption 
the march was called to protest a food and drug administration 
policy prohibiting anyone who has emigrated from haiti from giving 
blood as a precaution against spreading aids 
dr joel l solomon director of the fdas division of blood and 
blood products said emigres from haiti and some african countries 
are excluded because the aidsrelated virus is so widespread there 
also aids is transmitted largely through heterosexual activity in 
those countries meaning that the immigrants would not be covered 
by the fda ban on blood donations by men who have had homosexual 
contacts 
the immigrants from the countries affected are mostly black and 
some have charged racism

east germanys new parliament on friday 
debated the path toward unity with its rich western neighbor in a 
session that highlighted fears about the impact of the planned 
merger 
in an interview to be published saturday east germanys finance 
minister walter romberg warned that 70 percent of the countrys 
factories would need huge support or would not survive economic 
union 
and the chief of the former communist party criticized the 
governments plan for unity and said it would allow west germany to 
colonize east germany 
at the parliamentary session lawmakers united behind prime 
minister lothar de maizieres desire for east germanys currency to 
be valued at the same rate as the mighty west german mark but 
differences quickly emerged over the speed of reunification 
taking advantage of the newly found freedom of protest the 
reformed communist party walked out of the chamber after a member 
of an archconservative party likened the communists to the 
hardliners who ruled east germany 40 years 
the arcconservative joachim hubertus nowack of the german 
social union compared the ousted government to the nazi 
dictatorship that preceded it 
the farmers party one of the many factions in the 400seat 
parliament threatened a blockade of openings in the crumbling 
intergerman border if agricultural markets were threatened by a 
flood of imports during the moves toward a market economy 
gregor gysi who took over the battered communist party and 
oversaw its name change to the party for social democracy urged a 
slow merger and said east germans must have a chance to go 
upright into unification 
he said the constitutions of both germanys should be abolished 
and a new series of laws written for a united nation 
economics minister gerhard pohl rejected this with the comment 
no more socialist experiments 
the coalition government led by de maiziere has proposed that 
east germany adopt the existing west german constitution 
wolfgang thierse of the leftleaning social democrats who 
advocated the slower process before it joined the government 
coalition said the quick route is the realistic way to unity 
but he said the social democrats would fight for revisions 
to the constitution to include the right to housing employment and 
education currently laid down in basic east german law 
the chairman of west germanys social democrats hansjochen 
vogel also cautioned against rapid unification 
it would be terrible if we made mistakes because we proceeded 
too quickly mistakes that the people must put right again vogel 
told reporters he was visiting east berlin for the parliament 
session and a meeting with de maiziere 
in an effort to calm fears about massive unemployment de 
maziere said friday that planned tax incentives and new investment 
laws would help create 500000 new jobs in middlesized enterprises 
this year that would compensate for job losses in large state 
concerns 
in an interview in saturdays edition of the west german neue 
westfaelische newspaper finance minister romberg was quoted as 
saying only 30 percent of east germanys industrial concerns could 
handle competition in a free market economy 
he said that 20 percent would survive only with very heavy 
capital expenditure while 50 percent needed a lot of 
investment the text of the article was released in advance to 
other news media

the associated press two british news agencies 
and a television company must hand over all film of a march 31 riot 
in london that left about 580 people injured a judge ruled friday 
at a hearing in the old bailey central criminal court judge 
neil denison granted the police application he rejected arguments 
that freedom of the press is paramount 
he said the right of the press to report freely and the need to 
trace serious offenders clashed and one had to give way 
there are two conflicting areas of public interest denison 
said they have to be weighed and balanced one against the other 
and in a sense they are irreconcilable 
the ap the british domestic news agency press association and 
london weekend television opposed the application on grounds it 
made them appear an arm of the police and endangered their 
photographers 
the fourth organization fleet street news agency made no 
objection 
if applications routinely succeed there is a loss of the 
perceived independence of the media robin oppenheim legal 
counsel for the three news organizations told the court 
police had sought help from news organizations in identifying 
those who participated in the riot that engulfed trafalgar square 
and londons theater district the riot broke out after a 
demonstration against a new tax 
britains 1984 police and criminal evidence act allows a judge 
to order news media to turn over material in the case of serious 
offenses 
on april 6 denison ordered 25 british newspapers and tv 
companies to turn over their film to help identify rioters police 
then asked for film held by news agencies and london weekend 
television 
the order which the judge is to sign monday means the ap and 
press association must give police all negatives of the riot 
but the judge said the ap press association and london weekend 
television were right to oppose the application 
orders such as this should not be made as a matter of 
course he said 
it would be wrong if the media were to back down and concede 
every application that is made he said they are perfectly 
entitled to come to court and put their arguments 
the violence broke out after demonstrators tried to storm prime 
minister margaret thatchers 10 downing st office they then 
attacked police and rampaged across londons west end 
nearly 500 police officers and 86 civilians were injured and 
hundreds of shops were looted and cars burned

lithuanias prime minister came to the 
heartland of norways petroleum industry friday and suggested a 
trade of farm products for oil to help the baltic republic survive 
a soviet energy blockade 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene asked about reports soviet 
soldiers stormed a printing plant and beat civilian guards in 
vilnius denounced the soviets 
its not so easy for the soviet army to provoke conflicts and 
clashes although it is often clear that this is their aim mrs 
prunskiene told reporters 
we can only say that these clashes are very unpleasant but 
the situation has happened before she said 
she also said she had been told by lithuanian authorities in 
vilnius that a trip she planned to the united states and canada at 
the end of april had been canceled apparently to avoid a conflict 
with the ussoviet summit set to begin may 30 
i got the idea that my trip was too close to the summit 
meeting in america but im not sure this is why the trip was 
postponed she said after receiving a cable from the foreign 
ministry in vilnius 
the soviet union trying to prod lithuania to recant on 
secessionist moves has cut off crude oil supplies and most of its 
natural gas supply 
mrs prunskiene came to this west coast oil town to meet 
managers of the government statoil company the company has said it 
is ready to sell oil to lithuania on a normal commercial basis 
the norwegian government told the lithuanians they are welcome 
to buy its north sea crude but it has given no promises of aid or 
credit 
mrs prunskiene suggested that lithuania and norway could trade 
agricultural products and other products for oil though we dont 
know if norway is interested in buying our products 
it would be natural for those who buy oil to also pay for it 
but our situation is different as you know the hard currency has 
always been taken from lithuania to moscow she told reporters 
the soviet embargo means the time has come in lithuania to 
find new sources of oil deliveries and look to other countries 
she said this looking for new possibilities may start in this 
city 
norway which pumps 15 million barrels a day from north sea oil 
fields is the secondlargest oil exporter outside the opec oil 
cartel it also produces natural gas but has no way to deliver it 
to lithuania 
mrs prunskiene said her delegation would explore the 
possibility of refining norwegian crude oil in lithuania though it 
would take several months to set up an infrastructure to transport 
the oil to the refinery 
she said the small republic which lacks hard currency would 
seek foreign markets for dairy produce and other farm products 
previously sold through soviet authorities in exchange lithuania 
gets energy supplies at belowmarket rates 
if the soviets cut off oil deliveries its natural that 
lithuania will answer with its own coin she said 
lithuania also would seek export credits which she said would 
not necessarily have to be given by the exporting country 
the delegation leaves norway on saturday for denmark it made 
hasty arrangements for a stop in sweden on sunday before returning 
home

trip wire they believe connaghan rigged at the warehouse which has 
been burglarized of his tools eight times since 1987 the front 
door of the warehouse bore the inscription danger enter at own 
risk 
tim mccomb father of the slain youth declined comment other 
than to say id just as soon let it be 
the mother of one of the unidentified youths told the denver 
post they were talked into doing this its quite devastating 
our kid got led into something he shouldnt have gotten led into 
early has said colorados makemyday law which allows 
people to use deadly force to defend themselves in their homes 
probably does not apply the law was nicknamed after a line from a 
clint eastwood movie friends of the 46yearold connaghan

he put bars on the windows put up steel doors and even welded 
them shut and he couldnt keep the burglars out he even had a 
danger sign on the front saying enter at your own risk and that 
didnt keep them out 
connaghan lost more than 7000 in tools during a burglary last 
july the warehouse also holds auto parts acetylene torches and 
truck camper shells 
nearly everyone here has had their cars broken into or their 
houses broken into and theyre just fed up said corbin 
police wouldnt do anything about it or couldnt do anything 
about it they couldnt just stop their patrols to guard one 
building 
somethings wrong maybe its the whole system but people are 
fed up and so far all of the callers are saying its time we did 
something about it i havent had one person say they thought it 
was wrong corbin said 
corbin said connaghan often brought his granddaughter to the 
restaurant while he drank coffee 
hed give you the shirt off his back and im sorry to see him 
go to jail for people who took everything he owned he said if 
he goes to the penitentiary for this crime will just go up in the 
area because criminals will know they can get by with a slap on the

about two dozen foreign correspondents were back 
in lithuania on friday but only for a few days on a trip 
organized by the soviet foreign ministry 
the soviet government expelled virtually all foreign 
correspondents from lithuania on april 1 under threat of losing 
their accreditation in the soviet union 
no explanation was given for that order or for the special 
foreign ministrysponsored trip about 20 to 25 journalists who 
were given permission to stay in lithuania until sunday 
the trip came just as moscow cut oil and gas supplies to the 
baltic republic in its latest attempt to force lithuania into 
rescinding its march 11 declaration of independence 
journalists said it appears that the small lithuanian communist 
party faction loyal to moscow was behind the trip hoping to win 
coverage of its party congress saturday this group has 
orchestrated the intimidation tactics of soviet troops including 
the occupation of public buildings in lithuanias capital vilnius 
the moscow loyalists seemed unhappy when some of the journalists 
arriving in vilnius on thursday night immediately left their care 
to cover the story of the kremlin embargo 
most correspondents were too busy to consider the party leaders 
offer of a city tour friday 
but several attended a news conference where the communist 
groups leader vladislav schved repeated his demands for 
imposition of presidential rule that could include martial law and 
dissolution of the parliament that so infuriates him 
other journalists went to a briefing with military officers 
on saturday the partys congress faces major competition for 
the journalists attention on the same day the proindependence 
movement sajudis will hold its own congress and it claims more 
than 10 times the schved groups 35000 members 
journalists said soviet officials have not interfered with their 
work but all must leave on sunday and the republic remains 
offlimits for regular travel 
participation on this weeks trip was restricted but apparently 
arbitrarily the new york times the washington post and cable news 
network all asked to go and were told they were not included on the 
trip 
all also requested permission to travel to vilnius on their own 
simultaneously with the foreign ministry excursion they were 
denied permission

soviet ambassador yuri dubinin said friday 
that chances for a fair and honest dialogue with breakaway 
lithuania were improved by the soviet parliaments adoption of 
legislation implementing the constitutional right to secede 
but dubinin repeated the kremlins position that the next step 
toward dialogue cannot be taken until lithuania withdraws its 
unilateral declaration of independence and enters talks based on 
the soviet constitution and the new soviet law of secession 
i would like to say once more that the soviet government would 
like nothing more than to settle this problem by an open and honest 
dialogue dubinin told reporters at the soviet embassy 
there would be no one in the globe more interested in this 
than we are he said 
because of the adoption of the new law he said the 
conditions are now there to go forward in the spirit of perestroika 
and the rule of law 
meanwhile at the state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said secretary of state james a baker iii raised the 
issue of lithuania at a meeting on arms control issues with dubinin 
and soviet deputy foreign minister viktor p karpov 
baker restated the us position that the independence crisis in 
lithuania should be resolved peacefully and that a process should 
be started leading to dialogue ms tutwiler said 
she said the united states continues to consult with its allies 
on the situation in lithuania 
the united states has declared that reprisals can be expected if 
the kremlin uses force or coercion to force lithuania into line 
dubinin said he had seen no sign the lithuanians were willing to 
begin a dialogue on the terms spelled out by moscow 
at the present time i have no indication of their willingness 
to do so he said 
until now the lithuanians do not accept this element he 
said the answer has to be given by vilnius the lithuanian 
capital 
the new soviet law of secession calls for independence to be 
ratified by a twothirds majority in a referendum such a vote 
would be followed by a fiveyear transition period 
responding to a question dubinin said that while it is true the 
soviets have sharply reduced the flow of natural gas into lithuania 
in an attempt to force the withdrawal of the lithuanian 
parliaments independence decree gas is still reaching the country 
at the level necessary to assure each days needs of the 
population 
it is at a lower level but sufficient to assure normal 
life he said 
moscow completely cut off oil supplies to lithuania on wednesday 
night 
dubinin spoke during ceremonies in which he accepted a gift on 
behalf of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the gift a large cross fabricated of black walnut and bronze 
was presented by officials of architectural metalwork inc of 
tarpon springs fla to show support for gorbachevs policies of 
democratization expanded free enterprise and increased religious 
freedom 
the cross bears the russian word mir meaning peace 
pat shrader one of the owners of the company said she and her 
associates thought it was important that a message of support for 
gorbachevs policies come from just grass roots and nonfamous 
people 
our individual lives are degraded or improved by the 
conditions surrounding us she told dubinin saying the groups 
wish for gorbachev is wisdom and success

tass news agency reported 
the city council was dominated by reformers in recent elections 
which were the first multicandidate elections for local 
representative bodies in the soviet union

council was reflected in the 280162 vote for popov he has 
captured national attention for his leadership of the countrys 
first parliamentary opposition group the progressive interregional 
group of the congress of peoples deputies 
soviet officials are allowed to hold two elected posts 
simultaneously

for the soviet capital which has fallen into extreme disrepair 
under decades of neglect he strongly supports a market economy and 
has suggested rationing during the transition period to allocate 
scarce items fairly 
in a nationally televised speech in december popov harshly 
criticized premier nikolai ryzhkovs economic reform plan for 
continuing central planning for five more years he noted it went 
so far into micromanagement as to set the number of eggs to be 
produced per person 
popov suggested that if bureaucrats want to increase egg 
production they should raise chickens 
popov is a member of the communist party but as a supporter of 
the democratic platform wing he is in danger of being ousted by

the government posted a 5334 billion budget 
deficit in march a monthly record pushing the imbalance past 
the grammrudman 1990 target in just six months the treasury 
department reported friday 
the march gap between spending and revenues produced a deficit 
of 15085 billion for the fiscal year that began oct 1 175 
percent more than the 1284 billion imbalance during the first 
half of 1989 
revenues last month were down 49 percent from march 1989 to 
6482 billion while spending rose 136 percent to 11816 billion 
the 5334 billion difference was the widest monthly gap since a 
394 billion imbalance was posted in may 1986 according to james 
blum assistant director of the congressional budget office 
louis crandall an economist with rh wrightson of new york 
said the deficit so far this year points to a return to 200 
billion imbalances that existed until recently 
crandall attributed most of the march deficit to federal deposit 
insurance corp payments spending by the resolution trust corp to 
bail out failed savings and loans expedited income tax refunds as 
a result of electronic filing systems and federal reserve losses 
because of the falling value of its foreign currency reserves 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law set a target of 100 
billion for the total fiscal 1990 deficit but the law sets no 
pentalities if the actual deficit ends up exceeding the target an 
eventuality that has occurred every year since grammrudman was 
enacted in 1985 
the bush administration budget last january estimated the 1990 
deficit to be 1238 billion the congressional budget office in 
march projected the deficit would be 159 billion 
for the sixmonth period revenues totaled 45829 billion up 
39 percent from the first six months of 1989 spending totaled 
60915 billion a 698 percent increase 
as usual the biggest spending categories in march were for the 
military social security and other programs in the department of 
health and human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 2869 billion in march and 14547 
billion so far this year it is projected to total 28679 billion 
for the entire fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 2033 billion for the 
month and 11938 billion for the year so far they are expected to 
total 24459 billion for the year 
other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid totaled 
1740 billion in march and 19117 billion for the year 
interest on the national debt totaled 1754 billion during 
february and 25485 billion for the year

the chinese communist party said in a rare public 
release of a major internal document friday that it must resist 
the corrosive influence of the decaying ideologies to maintain 
close ties with the people 
the pledge belied the partys deep anxiety over its ability to 
continue its 41year rule over the worlds most populous nation in 
the wake of plunging public support 
the danger of alienation from the masses may spring up if the 
party does not use its power properly and consciously resist 
the corrosive influence of the decaying ideologies of the 
bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes said the document it 
was approved by a party central committee meeting last month and 
issued via the official xinhua news agency 
the rise or fall of the party and the state depends on whether 
fleshandblood ties with the masses can be maintained and 
developed the central committee document said 
central committee documents are rarely made public and the 
release of this one appeared intended to dramatize the seriousness 
of the partys repeated calls for tightening discipline rooting 
out corruption and improving its public relations 
the communists who took power in 1949 with widespread support 
lost some popularity in the 1950s with forced collectivization and 
in the 1960s with the violent farleftist cultural revolution but 
public disillusionment and cynicism have reached a new high since 
the leadership used the army in june to put down prodemocracy 
protesters killing hundreds and possibly thousands 
the fall of hardline communist governments in east europe and 
ethnic clashes on the edges of this vast nation most recently in 
the moslem west have further undermined the partys stature 
our party and state are presently at a crucial period of 
historical development it said unhealthy tendencies such as 
bureaucracy and individualism and corruptive practices such as 
seeking personal gain through abuse of power have emerged among 
some party cadres in recent years 
we must resolutely rid all malpractices that cut us off from 
the masses and boost our partys cohesive force and fighting 
power it ordered 
among other things the document told party officials to go 
deep down to the grass roots and take part in production so as to 
learn problems firsthand they should shun formalism mix 
with the masses treat them as equals be willing to learn from 
them and avoid putting on airs it said 
party officials must not use public funds to hold banquets and 
must refuse gifts it added in recent years bribes have become an 
implicitly accepted part of doing business in china 
the orders invoked the spirit of the revolutionary era when 
communist soldiers were famous for helping the peasants and not 
taking anything in return since last years protests the partys 
aging leaders have spoken nostalgically of that era and the wartime 
virtues of austere living personal sacrifice and patriotism 
the document said leading officials who hold themselves aloof 
and evoke dissatisfaction from the masses should be fired but 
it did not name anyone one of chinas least popular officials is 
premier li peng who signed the order imposing martial law in 
beijing last year during the protests 
there was speculation he might be removed to placate the public 
but at the recent annual session of chinas legislature he appeared 
firmly in power 
the document reflecting senior leader deng xiaopings policy of 
allowing small democracy said party officials should listen to 
the opinions of ordinary people and not retaliate against criticism 
but it made clear that big democracy pluralism and an end 
to absolute party control is not under consideration 
instead it ordered an increase in marxist education closer 
supervision of the partys 18 million members tightened discipline 
and absolute obedience to central party officials

concealing covert government operations from 
legitimate congressional inquiries poses a danger to democracy 
irancontra prosecutor lawrence walsh said friday 
in a speech at the university of oklahoma walsh said the need 
for truth in important human affairs is critically needed for 
the checks and balances of our constitution 
when the reagan administrations secret contra and iran 
initiatives were threatened with exposure in 1986 disturbingly 
the reaction among some of our most sophisticated intelligence 
operatives and superiors were not unlike those of more 
simpleminded conspirators said walsh 
first some lied separately then some lied in concert then 
some destroyed documents and notes 
the independent counsel has been investigating the scandal since 
december 1986 he obtained the conviction of former national 
security adviser john poindexter on five felony charges april 7 
poindexter was found guilty of covering up from congress oliver 
norths secret contra resupply operation and the us role in a 
november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran north is appealing 
his conviction of last year on three felonies in the affair 
the obstruction by some administration officials of legitimate 
congressional inquiries illuminates the need for the rule of 
law to function in the sphere of covert government activities 
said walsh 
he said the claim that congressional inquiries into 
intelligence activities might be answered by lies has been rejected 
by two district judges and two juries 
the need for secrecy is increasing to meet threats to us 
security said walsh but that means an everhigher premium must 
be placed by congress and the public on the truthfulness of 
executive branch officials who conduct covert operations 
walsh said reagan administration officials covered up norths 
contra supply network because truthful responses would have 
invited legislative actions designed to end all secret support 
to the contras 
the prosecutor said the iran arms sales presented an even more 
dangerous threat of hostile congressional reaction because the 
reagan administrations proclaimed policy was that the us 
would not pay ransom for hostages

more japanese than american companies ranked 
among the top 10 recipients of us patents in 1989 the commerce 
department said friday 
half of the top 10 spots went to japanese firms and four of 
those companies outranked any american company the departments 
patent and trademark office said 
three us companies were in the top 10 for the fiscal year 
which ended last september 30 
the largest number of patents went to japans hitachi corp 
marking the fourth year in a row that a japanese company has 
occupied the top position 
hitachi which received 1053 patents was followed by three 
other japanese companies in the top spots toshiba received 961 
patents canon 949 and fuji photo film had 884 
general electric co which had held the top spot from 1969 
until 1986 was the top american company on the list with 818 
patents dropping to fifth place from fourth last year 
other american companies in the top 10 were international 
business machines corp no 9 with 623 patents and eastman kodak 
in tenth place with 589 patents 
other foreign companies in the top 10 were japans mitsubishi 
denki in sixth place with 767 patents us philips corp the 
subsidiary of a dutch firm in seventh place with 745 patents and 
the german manufacturing firm seimens in eighth place with 656 
patents 
us industrial experts have said the trend of foreign 
companies especially the japanese dominating us patents is 
another demonstration that american companies are not adequately 
investing in the research and development necessary to keep the 
united states competitive in overseas markets in coming years 
the patent office said it issued a record 102712 patents in 
1989 a 23 percent increase from the 83584 patents issued in 1988 
while foreigners obtained almost half of all patents issued last 
year the percentage was down slightly from 1988 in 1989 
foreigners received 467 percent of all us patents compared to 
473 percent in 1988

than 12 hours at the vatin border crossing with romania quarrels 
and occasional fistfights broke out between customs officials and 
impatient travelers 
starting friday east european and soviet citizens entering 
yugoslavia through its borders with hungary romania and bulgaria 
had to change the equivalent of 200 in western currencies to 
yugoslav dinars 
many eastern europeans do not generally possess convertible 
western currency 
officially the strict money policy was introduced to prevent 
east europeans from bringing in large quantities of cheap goods 
without paying import duties and selling them at yugoslav flea 
markets 
the borba daily however said the measure was introduced after 
western nations suggested yugoslavia should become a filter 
zone for east europeans seeking asylum in the west 
the shortest road from romania and bulgaria to austria and italy 
is through yugoslavia 
over the past two years thousands of east europeans have poured 
into yugoslavia selling tools canned foods spare parts for 
sovietbuilt cars household utensils and other items at cutrate 
prices 
the influx of east europeans increased markedly this year after 
the dinar became freely convertible this made yugoslavia a 
particularly attractive venue for east europeans who in their own 
countries find it hard to get their hands on large amounts of hard 
currency 
in yugoslavia after selling their wares for dinars they can 
easily exchange the currency for us dollars or west german marks

the soviet union has assured vietnam that all 
soviet troops will be out of the asian nation by 1992 a senior 
member of the house armed services committee said friday 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo who headed a sevenmember 
congressional delegation that visited the western pacific and 
southeast asia last week issued a report that described soviet 
intentions in vietnam and discussed us bases overseas 
vietnam foreign minister nguyen co thach told the delegation 
that all soviet troops would be out of vietnam by 1992 schroeder 
said in the 44page report this is good news 
the soviet union moved into the usbuilt base at cam ranh bay 
at the conclusion of the vietnam war in 1975 but pentagon 
officials said in january that the soviets had withdrawn some 
fighter planes and bombers 
in an interview with reporters schroeder said the soviets no 
longer are basing their planned withdrawal from cam rahn bay on 
whether the united states remains at the subic naval base in the 
philippines as they have said previously 
leases on six us installations in the philippines expire in 
1991 and american officials anticipate difficult negotiations for 
continued base rights there 
the colorado congresswoman also said thach disputed recent 
reports that the vietnamese would allow the united states to use 
cam rahn bay as a military base 
the vietnamese have no interest in permitting the united 
states to use cam rahn bay schroeder said the foreign minister 
told the group 
he said that nations with friendship agreements with vietnam 
could ask to use the facilities and he hopes that vietnam and the 
united states could in the future commence friendly relations 
earlier this month rep thomas ridge rpa said vietnamese 
officials privately suggested allowing the us military to return 
to the base if relations between the countries continued to warm 
ridge met with vietnamese officials during an indonesia forum 
sponsored by the henry r luce foundation and attended by several 
lawmakers and a group of topranking officials of vietnams 
communist government 
schroeder said officials in many asian and western pacific 
nations count on us support but are not eager to have american 
troops stationed on their soil 
its clear they want us in the region not so much because they 
fear the soviet presence but because they fear a power vacuum not 
knowing who might move in she said theyd like us in the 
region but not in their country 
based on this reaction schroeder said she will introduce 
legislation next week calling for dual basing in which most of 
the army air force and marine corps units would be stationed in 
the united states unless some operational requirement exists to 
place them overseas 
the units would be sent on shortterm assignments ranging from a 
week to six months for exercises and training 
the passage and implementation of this legislation would 
permit the closure of the vast majority of the 86 major and 37 
minor overseas installations said schroeder who heads the house 
armed services subcommittee on military installations and 
facilities 
the congresswoman has been critical of defense secretary dick 
cheneys list of candidates for base closing charging that the 
list is partisan and fails to include enough overseas bases

some 25000 compact pickup trucks converted 
into small motorhomes have a defect that could cause their rear 
wheels to come off according to federal highway safety officials 
who plan a hearing on the problem 
in the first such action in six years involving a vehicle on 
us roads the national highway traffic safety administration 
upgraded a 2yearold defects investigation into an initial 
determination that a safety defect exists 
the action taken earlier this week could lead to a recall but 
none has yet been ordered said nhtsa spokesman tim hurd on friday 
manufacturers usually issue recalls on their own before the 
government forces the issue but the motorhomes are built by 30 
different companies he said 
the last step before a recall order will be a public meeting may 
23 in washington at which anyone may testify 
the agency determined that the motorhomes have overloaded rear 
axles which can cause failure of wheel bearings or axle shafts and 
result in the vehicles wheels coming off 
the vehicles have prompted 440 reports of problems including 16 
accidents with injuries and 63 instances in which wheels fell off 
the axles according to george reagle nhtsa associate 
administrator for enforcement 
the small motorhomes are nearly all modified versions of toyota 
minipickup trucks with double wheels installed in the rear about 
25000 were sold between 1977 and 1986 nhtsa said 
reagle warned owners of the homes to take precautions until the 
issue is settled 
he recommended that they avoid unbalanced loads minimize weight 
on the rear axle keep water tanks nearly empty while traveling 
and avoid towing anything or using a roof rack 
tire pressure should be checked frequently with inside tires at 
a slightly higher pressure than those on the outside he said also 
recommending that rear wheel bearings be inspected every 10000 
miles and that a competent mechanic be asked to inspect the whole 
rear axle and rear suspension

oklahoma teachers expressed hope friday 
that the largest reform and funding bill in state history would end 
the no more pencils no more books crisis they said they had 
faced for years 
most teachers and their students were back in classes friday 
after an unprecedented fourday walkout that brought thousands of 
protesting teachers to the capitol to push for passage of the 
education bill 
thats one of the things that got us this bill gerald 
hoeltzel state school superintendent said of the funding crisis 
as the amount of money available for education dwindled over the 
past few years some school districts flatly told teachers there 
was no money for instructional materials and others made just small 
amounts available to the teachers 
as a result hoeltzel said teachers had to dip into their own 
pockets to buy construction paper and supplemental books 
we ran a little survey last year and we found out that the 
average oklahoma teacher was spending 354 of his own money for 
supplies for his students hoeltzel said 
the national education association ranked oklahoma 48th in 
teacher salaries and 46th in total funding for public schools 
the oklahoma education association urged teachers to return to 
classes friday after passage of the education bill neither the 
association nor hoeltzel was able to say how many schools remained 
closed those that did not reopen friday were expected to resume 
classes monday 
the 230 million bill passed by the senate provides the largest 
infusion of funds to public schools in state history the bill 
calls for spending 681 million to raise minimum teacher salaries 
by 1500 a year for four years additional money may be spent on 
salaries at the discretion of the school districts 
oklahoma teacher salaries average 22000 annually the national 
average is 29648 
it is not uncommon to find a singleincome teacher whose 
family can qualify for reducedprice lunches hoeltzel said 
thousands of teachers deserted the classrooms and walked the 
picket line at the capitol to pressure the senate for final passage 
of the bill as well as the emergency clause which makes the bill 
go into effect as soon as gov henry bellmon signs it instead of 
the usual 90day wait 
bellmon a republican called the special legislative session to 
address school funding and said he would sign the bill the signing 
is expected next week 
a twomonth stalemate was broken late thursday when five 
democratic senators switched and voted for the emergency clause 
the bill got only one republican vote a fact bellmon said is 
nothing to be proud of 
although the bill will provide 230 million for education in its 
first year part of that will be siphoned off for a sales tax 
rebate for poor people that was the concession made to get the 
necessary five votes for the emergency clause 
the oea represents 31000 of the states 35000 school teachers 
an estimated 20000 teachers took part in the walkout at various 
times and education officials said about 60 percent or 343200 of 
the states 572000 students were affected by the walkout

the army said friday it grounded all 290 of 
its ch47d chinook cargo helicopters after cracks were found in 
barrel nuts in a chopper undergoing routine maintenance 
none will fly again until each of its four barrel nuts is 
inspected the army said 
the chinook is the armys only mediumlift helicopter it has 
twin engines tandem rotors and is designed to move ammunition 
repair parts petroleum troops artillery and special weapons 
about the battlefield 
the chopper built by boeing helicopter co was designed in the 
1950s and fielded in 1962 a modernization program was begun in 
1975 to upgrade the choppers three models to the newest d 
version the modernization included such changes as adding new 
fiberglass rotor blades new transmission and drive systems and 
modernized hydraulic and electrical systems 
in a statement the army said the grounding was ordered because 
cracks have been found in the barrel nuts associated with the 
aircrafts forward transmission four of the nuts are used to 
secure the transmission to the airframe the statement said 
it is estimated that approximately 300 of the suspect barrel 
nuts are currently in the armys inventory the statement said

senate democrats offering an olive branch 
to spur serious negotiations with republicans on campaign finance 
reform retreated friday on their demand for fixed ceilings on how 
much candidates can spend 
caucusing behind closed doors for nearly two hours democratic 
senators also agreed to embrace proposals by republican sen john 
danforth of missouri for reducing the cost of tv advertising and 
discouraging negative campaign tactics 
were trying to send a signal to republicans i hope theyll 
look upon it as a signal said oklahoma sen david boren the 
author of a democratic campaign reform bill that the partys 
leaders want to bring to the senate floor late next week 
the democratic meeting followed a similar gop meeting thursday 
among more than half of the senates 45 republicans on campaign 
reform senators planned to huddle again in party caucuses next 
tuesday 
boren and kentucky sen mitch mcconnell a gop point man on the 
issue both plan to have revised porposals on behalf of their 
parties prepared by early next week 
before you can have real negotiations you have to have each 
side say here is our starting point boren said we know 
were not going to enact a law by picking off people on the other 
side fundamentally it is going to have to be a bill that is not 
passed on party lines 
however one new obstacle to a possible consensus emerged friday 
among the 20 democratic senators up for reelection in 1992 
several among them including some of the nine who swept seats 
formerly held by republicans in 1986 to return the senate to 
democratic control objected to any new restrictions until after 
the 92 election 
everybodys for it in the abstract and wants it to take 
effect next time quipped sen robert c byrd dwva 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said democrats would 
exchange ideas over the weekend on how to grandfather 
exemptions for candidates who have already raised and spent so 
much they face exceeding the limits well before the 1992 election 
while boren said such exemptions would obviously apply to 
challengers as well minority republicans can be expected to raise 
vigorous objections because incumbents easily amass large campaign 
chests early in the sixyear senate election cycle 
the development could throw the 1986 class of freshman democrats 
in the senate into an unusual alliance with house republican 
campaign officials who already are building a warchest for the 
1992 election 
because 1992 is the first election after congressional districts 
are reapportioned based on this years census republicans look 
upon it as a better opportunity than 1990 to cut significantly into 
the 258176 majority that democrats now enjoy in the house 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash according to sources 
has even suggested to his gop counterpart rep bob michel of 
illinois that democrats might consider delaying implementation of 
any new campaign spendig law until after 1992 as a concession to 
republicans 
mitchell said friday there has been no such talk among senate 
democrats 
boren said the revised democratic package will include 
flexible ceilings that would restrict how much candidates can 
raise from outofstate donors but impose no limits on small 
contributions from instate residents

the ceasefire in nicaraguas 
9yearold civil war and an agreement to dismantle the rebel army 
have bought time for the incoming usbacked government to show it 
can solve the countrys problems 
a pacified nicaragua is essential to presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro whose inauguration wednesday will end a decade 
of leftist sandinista rule mrs chamorros promises of reviving 
the moribund economy were a key reason for her electoral rout feb 
25 of president daniel ortegas sandinistas 
im very happy mrs chamorro said after the agreements were 
signed thursday because we dont want war anymore we want peace 
and reconciliation 
the history of peace and ceasefire pacts in central america is 
not encouraging but the agreements appear to have a better chance 
than most of succeeding 
for one thing the negotiations involved one of the contras 
senior field leaders oscar sovalbarro most previous agreements 
have been about the contras without actually involving them giving 
them no stake in compliance 
the sandinistas appear to have decided to play the part of a 
democratic opposition after their electoral defeat they are moving 
to change from a narrowly defined revolutionary party to a broader 
political movement 
in the two days of talks there was little of the posturing that 
suggests the parties are playing for publicity only one 
photographer was allowed into the signing ceremony unlike past 
scenes of walltowall photographers 
let it be clear that what has been signed here is something 
serious something formal and i think that we all have the good 
will to fulfill this signed document sovalbarro said 
sandinista army gen humberto ortega defense minister and 
brother of the president said he was satisfied with what he called 
an agreement reached in a profound serious way with a great 
spirit of responsibility 
but nine years of civil war and 30000 deaths in a country of 3 
million have left a legacy of suspicion guns have always meant 
power in central america where democracy has no tradition and 
neither side wants to be the first to put down its weapons 
on thursday president ortega said the agreements brought the 
nation much closer to peace but the pacts still had to be 
carried out 
the war will have disappeared on the moment that all the 
contras have disarmed he said 
for its part the sandinista party controls not just the army 
but also cooperative farms unions and other peasant and worker 
organizations that have weapons cadres at neighborhood party 
headquarters are also armed 
the sandinistas fear the contras would become a rightwing 
military force and help overturn reforms in health education and 
land distribution the contras fear continued sandinista control of 
the army would lead to an overthrow of mrs chamorro 
both sides fear a wave of vendettas if families seek the return 
of seized farms or revenge for those slain in the fighting 
the bitterness was visible only hours after the accords were 
signed when a senior us state department envoy was surrounded by 
a mob pounding on his cars windows demanding the contras be 
demobilized at once 
washington backed the contras in their war it then supported 
mrs chamorro in the election and backed her call for the contras 
dissolution 
an additional problem is finding jobs for demobilized fighters 
the contras number about 9000 and the sandinista army is much 
larger although it has suffered from desertion 
mrs chamorros united national opposition alliance is pressing 
the united states for 300 million in aid with a good chunk to be 
devoted to disbanding the contras but even if the aid arrives 
quickly the government wont be able to ease the chronic economic 
problems including unemployment 
the ceasefire took effect thursday and the contras agreed to 
dismantle by june 10 6 weeks after mrs chamorro takes office 
wednesday that represented a concession by the contras who had 
refused to even consider talking about disarming until mrs 
chamorro took power 
the sandinistas had been demanding the contras disband by 
inauguration day but gen ortega said june 10 was soon enough the 
lag will also allow each to assess the others sincerity 
mrs chamorros alliance and the sandinistas signed an agreement 
march 27 that called for shrinking and depoliticizing the army in 
exchange for government recognition of the armys 
professionalism 
mrs chamorros coalition views the contras as both allies and 
problems and some contras suspect the new government would like 
nothing more than for the contras to go away now that electoral 
victory has been achieved 
the coalition gained the most from thursdays agreement even if 
it only postpones the issues of disarming and demobilizing 
the agreements give the new government some not much but some 
political breathing space if it can show that it is in control 
those who are dissatisfied may find themselves isolated and the 
disarmament agreements will have a better chance of sticking and 
bringing peace at last to nicaragua

wood doors window frames and railing was the backdrop for the 
platform where miss hayes spoke the steamboat was designated a 
national landmark in 1989 
docked next to the delta queen was the sevendeck mississippi 
queen which carried miss hayes from new orleans to vicksburg and 
back 
flags of the 14 states that line the mississippi river system 
and a united states flag fluttered behind the platform which also 
bore a 5foothigh cake decorated like the floating wedding 
cake the steamboat behind it

regardless of snags or water levels 
despite that the first gordon greene made an excellent business 
of steamboats he his wife mary who stood watches with her

and their sons eventually owned a fleet of 28 boats 
in 1946 their son tom bought the delta queen at an auction from

for 875000 in 1926 as a sacramento river luxury shuttle but was 
taken over by the navy in 1940 painted gray and renamed yard ferry 
boat 56 
tom greene bought the boat for 46250 but had to pay another 
750000 to scrape off the navy paint and restore the delta queen 
the company was renamed the delta queen steamboat co in 1973 
the flagships captain for the past 14 years has been gabriel 
gabe chengery 42

president bushs 1991 defense budget could be 
cut nearly 6 billion through reductions including star wars 
spending and delaying a plan to put mx nuclear missiles on rail 
cars the chairman of the senate armed services committee said 
friday 
sen sam nunn dga called for a military budget of 297 
billion to 298 billion for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
bush wants a 303 billion budget including an additional 1 
billion for the strategic defense initiative commonly known as 
star wars 
assuming sdi is redirected into a coherent and rational 
research program i believe it should be funded at roughly the 
current appropriated level nunn said in a speech on the senate 
floor 
congress approved about 38 billion for the antimissile shield 
in 1990s 296 billion defense budget the sdi total marked the 
first reduction in the program in six years 
nunns overall budget proposal is about 15 billion more than 
the cut adopted thursday by the house budget committee and some 6 
billion higher than the figure suggested by senate budget committee 
chairman sen james sasser dtenn 
i think the fight will be to try to keep defense even at the 
levels im talking about nunn said 
he projected defense savings of about 3 billion to 35 billion 
this year from the changes in the strategic programs and between 
20 billion and 30 billion over the next five years 
nunns comments on the budget were the first by the powerful 
chairman of the armed services committee he is the leading defense 
expert among conservative democrats 
elsewhere on capitol hill white house budget director richard 
darman dismissed all democratic defense proposals and argued that 
lawmakers affection for pet defense project in their districts 
will prevail over the cuts 
as it gets much more clear what it means for particular 
congressmens districts youll see the political system 
independent of defense strategy start to put a bottom on that 
defense cut darman said 
nunn called his budget range a realistic and responsible 
target 
he said there should be a delay in placing multiplewarhead mx 
missiles on railroad cars and criticized the purchase of trains 
while the pentagan is still conducting tests 
the bush budget calls for 22 billion to put 50 mx missiles on 
rail cars 
sens carl levin dmich and james jeffords rvt introduced 
legislation friday that would cut 16 billion of the 
administration proposal for the mx that total represents all the 
procurement and military construction funds in bushs budget for mx 
the mx railgarrison funding plan is a classic example of the 
flawed buy before you fly policy that has cost the country so 
much money in recent years levin said in a speech on the senate 
floor 
nunn reiterated his support for the singlewarhead midgetman 
missile but suggested deployment in existing silos with mobile 
launchers a later option 
he repeated his opposition to development of a new shortrange 
nuclear missile in europe and questioned buying a new trident 
submarine each year and trident d5 missiles with nuclear warheads 
in short supply 
nunn reserved comment on the b2 stealth bomber until after 
defense secretary dick cheney briefs members of congress on the 
pentagons review of major aircraft programs however nunn said 
the b2 program of 132 planes at a cost of 72 billion must be 
made more affordable 
nunn called for slashing bushs defense budget authority to 289 
billion to 291 billion about 18 billion less than the president 
has proposed for fiscal 1991 
because budget authority represents the amount that can be spent 
over several years such as in a longterm contract to purchase 
warships the cut would force reductions in future pentagon 
spending plans

this weekend in islamorada where bush has scheduled a fishing 
excursion and a ceremony honoring a coral reef preservation group 
on sunday one group has promised daiquiris mixed in solarpowered 
blenders 
also some officials have criticized the administrations 
inaction on the oil drilling issue and sundays upcoming earth day 
celebrations to assail bush who proclaimed himself the 
environmental president while campaigning 
for bush to remain silent when all of the florida keys is 
opposed to offshore oil drilling is appalling said ann 
whitfield executive director of the florida public interest 
research group this would have been the time to act but he 
missed an opportunity to show he has a real interest in the 
environment 
bush has said he is willing to ban drilling in some 
environmentally sensitive areas but stopped short of guaranteeing 
protection of the florida keys 
rep dante fascell dfla urged bush to ban oil drilling and 
support a coast guard plan to move shipping lanes farther from 
fragile reefs off the keys where three freighters ran aground last 
year 
you know all the arguments and i look forward to the day when 
we will spend our time telling fish stories instead of debating the 
issues fascell said in a letter to bush issued thursday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that bush 
will not make a policy announcement on the oil drilling issue this 
weekend fitzwater said a taskforce report on oil drilling off 
florida and california needs more study 
the special presidential task force issued its report in 
january but the findings have not been disclosed a temporary 
moratorium on oil exploration on key tracts off the california and 
florida expires oct 1 
there are 73 leases issued to oil companies off floridas 
southwest coast affected by the present moratorium in california 
oil companies have proposed developing millions of acres off the 
states central and northern coasts 
on saturday greenpeace and several others groups will hold a 
mock before and after protest to illustrate the damage an oil 
spill would have on the keys sensitive coral reefs and mangrove 
coastline 
the following day at the lodge where bush is staying members of 
environmental solutions inc have scheduled an exhibit to show 
energy alternatives to oil an invitation to the event promises 
daiquiris mixed in solarpowered blenders 
among the proposals endorsed by environmental groups is revoking 
the 73 oil leases and permanently banning offshore drilling south 
of 26 degrees north latitude a bill cosponsored by floridas two 
us senators that latitude runs across florida roughly from 
naples to fort lauderdale 
a ban on oil drilling in the everglades is scheduled to be 
considered next month by gov bob martinez 
we have a unique opportunity here as environmentalists to 
solve a problem before it becomes a problem said ms whitfield 
on key largo the threat of an oil spill from a tanker or 
offshore rig is particularly worrisome to those who make their 
livings off the reef and the clear waters 
one oil spill one mistake and the keys as we know them are 
gone said anthony greene who operates snorkling tours its 
goodbye keys hello new jersey 
studies of a 1986 oil spill off panama show severe damage to 
coral reefs and oil seeping deep into the sediment in the mangrove 
areas said lisa speer senior scientists at the new yorkbased 
natural resources defense council 
a spill in the keys would be quite different than the valdez 
spill in alaska said ms speer without the pounding wave 
action the oil filters down and remains there it would be a huge 
tragedy

three physicians who treated elizabeth taylor 
overprescribed narcotics for their demanding famous client but 
will not be criminally prosecuted the district attorneys office 
said friday 
it is clear that the prescribing practices of these physicians 
fell below the accepted standard of medical practice deputy 
district attorney daniel feldstern wrote in a report 
however it is equally clear that these physicians in trying 
to resolve the patients medical condition were also attempting to 
deal with her addiction through alternative means of therapy and 
treatment and that their conduct was lacking in the requisite 
criminal intent it said 
miss taylor was battling pneumonia at st johns hospital and 
health center in nearby santa monica she remained in stable 
condition friday her spokeswoman lisa del favaro said from new 
york 
the illness is not believed to be linked to the prescriptions 
the 58yearold actress was expected to remain hospitalized 
through the weekend said ms del favaro she said miss taylor was 
in good spirits receiving a stream of cards and letters from 
wellwishers 
los angeles county district attorney ira reiner declined to 
prosecute drs william skinner michael gottlieb and michael roth 
but will refer the case to the state medical board for possible 
disciplinary action the report said 
messages left with the doctors exchanges friday were not 
immediately returned 
in 1983 miss taylor acknowledged a 35year addiction to 
sleeping pills and painkillers prescribed for health problems she 
was treated at the betty ford center in rancho mirage for alcohol 
and drug abuse that year 
from mid1987 to october 1988 skinner gottlieb and roth were 
treating miss taylor for a painful chronic back condition and 
cumulative effects of addictive medication the report stated 
skinner is medical director of the chemical dependency center at 
st johns gottlieb is the immunologist who reported the first 
aids cases in the united states and roth was once gottliebs 
partner 
skinner who was instrumental in having miss taylor admitted to 
the ford clinic wrote hundreds of the prescriptions investigated 
gottlieb wrote dozens and roth wrote prescriptions infrequently 
the report said 
among drugs skinner prescribed were demerol percodan valium 
ativan xanax preludin and dilaudin demerol is the brand name for 
meperidine a strong narcotic analgesic similar to morphine 
the evidence concerning miss taylors treatment was reviewed for 
reiners office by dr david smith referred to in the report as an 
authority in addiction medicine 
smith found that overprescribing was clearly documented 
the report stated but it pointed out that the doctors also tried 
to detoxify the patient and to convince her to reenter the 
ford center in november 1988 
i recommend that some appropriate administrative action be 
taken so that the physicians in question no matter how well 
intended learn that following appropriate prescribing guidelines 
coupled with established principles of chemical dependency apply 
even to a demanding famous client smith wrote 
dave thornton a senior investigator with the board of medical 
quality assurance in sacramento said discipline could range from a 
reprimand to license suspension 
miss taylor was hospitalized with a sinus infection april 9 at 
daniel freeman marina hospital she was transferred to st johns 
on monday because of a persistent fever and pneumonia 
the actress had a nearfatal bout of pneumonia in 1961 the year 
she won an oscar for butterfield 8

portauprince haiti ap the new civilian government has 
considerable popular backing in its push to end a history of human 
rights abuses and to hold elections the head of an international 
rights panel said friday 
but rights violations persist following the ouster of a military 
government in march and panel members would not say whether 
conditions were conducive to holding the first free and fair 
balloting since haiti gained independence 186 years ago 
any country which is going toward elections is a country which 
is moving away from violations of human rights said oliver 
jackman chairman of the interamerican commission on human rights 
of the organization of american states 
jackman said the new government enjoys a considerable measure 
of popular support and has the specific mandate to create the 
conditions for elections which are expected this year 
however another member of jackmans delegation patrick 
robinson said in some respects the situation has not improved 
since the last visit by the commission in august 1988 
in march 83 haitians were killed and more than 120 injured in 
rights abuses the haitian center for the defense of rights and 
liberties said in a report this month 
the ninemember oas commission in haiti since monday 
interviewed ertha pascaltrouillot the former supreme court 
justice who took over when prosper avril quit and fled the country 
last month following a weeklong popular uprising 
the commission also talked with her chief of staff lt gen 
herard abraham and other government officials political and 
rights activists members of the press and other civic and 
religious leaders 
it said it was told of the necessity to disarm paramilitary 
thugs break up the repressive country sheriff system and separate 
the police force from the army as provided for in the 1987 
constitution 
on nov 29 1987 an attempt at free elections was canceled 
after at least 34 voters were shot or hacked to death at the polls 
by thugs in collusion with the army in september 1988 lt gen 
henri namphy considered responsible for the attack on the voters 
was ousted in a palace coup 
avril namphys successor had promised reforms but jailed 
opponents and encountered severe criticism over rights policies 
under the civilian caretaker government that replaced avril 
mrs pascaltrouillot governs with a 19member council of state 
elections are expected before the end of this year and will be 
organized and controlled by a ninemember independent electoral 
council and probably supervised by un and oas election monitors

president bush designated five 
environmentally troubled waterways friday for intense review and 
development of cleanup plans including the bay that leads into 
bostons polluted harbor 
the president said the waterways in maine massachusetts 
louisiana and florida would become part of the national estuary 
program and be eligible for some of the 16 million in federal 
funds under the program 
congress established the national estuary program in 1987 to 
help protect and improve the environmental quality of significant 
estuaries twelve estuaries already are in the conservation program 
under the program federal and state money is used for a 
fiveyear study and planning effort aimed at identifying key 
environmental problems and ways to resolve them states must 
provide some matching funds 
the five waterways singled out by bush are tampa bay and the 
indian river complex both in florida the baratariaterrebonne 
estuarine complex in louisiana casco bay in maine and 
massachusetts bay in massachusetts 
massachusetts bay leads into boston harbor which became a 
subject of debate in the 1988 presidential campaign after bush 
criticized massachusetts gov michael dukakis for not cleaning up 
the harbor 
since then some environmentalists have criticized the bush 
administration for not providing federal money for further harbor 
cleanup in boston 
bush speaking at a fundraising dinner for floridas republican 
party in orlando said he was pleased to make the announcement on 
expanding the estuary program as we head into the earth day 
its a good first step rudy rosen an expert waterway 
conservation problems for the national wildlife federation of the 
presidents action 
but rosen added that the designation would mean little if not 
followed by further action designation is great but its got to 
be backed with regulatory enforcement both state and federal and 
the money to do the job he said in an interview 
paul pritchard president of the national parks and conservation 
association called the announcement a good step but said on 
many environmental areas the president has backtracked badly 
from campaign promises 
bush also came under attack friday from congressional democrats 
who accused the president of not following his rhetoric with action 
on environmental issues 
a group of democratic senators including majority leader george 
mitchell of maine criticized bush for not moving more aggressively 
to deal with global warming opting instead to call for additional 
research 
sen albert gore dtenn said bush failed to provide the 
leadership earlier in the week at an international white house 
conference on global warming european delegates have sought 
commitments on specific reductions in carbon dioxide emissions 
while the white house has said more research is needed for such 
pollution controls should be sought 
president bush refused to call the nation to action on the 
serious problem of global warming rather he used the conference 
to call attention to all of the obstacles said mitchell at a 
news conference to discuss earth day 
in the house democrats called on bush to celebrate earth day by 
declaring his support for legislation that would force federal 
agencies to comply with the same environmental laws the government 
imposes on industry 
the federal government has operated under a do as i say not 
as i do rule more than 80 house democrats said in a letter to 
bush 
although bush promised during his campaign to bring the 
government agencies into compliance with federal environmental 
laws the white house has opposed efforts in congress to mandate 
such compliance as part of a bill elevating the environmental 
protection agency to cabinet level

the canadian utility representative spoke of 
kilowatts reservoirs and big savings to taxpayers but the grand 
chief of the cree indian tribe saw a giant hydroelectric project in 
a different light 
it will be a cultural genocide for us said cree grand chief 
matthew cooncome our main diet is fish they tell us we cannot 
eat the fish 
america you are the builder wall street is financing its 
time the little guy starts speaking up cooncome said thursday 
after he and other indians paddled up in a canoe and climbed onto a 
lower manhattan dock in the shadow of skyscrapers 
it was the last stop on a 1300mile trip from their quebec 
homes 
cooncome and robert brunette a vice president of the 
governmentowned hydroquebec differ about how much land the 
project would affect estimates range as high as several hundred 
thousand square miles 
most of the power generated would benefit canada but up to 10 
percent would be exported to various of the united states 
the project requires reversing the course of three rivers 
and it means building six more dams along five rivers that flow 
into james bay in northern quebec 
the contracts to finance the project and sell the power have 
been signed the only remaining obstacles are approval from 
canadas national energy board and an avalanche of bad publicity 
brought on by the 10000 cree and inuit indians who live along the 
james bay 
brunette conceded that some species of fish would be made 
inedible by mercury contamination 
there is jubilation in my heart and also i cry said 
cooncome relieved at completing his journey but predicting 
doomsday for his home environment 
some people call us primitive cooncome said we still 
hunt and fish as a way of life we have protected that land 
he drew sympathy from dennis deleon new york citys human 
rights commissioner and from city councilwoman miriam friedlander 
who said people continue without thinking to destroy fragile 
parts of the earth 
the new york power authority says that buying hydroelectric 
power from quebec since 1978 has saved more than 600 million and 
eliminated the need for nearly 6 billion gallons of oil 
the state would be able to start drawing power from the new 
project in 1995 saving about 3 billion over 20 years said power 
authority chairman richard flynn 
he said the project would cause significantly less environmental 
damage than the coalburning plants that would have to be built 
otherwise 
as for the indians flynn said we really think its an 
internal affair for the canadians

a fire that gutted the home of a 
nuclear regulatory commission inspector is the most serious case of 
violence in the agencys history an nrc official said friday 
im not aware of anything of this magnitude in the past 
said ken clark an nrc spokesman in atlanta who has been with the 
agency since its inception in 1975 
the fire thursday destroyed the home of ken jenison the nrcs 
chief resident inspector at sequoyah nuclear plant hours after he 
received threatening telephone calls specifics of the calls 
werent released 
the fire was ruled an arson friday said hamilton county arson 
investigator jimmy swafford a basement window was found broken and 
it appeared fires were started in the basement and on the second 
floor 
nobody was injured but officials estimated damage at 150000 
jenison was scheduled to be transferred later this month and the 
house was listed for sale at 110000 
jenison who was at work when he heard of the fire tried to 
leave the plant but discovered that the lugs on his car wheels had 
been loosened 
the fbi hamilton county arson investigators and the tennessee 
valley authority the federal utility that operates sequoyah are 
all investigating the fire 
every agent in the southern part of the state is working on 
this said william baugh special agent in charge of the fbis 
knoxville office 
the blaze occurred less than a week after the nrc fined the tva 
240000 for harassing whistleblowers at its watts bar nuclear 
plant and recommended a 75000 penalty for failing to correct a 
safety problem at sequoyah 
it is always a possibility that someone will take offense at 
something that happens as a result of some action an nrc inspector 
takes clark said 
jenison had received harassing but unintelligible phone calls at 
his home wednesday night and someone called him at his office 
twice on thursday clark said 
it was something to the effect that they were going to burn 
his house and it had to do with his being an nrc inspector clark 
said but i dont know the specifics 
jenison was not in his office friday and could not be reached 
for comment 
clark said it was not uncommon for nrc officials to receive 
harassing phone calls but he said he could not recall any other 
serious acts of violence 
jenison had not received any other harassing calls before 
wednesday although his house was burglarized in january and 
there have not been any threats against the nrcs two other 
inspectors at sequoyah officials said

prosecutors said friday that mayor marion 
barry put crack cocaine in his jacket pocket and spoke of previous 
cocaine use with exmodel rasheeda moore the night he was arrested 
by the fbi 
in court papers the us attorneys office said the washington 
dc mayor and moore talked of their previous times together 
including their past cocaine experiences when they met in a 
hotel room jan 18 
the government filed the papers in opposition to barrys motion 
for dismissal of the charges against him barry argues that his 
fifth amendment right to due process was violated because the 
government manufactured the crime against him 
barrys lawyers said in an earlier filing that the facts 
depict a conspiracy to distribute cocaine by the government with 
barrys due process rights being violated by the lawless conduct 
of police 
the prosecutors said barrys conversation confirms that he had 
drugs on his mind as soon as he arrived in the room at the vista 
hotel where the mayor was the target of an undercover sting 
operation 
once he was alone in the room with ms moore he asked her in 
their coded vocabulary if she was still using drugs said the 
23page court filing 
once crack cocaine was obtained from an undercover agent posing 
as a friend of moores barry took a portion of the crack and 
placed it inside his jacket pocket which was hanging on a door knob 
nearby said the papers 
after taking two hits from the pipe he put on his jacket and 
called his security officer by walkietalkie as though he was ready 
to leave they added 
barry asked for the crack he eagerly accepted it and he 
appeared to be quite adept at smoking it said the prosecutors 
law enforcement officers then entered from an adjoining room and 
arrested the mayor 
the prosecutors also said that at the start of their 
conversation barry indicated to moore that he wanted cocaine 
powder not crack but when the undercover agent left the room to 
get powder barry told moore to get the crack instead said the 
court filing moore called the undercover agent back in the room 
barry gave money to moore and moore bought a bag of crack 
barry faces trial june 4 on five counts of cocaine possession 
and three counts of allegedly lying to a federal grand jury by 
denying he had been involved in drugs with charles lewis a former 
city employee lewis is now the governments chief witness against 
barry 
the prosecutors also asserted that barry showed very little 
liquor in his blood making it difficult for him to argue that 
the government plied him with liquor in an effort to overcome his 
resistance 
actually during the 45 minutes that he was in the hotel room 
cognac was poured sparingly from a bottle three times and only in 
small amounts said the prosecutors he nursed his drink during 
the duration of the visit 
his blood alcohol content was 005 after his arrest and would 
have had to have been 20 times higher to reach even the threshold 
legal limit for driving under the influence said the government

former ambassador winston lord says president 
bushs china policy is wrong and marked by tawdry symbolism 
he said bush should not have sent brent scowcroft his national 
security adviser to beijing after the suppression of prodemocracy 
forces in tiananmen square last june lord also said the president 
should not have relaxed sanctions against china 
lord who was us ambassador to china from 1985 until just 
before troops attacked protesting students said bush is 
disappointed his overtures to beijing were not reciprocated 
i dont think anyone would claim that theyve achieved 
anything lord said 
the longtime china scholar made his remarks in an interview on 
the pbstv program american interests it will be aired in 
washington on saturday 
first of all i think we should keep contact lord said 
but i think it should be a workinglike relationship as long as 
they are crushing the chinese people 
he said it shouldnt include highlevel emissaries going to 
beijing 
lords stand puts him at odds not only with bush but with former 
president richard m nixon and former secretary of state henry a 
kissinger both of whom support strong us ties to china despite 
the beijing governments actions 
nixon has warned that if the united states withdraws from a 
close association with china it leaves the field to the soviet 
union and japan 
lord who held a key state department post in the nixon 
administration and accompanied kissinger on his trips to china in 
the 1970s disagreed 
hes just wrong on this lord said 
there is no way the chinese and the soviets are going to get 
very close together he said you have geopolitical disputes 
you have ethnic populations across a disputed boundary youve got 
competition around the world 
japans occupation of china in world war ii has left real 
scars even a halfcentury later lord said 
those are not going away and china will always want us in asia 
to balance off japan and the soviet union he said 
lord did not propose bush break ties with china and he said 
the president acted in good faith in twice sending scowcroft to 
beijing 
he knew the scowcroft missions would be unpopular at home 
lord said he tried to break the logjam in china 
lord said us policy should be to maintain contact with beijing 
but it should be a cool working type relationship and not one 
filled with tawdry symbolism and highlevel contacts and unilateral 
gestures

scientists on friday ordered stocks of 14 chilean 
wines withheld from sale after discovering unacceptably high levels 
of a sweetener in them 
the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food said scientists 
found unacceptable levels of sorbitol a sweetener found naturally 
in apple or pear juice but banned from wine because it can change 
the flavor 
the wine standards board which enforces european community 
regulations ordered the 14 wines to be withheld while more tests 
were carried out said a ministry spokesman who by custom was not 
identified 
the ministry is acting to safeguard the integrity of wine the 
presence of sorbitol suggests that fruit juice was added in making 
the wine or that sorbitol was added said the spokesman 
local authorities have also been asked to carry out checks to 
see if stocks in stores broke the rules the spokesman said 
chile is the largest south american exporter of wine to britain 
selling 2 million bottles a year according to the wine and spirits 
association 
in march 1989 the united states ordered chilean grapes held in 
us ports or removed from store shelves after traces of cyanide 
were found in two grapes no further contamination was found and 
shipments resumed 
about 6 million crates of grapes were dumped during the health 
scare

the last of the mohicans who fought 
beside massachusetts farmers in the revolutionary war and embraced 
their christianity will get back a historic bible presented to the 
tribe in the 1700s 
we felt it was the right thing to do frederic winthrop jr 
director of a private historical group which has the bible in its 
museum here said friday after trustees agreed to return it to the 
stockbridgemunsee tribe in northern wisconsin 
the remnants of the mohican tribe became known as the 
stockbridgemunsee after they were driven from the berkshires 
we are pretty elated said reginald miller tribal chairman 
and the trustees know that we will take even better care of it 
than they have because it means so much to us 
miller said the tribe which first approached the mission house 
museum 15 years ago would display the bible in its own museum in 
bowler wis the museum chronicles the tribes history from the 
time it sought shelter in the berkshires from marauding mohawks and 
embraced christianity in the 1700s 
the twovolume goldembossed folio bible was presented to the 
tribe in 1745 by the prince of wales heiress mable choate who 
financed the restoration of the mission house built by john 
sergeant the first missionary to the stockbridge indians bought 
the bible from an impoverished church in red springs wisc in 
1930 for 1000 she willed it to the mission house in 1948 
the agreement still needs approval by the probate court and it 
could be months before the bible is actually returned winthrop 
said but we feel that it would be what miss choate would want 
she bought the bible as a good faith gesture to help the 
tribe 
winthrop whose own family dates from the beginnings of the 
massachusetts colony said the trustees were finally persuaded by 
the inscription which says the bible was given to the rev john 
sergeant to remain to the use of the successors of those indians 
from generation to generation 
a lot of lawyers could have had a lot of fun with this i 
suppose winthrop said but we have become convinced that since 
there is a question of title the benefit of doubt should rest with 
the tribe since this religious artifact is very important to their 
cultural heritage for nearly 200 years they took very good care of 
it and brought it with them on their long journey from 
massachusetts 
the tribe left stockbridge in 1785 forced out by the settlers 
who were buying up their land they moved to new york and indiana 
before settling about 60 miles north of green bay wis 
the town of stockbridge later painted by norman rockwell was 
founded in the 1730s as a mission to the indians at the invitation 
of chief konkapot the colonial legislature granted the tribe six 
square miles 
in return the tribe was the only one to formally enlist on the 
colonists side in the revolution the stockbridge unit fought from 
the opening of hostilities at concord in april 1775 until the wars

pickfair the romantic estate where 
legendary movie stars mary pickford and douglas fairbanks once 
reigned over hollywood has been demolished to build a palatial 
home for actress pia zadora 
cherubs still guarded the gate friday and vines and flowering 
shrubs draped the curving wall surrounding the estate but inside 
beyond a thicket of trees stood only portions of the mansion amid 
bins of rubble 
sounds of hammering and shouts of construction workers echoed 
across the hillside where americas sweetheart once hosted 
parties for virtually all the legends of hollywoods golden age as 
well as royalty and presidents 
the 27 acres that remain of the original 15acre estate are now 
owned by miss zadora and her millionaire husband meshulam riklis 
they are building an elaborate mansion that will incorporate a 
living room from the old house 
a person hates to see part of an era a very famous era the 
pickfair just sort of disappear very suddenly but its my feeling 
its not the end of an era said matty kemp longtime associate 
of the late silent film star 
it was not the house itself but miss pickford and fairbanks as 
well as the company that tinseltowns king and queen kept that 
made pickfair what it was said kemp who runs the pickford co 
which continues to handle the late actress films 
the glamour came from the people the celebrities of the day 
you name them valentino swanson thats where the glamour was 
at pickfair 
miss pickford made her first movie in 1909 the violin maker 
of cremona directed by dw griffith she was in more than 100 
silent films including polyanna and poor little rich girl 
before making her first talkie coquette in 1929 it won her 
an oscar for best actress 
she followed that with taming of the shrew and kiki 
before ending her career with 1933s secrets the motion 
picture academy gave her a special oscar in 1976 for contribution 
to the industry 
pickfair was built shortly after miss pickford married fairbanks 
in 1920 what was once a stable in the country and then a hunting 
lodge was transformed into a gracious home that with some 
exaggeration became known variously as the buckingham palace of 
hollywood or the white house 
it was as famous as the white house in washington said 
kemp mary during her reign as the queen she was the most 
popular woman in the world my god there wasnt anyone that didnt 
know mary pickford 
an invitation to pickfair meant you had arrived rudolph 
valentino and gloria swanson were just two names on a startling 
guest list maurice chevalier anna pavlova charlie chaplin clark 
gable joan crawford norma shearer jack dempsey albert einstein 
amelia earhart f scott fitzgerald henry ford babe ruth lillian 
gish and hg wells 
miss pickford was 86 when she died in 1979 her marriage to 
fairbanks had ended in 1934 and she hadnt made a movie in nearly 
50 years but the mystique of pickfair lingered on until the end 
her third husband actor buddy rogers several times called 
reporters to the mansion to dispel rumors that miss pickford who 
became reclusive in the mid1960s was locked up she spoke from an 
upstairs room using a taperecorded message or telephone 
im feeling so good that im ready to go back to work she 
said in one such interview in 1978 the mansion at that time was 
reported to be in splendid repair fully staffed and brimming 
with legend 
after her death rogers decided to sell pickfair and built 
himself a new house on a portion of the property he called it 
pickfair lodge and still lives there 
rogers who was out of town friday sold the house to jerry 
buss owner of the los angeles lakers for 54 million in 1980 he 
sold it to miss zadora and her husband in 1988 for 667 million 
the couple announced last july that they were embarking on a 
twoyear remodeling project to transform the house into a 
renaissancestyle venetian palazzo with tile roofs leaded windows 
balconies and verandas the demolition work has been going on since 
the beginning of the year 
now however only a separate guest houseservants quarters and 
the old houses living room remain standing the rest had simply 
begun to crumble 
i understand they ran into some problems with the foundations 
termites said kemp

the astronauts who will operate an 
observatory aboard the shuttle columbia next month said friday they 
expect to beat the discoverys hubble space telescope in sending 
back celestial clues 
one of the things weve frequently reminded the space 
telescope crew is that we will be sending down science data while 
space telescope is still doing engineering checkout and so we 
should be able to beat them to the punch on getting down the first 
science data said mission specialist robert parker were 
looking forward to being able to do that 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope nasas most valuable 
payload is scheduled to head into orbit aboard discovery on 
tuesday its first launch attempt was scrubbed shortly before 
liftoff april 10 when a shuttle power unit failed 
the twoweek delay has pushed the shuttle columbias may 9 
launch date back a week or two in addition to seven astronauts 
four of them astronomers columbia will be carrying a 100 million 
observatory called astro that is intended to complement hubbles 
work 
nasa plans to roll columbia out to the launch pad sunday 16 
miles from where discovery awaits a tuesday liftoff it will be 
only the second time that both of kennedy space centers shuttle 
launch pads have been occupied at the same time 
columbia and challenger occupied the launch pads in january 
1986 ten days after columbia landed challenger exploded 
the national aeronautics and space administration is waiting for 
discovery to go up before setting a new launch date for columbia 
we tease the hubble crew that if they dont get out of the 
way were going to go ahead of them said air force col guy 
gardner columbias pilot 
discoverys payload bay doors were reopened friday and 
technicians began the daylong task of installing hubbles 
batteries nasa completed 130 hours of recharging the six 
nickelhydrogen batteries in a laboratory on thursday 
nasa planned to test the batteries saturday and seal the payload 
bay later in the day the countdown for discovery was to begin 
saturday afternoon with the five crew members returning to kennedy 
space center on sunday 
at a news conference columbias astronauts readily agreed 
friday that the muchtouted hubble is the crown jewel of nasas 
astronomical endeavors but they said astros three ultraviolet 
instruments and broad band xray telescope also will shed light on 
galaxies black holes and quasars during the nine days of the 
mission 
while hubble will be able to discern objects in space with 
extraordinary clarity and allow astronomers to look back to almost 
the beginning of time astro will have a wider field of view and be 
better able to detect ultraviolet light astronomers expect astro 
to uncover targets on which hubble can focus during the telescopes 
15 years in orbit 
columbia mission specialist jeffrey hoffman insists its not a 
competition between hubble and astro or between the crews still 
he cant resist ribbing discoverys astronauts every now and then 
we get to be astronomers he said all they do is throw 
out a telescope anybody can do that

the state senate voted 3423 friday to 
give final approval to a oneyear ban on a hormone used to boost 
cows milk output making minnesota the second major milkproducing 
state to do so 
the minnesota house passed the ban thursday 6859 despite 
protests from the states dairy farmers that the action would put 
them at a competitive disadvantage 
the measure follows a similar one approved by the wisconsin 
legislature last month minnesota and wisconsin combined produce 
about 24 percent of the nations milk 
rep chuck brown who led the charge for the moratorium in the 
minnesota house said he has received assurances that gov rudy 
perpich will sign the measure into law 
under the legislation nonmedical use of bovine growth hormone 
known as bgh or bovine somatotropin would be banned for a year 
the protein is a synthetic version of a hormone that naturally 
appears in cows and is expected to win approval of the food and 
drug administration for commercial use later this year 
brown and state sen steve morse urged the ban saying more time 
is needed to study the potential effects of the drug on animals and 
humans 
the legislation would keep the ban in effect as long as 
wisconsin enforced a similar moratorium or if a consortium of 
states representing at least 40 percent of the nations milk 
production adopted a ban on bgh 
the wisconsin legislature approved a temporary moratorium last 
month that is awaiting the signature of gov tommy thompson he has 
not said whether he will sign the measure 
the companies that produce the hormone monsanto agriculture 
co eli lilly co upjohn co and american cyanamid have lobbied 
against such measures saying the hormone has been more than 
adequately tested 
supporters of the synthetic hormone including dairy farmers a 
pharmacist and a veterinarian took issue with opponents 
contentions that the drug may not be safe and argued against 
legislative impediments on new technology 
theres no credible evidence that theres any health hazard 
said rep jim girard this is just another tool to allow farmers 
to increase their production 
rep harriet mcpherson likened bgh to milk machines embryo 
transplants and other technological advances that have increased 
milk production

an anticensorship lobbying group said 
thursday that a new nationwide poll shows americans overwhelmingly 
support the national endowment for the arts and oppose conservative 
lawmakers efforts to curb federal support for controversial art 
the poll results were released by the liberal people for the 
american way as a pornographyfighting preacher sent members of 
congress envelopes containing what he called filthy pictures of 
homosexual acts from an illinois art exhibit mounted with a 15000 
grant from the endowment 
were spending 175 million in this area that benefits 
primarily the rich and the perverted said the rev donald 
wildmon founder and director of the american family association of 
tupelo miss 
wildmon said he hopes the reproductions of 14 images from the 
david wojnarowicz tongues of flame show at the university 
galleries at illinois state university in normal will persuade 
congress to eliminate funds for the nea 
in an interview endowment chairman john e frohnmayer accused 
wildmon of using falsehoods or halftruths or intimidation to 
whip up antinea hysteria and suggested that he pay attention to 
the commandment against bearing false witness 
frohnmayer said the illinois art exhibit grant was made before 
congress banned federal support for obscene art in any case he 
said wildmon was wrong to suggest that the nea is a purveyor of 
pornography or is somehow out of control 
the endowment an independent federal agency with a budget of 
1713 million supports a wide variety of artists and artistic 
institutions with taxpaid grants that must be matched by private 
donors 
the nea has been the target of attacks by conservative lawmakers 
led by sen jesse helms rnc and rep dana rohrabacher 
rcalif since last summer for its support for exhibits of 
controversial works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist 
andres serrano 
last fall congress voted to forbid nea financing of art that 
may be considered obscene and without serious literary 
artistic political or scientific value 
the lawmakers also ordered a special commission created to 
review the neas grantmaking procedures and withheld 45000 from 
the nea as a penalty for supporting the mapplethorpe and serrano 
exhibits 
officials of people for the american way action fund which 
describes itself as a constitutional liberties organization 
fighting censorship said their poll showed that the public 
overwhelmingly opposes censorship of controversial art even if 
they find it personally offensive 
the poll was conducted for the group by research amp forecasts 
inc of new york which conducted random telephone surveys of 1200 
adults in late march 
the firm said the poll showed that 68 percent of the public 
supports federal financing of the arts and that only 30 percent 
agrees that government funding to avant garde or leadingedge 
artists should be stopped because a few people feel their work is 
controversial 
the poll takers said 81 percent of those surveyed agreed that 
congress should not pass laws that interfere with our rights to 
free expression they said 93 percent agreed that even if i 
find a particular piece of art objectionable others have the right 
to view it 
of those surveyed they said 61 percent take the neas side in 
favoring the current system of having citizen panels make grant 
decisions only 13 percent they said supported helms efforts to 
slash funds and tighten controls over the endowment 
sen edward m kennedy dmass hailed the poll results as a 
welcome vote of confidence in the arts endowment and proof that 
americans reject the knownothing censorship the right wing is 
trying to impose 
but rohrabacher said censorship was a phony issue what we are 
talking about is whether standards should be established so that 
federal funds cannot be used to finance obscene or indecent art or 
art that attacks religion he said 
former rep john h buchanan rala chairman of people for the 
american way said he will circulate the poll results in congress 
to show that the american people say yes to the arts yes to the 
nea and no to any government censorship of the arts or any other 
form of free expression 
but wildmons antinea campaign appeared to be succeeding among 
some legislators 
an aide to rep james saxton rnj said his office had 
received up to 300 pieces of mail in the past week as a result of 
wildmons letters to constituents at this point its going to 
be very difficult for us to vote to fund the nea said the aide 
jeff de korte 
meanwhile a joint sovietamerican exhibi of contemporary art 
opened thursday at the corcoran gallery of art minus three works by 
new york artist annette lemiuex she boycotted the shows 
washington appearance to protest the corcorans cancellation of the 
mapplethorpe exhibition last summer

shaken hours after watching soldiers 
take over her workplace friday journalist maria gediene swore that 
mikhail gorbachev had met his match in lithuanias stubborn 
nonviolent resistance 
hes a big actor the middleaged journalist said a tear 
rolling down her cheek i see his game and it doesnt interest me 
any more 
he doesnt know what the ending of this play will be and 
thats too bad for him she added in a trembling voice it will 
be worse for him than for us 
lithuanians interviewed on a dimly lighted street near the 
requisite sovietera statue of vladimir i lenin pledged they would 
endure despite an embargo on oil and natural gas that the 
lithuanian government said was spreading to tires cable packaging 
and some food items 
lithuania imposed stiff gas rationing earlier friday limiting 
each car to slightly under eight gallons a month long lines waited 
at the gas pumps attendants stamped each cars registration as 
they doled out the monthss share 
officials warned of huge unemployment as factories are shut down 
due to a lack of fuel parts and raw materials from the soviet 
union which is continuing its opposition to lithuanias march 11 
declaration of independence 
citizens interviewed in the pleasant cool spring evening said 
they have not noticed any hoarding in expectation of shortages 
mrs gediene was present as soviet interior ministry soldiers 
took over a communist party publishing plant and beat some of the 
civilian guards friday afternoon 
i dont know whether ill be working there on monday or not 
she said 
daffodils and red carnations were placed at the foot of the 
lenin statue on a street that until recently was named for the 
soviet founder some traffic rumbled down what is now gedimo 
street named for an ancient lithuanian king 
an 18yearold history student vitas batsis tall blond and 
smiling said few lithuanians care about lenin anymore 
for russians he is god said batsis thats 
understandable but for us hes not god 
let them do what they want he said we have only one 
weapon the truth 
asked what would happen in the future the student said i 
think there will be presidential rule or well starve but well 
endure well learn like were learning now 
ethnic russians agreed this baltic republic of 38 million 
people was headed for hard times but charged it was all the fault 
of the lithuanian government two ethnic russian women strolling 
arminarm down the street criticized the lithuanian government for 
moving too fast 
before declaring independence you have to be able to stand on 
your own feet said 41yearold teacher lina polotnova 
it would be bad for all of us but the lithuanian government 
is at fault she said moscow is no way at fault 
the two women were both born in lithuania and mrs polotnova 
said she had no plans to leave despite the impending difficulties 
but her friend vita vishnyevskaya said she and many other 
russians would leave if they could get new apartments somewhere in 
russia 
housing most of it allocated rather sold is in short supply 
all over the soviet union 
both women said they were still able to buy in vilnius stores 
without any discrimination because they speak lithuanian and they 
said they experienced no particular difficulties in everyday life 
however the ethnic strain was starting to show on 22yearold 
student daira arnshite of klaipeda 
i hate the russians she said they turned us into 
horrible people we couldnt go anywhere we didnt know anything 
we couldnt buy anything 
she and the other lithuanians agreed that no possible solution 
existed to the dispute with moscow except full independence 
we can negotiate about anything except independence said 
mrs gediene i dont think our parliament would be so bold as to 
do that the people would curse them

a church barred a 5yearold boy with aids from 
sunday school then reversed itself friday after an uproar 
we love him and we want him back in our sunday school and 
he will be back in our sunday school the rev erwin lutzer 
senior pastor of the moody church said at a hastily called news 
conference 
but lutzer said other parents would be notified that a child 
with aids would be attending bible class and they will have the 
freedom to keep their children from sunday school 
our position and our concerns have not changed lutzer said 
we have decided to shift the burden of responsibility from us as 
a church 
the church had drawn fire when its decision to bar the boy 
became public a few weeks after the death of young aids victim 
ryan white 
im pleased that they reversed themselves i dont feel 
any bitterness the chicago boys foster mother terry rucker 
said in a telephone interview friday afternoon 
mrs rucker said she had not decided whether to return to the 
church on sunday i have made no plans to go elsewhere she 
added 
on thursday mrs rucker had said the church officials initial 
decision stemmed from fear and ignorance 
before announcing the reversal the pastor said the 65yearold 
church had decided to bar the boy to give us time to think it 
through 
his secretary evelyn rankin said officials of the 
nondenominational evangelical church acted out of concern over how 
aids is spread and fear it could be passed on through saliva 
there has never been a documented us case in which aids which 
cripples the bodys defenses against disease was spread through 
saliva said charles fallis a spokesman for the federal centers 
for disease control in atlanta 
we are well aware of ryan white and the implication of his 
death lutzer told reporters friday 
white who had been barred from his school near kokomo ind 
after he contracted aids through a blood transfusion died april 8 
at age 18 he had fought a long and public battle aimed at 
increasing understanding of the disease 
we thought with ryan white all that had been settled walt 
rucker said of his foster son rucker asked that the childs name 
be kept private 
thats just crazy agreed carrie van dyke a friend and 
spokeswoman for whites family in indianapolis where is their 
humanity to fellow man 
i would think that they would be a little more introspective 
about what theyre doing 
the boy was born with the aids virus said david schneidman a 
spokesman for the illinois department of children and family 
services the agency removed the boy from his mother who has aids 
out of concern she could no longer care for him schneidman said 
the ruckers took the boy in two months ago mrs rucker 
confirmed that he has contracted aids from the virus 
john hammell director of the aids and civil liberties project 
of the american civil liberties union of illinois said the 
churchs decision to bar the child likely would not have withstood 
a legal challenge 
its very sad especially since this is a religious 
institution and should be a compassionate institution that this 
still happens 
rucker a psychologist said earlier that he and his wife a 
nurse have belonged to moody church for 10 years 
we strongly support the churchs position on prolife 
rucker said we do not support the churchs position on not 
taking a child with aids 
the boy had been told only that he was not going back to bible 
class anymore said mrs rucker this is a bibleteaching 
church and they cannot justify their fears 
a receptionist at the church said the moody church and the moody 
bible institute are separate entities connected only in that 
dwight l moody founded both the church and the institute she said 
that while the institute contributes money to the church the 
church also helps the institute financially 
aids is spread by a virus transmitted mainly through sexual 
intercourse shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to 
their infants before or during birth health officials have said 
there has been no evidence that it can spread by casual contact

i am not the wisest guy but we are wise because we now have a 
democracy walesa said 
delegates responded by voting 3571 in favor of a report on the 
leadership of walesa and the union movements national commission 
since 1981 there were 22 abstentions 
his name was later submitted to a union commission for 
reelection aides to walesa said 
members of the election commission said several other names had 
been submitted but they declined to provide details some have 
accused walesa of undemocratic rule 
apart from the election of its leadership the trade union 
movement also was expected to try to clarify its union and 
political roles in postcommunist poland 
walesas reelection appeared virtually certain 
walesa will guarantee that the union will not fall apart 
said ryszard musielak a delegate from the central city of torun 
it is very important that we passed this vote of confidence 
because it shows there are no serious objections to walesas 
activities among the delegates said antoni bielewicz of the 
warsaw region 
later the congress rejected a motion to create a vice chairman 
who would take over if the chairman assumed other duties but the 
post still could be introduced if union statutes were changed 
last week walesa raised the possibility of running for 
president 
walesas address came on the second day of solidaritys sixday 
congress the second one it has held 
since the first congress in 1981 the movement has survived 
martial law negotiated an end to communist dominance and won 
elections to take control of the government 
recent public opinion polls however show solidarity losing 
popularity as poland undergoes austerity measures that have 
increased unemployment walesa who won the nobel peace prize in 
1983 for his efforts as solidarity leader remains very popular 
in an emotional speech friday walesa acknowledged mistakes had 
been made 
the victory i am giving you the mistakes are ours and you 
should correct all the mistakes weve made here and today walesa 
said 
i did this only for poland its not my victory its our 
mutual victory i was only the driver of it all he said 
several delegates later accused walesa of diminishing the 
achievements of others who helped found the union 
parliament member andrzej malachowski however received a 
standing ovation when he called for an end to backroom politicking 
of course you lech have enemies but some game is being 
engineered here malachowski said stop it please lech walesa 
has well served the fatherland 
after the confidence vote the delegates changed lechu 
lechu as walesa raised his arms in a victory salute 
walesa an electrician at the gdansk shipyard became leader of 
solidarity in 1980 by climbing over the shipyard fence during a 
strike to galvanize the workers 
due to bad luck i jumped over the shipyard wall he said 
friday you liked my jump and thats why you elected me to drive 
this vehicle called solidarity 
before walesas speech the congress debated more than an hour 
before voting to admit as guests all members of the 1981 union 
leadership who no longer were delegates the guests would not be 
permitted to vote 
the former leaders include several radicals who have broken with 
the solidarity mainstream 
some had accused walesa of undemocratic rule others had opposed 
any compromise with the former communist government including the 
negotiations that led to elections in june that vote resulted in 
the east blocs first noncommunistled government 
walesa threatened to leave the hall friday if certain members of 
the former leadership showed up he did not specify who he meant 
the union regained legal status april 17 1989 then took 
control of the government after partly free elections in june 
solidarity has since managed to sign up only 22 million of the 
10 million members it had in 1981 opinion polls show confidence 
dropping as the public undergoes economic hardships associated with 
the strict austerity program of the solidarityled government 
economic restructuring is forcing plant closures and raising 
unemployment among the industrial workers who are the backbone of 
solidaritys support 
walesa has criticized the pace of political reforms saying 
prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis team is not moving quickly 
enough to dislodge communists from power in state enterprises and 
government ministries 
the delegates are expected to debate how much they want 
solidarity to be confined to union issues and whether to create a 
solidaritylinked political party

jerry lewis and jerry erwin have 500 
riding on a hairraising bet they made in 1963 which man will 
shave off his beard first 
the winner if there ever is one undoubtedly will claim victory 
by a whisker 
the wager began 27 years ago when both men decided to grow 
beards in honor of west virginias 1963 centennial celebration 
both shaved when the festivities were over but soon grew back 
their beards because as lewis explained when i shaved if off i 
felt naked 
to make things interesting lewis and erwin bet 100 on who 
would be the first to shave neither has since and as the beards 
have grown so has the pot to 500 
thats because of inflation lewis said 
lewis keeps his beard trimmed to about 5 inches erwins 
without a moustache is about 9 inches long 
neither lewis nor erwin who work together at a boone county 
automobile towing shop will predict wholl be the first to come 
cleanshaven when asked recently both just smiled and stroked

assistant secretary of state john kelly 
returned home on friday and ruled out yielding to the demands of 
hostageholders 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine had called for 
kelly to go to damascus the capital of syria to handle final 
details of the release of an american hostage 
when the request was turned down by the bush administration the 
militant group said the release had been postponed 
kelly in a statement at washington dulles international 
airport said edward p djerejian the us ambassador to syria 
was at his post and fully capable of handling all the details of 
bringing a hostage out safely and quickly and efficiently 
kelly and djerejian had been in west germany attending a 
conference of american diplomats 
kellys statement did not indicate with whom the bush 
administration was prepared to have djerejian deal 
administration spokesmen have flatly ruled out negotiating with 
hostageholders kelly evidently was referring to syria which is 
serving as an intermediary for the united states 
in his statement the american diplomat stressed there would be 
no yielding to the demands of hostageholders 
you know american policy is that we do not make concessions to 
those who hold the hostages he said we want the hostages out 
but we are not going to bow to the demands of the hostageholders 
kelly voiced hope a hostage would be released he described 
djerejian an arabic and frenchspeaking career diplomat as a 
very competent seasoned professional ambassador knowledgeable 
about lebanon and syria 
explaining why he did not go to syria the assistant secretary 
of state said there was no particular utility in my going to 
damascus because ambassador djerejian is fully capable of handling 
all the details there 
kelly has also served in lebanon as us ambassador 
his explanation was milder than that given by us officials 
earlier in the week 
they said sending kelly to damascus would have meant yielding to 
demands of the islamic jihad and that even if kelly did not engage 
in negotiations his presence in syria might give that impression 
president bush on thursday said the united states would not 
knuckle under to demands

mexican authorities will prosecute anyone 
responsible for the purported abduction of a mexican doctor to the 
united states to face charges in the murder of a us drug agent 
the attorney general said friday 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo also reiterated an 
earlier threat that mexico will stop cooperating with the united 
states in the war on drugs if further abductions take place on 
mexican territory 
there must be respect otherwise there is no cooperation 
he said 
alvarez del castillo said no charges are pending in mexico 
against dr humberto alvarez machain 42 who has been indicted in 
the united states in the torturemurder of drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique camarena 
alvarez machains lawyer says he was abducted from his office in 
guadalajara and flown to el paso texas where dea agents arrested 
him 
alvarez machain pleaded innocent to any involvement in the 1985 
camarena killing near guadaljara capital of western jalisco state 
the attorney general said anyone suspected of involvement in a 
kidnapping will be prosecuted no matter what their rank position 
in government or nationality 
we are investigating thoroughly and anyone found to be 
responsible will be investigated arrested and prosecuted 
alvarez del castillo told a news conference 
he said chances of returning alvarez machain to mexico are 
very complicated but refused to comment further 
in washington a justice department spokesman said alvarez 
machain would not be returned even if he was kidnapped us courts 
long have held that a fugitive can stand trial in the united states 
even arrested improperly abroad 
alvarez del castillo spoke at the end of a fourday conference 
on drugfighting by the organization of american states over which 
he presided us attorney general dick thornburgh attended the 
conference opening and returned to washington on thursday he 
ordered the dea to give him a full report on the alvarez machain 
arrest 
justice spokesman david runkel said thornburgh had reassured 
mexican officials including alvarez del castillo and that the 
americans were assured that relations between mexico and the 
united sates remained strong and that cooperation on drug law 
enforcement would continue 
mexican officials at the conference have been privately 
criticizing the idea of apprehending drug suspects abroad based on 
a us supreme court decision that such arrests are legal 
without mentioning the united states by name president carlos 
salinas de gortari on thursday criticized the police saying 
nations should not take drugfighting as an excuse for such illicit 
actions abroad 
in the fight against drugs the law is rendered useless by 
illegal actions or by trying to measure justice with a ruler of 
one country in foreign territory salinas told the conference 
the conference was attended by justice ministers or their 
representatives from 32 oas member nations

the justice department said friday it has no 
plans to return to mexico a doctor accused of participating in the 
murder of a us drug agent even if his capture violated mexican 
sovereignty 
justice department spokesman david runkel said he did not 
foresee any circumstances under which dr humberto alvarez 
machain would be returned to mexico rather than face federal 
charges in los angeles 
but the judge overseeing the case ordered the justice department 
to explain the circumstances leading up to alvarez april 3 arrest 
in el paso texas on charges of participating in the 1985 murder 
of drug agent enrique camarena 
the mexican government also has demanded an explanation for what 
an embassy spokesman here called the illegal detention of the 
guadalajara gynecologist 
attorney general dick thornburg issued a statement on the 
apprehension of dr machain that was read by spokesman dan eramian 
although the drug enforcement administration has not completed 
its investigation of the circumstances surrounding the apprehension 
of dr machain it has been confirmed that no dea personnel were 
present when he was taken into custody in mexico or when he was 
boarded onto an aircraft in that country 
in addition no dea personnel were aboard the aircraft that 
brought dr machain to the united states 
the first encounter dea agents had with dr machain was when 
they took him into custody at the el paso texas airport 
eramian refused the answer questions 
the defense lawyer in the case charges that alvarez was 
kidnapped and flown by private plane to el paso where he was 
arrested by dea agents 
dea officials have denied published reports that it paid bounty 
hunters to capture alvarez and bring him to the us border dea 
officials have declined to describe how they arrested alvarez 
a prosecutor handling the case however said in court thursday 
in los angeles that the us government has had standing offers 
on the street in mexico and guadalajara for rewards for the 
capture of those involved in the camarena murder 
the arrest has sparked a diplomatic protest from the government 
of mexico the mexican attorney general enrique alvarez del 
castillo said it could end usmexican cooperation on drug 
enforcement 
runkel said that threat was dispelled by talks between 
thornburgh and his mexican counterpart this week in ixtapa mexico 
the site of a hemispheric conference on drug enforcement 
we were assured that relations between mexico and the united 
states remained strong and that cooperation on drug law enforcement 
would continue runkel said 
any threat if one existed to continued cooperation was 
substantially lessened as a result of the bilateral talks in 
ixtapa runkel said 
thornburgh has asked dea for a full account of the arrest and 
assured mexico that appropriate action would be forthcoming when 
a report of the results of that investigation was in hand runkel 
said 
a spokesman for the mexican embassy here said future cooperation 
on drug enforcement would have to await the result of the 
investigation into the circumstances surrounding alvarezs arrest 
there is cooperation to find who the real violators of the 
mexican law are in this case of the illegal detention of alvarez 
machain said javier trevino the embassys press attache 
once this investigation is over and those responsible are duly 
punished cooperation will continue trevino said 
runkel declined to say what action might be taken by the 
attorney general once he received deas report 
but he said i dont foresee any circumstances under which he 
would be returned to mexico runkel said he faces criminal 
charges in this country 
a long line of us court decisions have held that a fugitive 
can stand trial in this country even if his arrest overseas was 
improper or illegal 
a justice department legal opinion issued earlier this year said 
the fbi had the authority to grab fugitives in other countries 
without the permission of the host government

its curtains for the whole theater 
which rose to national prominence with a push from oscarwinner 
olympia dukakis it was announced friday 
were hoping that its not a sign of things to come for other 
theater groups but we have to realize the state is seeing some 
tough times said laura aden executive director of the new 
jersey theater group 
the whole theater was founded in 1973 by a group of married 
theater couples including ms dukakis and her husband actor louis 
zorich it won national acclaim for original programming and 
quality acting and attracted even more attention with the academy 
award won by ms dukakis in 1988 for her role in moonstruck 
in a plot twist laced with irony however the theater that 
lived by ms dukakis may die by ms dukakis 
the whole theaters association with the actress may have lulled 
wouldbe donors into believing it was financially sound said 
theater spokeswoman bonnie kramen 
some people may have thought that with the increased 
visibility there were increased dollars coming in and that didnt 
turn out to be the case ms kramen said 
the theaters board of trustees determined wednesday that the 
building would have to be sold to pay off debts of about 450000 
ms kramen said 
our town was the theaters first production in 1973 
ms dukakis could not be reached directly for comment but 
issued a statement 
however much i regret that this decision had to be made i 
feel the board of trustees of whole theater made the most 
responsible decision possible under these circumstances she said

greyhound said friday that a reduced workload 
caused by a 7weekold strike by bus drivers has forced it to lay 
off almost onefifth of its maintenance force 
union officials said the layoffs were a sign the company is 
struggling 
because of the present volume of business we have more 
mechanics than we need said greyhound lines inc spokesman 
george gravley its not that we cant pay them we dont want to 
pay them if theres no work to do 
he said 275 of the current 1395 mechanics mechanics helpers 
storekeepers truck drivers and service workers were being laid off 
beginning monday 
before the strike greyhound had 2165 maintenance workers of 
those the 690 represented by the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers remained on the job gravley said 
695 atu members also ignored the strike 
the layoffs are spread throughout the country and involve 120 
machinists and 155 atu members he said the workers would be 
recalled as work loads increase he said 
every indicator points to financial disaster for greyhound 
lines inc said james la sala international president of the 
amalgamated transit union greyhound management is now at a 
crossroads it can either negotiate a settlement to this contract 
dispute or allow this countrys only national bus system to slide 
into financial ruin

office workers has been on strike since march 2 walking out in a 
dispute over wages and job security there have been no

farmland prices rose again last year but at a 
slower pace than in 1988 the agriculture department said friday 
the departments economic research service said that as of jan 
1 the average value of us farmland including buildings was 693 
per acre up 4 percent from feb 1 1989 the february figure was 
not given 
an 11month period was used because the agency is switching from 
feb 1 to jan 1 as the reporting date 
although below the 6 percent gain in 1988 last years rise 
was the third straight increase the agency reported 
despite the annual increases us farmland values are still 16 
percent below the record of 823 per acre in 1982 prices sank to a 
19year low of 548 per acre in 1987 before gaining 3 percent in 
1988 
analysts said 1989 was a good income year for farmers nationally 
and that debt was down 29 percent from its earlier peak farm real 
estate interest rates in 1989 were about the same as in 1988 
thus they said farmland values should have increased 
strongly last year but there were other factors at work too 
the combination of a relatively modest increase in farmland 
values with the positive income and debt indicators suggests 
farmland investors anticipated the 1989 conditions and the 
farmland value increases in 1987 and 1988 reflected those 
anticipations the report said 
also uncertainty about changes in the capital gains tax 
changes in income and price supports movements in interest rates 
and outcomes of the global trade liberalization negotiations may 
have made investors cautious about projecting 1989 income levels 
into the future it said 
no state breakdown of farmland values was included in the 
report but analysts said farmland values rose in eight of the 10 
farm production regions although there was a wide variation 
corn belt land values averaged 2 percent higher on jan 1 far 
below the 10 percent gain of the previous year the mississippi 
delta states were about 1 percent higher while the northeast was 
about unchanged 
led by a 15 percent gain in south dakota values in the 
northern plains rose 8 percent about the same as a year earlier 
the report said value increases also were similar to a year ago 
in the southeast 8 percent appalachia 7 percent the lake 
states 6 percent and the pacific region 6 percent 
farmland values in the mountain region were reported up 5 
percent compared with 2 percent a year earlier including a 16 
percent gain in montana and 14 percent in idaho

veterans of world war i who fought in 
the gallipoli campaign left friday for turkey to commemorate one of 
the worst allied defeats in the war to end all wars 
the 46 australians aged 90 to 103 took off on a specially 
outfitted qantas airways boeing 747300 the plane was equipped 
with a minihospital including royal australian air force doctors 
to care for the veterans in case of medical emergency 
the journey for the ceremonies on wednesday will include a 
30hour stop in singapore to give the veterans a rest break the 
trip scheduled for arrival sunday in istanbul is expected to be 
difficult for some 
unlike their crowded wartime trip in a troop ship the veterans 
traveled first class in front of the plane while prime minister bob 
hawke and other government representatives sat in the rear of the 
jet 
some reflected on their first voyage 
we thought it was a glorious chance to see the world for 
nothing said 92yearold jack hazlitt who was a runner or 
military cables dispatcher that attitude didnt last long very 
few of us survived you could say im one of the lucky ones 
gallipoli is the turkish peninsula on the northern side of the 
dardanelles strait allied forces consisting of the britain 
australia new zealand french and indian troops invaded in 1915 in 
an attempt to open the straits to russia capture istanbul then 
known as constantinople and sever the ottoman turkish empire from 
its ally germany 
allied forces fought unsuccessfully for nine months and were 
forced to evacuate in december 1915 and january 1916 
allied casualties were 33532 killed 78518 wounded and 7689 
missing including 8587 australians killed and 19367 wounded 
most of the australian soldiers were called diggers and 
93yearold george mitchell said the term developed because all 
we did when not fighting was to dig dig and dig trenches 
the battle gave the turks a modern hero kemal ataturk who made 
his name as a military genius in gallipoli 
australia commemorates the campaign each year with a national 
day of remembrance for those killed in the wwi and for those who 
died in other wars 
in the australian consciousness two things stand out about 
gallipoli said bob carr leader of the labor opposition in the

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
will visit the isolated stalinist country of albania in midmay 
un officials confirmed friday 
it will be the first trip by a un secretarygeneral to 
albania the last bastion of hardline communism in eastern europe 
in recent weeks albania has made several recent moves to 
increase ties with the west including the reestablishment of 
telephone communications with the united states and several other 
western nations 
albanian foreign minister reis malile invited perez de cuellar 
to travel to his country when he visited the un general assembly 
in october 
the visit had been announced officially last month and there 
were no further details available friday except that the officials 
said the un chief is expected to spend two days in albania 
un officials said perez de cuellar was also planning trips in 
may to czechoslovakia and hungary two east bloc countries that 
have moved to end four decades of communist rule 
a visit to albania a nation accused of serious human rights 
abuses would make perez de cuellar one of the most senior 
international officials to visit the rigid communist state in 
recent years 
albania lying between greece and yugoslavia on the adriatic 
sea is one of the most isolated countries in the world albanian 
authorities strictly limit foreign visitors and tightly control 
access to foreign broadcasts and books 
despite the restrictions there have been indications of moves 
toward opening to the outside world since the death in 1985 of 
albanian hardline leader enver hoxha hoxha broke relations with 
the soviet union in 1961 because of nikita krushchevs dismantling 
of stalinism

the family of the late hank gathers filed a 
325 million lawsuit friday against loyola marymount university 
coach paul westhead and 12 others accusing them of negligence in 
the basketball stars death 
the lawsuit alleges among other things that gathers heart 
medication was reduced at westheads request because the players 
performance was suffering that gathers was not made aware of the 
risk he faced if he continued to play basketball and that he was 
not treated quickly enough when he collapsed march 4 during the 
lions west coast conference tournament game 
gathers the nations leading scorer and rebounder a year 
earlier died of heart disease hours later 
loyola marymount spokesman joan gaulene said university 
officials expect to be vindicated 
loyola marymount university is deeply saddened by the charges 
leveled at the university and the university staff in the suit 
filed today by attorney bruce fagel on behalf of the family of hank 
gathers she said in a statement gaulene said the universitys 
lawyers had not had enough time to review all the allegations and 
could not comment further 
westhead said in a statement friday as his coach i did my 
best for hank gathers i was never part of the medical decisions 
concerning hank i did not decide what medication to prescribe or 
what dosage to take 
i feel badly that my relationship with hank and his family 
could be distorted with this legal action 
contained in the lawsuit filed in los angeles superior court 
was the excerpt of a letter sent by one of gathers doctors vernon 
hattori to another dr michael mellman on jan 29 stating that 
the initial dosage prescribed to control the players irregular 
heartbeat was reduced because he was not playing well 
hattori was at lunch when fagels news conference on the lawsuit 
ended said a spokeswoman for his office exchange mellmans 
whereabouts were not immediately known 
the letter stated that a dosage of 240 milligrams of inderal a 
day almost completely controlled gathers erratic heartbeat but it 
went on to say his dose was diminished after a rather dismal 
performance in his first game against xavier on a lower dose he 
apparently performed incredibly against st johns 
however his performance was obviously still being unfavorably 
affected by his medication so i decreased his inderal 
the lawsuit was filed in los angeles superior court on behalf of 
gathers mother lucille his brothers derrick and charles and his 
aunt carole livingston 
hattori and mellman are among the defendants who also include 
loyola athletic director bryann quinn team trainer chip schaefer 
and a number of other doctors who treated gathers 
another part of the letter quoted in the lawsuit said that 
hattori met with gathers the week before his death and that the 
player said he was satisfied with his level of performance with the 
changes in medications 
later on over the weekend i got a call from his coach 
indicating that his athletic performance was still substantially 
subpar and that he felt strongly that the medication should be 
changed 
hattori said in the letter that gathers felt decreasing his 
dosage of inderal would be preferable to changing medication which 
could make him miss a game while he adjusted 
the last recorded dosage was 40 milligrams twice a day far 
below the 240 milligrams initially prescribed 
westhead has denied having any conversation in which he 
instructed that gathers medication be reduced or changed 
i dont have a clue about medications why would i tell a 
doctor what is best for hank gathers espn quoted westhead on 
thursday as saying

the united states and 31 other member 
nations of the organization of american states on friday formally 
signed a wideranging plan to speed up the hemispheres war against 
drugs 
the 20point declaration of ixtapa unanimously approved friday 
by the countries top law enforcement officers made no mention 
however of extradition 
extradition of suspects especially to the united states has 
been a touchy issue in latin america in recent years made even 
touchier this month by the alleged abduction of a mexican doctor to 
stand trial in los angeles in the 1985 murder of a us drug agent 
the declaration of ixtapa calls for better education and 
prevention starting in grammar schools greater coordination in 
police actions improvements in information exchange and tougher 
laws against the drug trade 
it calls for stronger measures against moneylaundering and 
illegal sales of weapons and explosives and of lab equipment and 
chemicals used in making drugs 
the plan includes a project for economic aid through the inter 
american development bank and like financial institutions to help 
farmers substitute legal crops for highpaying illicit crops such 
as coca leaf poppies and marijuana 
the declaration called for greater cooperation by governments 
for adequate control of their borders with absolute respect 
for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states 
according to some news reports bounty hunters snatched dr 
humberto alvarez machain 42 from his gynecologists office in 
guadalajara for a large reward put up by the us drug enforcement 
administration 
alvarez is one of 19 mexicans indicted by a us grand jury in 
the tortureslaying of dea agent enrique camarena 
mexico demanded an explanation and attorney general dick 
thornburgh asked dea director william c bennett for a full and 
immediate investigation 
similarly president virgilio barco of colombia has been 
criticized and threatened for extraditing colombian drug suspects 
to the united states 
experts from the oas nations unanimously concluded in a report 
to the assembled justice ministers at the fourday meeting that 
nowhere is the drug problem more serious and pressing than in the 
americas 
latin america is a leading grower and producer of the three 
principal drugs cocaine heroin and marijuana and the united 
states is the worlds leading consumer and center for 
moneylaundering 
enormous profits derived from the drug trade are making it 
possible for transnational criminal organizations to penetrate 
government structures the experts said 
these criminal elements are penetrating legitimate business 
activities and society at all levels corrupting and contaminating 
them and undermining the foundations of states the report

us rep harold ford lived well borrowed 
heavily and gave political support to two tennessee bankers but 
none of that means he broke the law his lawyer said friday at the 
congressmans bank fraud trial 
if you are to remove a political leader for his politics or 
his lifestyle that is to be done at the ballot box not the jury 
box william mcdaniels said in his closing argument to fords 
trial jury 
ford a memphis democrat has been on trial since feb 12 on 
conspiracy bank and mail fraud charges he is accused of taking 
political payoffs from former bankers jake and ch butcher jr 
the government says ford got loans totaling more than 1 million 
from the butchers between 1976 and 1982 and he was not expected to 
repay many of those debts 
the butchers banking empire collapsed in 1983 and only then did 
ford begin trying to settle his loans said assistant us attorney 
dan clancy 
he did not have the ability to repay all this stuff clancy 
said in his closing statement thursday 
the government claims ford took butcher payoffs to finance a 
lavish lifestyle prosecution witnesses said ford bought a 35000 
car 10000 worth of oriental rugs and contracted for 94000 in 
home renovations while heavily in debt to the butchers and other 
bankers 
ford puts his butcher loan total at 650000 and says all of the 
debts have been settled he settled his obligations on one loan a 
350000 debt assigned to a company called tennford inc by 
paying 25000 to a bankruptcy trustee 
the congressman is on trial with three former butcher aides 
accountant david crabtree and lawyers karl schledwitz and douglas 
beaty they are accused of helping him get and hide butcher payoffs 
the case is expected to go to the jury early next week ford 
who has been in congress since 1974 could face up to 95 years in 
prison if convicted on all 19 counts of an indictment issued in 
knoxville three years ago 
the defense rested its case without calling any witnesses ford 
said he decided not to take the witness stand because he regarded 
the governments case as weak 
his lawyer said the government failed to show what ford 
supposedly did in exchange for butcher payoffs 
prosecutors say ford helped the butchers in their business and 
political ventures and was called upon to help find federal money 
for a memphis bridge to butcherowned property

customs officials have seized a huge 
cylinder that iraq ordered from britain for an artillery system 
greece said friday 
the announcement came seven days after britain seized a shipment 
of steel tubes it said iraq had ordered to make an enormous gun for 
firing missiles 
customs officials in greeces western port of patras seized a 
british truck thursday that was conveying to iraq a part of an 
artillery system weighing 295 tons the finance ministry said it 
a statement 
it said documents listed the cargo as a copper cylinder 
sotirios sotiriou patras chief customs official said the 
cargo contained a 17footlong cylinder with a base for connecting 
it to a gun carriage 
sotiriou said that the driver of the truck paul ashwell 25 of 
northampton england had been arrested and would be charged with 
illegally importing arms into greece 
sotiriou said the british truck arrived in greece by ship on 
april 11 bound for iraq officials held it up because of a missing 
stamp on its documentation the officer said customs officials 
became suspicious because of reports about the shipment seized in 
britain and that it was intended for a huge iraqi gun 
greek customs officials requested help from the british 
government soritiou said 
he said an unidentified british customs expert later examined 
the cargo and determined it also was intended for the same big gun 
britain believes the iraqis intended to build 
walter somers ltd of halesowen near birmingham said they had 
shipped the consignment but said two trucks were detained in greece 
sotiriou confirmed somers originated the cargo but insisted 
only one truck was seized 
the domestic british news agency press association later quoted 
david james chairman of somers parent eagle trust as saying 
another truck had been detained friday in turkey 
but turkish officials including the customs director in the 
port mersin where the truck was rumored to be denied the reports 
somers said the last of 12 steel tubes ordered by iraq at a cost 
of more than 16 million left the factory by shipment march 15 
until a few hours ago we thought it had all gone by sea a 
company spokesman said we now learn that two lorries trucks 
detained in greece were each carrying one and possibly two of our 
pipes 
it would be fair to assume that at least six of the others 
forged by walter somers ltd have got through to iraq 
customs investigators were believed to have been trying to 
intercept the road freight for more than a week as it made its way 
from birmingham to iraq 
british officials seized eight steel tubes on the middlesbrough 
docks in england on april 12 the tubes were parts for a gun that 
would be 130 feet long with a bore of nearly 40 inches british 
customs officials said 
the iraqi government and the british manufacturer of the tubes 
sheffield forgemasters have said they were designed for a 
petrochemical plant there was no immediate comment from iraq on 
the greek shipment 
tony peck a spokesman for sheffield forgemasters said in 
london that he assumes the shipment confiscated in greece is 
ancillary equipment for the same iraqi contract that has already 
been widely reported 
weapons experts have said a gun built from the parts confiscated 
in britain and greece could fire nuclear or chemical missiles 
hundreds of miles far enough to reach israel and iran 
nicholas ridley britains trade and industry secretary said on 
thursday his government is entirely satisfied that these tubes 
form part of a gun and that the customs action was correct 
britain banned arms shipments to iran and iraq when the two 
countries were at war and the ban remains in effect

israels supreme court on friday blocked the 
eviction of jewish settlers living in a compound in the christian 
quarter of jerusalems old city temporarily setting aside an order 
by the attorney general 
the 150 settlers can remain in the four 100yearold buildings 
near the church of the holy sepulcher until the high court hears 
more arguments next week on an appeal for the settlers to remain 
attorney general yosef harish on thursday ordered their 
immediate eviction from the 72room complex owned by the greek 
orthodox church harish said he wanted to prevent further 
deterioration of jewishchristian relations 
the church claims a former tenant illegally sold his user rights 
to the building to the settlers 
the april 11 move by the settlers into the christian quarter 
sparked angry protests by arab christians and moslems they fear 
the group is leading a campaign to eventually push all palestinians 
out of the walled old city 
after the high court allowed the settlers to stay a half dozen 
greek orthodox priests carrying candles staged a protest vigil 
outside the complex black flags fluttered from the holy sepulcher 
and the greek orthodox patriarchate 
rightwing parliament member hanan porath a mentor of the 
settler group said even though the court treated the case as a 
simple tenancy dispute it was a political confrontation 
the motives of all sides are political this is a struggle 
over the rights of jews to live everywhere in jerusalem he told 
the associated press 
this is one of the most sensitive places in the world 
avraham sochovolsky attorney for the church told the threejudge 
panel there is no quiet moment there now we have to douse this 
fire 
anger over the move has been heightened by the fact that arabs 
cannot buy land in the old citys jewish quarter under israeli law 
the settlement also has implications concerning israels 
sovereignty over jerusalem the christian quarter is part of east 
jerusalem which israel seized from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war 
most countries including the united states do not recognize 
israeli sovereignty over the disputed area the palestinians hope 
east jerusalem will be the capital of their wouldbe state 
greece on friday strongly criticized israel in the matter 
we condemn the stand taken by israel which so far has failed 
to take proper measures for removal of the occupiers foreign 
minister antonis samaras said in a statement moreover the 
regrettable incident has taken place in occupied territory 
in fridays hearing the supreme court made no reference to the 
religious and political dimensions of the case 
chief justice meir shamgar scheduled a hearing for next 
thursday during which harish must show why his immediate eviction 
order should not be annulled 
the settlers will be allowed to stay until there is a final 
decision by the high court said attorney dan aviyitzhak who 
represents the panamabased company sbc which leased the building 
to the settlers 
sbc claims it gave martyros matossian an armenian who has lived 
in the complex more than 40 years 35 million for the user 
rights matossian left for geneva before the settlers moved in 
attorney yohanan altbauer who represents the church said 
matossian had no right to sublet the building he said the church 
has been trying since 1982 to evict matossian and that the case was 
pending a decision is not expected for another six months 
altbauer said 
the supreme court will not make a ruling on the tenancy dispute 
but only on whether the settlers can remain while the lower court 
sorts out the tenancy rights 
altbauer said the supreme court judges offered a compromise 
under which the settlers would leave and only a few sbc 
representatives would remain until the tenancy dispute is decided 
both sides rejected the compromise altbauer said

the bush administration criticized moscows 
escalating crackdown on lithuania as another unfortunate step 
friday and saidpresident bush would summon leaders of congress next 
week to discuss possible retaliatory action 
the situation in the break away baltic republic darkened amid 
reports that moscow was blocking food shipments after sharply 
reducing fuel supplies 
witnesses in the capital city of vilnius also said red army 
soldiers stormed into a printing plant and beat civilian guards 
we are increasingly concerned by news reports today of an 
economic crackdown on lithuania white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said accompanying bush on a political trip to 
birmingham and orlando 
bush himself was silent on lithuania he avoided the subject 
as he made a political appearance in birmingham ala and visited 
a model recycling plant and again in orlando where he campaigned 
for the gop and also fed a bottle of food to a 235pound orphan 
manatee at sea world 
although our information is sketchy we are disturbed that 
this signals another unfortunate step in the pressure being brought 
to bear by the soviet union on lithuania fitzwater said reading 
from prepared remarks 
this statement represented a toughening of the administrations 
rhetoric intended to match the increase in soviet action and put 
pressure on moscow to relax tension 
by delaying any us response until next week bush in effect 
gave soviet president mikhail gorbachev a few more days to 
reconsider his tactics to force lithuania to drop its efforts to 
succeed from the soviet union 
bush during a tour of orlandos sea world park was asked why 
he was waiting until next week to respond to soviet actions a 
lot of consultations going on he replied 
hopeful of preserving ussoviet relations and prospects for 
nuclear arms negotiations bush has reacted cautiously over the 
last few weeks to soviet intimidation of lithuania 
we continue to urge the soviet union to pursue a peaceful 
course of dialogue in the hopes that this matter can be resolved in 
a responsible manner fitzwater said 
he said bush had stepped up consultation with allies about 
actions the united states would take and steps that other nations 
might adopt fitzwater said the president would complete his 
deliberations next week 
at that time president bush would meet congressional leaders 
to advise them on our consultations and to discuss possible courses 
of action fitzwater said 
asked if bush would announce after the meeting with 
congressional leaders what he plans to do fitzwater said i 
would assume that we would be prepared to announce actions fairly 
soon after that 
when asked why bush needed more time to frame a response 
fitzwater replied because many of the actions that we would 
contemplate taking would involve other countries would have 
international implications and we therefore think its important 
that we touch base with our allies on this issue 
the administration already has signaled that the most likely 
us action against moscow would be in the economic field such as 
trade rather than a slowdown in arms negotiations or discussions 
of regional disputes 
earlier friday fitzwater indicated the administration held out 
hope for release of an american hostage in lebanon but cited 
troublesome patterns weve seen before 
with the hostage situation still uncertain and kremlin tactics 
turning to violence in lithuania bush followed a 
businessasusual approach blending politics with environmentalism 
and a touch of personal recreation 
after an earlymorning jog and a speedboat ride in key largo 
fla bush jetted to birmingham to help raise money for bill 
cabaniss a conservative businessman struggling to unseat incumbent 
democratic sen howell heflin 
the next stop was back in florida for an orlando fundraiser to 
boost gov bob martinez reelection hopes and to help other 
republicans after that bush was flying back to the florida keys 
for a weekend of fishing 
in his public remarks bush stayed away from the mideast and 
lithuania situations instead celebrating the defections of 215 
democratic politicians mostly in the south to republican ranks 
since the 1988 election 
overshadowing the trip were the promise of release and then 
threatened delay of an american hostage in lebanon those 
concerns were compounded by new soviet coercion in lithuania 
fitzwater said that syria which exerts military control in 
lebanon still believes theres a possibility of release of a 
hostage even though the kidnappers said they were postponing it 
the captors the radical islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine blamed the delay on bushs refusal to meet their demand 
to send assistant secretary of state john kelly to syria to accept 
a hostage 
that was just a smokescreen and we think people realize 
that fitzwater said in a countermove bush sent the us 
ambassador to syria edward djerejian back to damascus to be on 
hand for hostage developments 
while holding out hope for release of a hostage fitzwater said 
well just wait and see if its real 
asked if the kidnappers were toying with the united states 
fitzwater replied they do it every time 
to highlight the environment bush went to birminghamsouthern 
college to view a model recycling program that enlists the help of 
inner city youngsters as well as college students 
in orlando bush announced the addition of five new sites 
including waterways around bostons polluted harbor to the 
environmental protection agencys national estuary program 
the designation leads to the development of comprehensive 
management plans to protect the areas 
the new sites are tampa bay and the indian river complex both 
in florida the baratariaterrebonne estuarine complex in 
louisiana casco bay maine and the massachusetts bays in 
massachusetts 
bush also used his orlando appearance to unleash tough criticism 
against democrats 
sadly the other party has no firm principles and no new 
ideas to offer the world at this critical time bush said

president bush paid respects friday to the 
more than 1 million armenians killed in terrible massacres at 
the hands of the turks from 1915 to 1923 
bush in a written statement issued during a visit here said he 
joined with armenians and others who will observe april 24 as a day 
of remembrance 
i call upon all peoples to work to prevent future acts of 
inhumanity against mankind and my comments of june 1988 represent 
the depth of my feeling for the armenian people and the sufferings 
they have endured bush said 
in 1988 as a candidate for president bush referred to the 
killings as a genocide 
as president he has refrained from using that term out of 
sensitivity toward turkey a nato ally the bush administration 
opposed a senate resolution sponsored by minority leader bob dole 
rkan which called the killings genocide 
bush said that through their history the armenians have shown 
strength and resilience in the face of numerous tragedies 
those tragedies include the earthquake of 1988 and most 
prominently the terrible massacres suffered in 19151923 at the 
hands of the rulers of the ottoman empire the president said

imposing a 10 pm curfew in an effort to curb vandalism and 
excessive noise on the streets of the town of 5300 20 miles north

friday in this day and age when both parents are working 
thats important 
parents of firsttime violators will get off with a warning 
hildreth said if their kids are caught a second time parents face 
a 25 fine after that parents could find themselves behind bars 
the youths who violate the curfew face no penalty the 
ordinance which police began enforcing monday applies to anyone 
under the age of 16 
each night even on weekends a horn that sits atop a telephone 
pole next to the local mcdonalds sounds the start of the curfew 
nobody has been arrested yet said hildreth whos found 
some opposition in his own back yard from his son kevin 13 
my son doesnt like it but he was never allowed out after 10 
anyway hildreth said its been on the books since 1915 i had 
to comply with the law when i was a kid and the curfew then was 
930 
hildreth said he hasnt received any complaints yet from 
parents but the new york civil liberties union is looking into the 
matter and may challenge the ordinance 
forget it the law could never stand up in court said the 
groups executive director norman siegel its

then he and his wife beat the child with pillows until he collapsed 
while mrs coes 30year sentence exceeds the recommended 12 to 
17 years for seconddegree murder a firstdegree murder conviction 
would have brought a sentence of life in prison without parole for 
at least 25 years 
under the plea deal circuit judge randall mcdonald imposed the 
30year sentence which with good behavior and gain time translates 
to about 10 years in actual time behind bars 
i dont think it was harsh enough said kip lyles who once 
cared for bradley in a foster home i think she should have 
received the death penalty for what she did she did nothing to 
protect the child and she participated in it 
prosecutors say mrs coe will be subpoenaed to testify against 
her husband at his firstdegree murder and aggravated child abuse 
trial set for july in fort myers 
bradley mcgee had been in foster care since his parents 
abandoned him at a lakeland mall when he was 3 months old the 
state department of health and rehabilitative services returned the 
child to his parents despite repeated warnings from foster parents 
and relatives that he might be in danger 
bradley died two months after being returned 
three hrs child protection workers were later charged with 
failing to report suspected child abuse one hrs supervisor was 
acquitted in february and the others still face trial 
outrage over the toddlers death also prompted lawmakers last 
fall to pass the bradley mcgee bill allocating an extra 78 
million for the hrs to hire more childprotection workers

honduran president rafael leonardo callejas said 
friday his country was donating 25000 to build a recreation 
center in the neighborhood where 87 people died when fire swept 
through an illegal social club 
cardinal john oconnor said the archdiocese of new york also was 
committed to building the center to diminish the need for illegal 
social clubs in the bronx neighborhood 
the announcements were made at a memorial mass for the victims 
of the happy land social club tragedy 
callejas told the more than 750 people inside st thomas aquinas 
church and more than 100 people listening through loudspeakers 
outside that the honduran people raised the money and that 1000 
of it was from his own pocket 
oconnor said the church would match the contribution if the 
city would donate the land he promised to donate 99999 of his 
own 
most of the 87 people who died march 25 when fire ravaged the 
club were honduran immigrants 
julio gonzalez 36 a cuban immigrant has been charged with 
setting the blaze 
the mass originally scheduled for sunday at st patricks 
cathedral was shifted to st thomas two blocks from the gutted 
social club building so callejas could attend officials said 
too many immigrants in our country are forced to live in 
crowded inadequate and dangerous housing conditions oconnor 
speaking in spanish told families and friends of the victims 
these immigrants have menial jobs because they are illegal and 
it comes as no surprise that they are forced to use crowded and 
dangerous facilities for various forms of social activities because 
they are so poor oconnor said 
callejas told the crowd that we are together in your pain

moscow on friday expanded its energy 
embargo on lithuania to include certain shipments of food metal 
and industrial parts in its continuing effort to crush the 
republics independence drive lithuanians said 
dozens of soviet soldiers also stormed a printing plant and beat 
civilian guards and a local legislator friday witnesses said 
the kremlin is seeking to stop the plants put the workers on 
the streets and encourage social unrest lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis charged at a news conference friday night 
thus far in the 5weekold standoff no such unrest has occurred 
despite military and economic pressure lithuanians have refused 
to back off their march 11 declaration of independence from the 
soviet union as demanded by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and have solicited western material and political support 
ill have to sacrifice said aviea kishnevskaya a jewish 
mother in her 30s interviewed in vilnius the capital she said 
that requiring her 7yearold daughter to share those sacrifices 
will be the hardest part the city was calm friday and traffic was 
quieter than usual 
vilnius radio said the presidium of the lithuanian parliament 
messaged gorbachev reiterating lithuanias readiness to negotiate 
with moscow 
it said landbergis disclosed details friday night and quoted the 
message as reading in part all countries big and small can 
and must find a solution worthy of civilized societies to any 
complication if these countries are guided by the principles of 
humanity and it is only political dialogue that must underlie the 
search for the wisest solution 
the message also said we have no doubt that brutal assault 
and battery of ordinary people like the one launched by units 
of the soviet armed forces in vilnius today will call forth your 
condemnation and that those guilty will be punished 
accordingly 
landsbergis was quoted as saying that a freeze on putting 
lithuanias independence fully into effect could form part of a 
compromise 
if somebody authorized by moscow to negotiate presented us 
with a package of proposals including this we could have a 
discussion the new york times saturday editions quoted him as 
saying in a telephone interview 
in birmingham ala where president bush spoke at a political 
rally spokesman marlin fitzwater said the white house is 
increasingly concerned by reports of the soviet economic 
crackdown on lithuania and that bush will be ready to brief 
congress early next week on possible retaliation 
lithuania was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
two ships from cuba carrying raw sugar were diverted from the 
lithuanian port of klaipeda and a shipment of fish due from latvia 
was sent elsewhere lithuania deputy prime minister romualdas 
ozolas told reporters friday night 
lithuania produces more meat and milk than it consumes and is 
in no danger of starving 
but lithuanias communist party chief algirdas brazauskas said 
friday this baltic republic of 38 million people must compromise 
on its proindependence decisions or face critical shortages of oil 
and natural gas in two weeks following soviet cutoffs and 
reductions the previous two days 
brazauskas said moscow also has cut off the supply of rubber 
tires polyesterol cables bearings and caustic soda large 
scheduled shipments of metal and wood failed to appear he said 
most factories here are expected to close if no solution emerges 
in two weeks we will have a critical situation brazauskas 
told the lithuanian parliament the price for independence must 
have limits 
algimantas cekuolis a newspaper editor and former lithuanian 
representative in the soviet parliament told reporters lithuanians 
may offer to freeze their new laws backing up independence if 
moscow gives us guarantees of something 
gorbachev has refused to negotiate unless lithuania rescinds its 
declaration of independence 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene was in norway on friday 
learning about buying oil for hard currency at worldmarket prices 
instead of lowcost oil for soviet rubles she offered to trade 
lithuanian dairy products and said she will seek financial aid from 
the west 
despite all this foreign minister lennart meri of neighboring 
estonia said in finland on friday his republic rejects soviet 
threats and inducements and refuses to rescind a march 30 
declaration proclaiming itself an occupied independent state 
armed soldiers stormed a communist party printing plant in 
vilnius friday afternoon beating at least 12 civilian guards and a 
local legislator witnesses said 
soviet soldiers previously occupied more than a halfdozen party 
and public buildings but without violence 
lithuanian legislator zigmas vaisvilas told reporters the 
civilian guards arrived friday at the plant which already was 
occupied by a few interior ministry troops without weapons 
the soviet news agency tass said the colonel in charge asked the 
27 civilians to leave and called in reinforcements when they did 
not 
helmeted soviet soldiers carrying automatic weapons and 
truncheons arrived in two trucks surged into the building and beat 
some of the civilians said witness angele guobiene who works for 
the trade union journal darbas ir poilsis that is printed at the 
plant 
newspaper editor algimantas cekuolis said the civilians 
including legislator vaisvilas were hurt when they tried to bar 
the soldiers two or three people were hospitalized cekuolis said 
tass said the civilians were hurt when soldiers shoved them 
bodily out the door 
police kept reporters out of the building soldiers were visible 
in the buildings courtyard some workers barricaded themselves 
near printing presses and looked out of open windows 
about 500 people gathered outside they sang nationalist songs 
and carried the hammer and sickle of the soviet union merged with 
the nazi swastika 
soldiers began occupying buildings in vilnius a month ago among 
them a plant that prints the republics newspapers the plant 
occupied friday prints nonpolitical magazines 
lithuania on friday limited gasoline to just under eight gallons 
a month for private cars and some large factories planned to give 
workers a day off saturday the only conservation steps reported 
to deal with the cutoff of oil and loss of 80 percent of its 
supply of natural gas 
the energy embargo left lithuania with only 15 percent to 17 
percent of the 18 million cubic meters of natural gas it uses daily 
for homes and industry 
gorbachev has demanded repeal of new republic laws that halt 
conscription of lithuanians into the soviet army and introduce 
identity cards for all citizens he also complained about alleged 
seizure of communist party property 
brazauskas said the march 11 declaration should not be 
reconsidered but urged lawmakers to compromise on gorbachevs 
other demands to take us out of this dead end

police on thursday foiled a plan by two 
spanish basque mercenaries to attack the medellin airport with 
rocket and rifle fire authorities said 
officials have accused members of the eta the separatist basque 
group in spain of carrying out terrorist attacks in colombia for 
drug traffickers 
gen huberto camero the citys police chief said police found 
a rocket and two automatic rifles in a raid on a house across from 
medellin airport he said in a communique the two terrorists fled 
moments before the raid 
camero said the two were planning to carry out a largescale 
attack presumably against either presidential candidates or 
aircraft 
the candidate for the opposition conservative party rodrigo 
lloreda was in medellin on thursday campaigning for may 27 
elections 
in bogota gen miguel maza chief of colombias security 
police told reporters the two mercenaries arrived in medellin on 
wednesday apparently to prepare the attack on the airport 
mercenaries from the eta which stands for basque land and 
liberty in the basque language have been implicated in two of the 
worst terrorist attacks by drug traffickers in their war against 
the government 
police blame the terrorists for bombing a colombian jetliner 
last nov 27 killing all 107 people aboard a car bomb targeting 
security police headquarters killed 63 people and wounded about 
1000 on dec 6 
eta members fabricated the car bomb police said 
terrorists working for the medellin cocaine cartel exploded a 
car bomb on a busy medellin highway last week killing 20 people 
including eight police 
the attacks were in retaliation for a government antidrug 
campaign now in its eighth month 
in bogota the capital the government told colombias biggest 
leftist guerrilla group thursday to end hostilities if it wants a 
peace agreement similar to that of other rebels who disbanded 
hours later six leftist guerrillas were killed in a battle with 
a special army brigade created to fight the rebels the deaths 
brought to 28 the number of rebels killed by the brigade in its 
first two weeks in operation 
president virgilio barcos emissary for guerrilla contacts 
rafael pardo sent a message demanding that the colombian 
revolutionary armed forces known as the farc cease attacks if it 
wants to begin peace talks 
the statement was revealed in an official communique 
the farc says it has about 10000 combatants the defense 
department puts the number at about 4400 
by either measure the farc is the largest of colombias four 
guerrilla groups it was founded in the 1950s 
the farc has expressed interest in peace talks but has 
continued its attacks and kidnappings pardo said 
the government successfully negotiated an end to hostilities by 
another guerrilla group the april 19 movement known as m19 last 
january and the m19 leader carlos pizarro is running in the may 
26 presidential elections 
another guerrilla group the peoples liberation army or epl 
said this month that it too is interested in peace talks 
the six guerrillas killed thursday belonged to epl a maoist 
group an army communique said rebels fought soldiers in 
montelibano 250 miles north of bogota 
colombias most active guerrilla group the national liberation 
army known as the eln says it will fight until it overthrows the

thousands of dollars in payoffs to us 
rep harold ford were covered up with hocuspocus and bogus 
loans from two crooked bankers a prosecutor said thursday in 
closing arguments in fords fraud trial 
for more than 10 years loans ford wasnt expected to repay were 
bounced from bank to bank assistant us attorney dan clancy told 
the us district court jury 
several loans in the memphis democrats name ended up in his 
fathers name or as the responsibility of a vague company called 
tennford inc clancy said 
hocuspocus nowyouseeitandnowyoudont and his name is 
taken off clancy said 
ford 44 is accused of taking payoffs from former tennessee 
bankers jake and ch butcher jr he is charged with 19 counts of 
conspiracy bank and mail fraud and faces up to 95 years in prison 
if convicted of all charges 
also on trial are three former butcher aides accountant david 
crabtree and attorneys douglas beaty and karl schledwitz 
ch butcher was indicted with ford in 1987 but has pleaded 
guilty to bank fraud and is serving a 20year prison sentence his 
brother jake who was named as an unindicted coconspirator is 
serving a 20year sentence in another bank fraud case 
ford started getting loans between 6000 and 7000 from the 
butchers in 1976 two years after he was first elected to congress 
but his political value to the bankers grew over the years 
according to the government in 1982 he got 350000 from ch 
butcher through tennford which was created by the bankers aides 
as his influence increased so did his ability to talk them 
into giving him more money clancy said 
the butchers once controlled the largest string of banks in 
tennessee but their financial empire collapsed in 1983 under the 
weight of mismanagement and fraud 
after ch butchers southern industrial banking corp 
collapsed ford settled his obligations under the tennford 
arrangement by paying a bankruptcy trustee 25000 
he told the trustee in a sworn statement that tennford was set 
up to handle an investment by ch butcher in the nj ford amp sons 
funeral parlor in memphis 
clancy said records of fords personal accountant showed that 
much of the tennford money went to pay the congressmans personal 
debts including credit card and department store bills 
the funeral home didnt have an account at neimanmarcus the 
funeral home didnt have an account at saks fifth avenue clancy 
said 
ford says the government has failed to show what he supposedly 
did for the alleged payoffs but clancy said the motive for the 
butchers giving him money is clear 
since you know who got the money you know what they got for 
it there was only one thing to get they needed a united 
states congressman he said 
financial records offered as evidence showed that ford had so 
many debts in 1982 that his expenses exceeded his income by 12 a 
month even though he was not paying anything on his butcher loans 
clancy said 
ford has acknowledged he was in bad financial shape and that he 
turned to ch butcher to help line up investors in the ford family 
business 
ford the only black member of tennessees congressional 
delegation has said since his indictment that he is the victim of 
racist prosecutors who dislike him personally clancy has denied 
those allegations 
the defense was to present its closing argument friday and the 
case may go to the jury

a man on trial for resisting arrest was freed 
thursday after a judge agreed that he wasnt actually charged with 
anything because the wrong name was listed on the official papers 
anthony martinezs lawyer peter collins waited for prosecutors 
to rest their case before telling dade county judge morton perry 
about the error 
over the protests of the state attorneys office perry on 
wednesday found martinez innocent 
we dont feel a case should be decided on a typographical 
error complained chief assistant state attorney john hogan 
prosecutors said they would try to file new charges against 
martinez a jail guard from miami 
but collins said there were no grounds for such action because 
the case ended in an acquittal not the dismissal of charges 
they cant appeal a notguilty verdict said collins the 
case is history 
martinez was arrested after allegedly threatening his girlfriend 
with a gun but the paperwork in the case mistakenly listed two 
different names as the accused neither of which was anthony 
martinez 
the two assistant prosecutors on the case lisa kreeger and 
tammera j ferrari failed to notice the mistake 
when collins pointed it out the judge gave the prosecutors 10 
days to come up with a reason why he shouldnt throw out the case 
the prosecutors tried to argue that since martinez was not 
named the trial never happened but the judge rejected that 
reasoning

the number of illegal aliens caught 
entering the country per year dropped nearly by half from 1986 to 
1988 but sanctions on employers played a small role in cutting the 
flow said a study released thursday 
employer sanctions in the immigration reform and control act 
alone slowed the rate of illegal entry into the united states by 
less than 20 percent according to a joint study by the rand corp 
and the washingtonbased urban institute 
the study concluded that if the sanctions portion of the law was 
expected to merely stop the increase of illegal immigrants the 
reform act has succeeded 
but if officials expected a major drop in such numbers then the 
sanctions have failed and they probably should be reviewed by 
congress the studys authors said 
among the considerations would be increasing the level of 
enforcement or considering the cost of continuing the sanctions 
against such limited results 
congress approved the immigration act in november 1986 the 
employersanctions section was one of the most controversial 
for more than a year the immigration and naturalization service 
conducted seminars and contacted businesses about their obligations 
under the law then businesses were checked for compliance 
only in 1989 were repeat offenders prosecuted and punished for 
disobeying the law 
the study looked at various statistics to make its conclusions 
including counts of people passing through canyon zapata north of 
tijuana mexico a favored spot of illegal entry of the united 
states 
the raw data showed more than 17 million apprehensions in 1986 
down to just over 1 million apprehensions in 1988 the last year 
for which the statistics were available 
immigration waiting lists of several countries also were 
investigated researchers theorized that if immigration reforms 
were effective more people would be convinced to try entering the 
united states legally 
also reviewed were the wages for jobs traditionally taken by 
illegal immigrants dishwashing and car washing a rise in wages 
would indicate a decrease in the supply of such workers but no 
rise was detected 
alone none of our data sets provides conclusive evidence that 
employer sanctions have or have not reduced undocumented 
immigration the study said together the preponderance of the 
evidence points to some decline in the flow

candidates and threatening to kill people who voted 
perus elected government is currently battling two violent 
leftist insurgencies 
the most radical group is the maoinspired shining path which 
began fighting 10 years ago in the southern andean highlands it 
now operates throughout the andes and in the cocaproducing jungles 
of the northeast 
the tupac amaru revolutionary movement is a smaller and less 
violent group that operates mainly in lima and some regions of the 
northern jungle the procuban group took up arms in 1984 
bernales head of a respected senate commission on violence 
said 150 of the april deaths were confirmed by the military or 
police the rest were unofficial reports received by his office 
more than 18000 people have been killed since 1980 he said a 
great majority of the dead were civilians killed by both sides 
bernales criticized president alan garcias government for 
telling the public it is winning the war against the guerrillas 
this is dramatic evidence that terrorism has not been slowed 
but has increased bernales said 
the highest monthly death toll was recorded by the commission 
last june when 470 people were killed

despite a pact to disband the contras 
president daniel ortega said nicaraguans cant be sure their 
9yearold civil war is over until the last rebel lays down his gun 
the contras signed an accord thursday with the united national 
opposition and the sandinistas to begin turning in their weapons

violeta barrios de chamorro are to take office

might not transfer power as pledged despite its loss in feb 25 
elections if the contras did not disarm the situation has 
created an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and ortega appealed for 
trust

today that we are much closer to peace and are distancing ourselves 
from war he said after a meeting with bernard aronson the us

an international task force is recommending a 
worldwide plan to uncover billions of dollars being hidden by 
narcotics dealers through intricate moneylaundering transactions 
a major element of the plan according to deputy treasury 
secretary john e robson is a requirement that financial 
institutions report questionable dealings by their customers 
specifically the task force recommends that as in the united 
states financial institutions must be able to report suspicious 
transactions to law enforcement in good faith free from fear of 
liability under secrecy laws robson said at a news conference

suspicious transaction reporting has proven to be very 
valuable to us law enforcement he added

portauprince haiti ap women till the poor land toil in 
sweatshops and perform the other drudgery that moves haitis meager 
economy but the choice of a woman as president in march was their 
first real taste of power 
they dominate in agriculture trade and industry 
sociologist daniele bazin said they in fact run this country 
until ertha pascaltrouillot 46 was installed march 26 women 
were virtually excluded from power in haiti which has been ruled 
by dictators through much of its 186 years 
as recently as the early 1980s women were regarded as legal 
minors barred from opening bank accounts buying property or 
traveling without the consent of their husbands 
those laws have been repealed but little has been done to 
improve the hard lot of most haitian women 
mrs pascaltrouillot the only woman ever to serve on the 
supreme court has become a symbol of womens aspirations since 
taking office as provisional president 
i accept in the name of haitian women she said at the 
inauguration 
her civilian administration which is to govern as caretaker 
until democratic elections can be held replaced the 18monthold 
military government of lt gen prosper avril who was driven into 
exile by a popular uprising 
the choice of mrs pascaltrouillot by a coalition of opposition 
groups had psychological impact historian suzy castor said 
when the army gives up power to a civilian and to a woman at 
that it has a lot of meaning she said i dont have 
illusions but it represents a few steps 
symbol she may be but the elegant highly educated president 
has little in common with her illiterate improverished sisters 
women from privileged families have gained ground in haiti 
about half the doctors are women for instance but only 
onefourth of university students are women what money is 
available for higher education usually goes to a son 
haiti which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican 
republic is the western hemispheres poorest nation 
most of its 6 million people live in the countryside working 
tiny mountain plots of coffee sugar cane rice and corn with 
primitive tools agriculture accounts for 32 percent of a gross 
national product valued at 15 billion annually 
half the work force is unemployed and average annual pay for 
those who find jobs is only about 370 most city dwellers live in 
slums without electricity potable water or adequate sewers and 
life expectancy is 53 years 
the 8300member army is a way out of poverty for men women run 
the households care for the children and support the economy in 
countless ways 
most of the distribution and sale of crops is carried out by 
peasant women who walk long distances in the mountains to sell 
their goods at outdoor markets 
women called madames sara for a migratory bird handle most 
of the trade with the rest of the caribbean traveling to the 
dominican republic puerto rico martinique curacao and panama to 
buy kitchenware shoes and food for sale at home 
government tax incentives and low wages attract foreignowned 
manufacturing plants that produce electronics clothing and 
sporting goods for sale abroad mostly in the united states women 
make up about 75 percent of the factory workers who are paid only 
320 a day 
paul latortue a haitian economist at the university of puerto 
rico said womens conomic contribution is overwhelming 
though we dont have the data i believe women produce the 
better part of haitis gnp he said 
about 80 percent of haitian mothers raise their children alone 
marriage is commonly viewed as a preserve of the upper class and 
most children are born out of wedlock 
couples who live together consider themselves married but men 
have no legal obligation to pay child support or alimony men 
change wives at will and may have several at the same time 
men run around a lot to prove their virility said irene a 
22yearold housemaid who asked that only her first name be used 
claudette werleigh social affairs minister and the cabinets 
only woman said men often have several wives in a lifetime 
among the poor the man has many women so he is absent she 
said he escapes the problems the sick children the crying 
haiti has an infant mortality rate of 135 per 1000 births 
highest among western nations and women tend to have several 
children so a few will survive children are a womans protection 
when the man leaves and often go to work when very young 
the only thing a woman has to look forward to in haiti is that 
her children will have a better life than she does said mrs 
bazin the sociologist they are her insurance policy and she 
will slave so her child can get an education 
violence against women is common but usually goes unreported 
because abused women have nowhere to turn 
there are no womens shelters said lilian pierrepaul a 
popular radio newscaster when they are beaten they come here 
they come on foot in trucks to talk to me and ask for help 
feminists say attempts to organize have been difficult because 
haitian womens priority is economic survival women dont have 
time to go to meetings said michele de ronceray a sociologist 
and political activist 
womens groups have sprung up in recent years however and some 
observers see mrs pascaltrouillots government as a turning point 
we go the countryside and women are saying they are concerned 
about their lives said daniele fouchard founder of am education 
and health center for illiterate women and children that has 300 
branches 
for years they werent able to say what they were thinking 
they were afraid to talk she said people are thinking 
something can change with a new person with a woman as president

college campuses across the country will be 
the scene of a spring offensive in the battle between gay activists 
and the pentagon over its policy barring homosexuals from military 
service 
activists led by a university of wisconsinmadison group are in 
the process of organizing simultaneous news conferences to take 
place may 4 the thrust will be joint attacks on reserve officer 
training corps programs that exclude homosexuals from receiving 
financial aid or being commissioned as officers 
the groundswell of student interest has come as a surprise to 
some national gay leaders until rotc emerged as an issue last year 
on college campuses gay activists had been focusing primarily on 
the courts and congress in their effort to change pentagon policy 
i dont understand this why the schools in the midwest are 
getting so revved up about this but they are said sue hyde 
director of the gay and lesbian military freedom project based in 
washington 
in recent weeks hyde said she has fielded inquiries from 
students and faculty at about a dozen schools seeking information 
and advice on how to shake up their rotc chapters or continue 
protests already begun 
the effort has begun to show some results several universities 
already have written the pentagon warning that rotcs future on 
campuses is in jeopardy unless the policy changes in a recent 
letter to the defense department john m deutch provost of the 
massachusetts institute of technology said the exclusion of 
homosexuals runs counter to mits priniciple of 
nondiscrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual 
orientation 
about 96000 students participate in rotc programs on 585 
campuses according to the defense department 
in 1989 alone students or faculty at least six schools the 
university of wisconsinmadison yale harvard the university of 
minnesota northwestern and the university of iowa law school 
took action against rotc chapters for their discriminatory 
policies those actions ranged from barring rotc from using iowa 
law school buildings to refusing to reinstate the corps at harvard 
and yale rotc was ousted from the latter two campuses 20 years 
ago to protest the vietnam war 
at the university of wisconsin the student and faculty senates 
voted in december to recommend that the board of regents phase out 
rotc by 1993 unless the military changes its antigay policy the 
following month chancellor donna shalala instead recommended 
working within the system to pressure the pentagon and allowing the 
rotc to remain indefinitely 
many students contend that shalalas solution violates the 
universitys own antidiscrimination policy and a state law 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation said 
jordan marsh university affairs director of the wisconsin student 
association 
i think its important to start a comprehensive mobilization 
effort said marsh a senior who is organizing the simultaneous 
news conferences he said he has invited about 120 colleges to 
participate 
alan berube a san franciscobased historian whose book coming 
out under fire the history of gay men and women in world war 
two was published this month said he had just returned from a 
talk at chico state college in california and was surprised at how 
quickly interest was spreading 
the whole issue in the last six or eight months has become 
much more public he said 
he pointed to the cases of joe steffan a naval cadet who was 
expelled from anapolis for admitting his homosexuality and james 
holobaugh a former rotc cadet at washington university in st 
louis who in january was denied an army commission for the same 
reason 
at least two other rotc cadets have also come out recently 
leading the military to try to make them pay back their 
scholarships several dozen members of congress have sent protest 
letters to the pentagon the cases are still open 
the defense department policy says flatly that homosexuality 
is incompatible with military service the defense department 
contends that the presence of gay people would undermine 
discipline order and morale and that homosexuals in the military 
would be particularly susceptible to blackmail 
however internal defense department studies which the 
pentagon had tried to suppress but which leaked out anyway 
disputed those arguments and concluded that gay people perform 
their military duties as well as straight people 
nevertheless the military expels about 1400 people every year 
on charges of homosexuality according to the dods own estimates 
nan hunter who heads the lesbian and gay rights project of the 
american civil liberties union in new york predicted that campus 
protests would resonate all the way to washington 
in general i think the tide is turning in our favor she 
said i think the irrationality of the policy is becoming more 
clear even within the military 
but gay leaders are divided on how and when change might come 
sue hyde said she doesnt see the political courage in congress 
to pass even a symbolic amendment on the subject right now 
hunter said she does not see much evidence that the courts will 
confront the military either 
there is a longstanding tradition of deference to military on 
a whole range of issues she said pointing to the us supreme 
court ruling that it was constitutional to discharge an orthodox 
jew from the air force for wearing a yarmulke 
another option would be for president bush to change the policy 
by executive order much as president harry truman integrated the 
military in 1948 
but hyde said she believes change is still a long way off 
one of the big questions we always grapple with at our project 
meetings is what time is it meaning do we think the moment is 
really ripe for some kind of clear statement by congress she 
said 
if midnight is the goal of passing legislation i think its 
about 630 she said pm

do celebrities really care about spotted owls 
the ozone layer and rain forests or are they simply treehugging 
the cause of the week 
the evidence suggests that while numerous entertainers actor 
ed begley jr and singer jackson browne among them have adapted 
environmentally friendly living practices many others are slow to 
practice what they preach 
at a recent beverly hills benefit for the brazilian rain forest 
an array of hollywood celebrities superstars like jane fonda and 
agent michael ovitz were warned of the dangers of global warming 
and pollution 
the 1000 or so guests who dined on organic foods raised 12 
million for the environment most carpooled but the scores who 
didnt went for their limos which idled patiently stretching for 
blocks exhaust filled the evening air 
it was scarcely an isolated slip when hollywoods blueribbon 
environmental media association held its first organizational 
meeting at producer norman lears house ema founders arrived in 
mercedes bmws rollsroyces and other gasguzzlers 
producer ted field and wife susie who hosted the beverly hills 
rain forest benefit are longtime contributors to the natural 
resources defense council and charter members of ema they also 
have been known to fly to their spacious aspen home in a private 
jet 
its great celebrities are getting involved said bob 
hattoy a lobbyist for the sierra club but its not about doing 
lunch its about changing the way that we live lifestyles of the 
rich and famous are often lifestyles of the wasteful and 
indulgent 
the entertainment industry is symbolic of the values of 
everyone in our culture said bonnie reiss who founded the earth 
communications office eco seeks to add environmental themes to 
television shows and movies 
we have to get the rich and famous to truly examine their 
lifestyles reiss said 
environmentalism has yet to become hollywoods flavor of the 
month it has long been the land of excess and tradition does not 
die easily 
at an april news conference for abcs earth day special 
celebrity performers were ferried to the event in you guessed it 
limousines 
tom cruise has visited the amazonian rain forest and is a member 
of the eco so is his next movie about global warming not quite 
cruise stars next in days of thunder a movie about the hardly 
fuelefficient sport of auto racing

stretch of the southern california coastline her malibu neighbors 
have charged in a civil complaint 
newtonjohn and her husband have polluted the ocean with tons of 
dirt and sand removed during the construction of their 
6000squarefoot home overlooking the beach the complaint charges 
its blown way out of proportion newtonjohn said i had 
an environmental specialist look at the property i care about the 
environment 
diehard environmentalists dont wear furs or leather so how 
did people dress at the beverly hills rain forest benefit 
singer don henley who performed at the fundraiser said he had 
visited the cloakroom before coming on stage what did he see 
about a quarter of a million dollars worth of dead animals 
actor begley is one of the handful of personalities who has 
reordered his life to save the planet he rides a bicycle or takes 
the bus to work has a compost heap in his backyard and has 
installed 15watt bulbs in his house 
we dont need any more definition of environmental problems 
begley said we need action

actor said the electricity will come from solar cells and all 
water will be heated by the sun 
other leading earth activists include ted danson lloyd bridges 
hart bochner and melanie mayron 
reiss said that cruise organized a recycling program on the

a new securities rule designed to help big 
institutions investing more than 100 million also should benefit 
people across the country who never dabble on wall street 
regulators said 
the securities and exchange commissions rule 144a will make it 
easier for big banks insurance companies and pension funds to 
trade in unregistered stocks and bonds that may not be sold to the 
general public 
the sec requires companies offering stock to the public to 
register and make extensive disclosures about their ownership 
financing and other issues to protect american investors 
but the agency voted thursday to ease restrictions on trading 
privately offered securities which arent required to register and 
arent bound by disclosure regulations 
the 40 vote applies only to institutional investors that can 
prove they are big enough to handle the risk of dealing in 
unregistered securities but sec chairman richard c breeden said 
the measure would have a broader impact 
we hope this rule will have a beneficial effect even on people 
who dont buy securities at all breeden told reporters after the 
meeting 
to the extent that we can reduce the cost of us companies 
raising capital thatll benefit the people who work for those 
companies benefit the us economy broadly by helping make us more 
competitive 
breeden noted that some estimates put the market for privately 
placed securities at 1704 billion last year up from 158 
billion in 1980 
but two congressional leaders expressed concern about the 
possible development of a twotiered securities market for us 
investors one public and one private 
in a letter to breeden released after thursdays vote reps 
john d dingell dmich and edward j markey dmass asked the 
sec to report periodically to congress on the new rules impact 
dingell powerful head of the house energy and commerce 
committee and markey chairman of its finance committee which 
oversees the sec said they also were concerned that rule 144a may 
be beyond the scope of the powers of the commission because it 
allows for exemption from registration and thus disclosure 
requirements 
full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold 
across state lines is a key element of federal securities law they 
said 
the rule sets a 100 million threshold for participating in the 
private placement market to screen out unsophisticated investors 
who might not be able to make wise choices without the disclosures 
required on public offerings 
registered brokerdealers that either own and manage 10 million 
in securities or act as riskless principals for qualified 
institutional buyers are exempt from the 100 million requirement 
banks and savings and loans on the other hand must have a net 
worth of 25 million in addition to holding at least 100 million 
in securities 
the move is expected to lower the cost of raising money for us 
companies while wooing foreign corporations sometimes put off by 
onerous us disclosure requirements to raise capital here 
the sec also approved rule changes that would make the national 
association of securities dealers portal trading system the market 
place for such unregistered securities and clarify regulations 
governing foreign transactions of unregistered securities 
this is an historic day for the commission and its 
international program said breeden who has been pushing to make 
the us securities laws and markets more competitive with foreign 
markets 
these rules will have a profound and beneficial effect upon 
the ability of issuers to raise capital in the context of todays 
global marketplace and will enhance the competitiveness and 
efficiency of our domestic markets breeden said at the beginning 
of the threehour meeting before a standing room only crowd of more 
than 200

dayton hudson co said its winning 104 billion 
bid for marshall field amp co gave it a onceinalifetime 
opportunity to add one of the nations top retailing names to its 
midwest department store chain 
the minneapolis retailer beat out several bidders including a 
group of fields managers to win the 24store chain the company 
expects to complete the deal within two months 
the fact is that the dayton hudson bid was clearly superior in 
financial terms said arthur martinez senior vice president of 
batus inc the us subsidiary of fields current owner bat 
industries plc of britain 
dayton hudson chairman kenneth macke said the company had no 
plans to close any of fields stores in illinois texas ohio and 
wisconsin or make dramatic changes in strategy he also reiterated 
a commitment to continue the renovation of fields flagship store 
in chicagos loop 
we view this as a once in a lifetime opportunity macke said 
at a chicago news conference this is a great strategic fit for 
us 
analyst marcia raley of dain bosworth inc in minneapolis agreed 
i think its a very very strong strategic bid for them she 
said adding that the price appeared fair 
she said the deal stands out given the current distress in the 
retailing industry where the bankruptcy filing of federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp has raised fears of 
possible fire sales of store chains to raise cash 
theres been a lot of distressed merchandise that has been on 
the market raley said but marshall field is not a distressed 
operation its a very highquality operation 
the acquisition will be financed with internally generated funds 
and debt dayton hudson said the company does not plan an equity 
offering 
we will have absolutely no problem financing the deal said 
macke adding junk bonds would play no role in the purchase 
dayton hudsons stock fell 162 on the new york stock exchange 
to 6912 thursday 
philip miller fields chairman and chief executive and the man 
widely credited with helping turn fields around in the past five 
years said he was disappointed his management team had lost the 
bidding he said he was taking a waitandsee attitude for the 
moment 
we dont have any indication as to what daytonhudsons plans 
are miller said until we understand that were encouraging 
all our people to keep their powder dry 
while saying it was too early to discuss management changes 
macke and dayton hudson president stephen watson said they planned 
to meet with miller soon 
phil miller and his team have done an extraordinary job of 
building this company watson said 
others said to be in the bidding were may department stores co 
based in st louis and dillard department stores inc based in 
little rock ark 
bat put marshall field up for sale last year as part of a 
restructuring to defend itself against a hostile takeover bid by 
sir james goldsmith 
bat a british conglomerate with interests ranging from tobacco 
to financial services to retailing also is selling saks fifth 
avenue 
dayton hudsons department store division operates 37 stores 
known as either daytons or hudsons in seven midwestern states 
dayton hudson also owns the target chain one of the countrys 
biggest discounters with 408 stores in 32 states and mervyns a 
moderatepriced department store company with 221 stores in 15 
states 
in 1989 the department store division had an operating profit 
of 179 million on revenues of 18 billion the division employs

massachusetts lawmakers united to urge the 
bush administration to block a british conglomerates hostile 
takeover bid for norton co 
all 13 members of the states congressional delegation argued 
that the worcester mass abrasives maker is the leader in a field 
with defense and national security applications the lawmakers 
attended a news conference thursday at the capitol calling for 
federal action to stop the takeover attempt by btr plc 
norton is worcester said rep joseph early norton is the 
worlds leading manufacturer of abrasives and the largest employer 
in worcester 
the jobs of nortons 3100 employees would be jeopardized early 
said if a foreign owner decided to relocate or sell off nortons 
assets 
the delegation signed a joint letter to president bush urging 
him to step in and block the takeover early said the delegation 
would unveil legislation next week designed to make it easier for 
the president to act 
a law already on the books allows the president following an 
investigation to block a foreign takeover if it would threaten 
national security it has been invoked only once 
a btr spokesman who asked to remain anonymous said the 
existing law is inapplicable to btr 
btr and its subsidiaries in the us have sensitive and 
secretive clearance with the department of defense and other 
federal government agencies the spokesman said we believe 
those clearances are more sensitive than nortons 
the spokesman added that btr has no plans to move nortons 
headquarters or lay off workers 
the stance taken by the congressional delegation came a day 
after gov michael s dukakis signed a law that would prevent btr 
from wresting immediate control over the norton board 
the law requires massachusetts companies to elect directors over 
staggered terms with onethird being elected at a time that would 
prevent btr from replacing a majority of directors at nortons 
annual meeting next thursday 
norton tried to delay the meeting for two months but that move 
was blocked this week by the us court of appeals 
norton also has filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that 
state law prohibits btr from exercising any voting power at 
nortons shareholders meeting btr called nortons claim 
frivolous 
a key player in the effort to involve president bush in the 
norton battle is likely to be rep silvio conte the only 
republican in the delegation and the most senior member from 
massachusetts 
when a foreign company attempts to acquire an american company 
that has important industrial and technological capabilities the 
president is required to determine if the acquisition is in the 
best interests of our national security conte said 
nortons research projects manufacturing technologies and 
government contracts are of great importance to our national 
security and our industrial base

the man appointed to take control of eastern 
airlines from frank lorenzo told customers the troubled carrier was 
back on course after a bitter court fight for the cockpit 
i want to reassure the community of travel agents and the 
flying public that eastern is flying that it is flying safely and 
reliably and with an unparalleled level of service and 
enthusiasm said martin shugrue who was appointed trustee to run 
the airline 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp endorsed 
shugrue thursday as an able manager and promised to work with 
him to try to turn the airline around 
easterns machinists meanwhile celebrated lorenzos ouster and 
the prospect of an end to their 13month strike although they 
acknowledged they faced the prospect of still more hard times ahead 
there obviously is going to be tremendous sacrifices over the 
next year maybe two years or more to bring us back to normalcy 
but its not going to be done in the interest of frank 
lorenzo eastern machinist president charles bryan told about 100 
strikers at union headquarters near miami international airport 
after a fourday hearing in new york city that offered some 
harsh assessments of lorenzos stewardship us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland late wednesday granted the request of easterns 
unsecured creditors to appoint a trustee 
the creditors who are owed about 980 million were angered by 
easterns continuing losses and managements plans to slash debt 
repayments it was sweet news for the unions which had sought 
lorenzos departure since eastern filed for bankruptcy in march 
1989 five days into a crippling strike 
frank lorenzo has finally been exposed as the incompetent 
conniving greedy airline wrecker he is said machinists national 
president george kourpias 
shugrue is a former president of easterns sister carrier 
nonunion continental airlines he resigned from continental under 
pressure from lorenzo last year 
in an interview thursday lorenzo said the decision to let 
shugrue go was made by continentals board of directors he also 
said he wouldnt appeal shugrues appointment and pledged to work 
with him 
were going to help in all reasonable ways that we can 
lorenzo said marty is an able airline operator and hes going 
to have our support 
some analysts were encouraged by the naming of shugrue 
there arent a lot of messiahs standing on street corners 
said robert joedicke of shearson lehman hutton as far as 
understanding the industry and the relationships at texas air 
martys probably the best qualified man out there 
however the change at the top could prompt some eastern 
managers to leave lorenzo said 
its very difficult to project the future there may well be 
people leaving but were just going to have to see he said 
strikers however are eager to return 
if it was up to me id be back to work today said willie 
washington 47 who worked parttime as a substitute teacher during 
the strike 
our main goal now is getting back to work said frank ortis 
president of the machinists miami local but we will remain on 
strike until an agreement is reached weve worked too hard to make 
any moves now that wed regret later 
bryan said thursday night he had had only a brief introductory 
conversation with shugrue i hope to probably speak with him 
tomorrow get things started he added 
about 7500 of the 9000 machinists who walked off the job last 
year have said theyd go back to eastern ortis said about 2500 
workers could be brought back immediately following a strike 
settlement he added 
eastern shrank considerably during the strike billionaire 
donald trump bought its profitable northeast shuttle last year and 
american airlines has received tentative federal approval to 
acquire its latin american routes 
eastern spokesman bob hunter said the courts decision to 
release 80 million from escrow will keep the carrier in the air 
through mid1990 all reservation systems and flierincentive 
programs will remain in effect 
its still business as usual said hunter

the hottest investment in tokyo this year is cash 
with uncertainty reigning over japans stock and bond markets 
and us treasury bond prices tumbling many investment managers 
have sought shelter for their funds 
they are finding it in tokyos overnight money markets 
shortterm certificates of deposit and other interestbearing cash 
investments brokers and analysts say 
true this weeks rebound in the yen and in stock prices have 
led some analysts to believe the bear market might be over but 
they have not washed away the caution 
people are hiding in cash and cds from all of the unpleasant 
possibilities said william h brown president the investment 
advisory firm of scudder stevens and clark overseas 
the rate for unsecured overnight call loans the shortestterm 
cash investment has been above 7 percent recently thats less 
than a quarter percentage point below the yield on the benchmark 
10year japanese government bond 
whats more threemonth certificates of deposit have been 
quoted on the open market this week at more than 75 percent 
such high rates offer investors a rewarding hedge for their 
money while market turbulence continues 
who wants to be the first to stick out their neck by taking a 
stand when you can get those kinds of rates on the overnight 
calls said one dealer who spoke on the condition she not be 
identified 
if im 20 percent in cash and youre 40 percent in cash and 
the equities market crashes again who wins you do 
at county natwest securities analyst david threadgold remarked 
id be very surprised if a lot more money werent going into 
cash 
as a result japans money supply is growing far faster than the 
economy with its relatively stable prices justifies according to 
the bank of japan 
the broad money supply which includes shortterm instruments 
rose 117 percent from january through march the central bank 
reported this week in that period the stock market has lost a 
quarter of its value the yen has fallen more than 10 percent 
against the dollar and government bond prices have dropped to 
about 85 percent of their face value 
the central bank had forecast only a 9 percent expansion of the 
money supply for the quarter bank of japan officials said a major 
cause of the excessive growth was the merrygoround of 
funds slushing through cash instruments as investors darted in and 
out of various markets 
the cash glut shows no sign of abating the central bank now 
predicts 11 percent money growth for the marchmay quarter that 
could trigger a viscious spiral if fast money growth further erodes 
the yens value 
it means more inflation and that will result in higher 
interest rates whether the boj does anything about it or not 
brown said 
turbulence in the us bond market also is pushing money into 
japans cash markets a worsening of the us inflation outlook 
sent treasury bonds plunging this week driving the yield on the 
bellwether 30year bond up a quarter point this week to 884 
percent thursday 
some japanese investors are selling us treasuries long a 
staple of overseas investment for them and repatriating the money 
dealers said 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a currency dealer with daiwa bank said the 
yens rise this week resulted partley from life insurers selling 
treasury bonds and converting the proceeds into yen for shortterm 
investment in japan 
the popularity of cash investments indicates hesitation rather 
than any fundamental shift in strategy analysts said 
kinugasa said he thought the life insurers would probably 
reinvest in us treasury bonds at next months auction 
masahiro yamada general manager of overseas investments for 
nippon life insurance co possibly the biggest overseas investor 
of all said his firm will invest about the same amount abroad this 
year as last the only difference might be a stronger interest in 
western europe and canada he said 
marshall gittler of ubs philips and drew international said that 
if money continues to pour into shortterm investments and if 
japanese investors prove unenthusiastic at next months us 
treasury auction the yen is bound to rise 
that would take pressure off shortterm interest rates he said 
with rates falling its possible greed would exceed fear 
allowing the financial markets to rebound he said

an international task force is recommending a 
worldwide plan to uncover billions of dollars being hidden by 
narcotics dealers through intricate moneylaundering transactions 
a major element of the plan according to deputy treasury 
secretary john e robson is a requirement that financial 
institutions report questionable dealings by their customers 
specifically the task force recommends that as in the united 
states financial institutions must be able to report suspicious 
transactions to law enforcement in good faith free from fear of 
liability under secrecy laws robson said at a news conference 
thursday 
suspicious transaction reporting has proven to be very 
valuable to us law enforcement he added 
the 40 action recommendations were adopted by the financial 
action task force on money laundering on feb 7 in paris and 
announced thursday by the participating nations robson headed the 
us delegation on the panel 
the task force was established following last summers economic 
summit of the group of seven industrialized nations in paris to 
assess current antimoneylaundering efforts and to consider 
additional preventive efforts in this field 
in addition to the g7 nations of britain canada france west 
germany italy japan and the united states task force members 
included austria australia belgium luxembourg the netherlands 
spain sweden and switzerland and the european community 
president bush and other leaders of the g7 nations will 
consider the recommendations at their july economic summit in 
houston robson said many of the recommendations will require 
government approval elsewhere but most already conform with us 
laws he added 
in addition to the reporting requirement the task force 
recommendations include requirements that financial institutions 
adopt procedures to identify their customers and to maintain 
adequate records about customers and their transactions 
with moneylaundering cases being investigated months and even 
years after transactions take place adequate recordkeeping is 
essential robson said 
at the same time he added the recommendations reflect a 
recognition that law enforcement objectives need to be balanced 
with burdens on the financial system 
he contended the recommendations would not transform financial 
institutions into policemen 
the task force report said the united nations has estimated that 
drug trafficking proceeds worldwide totaled 300 billion in 1987 
drug trafficking and moneylaundering are inextricably 
connected and require an international solution robson said 
thus countries must link together to have strong domestic 
antimoney laundering programs for detection and prosecution and 
must cooperate freely with each other in the many cases that cross 
international borders 
the recommendations he added should establish a network of 
comprehensive programs to address moneylaundering and will 
facilitate greater cooperation in international investigations 
prosecutions and property seizures

two major canadian food companies maple leaf 
mills and canada packers plan to merge in a 1 billion deal 
designed in part to build their competitiveness in the us market 
it was announced today 
the british owner of maple leaf mills canadas biggest flour 
miller announced the plan for its subsidiary to join forces with 
what is the countrys largest public foodprocessing company 
hillsdown holdings plc will have a 56 percent stake in the 
combined company under the proposed transaction which must be 
approved by both companies stockholders their boards of directors 
back the proposal and are recommending that shareholders endorse it 
the merger must be approved by canadian regulators 
the combination of these two businesses creates a powerful new 
force in the north american food industry said harry solomon 
chairman of hillsdown the size scope and resources of the 
combined company enables it to take full advantage of the 
opportunities of the canadaus freetrade agreement 
maple leaf mills which was taken over by hillsdown in august 
1987 sells baked goods and poultry its brand name products 
include monarch flour and dempsters bread 
canada packers sells about 3 billion worth of food products 
each year which include the brand names york maple leaf and 
tenderflake it has been on the auction block since last october 
the new company will have combined sales of 4 billion and will 
be the largest publicly traded foodprocessing company in canada 
and one of the largest in north america hillsdown said in a news 
release 
under the deal hillsdown will exchange its entire interest in 
maple leaf mills for approximately 295 million newlyissued canada 
packers shares thats equivalent to a 45percent holding in the 
new company 
in addition hillsdown wants to buy 119 million worth of canada 
packers shares at 1650 per share to boost its holding in the new 
company to a majority share of 56 per cent 
canada packers shares ended trading on the toronto stock 
exchange on thursday at 1325 down 38 cents on the day 
the shares had soared to more than 20 after the company 
announced it was up for sale last year but then sagged when no 
offers for the company appeared analysts suggested the poor profit 
of canada packers meat division was discouraging potential buyers 
the family of william mclean and their associates who together 
own 29 per cent of canada packers have agreed to tender their 
shares to the offer hillsdown said 
canada packers employs about 12000 people while maple leaf 
mills employs 4000 there was no immediate indication whether jobs 
would be lost

it probably was inevitable that after the 
debtengorged 1980s one of the first scares of the 90s would be 
the fear that a shortage of credit would tilt the economy into 
recession 
after all with estimates of the thrift bailout now reaching as 
high as 500 billion and regulators keeping a closer eye on the 
books savings and loans wont be pushing out loans like the good 
old days 
banks also are feeling the pinch of bad loans as last weeks 
first quarter results showed clearly citicorp the nations 
biggest bank and biggest real estate lender reported a 56 percent 
drop in profits largely because of problems with loans for real 
estate and corporate takeovers 
the situation has raised anxiety on capitol hill responding to 
a question from a congressman worried about businesses at home 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said last week that a 
large majority of the nations top banks had become less 
willing to make construction or land development loans 
does that add up to a growthsnuffing credit crunch many 
analysts say not quite to the extent that some borrowers are 
getting turned down it may not be a bad thing 
brian j fabbri chief economist at midland montagu economics in 
new york says evidence seems clear that banks are extending less 
credit the amount of big certificates of deposit or interbank 
deposits banks buy the raw material for their lending actually 
has contracted over the past year he says 
one reason for the pullback is the growing effect of an 
international agreement on capital standards which will require 
banks to hold capital equal to 8 percent of their assets as a 
cushion against losses fabbri says the standards require more 
capital for riskier assets so banks are likely to cut back first 
on loans for smaller companies construction and takeovers he says 
i think were clearly at a point where were witnessing banks 
and thrifts reducing their extensions fabbri says the small 
the less creditworthy borrowers no doubt will have less wherewithal 
to expand 
but some other economists think the problem isnt a lack of 
money to lend its a shortage of borrowers 
big companies havent been borrowing much from banks in recent 
months because it has been far cheaper to raise money via 
commercial paper the market for corporate ious says kevin logan 
chief economist at swiss bank corp in new york thirtyday 
commercial paper costs just over 83 percent today compared with 
the bank prime rate of 10 percent 
logan concedes that some more speculative borrowers are facing a 
squeeze especially in areas like real estate but he says that 
only reflects a welcome return to more prudent lending after years 
of easy money 
drop the credit crunch headline he says make it read 
liquidity flood recedes 
edward yardeni director of economics at prudentialbache 
securities agrees 
we would be more concerned about the outlook for the economy 
if mr robert campeau was still buying department stores with other 
peoples money he wrote in a recent forecast 
we would be more concerned if mr alan bond was still 
purchasing van goghs on margin from sothebys we would be more 
concerned if mr michael milken was still in business 
tighter lending may hurt industries like construction and some 
manufacturing sectors fabbri says but it isnt likely to trigger 
a widespread recession thats because so much of the economy is 
based on service industries that dont have big credit needs he 
says 
stricter lending also may reduce pressure on the fed to raise 
interest rates to stem inflationary pressures that pressure heated 
up last week with reports showing that inflation ran at an 85 
percent rate in the first quarter an eightyear high while 
industrial production surged 
they dont have to raise interest rates to prevent credit 
extensionbecause its not happening anyway fabbri says of the 
fed 
this should eventually lessen inflation pressure and help 
reduce domestic demand for foreign goods

grain and soybean futures were slightly higher in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade amid talk that 
the soviet union bought at least one million metric tons of us 
corn in recent days 
but there was no official confirmation of a large soviet corn 
purchase and doubters said this mornings lower cash corn prices 
conflicted with the market rumors 
one analyst who believed the soviets bought corn said the lower 
cash prices reflected a big jump in farmer selling of corn after 
yesterdays moderate price rally 
the analyst william biedermann of allendale inc said there 
was pretty good confirmation that the soviets bought up to 2 
million metric tons of us corn 
the futures markets were further supported by a weekly 
agriculture department report showing strong export sales of us 
grains and soybeans biedermann said 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 370 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to cent higher wiith may at 277 a bushel oats were 
cent to cent higher with may at 158 a bushel soybeans were 
cent to 2 cents higher with may at 601 a bushel 
cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were 
mostly higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange

cubs baseball team television and radio stations in several major 
markets as well as other newspaper holdings 
operating profit for tribune cos newspaper publishing group 
declined 10 percent to 557 million from 616 million 
the company said the decrease was due to larger operating losses 
at the daily news resulting from weaker market conditions and costs 
related to contract negotiations with the newspapers 10 unions 
operating profit improved for the rest of the newspaper group 
largely due to stronger chicago tribune results and lower newsprint

first quarter last year with higher income at the companys 
television stations given as the reason for the increase

the alltime high for revenue was 304 billion in the second 
quarter of 1989 
the hiring freeze applies to all management or salaried

management centers has resulted in a reduction of

fashion is losing to flora and fauna with a 
house vote to ban strip mining the scenic beds of new mexicos 
jemez river for the pumice used in making stonewashed jeans 
a bill approved 3911 on thursday would put the 11 miles of 
the east fork of the river under the protection of the national 
wild and scenic rivers systems 
it also protects 205 miles of the pecos river from anyone who 
would permanently change the contours of the land such as in the 
stripmining of block pumice used by jeans manufacturers 
the section of the jemez river being protected features rugged 
canyons thick forests lush meadows and is a popular trout stream 
that also provides a habitat for the unique jemez mountain 
salamander 
the segment of the pecos river is known for granite canyons 
waterfalls and mountain meadows 
we had a legislative proposal to designate the rivers and at 
the same time we had a regulatory action going forth on a mining 
claim said rep bruce vento dminn who sponsored the bill 
with reps bill richardson dnm and steven schiff rnm 
in a very real sense the east fork of the jemez river was the 
nations first river threatened by stonewashed jeans richardson 
said 
vento said the mining would substantially change the surfaces 
around the river 
congress has a right to designate the river and prevent this 
type of misuse or abuse he said 
the mining claims in question within the proposed jemez river 
corridor are for pumice a material used in the manufacture of 
stonewashed jeans said rep nick joe rahall ii dwva 
for my part i would forego the jeans in order to preserve the 
environmental values of the river he said 
the bill would allow existing claimholders to mine land in the 
river corridors but maintains the land as federal property it 
would require that after mining claimholders return the area to 
its natural condition 
the measure would prohibit the sale of mining patents under the 
federal 1872 mining laws used by speculators looking for valuable 
minerals 
the block pumice found in rich quantities along the river is 
considered a valuable mineral because it is difficult to find its 
largest market is in the manufacturing of stonewashed blue jeans 
said a house interior committee staffer 
the bill is supported by the administration similar legislation 
already has passed the senate

167 in the same quarter last year 
revenues increased 173 percent to 149 billion from 127 
billion

mainly due to increased costs of crude oil which helped push cost 
of sales from 102 billion in the 1989 quarter to 132 billion 
this year

cents a share a year earlier

federal prosecutors and attorneys for financier 
michael milken continued negotiations over a possible settlement 
friday but no plea deal or new indictment was announced 
the government had promised to return a new broader set of 
charges by friday in the racketeering and fraud case against the 
former drexel burnham lambert inc junk bond executive 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
newberg were named in a 98count indictment handed up in march 1989 
alleging wideranging securities fraud violations including insider 
trading in takeover deals 
lawyers for milken the manhattan us attorneys office and the 
securities and exchange commission have been negotiating a possible 
plea bargain to avoid what was expected to be a long and costly 
trial 
in addition to the criminal counts milken still must settle 
civil allegations made by the sec in 1988 almost all the charges 
against milken are based on information supplied by former stock 
speculator ivan boesky who recently completed a prison term 
individuals close to the case said friday that talks were 
continuing a us attorneys office spokesman said no announcement 
was planned related to the case 
under the terms of a reported plea offer by the government 
milken would pay about 650 million in fines and plead guilty to 
six felonies the same terms that drexel agreed to in its 
settlement last year 
the government then would recommend that milken serve a maximum 
of five years in prison but the length of any term would be up to 
us disctrict judge kimba wood 
the wall street journal reported that the government gave milken 
a friday deadline to accept a plea bargain or face additional 
charges in an expanded indictment 
prosecutors have said for more than a year that a new indictment 
was planned milken pleaded innocent to the original charges and 
has said through his attorneys that he planned to fight the case in 
court 
the journal said negotiations also were over the extent to which 
milken would have to cooperate with the government in the future 
and the status in the case of lowell milken who worked as a lawyer 
at drexel and assistant to his brother 
milken resigned from drexel last june to set up his own 
consulting and investing firm drexel was forced to sever ties with 
milken under terms of its sec settlement drexel has been 
liquidating since its parent filed for bankruptcy court protection 
in february 
milken 43 is credited with reshaping corporate america in the 
1980s through the use of highyield bonds used to finance 
businesses and takeovers once considered one of the most powerful 
men in us finance milken was paid more than 1 billion from 
198387 including 550 million in 1987 alone

soybean futures prices closed moderately higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade while grain futures ended 
narrowly mixed 
the runup in soybean prices occurred despite a lack of 
significant supplyanddemand news largely reflecting efforts by 
speculators to push values above their recent highs 
after three days of strong gains this week price charts 
indicated the soybean marketwas ripe for a further advance said 
anne frick an analyst with prudential bache securities inc 
this was largely a technically inspired trade we made the 
days highs at midsession then the market backed off then we had 
a runup within the last 15 minutes to test the midsession highs 
she said 
the may soybean contract failed to surpass its midsession high 
of 606 a bushel but still managed a respectable gain of about 18 
cents on the week 
at the close wheat futures prices were 1 cents lower to 1 
cents higher with the contract for delivery in may at 370 a 
bushel corn was unchanged to 1 cents lower with may at 277 a

a major creditrating agencys decision to 
review the health of citicorps debts reflects the hard times the 
banking industry is enduring with weakening foreign and real estate 
loans 
several other insitutions already have had ratings on their 
securities downgraded as credit agencies express concern over the 
quality of the debt 
its hardly unusual said mara hildeman a senior analyst at 
moodys investor services inc which put some 31 billion of 
citicorps senior debt undeis month downgraded 28 billion of first 
chicago corp senior debt by one notch to a3 from a2 and last 
month marine midland banks inc saw moodys lower its rating on 
13 billion of its senior debt to baa1 from a3 
moodys review of citicorp the nations largest banking company 
with 230 billion in assets didnt send tremors through the 
banking community 
the industry is already shaken said mark gross a senior 
vice president at ibca inc the new york arm of the londonbased 
rating agency the review of citicorp just adds to it 
a lower credit rating could make it more expensive for citicorp 
to borrow money by prompting investors to demand higher interest to 
compensate for increased risk the ratings have no affect on 
customer deposits 
currently citicorp outranks many banking institutions its 
senior debt carries an a1 rating well above moodys current 
rating of some of chemical banks debt 
moodys characterizes a1 bonds as possessing many favorable 
investment attributes but elements may be present which 
suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future 
moodys pointed specifically to citicorps nonperforming loans 
in real estate and to developing countries as well as loans made in 
highly leveraged transactions like buyouts financed mainly with 
debt 
according to ibca 7 percent of citicorps real estate loans 
excluding residential mortgages were nonperforming in 1989 
though that figure does not rank citicorp at much greater risk than 
its peers analysts expect the amount of nonperforming real estate 
loans those on which payments are not being made to increase 
citicorp is fairly geographically diverse in its real estate 
portfolio but nevertheless given their location in new york they 
have a fairly large concentration of loans in the northeast 
where the economy is expected to deteriorate hildeman said 
about 5 percent of citicorps highly leveraged transactions were 
nonperforming the fifthworst showing in ibcas review of 50 major 
banks but citicorp has 78 billion in highly leveraged loans 
outstanding roughly twice as much as the next biggest player 
in comparison ibca said that in 1989 chase manhattan bank had 
45 billion in outstanding highly leveraged debt 11 percent of 
which was nonperforming 
in terms of capital ratios in which assets are adjusted to 
reflect total risk to the corporation citicorp barely met the 
governments minimum 4 percent requirement with a ratio of 404 
percent citicorp ranked 49th out of 51 institutions although the 
bank is in the process of raising its capital ratios 
once a company is under review moodys likes to act quickly 
before speculation runs rampant 
i dont see how they can downgrade citicorp very much 
said anthony naylor a senior vice president of fixedincome 
securities at rodman amp renshaw inc and one notch isnt going to 
make a whole lot of difference citicorp isnt in the credit 
squeeze that some regional banks are its so diversified he 
said 
if moodys takes action it might encourage citicorp 
management to be more quick in terms of what they do to remedy the 
situation said richard mueller an analyst at duff amp phelps in 
chicago 
no bank likes to see any downgrading but it brings more 
sharply into focus the issues management has to deal with he 
said 
earlier this week citicorp reported its firstquarter earnings 
declined 56 percent mainly because of problems with weakening real 
estate loans

the cosmetics company said friday that tokyobased friends of 
freesia co ltd had notified avon that it will not close on the 
450 million deal by april 27 the rescheduled closing date 
the japanese company had sought to postpone the closing again 
this time until late june the original closing date of march 30 
already had been put off for a month at freesias request avon 
said it turned down the second request and plans to pursue other 
options 
avon still intends to sell all or part of its 60 percent stake 
in avon japan the company said it will resume discussions with 
other interested japanese investors after april 27 
we are confident we will sell our interest in avon japan this 
year avon spokesman john cox said 
he said after april 27 avon plans to collect the 63 million 
held in escrow while the deal was pending 
avon did not say why freesia balked at completing the deal cox 
said avon japans shares have not suffered a significant price 
erosion during this years slump on the tokyo stock exchange 
the deal between avon and freesia which has interests in direct 
mail marketing land development as well as hotel and hospital 
management was announced feb 21 
freesia and the companys president veji sasaki had agreed to 
pay 408 million at the closing which included 338 million in 
cash and 70 million in advance royalties on future sales another 
42 million in advance royalties was to be paid 18 months after the 
transaction was completed 
avon the worlds biggest direct seller of beauty products made 
a decision to withdraw from japan after concluding that it would be 
too costly to try to prosper there an intensely competitive 
environment in which avon has had little success expanding its 
market share 
proceeds from the sale of the japanese stake will be used to 
reduce avons debt the company has said in the past

copper futures prices fell sharply friday on new yorks 
commodity exchange amid improved supply prospects and perceptions 
that demand for the metal is entering a seasonal decline 
on other commodity markets precious metals were mixed coffee 
futures climbed energy futures were mixed livestock and meat 
futures were mixed and soybeans advanced while grain futures were 
mixed 
copper futures settled 15 cents to 405 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in april down 15 cents at 1185 a pound and 
the mostactive may contract off 405 cents at 11255 
analysts attributed much of the selling to speculation that 
mondays weekly london metal exchange stocks report will show a 
rise of as much as 15000 metric tons in supplies of copper 
certified as deliverable on the exchange 
the expectation of larger london stocks reflects a general 
perception that copper demand is declining fabricators having 
already filled most of their needs ahead of the summertime 
construction season 
analysts said further selling was prompted by speculation that a 
fiveweek strike against the southern peru copper corp may be 
nearing a settlement after workers at a stateowned peruvian copper 
mine returned to work this past week both strikes began on march 
12 
people are thinking how long can these guys stay out when 
this other group went back to work said steve platt a metals 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
gold futures edged lower on the commodity exchange while silver 
futures advanced moderately 
gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with april at 37660 a 
troy ounce silver was 3 cents to 37 cents higher with may at 
5108 a troy ounce 
on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange coffee futures 
were boosted by trade buying amid reports of cooler weather moving 
toward brazil the worlds largest coffee producer 
coffee settled 157 cents to 244 cents higher with may at 9561 
cents a pound 
oil futures had a mixed day on the new york mercantile exchange 
reflecting uncertainty about what action the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries might take to prop up prices at its 
may 2 emergency meeting 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents lower to 4 
cents higher with may at 1795 a barrel heating oil was 59 cent 
lower to 14 cent higher with may at 5294 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 15 cent to 32 cent higher with may at 6193 cents a 
gallon 
livestock and meat futures finished mixed ahead of three 
agriculture department reports that were interpreted as neutral to 
bearish for cattle futures and bullish for pork bellies 
the usdas monthly and quarterly cattleonfeed reports showed a 
largerthanexpected number of cattle placed on feedlots in the 
first quarter which traders initally perceived as bearish for 
cattle futures 
but analysts noted the june live cattle futures contract is 
already trading nearly 7 cents below the cash market indicating 
the futures market has discounted the likelihood of greater 
supplies this summer 
i would say youre going to get a negative response to the 
report on balance but i think that if the market drops 50 or 75 
points there will be a lot of support to buy the futures said 
chuck levitt senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
in its monthly coldstorage report the usdas tally of pork 
bellies in the nations commercial freezers was below market 
expectations 
the april live cattle cattle contract expired at noon at 80 
cents a pound the april hog contract expired at 5730 cents a 
pound

phil bakes resigned friday as president and chief 
executive officer of eastern airlines as a courtappointed trustee 
replaced parent texas air corp as head of the airline 
bakes a longtime cohort of texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
urged eastern employees to support trustee martin shugrue who was 
appointed wednesday by us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
the judge appointed shugrue over the opposition of eastern and 
texas air after the airlines unsecured creditors argued that 
present management appeared unable to halt the companys financial 
deterioration 
i know you will give marty the complete support and commitment 
you afforded me i have been privileged and inspired to be 
associated with you said bakes in a statement issued to 
easterns employees 
the last 12 months in particular have been the most 
satisfying of my life because of your accomplishments i am 
confident you will continue to succeed bakes said 
eastern has lost 12 billion since machinists pilots and 
flight attendants walked off their jobs in march 1989 prompting 
the airline to seek protection from its creditors under chapter 11 
of the bankruptcy code 
lorenzo has denied reports that he had offered bakes 
resignation to creditors this past week in exchange for withdrawing 
their request for a trustee 
bakes announcement came hours after shugrue met friday morning 
with easterns officers company spokeswoman karen ceremsak said 
bakes resignation was freely offered and was not part of a deal 
with creditors 
ms ceremsak said no other resignations were expected 
bakes joined texas air in 1980 and became president of easterns 
sister carrier nonunion continental airlines before leaving to 
run eastern in october 1986 
under bakes eastern suffered continued financial losses 
including 8523 million in 1989 and labor turmoil culminating in 
the strike and bankruptcy filing 
during bankruptcy court hearings this past week bakes warned 
that the appointment of a trustee could make it tougher for eastern 
to improve its business by further shaking the confidence of 
consumers and travel agents he also warned that such a move could 
spark departures by members of eastern management causing 
additional problems 
shugrue also has had close ties to texas air serving as 
president of continental until lorenzo pressured him to resign in 
february 1989 before that he had been a highranking executive at 
pan am corp

martin shugrue is a rare bird in the airline 
industry an executive who started as a pilot 
as the new trustee for eastern airlines he faces a challenge in 
trying to pilot the carrier out of its financial tailspin 
shugrue picks up many of the problems that saddled frank 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp who was 
stripped of his control over eastern by a federal bankruptcy judge 
on wednesday 
shugrue must find ways to drum up more revenue restore consumer 
confidence in the airline and hammer out new labor contracts with 
pilots flight attendants and stillstriking machinists 
the task was complicated by the resignation friday of phil 
bakes easterns president and chief executive and the companys 
top officer after lorenzo 
hes going to be under tremendous pressure to show progress 
very quickly raymond neidl an analyst at dillon read amp co 
said friday hes probably got one of the toughest jobs in the 
airline business right now 
easterns unsecured creditors succeeded in persuading the 
bankruptcy judge burton r lifland to take the drastic step of 
appointing a trustee but the creditors who are owed around 980 
million also could become impatient with shugrue very quickly 
neidl said 
shugrue 49 moved quickly friday to soothe jangled nerves in a 
meeting at easterns miami headquarters he told top executives 
this trustee is not a liquidator according to eastern 
spokesman robin matell who attended the session 
in the course of the fourday hearing in bankruptcy court 
eastern officials had warned that appointment of a trustee would 
spark the resignations of top managers and eventually lead to the 
airlines liquidation 
shortly after shugrue met with the executives eastern announced 
the resignation of bakes its president and chief executive since 
october 1986 before being relieved of control lorenzo had served 
as easterns chairman 
jose smith easterns senior vice president of operations 
resigned earlier in the week 
in an era when aviators have long since been replaced by 
businessmen in most airline boardrooms shugrue knows the business 
from the ground up he worked his way through the ranks at pan am 
corp starting as a pilot in 1968 and becoming vice chairman in 
1984 
he added the title of chief operating officer a year later at 
financially troubled pan am as no 2 to thenchairman c edward 
acker shugrue developed a reputation for efficiency fairness and 
good relations with labor 
he was the bridge between toplevel management and the 
workers said william f genoese director of the teamsters 
airline division and a longtime adversary of pan ams management 
he never beat up on the workers 
shugrue and acker clashed in late 1987 over a proposed merger of 
pan american world airways the companys main airline business 
with braniff inc shugrue had favored keeping pan am intact while 
acker had pushed for a deal with braniff now reorganizing under 
bankruptcy court protection 
the two were ousted in a management shuffle at pan am in january 
1988 a few months later lorenzo hired shugrue as president of 
continental airlines easterns nonunion sister carrier 
shugrue resigned under pressure in february 1989 after lorenzo 
brought in former twa executive joseph corr over shugrue as 
continentals chairman and chief executive shugrue became 
continentals sixth former president in as many years 
marty is an able airline operator lorenzo said thursday in 
an interview and hes going to have our support 
so far at least shugrue also seems to have the support of 
easterns unions who bitterly fought lorenzo officials of the 
machinists union indicated thursday they could negotiate a 
backtowork pact with deep concessions 
eastern also must reach longterm contract agreements with its 
pilots and flight attendants

recommendations designed to establish 
worldwide controls against laundering of hundreds of billions of 
dollars by drug dealers were announced thursday by an international 
task force 
the 40 action recommendations should establish a network 
of comprehensive programs to address money laundering and will 
facilitate greater cooperation in international investigations 
prosecutions and property seizures deputy treasury secretary 
john e robson told reporters 
the recommendations were adopted by the financial action task 
force on money laundering last feb 7 in paris and announced 
simultaneously thursday by the participating nations robson headed 
the us delegation on the panel 
the task force was established following last summers economic 
summit of the group of seven nations in paris to assess current 
antimoney laundering efforts and to consider additional 
preventive efforts in this field 
in addition to the g7 nations of britain canada france 
germany italy japan and the united states other task force 
members included austria australia belgium luxembourg the 
netherlands spain sweden and switzerland and the european 
community 
robson said the recommendations will be on the agenda at the 
july meeting of the g7 nations that president bush will host 
houston 
the task force report noted that the united nations estimated 
drug trafficking proceeds worldwide at 300 billion in 1987 money 
traffickers use a complex web of financial transactions to hide the 
money in their accounts 
the financial action task force was born of the ideas that 
narcotics trafficking and money laundering are inextricably 
connected and that money laundering is an international problem 
that requires an international solution robson said 
countries must link together to have strong domestic 
antimoney laundering programs for detection and prosecution and 
must cooperate freely with each other in the many cases that cross 
international borders he said 
central to the recommendations is that financial institutions 
must be the first line of defense by reporting suspicious dealings 
by their customers robson said 
specifically the task force recommends that as in the united 
states financial institutions must be able to report suspicious 
transactions to law enforcement in good faith free from fear of 
liability under secrecy laws he said 
suspicious transaction reporting has proven to be vary 
valuable to us law enforcement he added 
robson said other recommendations include requirements that 
financial institutions have procedures to identify their customers 
and maintain adequate records about customers and their 
transactions 
in most cases current us laws and regulations are in 
conformance with the recommendations robson said 
robson said the announcement of the recommendations was the 
starting point of missionary efforts to attract support 
throughout the international community

a swiss apparel maker charged in a 42 million 
countersuit friday that the cocacola co lured it into a deadend 
deal to manufacture a line of clothing with the famous coke logo 
the countersuit filed in us district court in atlanta 
alleges that coke withheld information that the market for the 
clothing had gone flat because of a fiasco involving a previous 
licensee 
spira textile investments sa also contends that actions by the 
soft drink maker have prevented it from making deadlines for the 
spring and summer season for the coke clothing line which helped 
spark the late1980s fad of corporate logo attire 
a cocacola spokesman branded the allegations in the countersuit 
laughable 
stis countersuit is in response to a federal suit filed in 
february by cocacola charging breach of contract by the clothing 
maker last october coke nullified its licensing agreement with 
spira 
coke has accused the porrentrury switzerland company and two 
codefendants of defaulting on 1 million in licensing fee payments 
and failing to provide the soft drink maker with certain financial 
reports 
the 1 million represented the first of several payments that 
were to total 10 million and serve as the nonrefundable portion 
of a 23 million licensing fee that would have given sti the right 
to make market and sell cocacola clothing through 1993 according 
to the coke suit 
coke said in its suit it has reason to believe that 
defendant sti will not pay the remaining 9 million of the 
nonrefundable licensing fee due during 1990 
sti admits in its countersuit that it has failed to pay 
cocacola the licensing fees but paints itself as the victim of a 
dupe whereby coke used the company in an attempt to recover losses 
from a failed deal with murjani international ltd which made the 
clothing line from 1984 until last year 
murjanis initial success with its line of sweatshirts 
sportswear and childrens clothes emblazoned with the cocacola 
logo spawned an outpouring of garments by other manufacturers 
featuring the insignias of some of americas bestknown consumer 
products 
but cokes relationship with murjani soured and the licensing 
agreement was terminated last summer 
murjani also mass merchandised lowpriced inferior goods that 
left a negative impression of coke apparel within conventional 
trade channels sti said 
sti contends in its countersuit that coke never informed the 
company of the extent of the problems with murjani 
the murjani relationship turned out to be a very bad 
experience for cocacola financially and otherwise said sti 
attorney john r lowery they were looking to find someone to 
step into that bad situation 
cocacola spokesman mark preisinger said stis allegations 
contained such wanton disregard for the facts as to be laughable 
the countersuit is without merit 
the countersuit said alhough cocacola originally suggested that 
sti replace murjani as the clothing licensee coke later refused to 
publicize its new agreement with spira apparently in order to 
stem the flow of negative publicity from the murjani situation 
coke also blocked the clothing manufacturers attempts to 
arrange distribution arrangements with stores such as jc penney 
sears k mart and montgomery ward the countersuit said 
spira contends that coke has caused the company to lose 7 
million in business which the countersuit seeks in damages along 
with 35 million in punitive damages and attorneys fees

home to regain market share competitors have chewed away the 
worlds largest cereal maker said friday 
kellogg reported its firstquarter profit dropped 396 percent 
from firstquarter 1989 earnings that were boosted by a tax 
accounting change

months trying to rebuild the market lead that analysts said 
narrowed as the company lagged in meeting demand for oat bran 
products last year 
lamothe said the company also may be nearing a decision in talks 
it has carried on for two years on a possible cerealmaking venture 
in the soviet union 
if the project moves forward it would take about two years to 
build a plant to manufacture readytoeat cereal from soviet grain 
for sale in the soviet union he said 
he also said kelloggs plant in bremen west germany has 
capacity to produce cereal for sale in east germany should that 
market open up soon

130 
last year the company reported its first annual earnings 
decline in 37 years as its 1989 profit fell 21 percent to 4702 
million 
kellogg said firstquarter 1990 profits dropped to 963 
million or 79 cents a share from 1595 million or 130 a 
share in januarymarch 1989 
without an incometax accounting change first quarter 1989 
earnings would have been 1114 million or 91 cents a share and 
1990 firstquarter profits were down 136 percent from that figure 
the company said 
net sales for the quarter were 121 billion up 66 percent 
from 113 billion a year earlier the company said 
although firstquarter earnings declined our overall results 
are in line with our longterm plan to enhance our market position 
in the united states and achieve consistent worldwide business

massachusetts lawmakers in a show of unity 
urged the bush administration thursday to block a hostile takeover 
of norton co of worcester mass a maker of industrial abrasives 
arguing that norton is the leader in a field with defense and 
national security applications all 13 members of the states 
congressional delegation attended a news conference at the capitol 
calling for federal action against the proposed takeover by great 
britains btr plc 
norton is worcester said us rep joseph early dmass 
norton is the worlds leading manufacturer of abrasives and the 
largest employer in worcester 
the 3100 norton employees would see their jobs jeopardized 
early said if a foreign owner decided to relocate or sell off 
nortons assets such as plant equipment and patents 
the delegation members signed a joint letter to president bush 
urging him to step in and block the takeover early said the 
delegation would unveil legislation next week designed to make it 
easier for the president to stop bid 
a law already on the books allows the president following an 
investigation to block a foreign takeover if it would threaten 
national security but it has only been invoked once 
a btr spokesman who asked to remain anonymous said the 
existing law is inapplicable to btr 
btr and its subsidiaries in the us have sensitive and 
secretive clearance with the department of defense and other 
federal government agencies the spokesman said we believe 
those clearances are more sensitive than nortons 
the btr spokesman added that btr has no plans to move the norton 
headquarters or lay off workers 
the stance taken by the congressional delegation came a day 
after gov michael s dukakis signed a law that would prevent btr 
from wresting immediate control over the norton board 
the law requires massachusetts companies to elect directors over 
staggered terms with onethird being elected at a time that would 
prevent btr from replacing a majority of directors at the norton 
annual meeting scheduled for next thursday 
norton tried to delay the meeting for two months but that move 
was blocked this week by the us court of appeals 
norton also has filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that 
state law prohibits btr from exercising any voting power at 
nortons shareholders meeting btr called nortons claim 
frivolous 
a key player in the effort to involve president bush in the 
norton battle is likely to be us rep silvio conte the only 
republican in the delegation and the most senior member from 
massachusetts 
when a foreign company attempts to acquire an american company 
that has important industrial and technological capabilities the 
president is required to determine if the acquisition is in the 
best interests of our national security conte said nortons 
research projects manufacturing technologies and government 
contracts are of great importance to our national security and our 
industrial base

higher while pnc financial corp another major banking company 
posted a 397 percent profit decline due to provisions for possible 
loan losses 
bankamerica the san franciscobased parent of bank of america 
earned 278 million in the three months ended march 31 up 1 
percent from 275 million in 1989s first quarter 
the company noted that during the quarter it received no 
interest payments on loans to brazil which has enacted a severe 
economic austerity plan to cool inflation while brazilian interest 
increased net income in the yearearlier period by 38 million 
earnings per share fell to 123 in this years first quarter 
from 138 a year earlier the number of common shares outstanding

pittsburghbased pnc said its net income dropped to 745 
million or 77 cents per share from 1236 million or 129 per 
share in the first quarter of 1989 
the drop reflected a 1089 million provision for possible

regional real estate markets and the slowing national economy pnc 
said 
about 364 million was set aside for possible loan losses in 
the same quarter of 1989

million up from 5813 million as of dec 31

the upjohn co has agreed to pay 18 
million to settle a federal lawsuit stemming from more than 1000 
waste water discharge permit violations at the companys north 
haven fine chemicals plant two environmental groups announced 
thursday 
upjohn will contribute just over 12 million to the new haven 
foundation to establish a trust fund for projects beneficial to the 
quinnipiac river new haven harbor and their watersheds the groups 
said 
the remainder of the settlement will be used to cover the legal 
costs incurred by the connecticut fund for the environment and the 
natural resources defense council said kate robinson senior staff 
attorney for cfe 
robinson said she believed it was the largest pollution penalty 
ever paid for permit violations in connecticut 
the two environmental groups sued upjohn in 1985 under a 
citizens suit provision of the federal clean water act for 
exceeding limits on the toxic materials it could discharge into the 
quinnipiac river 
a federal judge in hartford ruled in 1987 that upjohn was liable 
for more than 1000 permit violations and a hearing to determine 
the fine was held in late december and early january a settlement 
was reached then but details had to be worked out robinson said 
by settling the case the environmental groups were able to make 
sure the money paid by upjohn is used to help clean up the 
quinnipiac robinson said 
had the court imposed a penalty the money would have gone to 
the federal treasury she said 
upjohn had argued that it had done all that was possible to 
treat its industrial waste and that it viewed permit standards 
established in 1983 as goals and not enforceable limits 
we regret the misunderstanding which followed our installation 
of what was at the time the best available technology to control 
our waste water discharges pete mass a spokesman at upjohns 
kalamazoo mich headquarters said thursday 
on the settlement he said we are pleased that this is not 
only finished but that most of the proceeds will be used for such a 
worthy cause as improving the quinnipiac river 
upjohn announced in december its plan to phase out operations at 
the north haven plant over three years

norton co fighting a hostile 16 billion 
takeover bid disclosed friday it had received a better buyout 
offer but did not accept the proposal because the company was 
trying to line up investors who would buy a minority stake in the 
company 
nortons disclosure in documents filed with the securities and 
exchange commission came less than a week before the companys 
annual meeting btr plc a british conglomerate plans to wage a 
proxy fight at the meeting to place its own directors on the norton 
board 
norton last month rejected a 75pershare offer from btr and 
in the meantime norton has been looking for other investors 
in the federal documents norton said one party that it did not 
identify indicated it was interested in acquiring the company at a 
higher price 
but norton continued no negotiation of such transaction has 
taken place norton said it advised the suitor that the company 
is continuing to look for investors who would buy a minority 
interest 
other third parties also have shown interest in buying some of 
nortons business units but no decision has been made the company 
said 
we find nortons announcement today encouraging because maybe 
it will cause the norton board to begin focusing on shareholder 
value btr said in a statement 
it said the announcement makes the proxy contest that we are 
undertaking that much more critical to shareholders who want to 
maximize the value of their investment 
analysts said the disclosure added confusion to the takeover 
battle as the two sides prepare for next thursdays annual meeting 
in worcester 
one of nortons biggest weapons is a new state law that would 
prevent btr from taking immediate control over the norton board 
but analysts said friday that this legislation could also bring a 
year of hardship for the company a leading maker of abrasives 
the law zoomed through the legislature this week and was signed 
by gov michael s dukakis taking immediate effect it permits a 
massachusetts corporation to elect only onethird of its directors 
at a time unless the company opts out of the requirement 
btr says it will not back down despite the state law which 
creates a likely scenario that the norton board will have a 
minority bloc of dissident directors for at least a year 
its going to be a hell of a first meeting said john lubin 
a professor of management at the wharton school of the university 
of pennsylvania 
suddenly you bring in a whole bunch of guys who are against 
you its going to be difficult he said 
norton representatives concede that onethird of the companys 
directors probably will be voted out at the meeting so while the 
norton board would retain its majority and have a year to plan its 
options the dissident directors would sit in on the discussions 
and gain insight to the strategy analysts said they also would 
have more opportunities to persuade the majority toward btrs 
position 
basically the question is are those people going to get 
together and do whats best for the shareholders or get themselves 
in a political donnybrook and have a standoff for a year said 
jay lorsch a harvard business school professor 
if things become polarized its going to be a very difficult 
year he said i dont think it bodes well for anybody 
since the directors are liable for their decisions the minority 
bloc can challenge the majoritys actions using a threat of 
shareholder lawsuits observers said 
in fact a flurry of lawsuits would be expected if the majority 
directors took any more steps to protect norton from the takeover 
i dont think anybody will win except the lawyers said eli 
lustgarten an analyst at paine webbe its not a pleasant 
situation 
a source close to norton who asked not to be named said the 
board is aware of the potential difficulties but is determined to 
fight btr 
the real question is who cracks first the source said 
the bickering between the directors also could harm the 
companys longterm performance lubin said 
the good boards work together he said the board of 
directors should be trying to help the company move forward 
strategically 
its obvious there would be a temporary instability he 
said i think theres a danger norton will drift 
one uncertainty about next weeks meeting was a lawsuit filed by 
norton that claims a mechanism in state law prevents btr from 
exercising any voting power btr said the claim was meritless and 
the suit has been considered a long shot

million and use the money to improve and expand its media 
operations 
gte will acquire the systems in north carolina south carolina 
georgia and virginia expanding its potential customer base by 35 
million to more than 26 million the stamfordbased 
telecommunications company said 
the journal co based in providence ri and owner of the 
providence journal the evening bulletin and the providence sunday 
journal said the sale will allow the company to concentrate on its 
media operations which include four television stations and a 
cable system in five states it said it will use the funds to 
acquire more papers and stations and expand the cable system 
some people like golf and others like tennis well our area 
of expertise and comfort is in the media we like it and we want to 
stay there said jack c clifford vice president of the 
companys broadcasting and cable operations 
he said the company has been negotiating to buy a group of 
weekly newspapers owned by dci publishing inc of alexandria va 
he would not identify any television stations saying negotiations 
have not progressed to the point where he can discuss them 
the deal which is subject to regulatory approval will allow 
both gte and the journal co to concentrate on their core 
businesses gte which operates in 46 states and 41 countries had 
174 billion in sales last year from its telecommunications 
lighting and precision materials companies 
weve really in the last three years pulled into those three 
core businesses said spokesman tony hamilton this is a 
particularly good acquisition because its an area where we do not 
have any cellular right now and basically its an area of 
contiguous operations that will be fairly easy to manage 
the purchase will be gtes largest since it bought us sprint for 
750 million in 1983 he said 
the journal which began publishing in 1820 entered the cable 
business in 1969 and the television business in 1984 it now owns

colony communications the cable operation with 300000 subscribers 
in rhode island massachusetts new york california and florida 
the company entered the cellular business in raleigh nc in 
1985 its first nonmedia venture 
we thought there was a lot of synergism with our cable 
operations clifford said 
but were fundamentally a media company and with the 
escalating values that were being promoted in cellular and our own 
background in media it just really wasnt our game he said 
like every company every individual we chose to examine the 
marketplace to see if we could convert a very valuable asset into 
another very valuable asset that is more like what we want to do 
the journal co announced in january it was looking for buyers 
and gte was one of 10 companies that made serious offers clifford 
said 
the providence journal and evening bulletin have daily 
circulation of about 200000 the sunday journal has circulation of 
about 300000

a bankruptcy reorganization plan for 
public service company of new hampshire was confirmed friday in 
federal court two years after the states largest utility filed 
for bankruptcy protection 
us bankruptcy judge james yacos confirmed the 23 billion 
northeast utilities takeover plan for public service a week after 
confirmation hearings on the plan were completed 
northeast based in berlin conn was one of four bidders 
including public service itself for the utility public service 
was crippled by losses from the delayed seabrook nuclear power 
plant in which it was a major investor when it sought bankruptcy 
court protection in january 1988 
the takeover plan calling for seven annual 55 electricity rate 
increases won the support of creditors shareholders and the state 
in november beating out united illuminating co of connecticut 
and new england electric system of massachusetts 
the state public utilities commission is holding hearings on the 
complicated rate agreement this month 
the rate agreement is fair reasonable consistent with public 
policy and the public interest and is in the best interests of 
creditors and equity security holders yacos said 
yacos confirmation means northeast can begin managing public 
service on april 30 and until the acquisition formally is 
completed said public service spokesman nick ashooh 
the takeover requires state and federal regulatory approvals 
which utility officials do not expect until the spring of 1991 
until then an interim company run by northeast and owned by 
public services creditors and stockholders will control the 
utility

scecorps chairman accused state 
attorney general john van de kamp of angling for votes by opposing 
the companys proposed 25 billion buyout of san diego gas amp 
electric co 
the merger of san diego gas with scecorps southern california 
edison subsidiary would create the nations largest investorowned 
utility but it faces strong opposition in san diego 
shareholders of both companies approved it a year ago and it is 
now tied up in regulatory hearings edison maintains the merger 
will produce 17 billion in savings to be passed on to customers 
in the form of lower rates 
van de kamp who is seeking the democratic nomination for 
governor has opposed the merger claiming it would be 
anticompetitive 
at scecorps annual meeting thursday a shareholder suggested 
van de kamps motives were political causing chairman howard allen 
to erupt in anger 
you said it i didnt but i agree with you 100 percent 
said allen 
im just so disgusted with it i thought he had a higher sense 
of intellectual honesty and competence and ill tell you it really 
infuriated me as you can tell 
so angry was allen that another shareholder stepped up to the 
microphone to chastise him 
you have a duty to hold your temper back the shareholder 
said 
allen retorted youre entitled to your opinion and im 
entitled to mine and i thank you very much 
the merger is the subject of federal hearings under way in 
washington and also needs approval by the state public utilities 
commission which has scheduled hearings later this year 
allen said he was confident the deal would be approved by the 
end of the year but he acknowledged opposition from some san diego 
residents fearful of losing a utility with local headquarters 
the merger calls for scecorp to trade stock for sdgampe rather 
than pay cash the combined company would have 48 million 
customers 
scecorp contends the merger will result in far lower rates for 
utility users throughout its area but the staff of the puc has 
opposed the merger saying there is no guarantee rates would be 
lower after 1993 edison spokesmen have said they believe the deal 
can be modified to placate those critics 
scecorp also announced that first quarter profits rose 46 
percent to 172 million or 79 cents a share from 118 million or 
54 cents a share a year earlier revenue rose 2 percent to 156 
billion from 153 billion 
allen said the higher profits were due almost entirely to a puc 
decision shifting some earnings to the first second and fourth 
quarters from the third quarter without affecting annual earnings

president carlos salinas de gortari who has 
made economic liberalization one of the hallmarks of his 
administration has opened up the newsprint monopoly to competition 
productora e importadora de papel sa known as pipsa has had 
the monopoly on newsprint production and importation since its 
founding in 1935 
by controlling the supply of newsprint and extending credit on 
pipsa bills the government has been able to muzzle its enemies by 
controlling the supply of newsprint and credit the government has 
at times withheld newsprint supplies from critics 
but that control ends friday when anybody can produce or import 
newsprint 
salinas announced the change thursday in remarks at a special 
meeting of pipsas board of directors made up of newspaper 
publishers at the presidential palace 
the president said competition would make pipsa more efficient 
and fortify press freedom 
a stronger pipsa will strengthen our democracy salinas said 
although they now have the freedom to purchase newsprint from 
other suppliers publishers said they were unsure whether they 
would switch right away 
when salinas proposed last year that pipsa be liquidaded 
publishers howled in protest pipsa for many years allowed 
cashshort buyers to pay when they were able and the company was a 
perennial moneyloser 
but last year pipsa turned around and made nearly 12 million 
in profits 
mexico which manufactured 400000 tons of newsprint last year 
is the worlds 11thlargest producer but domestic production cant 
keep up with demand last year mexican publishers bought 430000 
tons of newsprint 
interior minister fernando gutierrez barrios said that after 
turning a profit pipsa is an efficient and productive public 
company which guarantees the existence of a free and pluralistic 
press that mexican society requires 
the head of pipsa said salinas announcement opens the options 
for newspapers 
rene villareal the organizations director general said he 
didnt know whether newsprint prices would rise or fall 
like anything the market will determine the prices he said 
publishers enthusiastically supported the move 
its an excellent decision it opens the possibilities to buy 
on the free market it will be very beneficial for all 
publishers said benjamin wong castaneda publisher of punto 
but wong like other publishers said it was too soon to say 
whether he would seek a new supplier
