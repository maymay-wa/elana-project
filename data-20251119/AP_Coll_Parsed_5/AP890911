its start 
gabrielle lingering south of nova scotia lost its hurricane 
status late sunday when its maximum sustained wind speed dropped 
below the 74 mph minimum by monday evening it had slowed to 45 mph

tropical waves are moving off the coast of africa every three or 
four days like clockwork said forecaster max mayfield of the 
national hurricane center in suburban coral gables

although gabrielles wind still created unusually high surf 
conditions along the southern coast of nova scotia and the us east 
coast north of boston

the fbi will soon join many police departments 
in arming its agents with highcapacity semiautomatic pistols 
according an interview with the director 
the bureaus 9700 agents will be issued 10mm pistols that can 
fire at least 12 rounds before reloading said director william s 
sessions in an interview monday with reporters and editors of the 
washington post currently agents carry sixshot revolvers 
a report on the interview appeared in tuesday editions 
many police departments have switched from revolvers to 9mm 
semiautomatics to match the greater firepower being deployed by 
drug gangs 
a revolver considered by many departments more likely to fire if 
contaminated with dirt cannot hold more than five or six rounds in 
the calibers needed for police use semiautomatics may carry many 
more rounds stacked in magazines that may extend out the bottom of 
the butt of the weapons 
the interview account quoted unidentified fbi officials as saying 
sessions ordered the switch to the new firearms about three months 
ago following a review that began in 1986 when two agents were 
killed in a shootout with drug dealers in miami the change should 
be accomplished next year

experts are restoring the spectacular 
centuriesold castle of alukhaidir a crumbling architectural 
masterpiece and iraqs oldest islamic monument as part of an 
ambitious program to revive the nations ancient glories 
the 120million restoration program also calls for the 
conservation of other small palaces in the western desert not far 
from the shiite moslem shrines at karbala and najaf 100 miles south 
of baghdad the capital 
the restorations will make iraqs early arab heritage more 
accessible to visitors and provide a contrast with the renowned 
ancient sites of ur babylon nimrud and nineveh in the north of the 
country the conservators say 
president saddam hussein is striving to bolster iraqs image by 
promoting its ancient greatness and its history of civilization that 
dates back at least 6000 years 
during the 8year war against iran in the persian gulf saddam 
portrayed iraq as an arab bulwark against persian aggression by 
recalling assyrian and babylonian victories over the persians in the 
first millenium bc 
alukhaidir characterizes that ancient glory with its 48 towers 
and thick walled fortifications still rising 65 feet above the 
desert it looms as a striking landmark visible for miles 
the british scholar gertrude bell who visited alukhaidir in 
1909 called it a solitary magnificence which rose out of the 
desert 
two years later she concluded that the architecture was the 
logical outcome of the period of cultural transition when arabs 
switched from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle 
historians and archaeologists differ on how old the castle is 
but agree it was built by an arab emir or caliph in the century 
after the islamic conquest of iraq in the mid7th century ad 
whoever built it the castle testifies that the first islamic 
builders assimilated neighboring civilization an assimilation 
which later expressed itself in a high order of artistic impulse 
said abdul aattar alazawi head of the restoration team 
the complex was built of rough stones hauled from surrounding 
areas with mud brick used for interior walls it was coated with 
gypsum a soft white plaster for protection against rain and the 
sandstorms that still howl in from the desert 
the palace filled most of the interior of the complex featuring 
a huge banquet hall guest suites guardrooms a mosque and baths 
as well as two large assembly areas the stairways on the walls were 
broad enough for defenders to ride horses up to the battlements 
the restorers aided by a small army of sudanese and egyptian 
laborers are using traditional materials for the reconstructions 
including trunks of datepalms to replace missing roofs villagers 
in the region still use that method in roofing their mud brick 
houses 
alazawi said the castle was the first important structural 
monument built by the arabs after they established themselves in 
areas formerly ruled by the sassanian and byzantine empires 
no doubt the interaction and even borrowing from these 
civilizations are still evident but the arab contribution can 
easily be detected he said 
warriors from the arabian peninsula set out in the 7th century to 
conquer the sassanian empire 
they occupied iraq but it was another century before the 
abbasids broke free from the syrianled umaiyad dynasty and 
transformed iraq into islams most prosperous region 
there are no inscriptions or records by which archaeologists can 
establish the date the castle was founded oddly for such a 
monumental building complex alukhaidir isnt mentioned by early 
islamic poets or historians 
azawi is also working to piece together evidence suggesting the 
castle stood at a crossroads of caravan routes across the desert 
linking trading centers in iraq and syria 
when gertrude bell visited the castle she found bedouin nomads 
camped in the ruined palace 
they were evicted in the 1930s when the first restorations were 
made but they still flock to the area for water from nearby springs 
and wells and for pasture for their cattle

a turtle presumed dead for 13 years has been 
found alive and well in her compartment at a zoo in devon the 
curator says 
colin bath said amy an oriental soft shell turtle who 
disappeared in 1976 from paignton zoo 130 miles southwest of 
london was found last week hiding in a silted pond after a gardener 
spotted her stealing meat 
how she survived for 12 or 13 years without food is a bit of a 
mystery said bath who described amy as now full size with a 
large bobbing neck and a 12inch grey soft pliant shell 
zookeepers were amazed at amys excellent condition especially 
since the turtles primary diet is meat and there was no meat in the 
tropical house until last week when meateating birds arrived 
they said she probably survived by stealing fruit from the bird 
cages and eating the odd insect or mouse 
bath believes it was the lure of the meat that finally brought 
amy to their attention 
she couldnt resist the diced beef her first square meal in 13 
years bath saidso she risked the daylight raid 
amy and a mate arrived at the zoo in 1973 when bath said she 
was probably only a couple of years old and 3 inches long 
for the first two years the turtles lived in a grass tank where 
they did not flourish 
they are not the easiest creatures to keep said bath 
paigntons curator for 25 years 
in 1975 the tropical house a huge planted aviary was opened and 
the turtles were transferred to their shrubfilled compartment with 
its 10footsquare shallow pool 
soon after the move the turtles natives of asia disappeared 
the fate of amys mate was still unclear

israel has gained the upper 
hand in a tax war with palestinians who refused to pay taxes as part 
of their revolt against israeli occupation 
israels armyrun civil administration has forced payment of 
taxes in the occupied west bank and gaza strip by demanding proof of 
tax payment for almost all official documents ranging from birth 
certificates to travel permits and export licenses 
soldiers and tax collectors have raided homes to seize television 
sets and stereos and have seized cars at checkpoints in lieu of tax 
payments 
makram saad a pharmacist in bethlehem who has endured a series 
of tax raids said israels policies have only strengthened his 
determination 
you pay taxes to a legal government that is elected and you get 
services in return said saad we are getting nothing we get 
closed schools arrests why should we pay to have more guns to kill 
my people 
but israels determination to force tax payments has worn down a 
boycott launched in early 1988 as part of a civil disobedience 
campaign 
by both palestinian and israeli estimates most of the 17 
million arabs in the occupied lands are now paying income and sales 
taxes underground leaflets no longer insist on compliance with the 
boycott 
an israeli military official said more arabs were paying taxes 
now than before the palestinian uprising or intefadeh that began 
dec 8 1987 even though arab tax collectors quit after being 
threatened by plo groups 
because of a sharp decline in the economy as a result of the 
uprisings strikes and boycotts however the army has not yet 
collected enough money to finance the preuprising annual budget of 
239 million of the civil administration 
in real terms we have succeeded in coming close to what we 
collected before the intefadeh but a lot now goes to repairing 
damaged buildings utility poles etc and little to new 
development said the military official who could not be 
identified in keeping with army regulations 
israeli sources said yasser arafats plo had funneled at least 
200 million to the occupied territories in 1988 to compensate 
palestinians for losses but they said the figure was only about 
100 million in 1989 because donations from arab oil states 
declined making the continued tax boycott more difficult 
dr abdel fattah abu shokor a palestinian economist at an najah 
university in the west bank estimated the gross domestic prodcut of 
the occupied lands fell 20 to 30 percent in the past 20 months from 
about 15 million in 1987 the jobless rate is also about 30 
percent up from a preuprising level of 10 percent 
he estimated 60 percent of palestinians avoided paying taxes in 
1988 but conceded there was less compliance with the boycott now 
the israeli measures are not easy to avoid he said 
the israeli military official said the tax battle continues to be 
a real war even though most palestinians are now paying taxes 
for example on aug 14 an israeli tax collector was fatally 
burned and three colleagues injured in a firebomb attack on their 
car in the west bank 
some palestinians say they will not pay taxes regardless of the 
pressure 
saad 30 whose pharmacy is near bethlehems manger square said 
a squad of soldiers raided his home last year seizing the familys 
22inch tv set and a 1987 peugot 104 in lieu of tax payments 
in the past year tax collectors also raided his store three 
times to confiscate medicine and cosmetics finally clearing all the 
shelves on july 11 he said 
saad estimates the raids cost him about 100000 and said he has 
spent 17 days in jail for refusing court orders to pay taxes 
the pharmacist maintains that some of the property seized 
belonged to relatives not to him a military official however 
said saad and three other pharmacists all leftist activists 
transferred their property to relatives at the same time in an 
attempt to fool tax collectors 
what infuriated him most saad said was the raid on his home in 
nearby beit sahour where he was ordered at gunpoint to sit in the 
living room while soldiers rummaged through the house looking for 
valuables to take as compensation for not paying taxes 
this was an attack on my home in front of my wife and child 
its harder to take than confiscating things in the pharmacy its 
where you live and sleep he said

she must be between 3foot10 and 4foot4 sing 
loudly and clearly be able to act and tap dance look 10 or 11 
years old and of course not be afraid of dogs 
the search for broadways new annie began as 29 little girls 
walked on stage at the golden theater to face martin charnin 
director of annie 2 miss hannigans revenge the new musical 
about the worlds most famous orphan 
why are we doing this mad thing sighed composer charles 
strouse as he prepared to listen to endless renditions of a little 
melody he wrote called tomorrow we should be playing poker 
the girls on hand monday morning were the first batch of 
youngsters to audition for charnin strouse casting director pat 
mccorkle choreographer danny daniels and others connected with the 
7 million musical that is to open march 1 on broadway 
some girls waited for more than more than four hours before they 
were let into the theater the audition was open to anyone with 
enough courage to be there 
nineyearold brandie gray of louisville ky and her mother 
teresa arrived at the theater at 530 am to stake out their place 
in line 
we got up at 3 am said mrs gray for the last leg of 
the trip 
right behind them was 9yearold jill mceachern of jackson 
miss who with her mother carolyn showed up at 630 am jill 
confided she never had appeared in annie but i watched the 
movie a lot 
like most of the girls jill was not even born when the original 
annie opened on broadway in 1977 it ran 2377 performances 
before it closed in january 1983 
the shows first star andrea mcardle is now 25 married and the 
mother of a yearold daughter she last appeared on broadway in 
starlight express in 1987 
the first annie ended with the nasty miss hannigan the orphanage 
matron going off to prison the sequel picks up the story six weeks 
later though producers arent saying much about how miss hannigan 
gets or tries to get her revenge 
as the girls hoping to follow in ms mcardles footsteps were 
sent to the stage monday parents were relegated to the back of 
theater where they whispered nervously 
one of the things you want to get a sense of is how these kids 
function by themselves without their parents charnin said some 
of them instantly reveal that they are frightened to death and are 
not trustworthy enough to be alone 
the girls were lined up across the stage standing in front of a 
yellow ribbon hung at 4 feet 4 inches above the floor some of them 
towering above it 
one of the things i learned from the last annie was to cast 
smaller charnin said it didnt have to be younger but it had 
to be smaller theres just so much of a hem of a dress you can let 
out still even the tootall girls got a chance to show their 
singing and dancing skills 
charnin described his role during the audition as pied piper 
and psychiatrist i get a sense of where their heads are and hear 
their voices 
the girls first sang the ubiquitous tomorrow in groups of 
five charnin then asked each her name and age and they got a 
chance to do a couple of simple dance steps again in groups of five 
the moment of truth came when charnin had the girls solo on four 
bars each of tomorrow 
this is the hard part he told the girls this is where we 
have to pretend that this is not annie but a chorus line the 
girls who didnt make the cut got a thankyou and an annie 2 
button 
by midday four youngsters had made it through the first hurdle 
and got invited to come for a second look neither jill nor brandie 
made the first cut 
charnin and company continued to look at hopefuls through the day 
monday and planned to repeat the audition process today and 
wednesday in new york and next monday in washington 
by the end of all of this i hope to have 25 kids who will then 
take specific material that we will want them to look at and come 
back for a concerted audition he said from that group our 
annie will be picked

andy warhol is making waves in london 2 years 
after his death posters with his magic name are everywhere 
six exhibitions devoted to the american master of pop art opened 
this month also taking place were a retrospective of his 
avantgarde films and a twoday conference on his filmmaking at the 
national film theater a sixweek series of lectures at the chelsea 
school of art and design and next month a dance at sadlers wells 
inspired by his heliumfilled floating silver pillows 
i cannot remember such a concentration on a single artist 
before and it reflects warhols stature as one of the great artists 
since the second world war said andrew dempsey assistant 
director of the hayward gallery which is staging britains first 
comprehensive retrospective warhol exhibition 
the hayward is the big draw 183 works assembled by the museum of 
modern art in new york 
visitors streamed in as soon as the doors opened on thursday 
even at 665 nearly as expensive as a modest theater seat in the 
west end 
the show runs through nov 5 and then goes to cologne west 
germany venice italy and paris 
the hayward works include the celebrated images of chairman mao 
marilyn monroe jacqueline kennedy elvis presley and elizabeth 
taylor there are the campbell soup cans the repetitive dollar 
bills and the 210 cocacola bottles that are all slightly different 
there are the early paintings derived from comics and chilling 
images of the electric chair and auto and aircraft crashes 
other galleries are showing warhols drawings as a successful 
commercial artist in the 1950s the selfportraits which occupied 
him from the start of his career to the last year of his life an 
exploration of his attitude toward sex the years at the factory 
where he and his acolytes worked in new york and at libertys 
department store a window display he designed for bonwit tellers 
new york store in 1961 
these six shows reflect warhols importance said dempsey 
he made an extremely interesting contribution not just as an 
artist but as a creator and reflector of his period the 1960s to 
the 1980s it was not an accident he was quintessentially an 
artist of his time 
dempsey described warhol as an extremely radical artist who could 
also reach a wide public 
artists like that are rare clearly he had the magic and was 
extraordinarily interesting and innovative he said 
warhol was born in pittsburgh on aug 6 1928 of czechoslovak 
immigrant parents who had settled in the united states seven years 
earlier 
when he died worldfamous on feb 22 1987 after a gall bladder 
operation he had been so successful in obscuring details of his 
life that obituaries could not agree on the year of his birth the 
hayward show notes 
although the times of london reporting on warhol this month spoke 
of the genius of the ultimate salesman the artist does not get 
a unanimous chorus of acclamation 
peter fuller one of britains top critics and editor of the 
countrys most popular art journal modern painters called warhol 
trivial empty banal and vacuous and therefore not worth 
attending to

when dr mitchell bush talks to the animals at 
the national zoo they run for cover 
i dont think theres any animal in the zoo that likes me 
the zoos chief veterinarian says ruefully 
the same furry creatures that would have nuzzled the jovial 
doctor doolittle cringe in fright when bush appears even though he 
fought a valiant but unsuccessful roundtheclock battle last 
weekend to save the life of the zoos newest panda cub 
hsinghsing the zoos giant male panda knows my voice bush 
said but when bush starts talking hsinghsing lumbers down to his 
moat and paces worriedly back and forth 
cheeky orangutans who cadge soft drinks from zoo visitors 
scramble for safety when bush shows up the great apes he says can 
spot him in a crowd of several hundred tourists and squeeze into a 
blind corner in their cage out of harms way 
my colleagues ask me how can you practice if none of your 
patients likes you bush said 
i dont relish being the villain but thats just a fact of 
life ive become used to it the reality of performing my job is 
that its not conducive to making friends with the animals 
a friendlier cageside manner might help bush concedes but lets 
face it he says who can blame the animals who would you prefer 
the veterinarian with his probing fingers and hypodermic needles or 
the keeper who brings food maid service and small talk into the 
cage 
most animals like their keepers bush says 
a big bearded bear of a californian bush 48 came to the 
national zoo from the faculty of johns hopkins medical school early 
in 1972 just before hsinghsing and his panda mate lingling 
arrived from china as a gift to president nixon for the american 
people 
over the years bush has presided over most of linglings 
heartbreaking attempts to breed successfully in captivity she has 
lost five cubs since 1983 most of them victims of their mothers 
recurring kidney or uterine infections 
the latest cub an unnamed male died last sunday after 39 hours 
of fighting an infection transmitted by lingling assisted by a 
dozen or more zoo veterinarians and pediatric specialists from 
nearby childrens hospital bush injected the premature cub with 
antibiotics and a serum containing hsinghsings antibodies to 
bolster its fragile immune system 
the cub which weighed only 31 ounces at birth was removed from 
its 250pound mother and placed in an oxygenrich incubator there 
it was fed a special formula through a tube into its stomach and 
cuddled by a rubber glove filled with warm water to simulate 
linglings motherly paw 
every effort was made to pull this cub through its illness 
said zoo director michael robinson 
bush says the giant panda couple probably will be mating early 
next spring and once again hell be crossing his fingers 
meanwhile bush is working seven days a week treating everything 
from elephants and rhinos to tiny hairyfooted hamsters it seems 
like one thing after another he says 
among his more memorable challenges were performing a root canal 
on a polar bear and playing midwife to a pregnant bongo an african 
forest antelope that tips the scales at 600 pounds and requires 
three operating tables to lie on a very stressful procedure 
bush says 
of all his animals bush says the bears are his happiest 
patients bears just seem to go on and on and on and they never 
give us any problem he said the most difficult to treat are 
giraffes which tower 16 to 18 feet and risk injury or death when 
they fall to the ground under anesthesia even with ropes erected as 
a safety net 
how does he treat a giraffe for a sore throat 
with benign neglect bush replied you very rarely hear a 
giraffe get vocal except when theyre young i havent heard them 
say a thing so i assume theres no complaint

crying laughing and cheering with 
happiness thousands of east germans poured across the border into 
austria early monday after hungary broke with a soviet bloc ally and 
let them emigrate 
they began driving across the border at midnight as hungary 
ending a weekslong diplomatic stalemate removed the frontier 
barriers to allow more than 7000 east german refugees to escape to 
the west 
the largest mass emigration of east germans to west germany since 
the berlin wall went up in 1961 began after hungary announced sunday 
evening that it would allow them to leave for west germany their 
final destination 
the first east german cars arrived in passau a west german city 
on the austrian border nine hours later most carried young couples 
or families with babies or toddlers 
some refugees said they were heading for one of several nearby 
tent communities set up more than a week ago by west german red 
cross workers others planned to seek shelter with relatives as far 
away as hamburg 
hungary on sunday became the first east bloc government to help 
the citizens of another communist country freely leave their 
homeland for which east germany promptly accused budapest of 
directly interfering in its internal affairs 
the hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow east 
german citizens to travel to west germany in violation of 
international treaty the staterun news agency adn said 
it said hungary under the guise of humanitarianism has 
engaged in the organized smuggling of human beings 
west germany which offers east germans automatic citizenship and 
help getting settled said hungary made a humanitarian decision 
it had refugee camps set up in bavaria just over a week ago to 
handle the expected influx 
at this frontier town 120 miles northwest of the hungarian 
capital border guards gave only cursory checks to east germans 
as the first groups crossed hundreds of others waited in their 
cars forming growing lines at the main border crossings 
and as the first convoys made they way across the border new 
east german arrivals were reported by hungarian and west german 
volunteers at several hungarian camps used to house and marshall the 
refugees since midaugust 
an estimated 60000 east germans were in hungary when the exodus 
began 
eight of 18 lanes at the hegyeshalom crossing were open as the 
jubilant east germans drove through they honked their horns 
cheered and whistled releasing emotions pent up by days and weeks 
of waiting for a decision by hungarian authorities 
some refugees waved bottles of foaming champagne from the car 
windows 
austrian customs officials said more than 2000 east germans in 
cars had crossed into austria over six entry points in the first 
five hours of the mass exodus others arrived at the border by bus 
and train 
its wonderful its terrific refugees shouted to reporters 
and border guards one man overcome with emotion tried to smile as 
tears rolled down his cheeks and couldnt speak 
dozens of people who had taken taxis from budapest waited to 
cross into austria on foot a group of youths among them held up a 
sign saying give it up erich referring to east german 
communist leader erich honecker 
once on the austrian side of the massive border barrier many 
east germans jumped from their cars and danced with joy 
in a small tent on the austrian side red cross workers handed 
out steaming cups of tea crackers and maps showing the quickest way 
to the west german border to anyone who asked 
crowds of austrians gathered to welcome the emigres cheering and 
clapping as each car passed a woman stood at the roadside holding 
up a sign offering free beds for a refugee family with children 
a statement sunday by the official hungarian news agency mti 
said hungary has decided to make it possible for the east german 
citizens staying in hungary and refusing to return home to leave to 
any country which is prepared to let them through or receive them 
interior minister istvan horvath instructed the police and 
border guards to let east german citizens leave hungary with their 
east german travel documents at any border point 
the hungarian foreign minister gyula horn suggested on 
hungarian tv that tens of thousands of other east germans now 
vacationing in hungary might join the exodus 
to make the exodus possible he said hungary decided to suspend 
a 1969 agreement with east germany a warsaw pact ally saying 
hungary should not take into account west germanys claim to east 
germans 
the fate of the refugees had been discussed for weeks by east and 
west germany with hungary insisting it was primarily a bystander 
interested in seeing a solution the communique said the talks 
between east germany and west germany ended in failure it did not 
elaborate 
there are about 60000 east germans now in hungary horn said 
in the television interview referring to thousands who have not 
registered with the west german embassy in budapest to leave and are 
formally in hungary as vacationers 
i cannot tell you how long it will last but it surely wont be 
just for an hour horn said when asked how long the refugees 
would be allowed to leave simply by showing their east german 
passports to hungarian border guards 
austrian television said a special hungarian train carrying only 
east german refugees had left from a camp in southwestern hungary 
for the border late sunday and four more trains would follow 
in frankfurt west germany federal railways spokesman klaus 
vollmer said that his austrian counterparts moved 50 railway cars 
with room for 90 people in each to border points with hungary 
also 40 west german railroad cars were moved to passau and 
freilassing two bavarian cities near the austrian border and 70 
austrian buses were standing by vollmer said 
this is a humanitarian decision and an act of european 
solidarity i am deeply thankful to the hungarian government 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said in bonn 
the refugee problem was a difficult one for hungary which wanted 
to show it is committed to western concepts of human rights but 
reluctant to anger hardline communist leaders in east berlin 
hungary recently began implementing democratic reforms similar to 
those being adopted by poland and the soviet union but east germany 
has not 
hungarys reform course has also caused tensions with 
czechoslovakia and romania two other hardline soviet bloc 
countries 
about 6000 east germans had already fled their communist 
homeland this summer by crossing from hungary where they were 
vacationing to austria budapest began dismantling border 
fortifications in may in keeping with its new commitment to human 
rights and more democracy

salman rushdie the author who was driven into 
hiding by a death threat from moslem extremists describes the 
united states in a newly published book review as a secular nation 
hungry for gods 
rushdie in the latest of his occasional reviews for the observer 
weekly since he was forced out of sight in february on sunday 
praised the new novel billy bathgate by american author el 
doctorow 
the story of the rise and fall of gangster dutch shultz is told 
by the young narrator billy bathgate an apprentice 
a secular nation hungry for gods america made of men like the 
dutchman dark deities in whom it desparately wanted to believe as 
15yearold billy wants to believe in shultz he wrote 
but what america loves most needs most more than light or 
darkness more than gods or demons is the myth of itself 
mythical america its writers tell us constantly is the real 
america and myth demands among other things that heroes fall as 
well as rise billy bathgate is the story of the dutchmans long 
last dive said the review 
rushdie called the novel doctorows most brilliant proof to 
date of the fact that american novelists have always been more ready 
than their european counterparts to demonstrate that the art of 
literature can adopt the form of popular entertainment without 
losing an iota of seriousness 
rushdies own novel the satanic verses drew him a death 
sentence from the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran for 
alleged blasphemy of islam 
rushdie was forced into hiding with a 52 million bounty on his 
head and given police protection his american wife marianne 
wiggins who is also a writer said last month that they had 
separated because of the strain

the leader of the eritrean peoples liberation 
front says he is optimistic about the conclusion of preliminary 
peace talks but the civil war in ethiopia probably would continue 
isaias afwerki said although eritreans have reason to believe 
they are getting close to a solution another round of 
negotiations to end the 28year war is unlikely for several months 
if we agree and finish these preliminary negotiations we will 
want to go back to eritrea and do out homework for the next phase of 
the process afwerki said sunday there should be enough time 
for everyone to prepare their positions 
ethiopias delegation did not have any immediate comment since 
the talks began thursday there has been little public comment by 
either side 
with former president carter acting as an observer the 
delegations are trying to arrange future peace talks 
the eriteans are fighting for independence from the east african 
country during the war an estimated 1 million people have died in 
combat or in the famine that has resulted from blocked delivery of 
relief supplies 
afwerki said that even though carter has discussed the 
possibility of a ceasefire the eplf probably would continue 
fighting until substantive negotiations begin 
the groups took a break from the negotiations sunday although 
carter center spokeswoman carrie harmon said the former president 
met privately with both delegations 
she said the talks would continue through tuesday although 
afwerki said they may last three or four more days

outrage over the supreme courts flagburning 
decision is subsiding but legislation to undo the ruling still 
stands an excellent chance of approval in congress lawmakers say 
if you vote against this law they could say youre for burning 
of the flag said rep sonny montgomery dmiss voicing the 
concern of many lawmakers that the issue remains potent despite 
evidence the uproar that greeted the june 21 ruling has subsided 
even though house and senate leaders expect legislation to pass 
many lawmakers who spent august at home on recess say they heard 
little about the issue from constituents 
my constituents couldnt care less about a superficial issue 
like flagburning said rep major owens dny 
rep phil crane rill said the matter was an abstraction to 
most people i doubt you can find one person in a million who has 
witnessed someone desecrating the flag 
but many americans particularly veterans groups are still 
angry people are incensed said sen christopher bond rmo 
they still want to see action quickly 
in its 54 ruling the court overturned a texas law under which a 
protester was charged for burning a flag at the 1984 republican 
national convention in dallas 
with legislation to protect the flag ready to begin moving 
through congress this week the only question appeared to be whether 
congress would submit a constitutional amendment to the states for 
ratification in addition to widely expected passage of a law 
an amendment would have to be approved by a twothirds majority 
of the house and senate and by 34 of the 50 states while a law 
requires simple majority votes of the house and senate and the 
presidents signature 
the proposed law on which house debate begins tuesday would 
impose unspecified fines and up to a year in prison for anyone who 
knowingly mutilates defaces burns or tramples upon any flag of 
the united states 
democratic leaders say enactment of a law could defuse a 
potential political bombshell without eroding first amendment 
rights although civil libertarians and the american bar association 
say the proposed law is still too restrictive 
but president bush and other republican leaders backed by 
veterans groups including the american legion say they doubt the 
legislation would survive a court challenge they are pushing a 
constitutional amendment 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine has scheduled a senate 
vote on the amendment for oct 16 in the house republicans and 
democrats were exploring a tradeoff in which the leadership would 
allow a vote on the constitutional amendment and the gop minority 
would drop plans to oppose the statute 
while republicans appeared to view the issue as a political plus 
many democrats voiced discomfort at the prospect of having negative 
votes on the statute or the amendment used against them in future 
campaigns 
my sense is that people are concerned that republicans will use 
the issue in the same unprincipled but politically effective way in 
which they used the pledge of allegiance against democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis last year said rep ted weiss 
dny 
rep guy vander jagt rmich chairman of the house gop campaign 
committee said democrats have good reason to worry id like to 
see a lot of democrats voting against the amendment because i do 
think it would make them vulnerable he said 
democrats who vote for the statute but against the constitutional 
amendment would not be immune from attacks vander jagt said 
adding they would have voted against the only viable solution 
the only real way to protect the flag 
but some democrats say they believe most voters would be 
satisfied with a statute 
i think the momentum to build up to a constitutional amendment 
has diminished substantially said rep mike synar dokla a 
statute will suffice even veterans groups are telling me right 
now they think a statutes sufficient

relations between president bush and congress 
cordial so far are showing the first major signs of strain in 
mounting disputes over how to finance his antidrug plan and a host 
of other programs 
with two key budget deadlines fast approaching congress has yet 
to vote a dime for any bush proposal other than an emergency savings 
and loan rescue plan 
by weeks end bush who promised an age of the offered hand 
in january was railing at carping democrats accusing critics 
of losing the war on drugs and issuing campaignlike statements 
slamming democrats for wanting to raise taxes 
for their part democrats accused the president of tossing out a 
multitude of costly proposals without proposing realistic ways to 
pick up the tab 
with the unveiling of his 79 billion antidrug initiative last 
week the president essentially completed his firstyears 
legislative agenda 
some further items are still expected a 19 billion fiveyear 
hightech computer program a food safety package a set of 
incentives to encourage adoptions and an assortment of minor 
measures 
but the president has now put forth the bulk of the major issues 
he raised during last years campaign and showcased in his february 
budget outline to congress 
he has sent capitol hill major proposals on education crime 
drugs clean air child care capital gains taxes strategic 
weapons ethics and foreign aid 
weve got a lot of balls in the air conceded frederick d 
mcclure who as bushs assistant for legislative affairs must try to 
shepherd the proposals through the congressional labyrinth 
mcclure said the white house will step up its lobbying efforts in 
the days ahead because of the anticipated fiscal crunch 
although the start of fiscal 1990 is but three weeks away 
congress still has not enacted any of the 13 appropriations bills 
required to fund the government as of friday the senate had acted 
on only five of the measures 
that raises the prospect of another sprawling catchall bill that 
both the administration and congressional leaders say they hope to 
avoid 
furthermore hard on the oct 1 deadline for funding the 
government is an oct 15 deadline for acting to avoid mandatory 
spending cuts that will be triggered by the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing bill 
congress approved a 12 trillion budget for 1990 that carries 
out an april agreement between the white house and congress calling 
for 28 billion in savings to get the fiscal 1990 deficit down to 
100 billion the target of the budgetbalancing law 
any projected deficit over 110 billion will trigger automatic 
acrosstheboard cuts in all federal programs on oct 15 
since that april budget agreement congress and the 
administration have had few discussions on budget policy still 
billions of dollars in additional spending has been proposed in bush 
administration initiatives 
the problem is whether this is all fiction or reality said 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget committee 
in addition to formal bush proposals since the april budget 
accord bush has thrown out a number of other tidbits including a 
proposal for a manned space flight to mars and another moon landing 
if there is a serious effort to make some of these efforts 
real then congress is going to have a tough time coming up with the 
funding to be able to support these initiatives panetta said 
in many ways panetta said despite the kinder and gentler 
rhetoric the bush administration is harder to deal with on budget 
issues than was the reagan administration 
reagan was much more direct on the stuff bush gets awfully 
wishy washy panetta said i think president bush identifies the 
areas of need but then when you look behind every initiative 
theres nothing there 
is bushs honeymoon over 
i dont believe its over said senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan i think the president is going to stay right in 
there hes going to continue to provide the leadership

jewish leaders are backing frederick v malek 
for a white house role after hearing the business executives 
apology for an incident in the nixon administration with 
antisemitic overtones 
the white house said sunday that president bush wants malek to 
run next years economic summit of western industrialized nations 
expected to be held in texas 
malek 51 a central player in three major business deals this 
year including the nearly 4 billion takeover of northwest 
airlines said he still must make arrangements with his partners 
before taking on the parttime white house post 
but malek has cleared one possible hurdle in a series of private 
fencemending meetings with leaders of major jewish organizations 
malek said he both explained and apologized for his role in the 
1971 incident in which he complied with a richard nixon request to 
find out how many top bureau of labor statistics officials were jews 
malek resigned as a top bush campaign adviser and deputy 
republican chairman last sept 11 after reports about the memo 
resurfaced 
he denied charges of antisemitism but said then he was 
relinquishing his posts because of my belief that nothing should 
interfere with the vice presidents victory in november 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations said malek made a mistake 18 
years ago when he agreed to a regrettable request by president 
nixon 
but reich added that malek has taken pains to assure the jewish 
community that he realizes his error and that he intended no harm i 
believe he is sincere and that he intends to serve the president 
and the country with integrity and with respect for all americans 
we wish him good luck in his new assignment 
he did make one mistake and hes apologized for it said 
abraham h foxman national director of the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith i think hes put it behind him 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said the president has 
spoken to fred malek about the summit post the president would 
like him to do it no final decisions have been made we do expect 
it to occur 
malek 51 who ran last years republican convention in new 
orleans said he wrote the memo only after ignoring several earlier 
demands from nixon for the information 
nixon had complained to aides that a jewish cabal within the 
bureau was trying to undermine his economic policies and demanded 
to know how many top officials were democrats and jews 
malek said he provided the data on democrats after a check of 
voter registration rolls but balked at fulfilling the rest of 
nixons query 
i refused four times malek said sunday the fifth time he 
came back and gave me a direct order through chief of staff hr 
haldeman so i gave him a number 
i regret my compliance it was a mistake said malek a west 
point graduate who was a special assistant to nixon in 197073 and 
then deputy director of the office of management and budget until 
1975 
i dont think anyone has ever found any shred of evidence of 
bigotry or antisemitism in my life except this footnote malek 
said in a telephone interview from his mclean va home 
before accepting bushs offer malek said he first must make sure 
his other business obligations allow him to take on the job of 
summit coordinator and that there are no conflicts of interest 
malek is a former marriott corp executive and president of 
marriott hotels 
in addition to the northwest airlines takeover he was a 
principal in two other recent major business deals the purchase of 
coldwell bankers commercial real estate operations from sears for 
300 million and the 800 million sale of marriotts airline 
catering business to malek and executives of the catering division 
bush attended a party at maleks home overlooking the potomac 
last month to mark the first anniversary of the gop convention 
the last summit was in paris in july bush is believed intent on 
holding the next in texas probably san antonio or houston in 
late spring neither the date nor site is firmly set

the evacuation of the us embassy in lebanon 
will have little effect on washingtons ability to gather 
information about american hostages because the diplomats had been 
isolated for months experts say 
since civil war erupted fullforce in lebanon in early march 
diplomats at the embassy in christiancontrolled east beirut were in 
contact with moslemcontrolled west beirut only by telephone said 
george malleck a state department spokesman 
the eight american captives in lebanon are believed to be held by 
proiranian shiite moslems all linked to the hezbollah umbrella 
group 
another state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the diplomats were limited in their movements in 
lebanon confined primarily to the embassy compound and their 
apartments 
neil livingstone a private consultant who has written 
extensively about the hostages said it was doubtful embassy 
personnel had much to do with the hostage situation the options 
and decisions to be made are done in washington they are done at a 
high level he said 
any indirect contacts with hostageholders or their iranian 
sponsors usually take place in european capitals he said 
ambassador john mccarthy and 29 american diplomats were evacuated 
by helicopter tuesday 
on friday mccarthy met with secretary of state james a baker iii 
to discuss the situation in lebanon where heightened hostilities 
have claimed the lives of 827 people over the last six months us 
diplomats fled first shredding documents and destroying electronic 
coding equipment after christian factions besieged the embassy 
claiming that the americans had not done enough to protect from the 
syrian army and its moslem allies 
thomas cicippio of norristown pa the brother of hostage joseph 
cicippio said the family had heard nothing about the captives but 
they were worried we just have to keep our fingers crossed he 
said 
joseph cicippios wife a lebaneseborn woman employed at the 
embassy continued to work with other foreign nationals who stayed 
to run the embassy compound officials said thomas cicippio said he 
had not been in touch with his sisterinlaw because of the 
difficulty in making telephone calls regular mail service also is 
sporadic 
the american aid program most of it consisting of food and other 
supplies is in the hands of local private voluntary organizations 
the program totalled about 16 million in the fiscal year that ends 
this month 
cicippio 58 was threatened with death but granted a reprieve 
in early august shortly after a group calling itself the 
organization of the oppressed on earth released a videotape showing 
lt col william r higgins in a noose american officials confirmed 
the picture showed higgins but his corpse has not been returned 
livingstone said the hostages are moved around among various safe 
houses probably no more than a dozen operated by the captors at 
different times the hostages reportedly have been held in the 
southern suburbs of beirut and in the bekaa valley northeast of 
beirut 
president bush focused on the hostage issue in early august after 
the death of higgins prompting a flurry of optimism about their 
possible release when none were released the bush administration 
took another tack announced that it would lower the decibel on 
discussions about the hostages 
we would like to lower our voices a little and let these issues 
play out for a few days and see what happens bush spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said on aug 11 
in an interview published tuesday in the washington post sheik 
mohammed hussein fadlallah the spiritual leader of the shiite 
moslems in lebanon said bush would have to make the first gesture 
of good will toward iran

the government will have the final word next 
spring on whether exxon has adequately cleaned up the 
11milliongallon oil spill caused by one of its tankers in alaska 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly says 
theres a lot still to do reilly said sunday on nbcs meet 
the press program exxon is going to have to go back in the 
spring as they intend to do and survey what the problems are and 
if theres remaining work to do to do it 
if the government determines more cleanup is necessary and exxon 
refuses to go along the epa chief said well take the road which 
has always been open which is to undertake the direct cleanup 
ourselves and to bill exxon for the cost 
the company has announced it is pulling out thousands of cleanup 
workers this week because of the limited daylight and rough weather 
of alaskas early winter 
exxon has been in disagreement with state and federal agencies 
over the adequacy of the companys cleanup efforts since the exxon 
valdez struck a reef in prince william sound on march 24 spilling 
nearly 11 million gallons in the nations worst crude oil spill 
the company says it has treated more than 1000 miles of 
shoreline and only four miles remain to be treated state 
authorities say the company is overstating the work it has done and 
is leaving before the job unfinished 
reilly defended exxons decision to withdraw its cleanup workers 
now my sense is that the weather is such there that it would be 
very risky to leave a lot of those folks in that exposed position

among state department officials there is no 
shortage of anecdotes about the moral and intellectual shortcomings 
of political activists who won prestige assignments as ambassadors 
some of the more noteworthy tales 
one recent ambassador to a european country had his bedroom 
covered with mirrors he often frolicked there with call girls 
imported from a neighboring capital 
when maureen reagan the former presidents daughter showed up 
in an african country a few years ago the local us ambassador 
received her at the airport in an advanced state of drunkenness 
an ambassador to an asian country a decade ago was so ignorant 
about world affairs he was unaware that there were two koreas and 
had never heard of the heads of government of either france or west 
germany 
the debate over political appointees versus those chosen from the 
career diplomatic service heats up each time a new administration 
takes office and president bushs accession is no different 
the union of career diplomats is so upset with some of bushs 
nominees that it is accusing the state department in a lawsuit of 
covering up background information about some of the choices in 
order to avoid embarrassing disclosures 
the state department declines comment on the suit but cites a 
1970 ambassadorial appointment by president nixon to defend the 
practice of going outside the foreign service for some key 
diplomatic posts 
the assignment was un ambassador and the appointee was a 
defeated senate candidate named george bush 
the career service has never argued against political appointees 
indeed the list of such ambassadors is long and distinguished mike 
mansfield who recently completed a 12year tour as ambassador to 
japan is but one example otto reich who left venezuela in july 
after a threeyear stay initially encountered official hostility in 
caracas because he was thought to be a rightwing extremist when he 
left he took with him venezuelas highest decoration 
also political appointees sometimes have the ear of their 
president an asset few career diplomats can claim they are 
sometimes more reliable in carrying out the presidents policy than 
their more cautious colleagues in the foreign service 
tony motley who as president reagans top aide for latin america 
policy had almost 30 ambassadors under his scrutiny said the best 
of them were equally divided between career and political appointees 
at issue now however are the credentials of a handful of bushs 
selections usually republican activists who helped bush in the 1988 
campaign but who are untutored in diplomatic matters 
examples are joseph zappala a florida developer who was 
nominated ambassador to spain after contributing a reported 126000 
to the campaign 
another florida businessman who made a similarly generous 
contribution was melvin sembler nominated to be bushs man in 
australia 
della newman won an appointment as ambassador to new zealand 
after helping bush carry washington state peter secchia who helped 
deliver michigan to bush was rewarded with the embassy in rome 
he quickly alienated many italians by suggesting that the italian 
navy now boasts glass bottom boats so they can see the old italian 
navy 
confidence in the process was not enhanced with the answers given 
by sembler and zappala when they were asked to write their special 
qualifications to be ambassadors 
sembler wrote i have been known as a coalition builder able 
to organize my peers to action in support of worthy civic 
charitable and political causes zappalas response was almost 
identical 
it was episodes such as this that prompted sen paul sarbanes 
dmd to dismiss the system as insulting and in going to court 
over the issue the career diplomats union known formally as the 
american foreign service association believes the law is on its 
side 
a 1980 law says ambassadorial nominees should be knowledgeable 
about all aspects of the country of their assignment and that 
political campaign contributions should not be a factor in the 
selection process

the man who would be king of a

tom wigle was the only person in the community of 200 to file for 
novembers election for the village councils six seats 
wigle says he could have declared himself council president 
become mayor by default and perhaps made himself king since there 
would be no one to disagree with him 
theyre starting to call me the king im getting a hell of a 
kick out of that he said 
but publicity about the possibility prompted ida lawrence to file 
for election and mayor pat mckee said she would run as a writein 
candidate 
wigle 63 who has lived here for 30 years said no one else 
wanted to run because they were too afraid of offending someone they 
knew 
everybody who lives here is damn near related wigle said 
you cant get nothing done because nobody wants to make their 
relation mad since you cant get nothing done theres no use

for 773 couples to celebrate 50 years of wedded bliss with cardinal 
joseph bernardin at holy name cathedral 
sometimes you feel like it isnt worth it sure said samuel 
smith who will be married for 50 years in november but you say 
youre together for better or worse and deal with it 
the theme was the more the merrier as about 2000 children 
grandchildren and greatgrandchildren were packed into the nearby 
cathedral school auditorium to watch the mass sunday on 
closedcircuit television 
the main focus of the mass was to balance some of the negative 
press about marriage and divorce said marsha ross a volunteer for 
marriage encounters for family ministries 
this balances that with a real vision of the commitment that 
you see 773 times 50 years represents ms ross said i mean its 
a very powerful witness to well marriage 
catherine and joseph bergthold were married sept 9 1949 and 
now have 10 children 25 grandchildren and seven 
greatgrandchildren they say the secret to a successful marriage is 
to concentrate on family togetherness and working together to solve 
problems 
it certainly keeps you together catherine bergthold said 
the key is to get mad and get over it

a construction industry groups 
proposal for overcoming homelessness would be little more than a 
concentration camp for the unfortunate opponents say 
but officials of the home builders association of maryland say 
the 69 million complex of modest apartments they want to build on 
surplus federal land would show people who have nowhere to live how 
to become independent 
we have the expertise and ability to help the homeless and 
innovative techniques that could be used if the government would 
just let us said frank miano executive vice president of the 
associations nonprofit subsidiary housing america through 
training 
residents and local officials have lined up against what anne 
arundel county executive james lighthizer said would quickly become 
a regional site serving hordes of the homeless from washington 
dc and elsewhere 
they have to yank these people out of the cities where they 
come from and concentrate them in a remote section of a suburban 
county its a concentration camp for people who are down on their 
luck lighthizer said 
no one need go homeless in the county because the county 
government will pay for a motel room for anyone who cannot be 
accommodated in shelters lighthizer said 
but the home builders group contends its transitional housing 
would be far more than a shelter residents would be taught 
construction trades and building management skills so that they 
could help build and maintain the complex 
the organization obtained conditional approval from the federal 
department of health and human services on july 28 to build up to 
300 units on a 35acre surplus parcel of fort george g meade about 
halfway between washington and baltimore 
at the request of us rep tom mcmillan the democrat who 
represents anne arundel county the general services administration 
delayed release of the property to the federal department while 
environmental issues were investigated 
in a victory for the home builders the gsa on sept 1 authorized 
the department to begin lease negotiations with the home builders 
association 
weve never doubted the applicants compassion we simply doubt 
their common sense said brad fitch mcmillans spokesman 
the thickly wooded site lacks water and sewage service has no 
access to public transportation or social services and is accessible 
only by a dirt road 
housing america through training has pledged to build its own 
road and sewage treatment plant dig a well and organize a shuttle 
bus service the home builders proposal also includes a daycare 
center a playground and social service workers to help residents 
find jobs and homes of their own 
the group applied to lease the parcel under the mckinney act 
which requires the government to make surplus land available for 
uses that benefit the homeless 
laurie betz spokeswoman for the builders pointed out that it 
was congress not her group that made the land available for the 
homeless 
i think a lot of people think if we withdraw the proposal it 
will go away she said it wont 
maryland citys 8500 residents already living near a prison a 
juvenile detention center and an emergency homeless shelter resent 
the implication that they are hardhearted because they object to 
this project said ray smallwood president of the maryland city 
civic association 
most people here would take someone into their homes if they 
were in trouble smallwood said 
we come out as the criminals against everything thats good 
apple pie and everything but its the most farfetched thing weve 
ever heard of he said its not fair to the truly homeless 
theyre going to be in a spot where nobody likes them no ones 
going to accept them 
even though they would be on federal land occupants would become 
a burden to county taxpayers because they would use local services 
and send their children to county schools smallwood said 
because the site is federal property housing america through 
training officials say they would be exempt from local codes and 
regulations that add to construction costs making it possible to 
experiment with less expensive building techniques 
the whole purpose of the mckinney act is to take restraints 
off if they amend it theyre defeating the whole purpose which is 
to provide affordable housing betz said 
but lighthizer said he will ask marylands congressional 
delegation to do just that the county executive said the 
legislation should be reworded to give local government some power 
over projects proposed in their jurisdictions 
that might well put an end to the project both sides say

president bushs proposal to rid cities of 
smog spare lakes and trees from acid rain and control poisonous 
airborne chemicals begins a long and tortuous journey through 
congress this week 
upcoming clashes over the clean air bill will pit 
environmentalists against industry region against region and 
powerful lawmakers against their colleagues but when the fight is 
over the nation may have the first major revision in the law since 
1977 
a house subcommittee tuesday will be the first panel to tackle 
the bush legislation which proposes to reduce the main component of 
acid rain sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons over the next decade 
and force severely polluted cities to take pollutioncutting 
measures that would change residents lifestyles 
also for the first time the measure would control poisonous 
chemical substances that can cause cancer and other devastating 
diseases 
other key issues before congress this week are the presidents 
defense budget the controversial nomination of donald p gregg as 
ambassador to south korea a permanent smoking ban on domestic 
airline flights and a proposed statute to prohibit flag burning 
rep mike synar dokla member of the house energy and commerce 
environment subcommittee said theres going to be a lot of 
posturing in the panels hearings this week before compromises 
are made there are politics that have to be considered as well as 
personal friendships of people who are going to have long careers 
together he said 
synar is among nine energy and commerce committee members trying 
to steer a middle ground between the two main combatants 
subcommittee chairman henry a waxman dcalif the champion of 
environmental organizations and the chairman of the full committee 
john d dingell dmich who usually expresses concerns of the 
auto utility and other industries 
among the issues to be argued before the subcommittee 
should the bush antipollution requirements for cars be made 
tougher over objections of the auto industry waxman wants to drop a 
proposal to average pollution emissions by engine categories he 
wants to double the current manufacturers warranty on 
antipollution equipment from 50000 miles to 100000 miles and he 
favors expanding a bush proposal for requiring use of alternative 
motor fuels 
toxic chemicals should the legislation cover more substances 
than the bush legislation force companies in all cases to install 
expensive antipollution equipment direct the chemical industry to 
better prepare for accidental spills and eliminate economic 
considerations in setting emissions standards 
acid rain should customers of polluting power plants in nine 
states pay a disproportionate share of the cost of cleaning up acid 
rain emissions under the bush legislation the brunt of the cost 
would be paid by electric customers in ohio pennsylvania indiana 
west virginia illinois kentucky missouri tennessee and georgia 
on sunday environmental protection agency administrator william 
reilly defended the proposal to require alternate fuels in the 
worstpolluted cities saying there is no other way to curb smog 
appearing on nbcs meet the press reilly said alternative 
fuels such as methanol and ethanol can compete economically with 
gasoline 
the petroleum industry contends the alternative fuels proposal 
would put its members at an unfair disadvantage against the makers 
of the other fuels methanol for instance is derived from natural 
gas or coal 
meanwhile the senate appropriations defense subcommittee is to 
vote tuesday on the presidents defense package that stresses 
bigticket items such as star wars the b2 stealth bomber and the 
mx and midgetman nuclear missiles 
the full senate is to vote on the gregg nomination as ambassador 
to south korea the onetime aide to thenvice president bush has 
denied under oath allegations that he was involved in oliver norths 
secret operation to resupply the nicaraguan rebels 
an 119 billion transportation spending bill before the senate 
includes language to prohibit cigarette smoking on all domestic 
airline flights the current ban on smoking aboard flights lasting 
two hours or less is scheduled to expire in april 
the house has scheduled consideration of a law to ban 
flagburning in response to the supreme court ruling june 21 that 
said that said such protests are constitutional the bush 
administration and many lawmakers have pushed for a constitutional 
amendment rather than a statute

moisture conditions have improved so much in 
the nations bread basket that private analyst john schnittker says 
the 1990 wheat harvest could reach a sixyear high of 25 billion 
bushels 
that would be up nearly onefourth from this years harvest of 
204 billion bushels and 38 percent from the droughtsmitten 1988 
production of 181 billion bushels 
schnittker a veteran agricultural economist and head of his own 
washingtonbased consulting firm says his optimism is based in part 
on massive rains in oklahoma and southern kansas in the past two 
or three weeks along with more recent moisture in northern kansas 
nebraska iowa and missouri 
these are prime winter wheat areas where 1989 yields were reduced 
sharply by drought conditions 
except for some little locations that may be missed and there 
are always some of those winter wheat in the main belt will be 
going into the ground in very good condition schnittker said in a 
telephone interview 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and is harvested the 
following summer it comprises about threefourths of the total us 
wheat supply kansas schnittkers native state is the traditional 
leader 
the usda says winter wheat planting is under way now in the 
central and southern great plains and in idaho and montana 
i would say prospects are good both for acreage and for 
growing conditions schnittker said but that was true a year 
ago too we had a fair start a year ago and then it quit raining 
as a result young wheat plants withered and were not able to 
gain enough moisture to see them through the winter kansas 
production dropped 35 percent to 2093 million bushels from 323 
million in 1988 based on last months estimate 
norton d strommen the usdas chief meteorologist said there 
has been so much rain recently that it looks like were going to 
have a slow wet harvest through most of the major grain belt this 
fall but he added that prospects for 1990 winter wheat have 
improved greatly 
theres no question on that strommen said were in better 
shape now moisturewise than we were at any time last fall we did 
get some very timely rains to help with planting germination and 
establishment of the winter wheat crop last fall but then it 
turned dry 
strommen said there has been enough rain in huge areas of the 
winter wheat region so that even some of the subsoil moisture 
levels are starting to increase and thats very encouraging 
part of schnittkers production outlook is based on usdas 
decision to ease the landidling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent 
of a farmers base acreage from 10 percent for 1989 that is the 
amount of land that must be taken from production in order to 
qualify the farmer for federal price supports and other program 
benefits 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has been under some 
pressure primarily from domestic wheat users to relax the 1990 
wheat program even further to help rebuild diminished us and world 
stockpiles 
one option being considered is a contract modification 
authorized under farm law which could allow farmers to boost 
plantings from their normal program acreage this additional wheat 
however would not qualify for federal price supports direct 
payments or be used to compute a producers acreage history for 
future years 
schnittker said he thought yeutter has postponed a decision on 
further expansion of the 1990 wheat program until after revised 
production and use figures are announced on tuesday sept 12 he 
predicted no changes will be made 
the world wheat situation is tenuous but not dangerous yet and 
next years prospects are improving schnittker said so they 
will leave the rules like they are i think 
carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
association of wheat growers which does not favor a further 
expansion for 1990 said he thinks the odds right now favor some 
kind of contract modification but declined to speculate on what 
the details might be 
one of the underlying fears of the association has been that 
wheat production can soar in relatively short order and that a 
significant rise in us inventories will drive down prices again 
according to usda projections last month wheat market prices 
nationally are expected to average 385 to 425 per bushel in the 
marketing year that began on june 1 up from 372 in 198889 and 
257 in 198788

the number of inmates in us prisons jumped by 
a record 73 percent during the first half of 1989 to a total of 
673565 inmates the bureau of justice statistics says 
the sixmonth increase of 46004 inmates was higher than any 
fullyear increase recorded during the 64 years that the government 
has counted prisoners the bureau said sunday 
the largest annual increase ever recorded was in 198182 when 
the national prison population grew by 41060 inmates from 344283 
to 385343 said tom hester of the bureau 
the surge in prison population during the first half of 1989 was 
brought about by increases of 7 percent in the number of men 
imprisoned and 13 percent in the number of women the bureau said 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the increase was an 
indication that more criminals many convicted of drugrelated 
offenses are being caught and punished 
the criminal justice system is working thornburgh said in a 
statement people who break the law do pay the price 
the figures dramatize the need for almost 1800 new prison beds a 
week the bureau said congress needs to act swiftly on president 
bushs violent crime legislation which provides for the 
construction of more than 24000 new federal prison beds 
thornburgh said 
the national drug control strategy announced by bush last 
tuesday echoed the crime legislation bush called for in may in 
seeking 12 billion in 1990 budget authorization for additional 
federal prison space 
most of the increase from dec 31 1988 to june 30 1989 
occurred in the state prison systems where the population grew by 
41214 or 71 percent from 577633 at the end of 1988 to 618847 at 
the end of june during the same period the federal prison 
population expanded by 4790 a 97 percent increase from 49928 to 
54718 
during the sixmonth period nine jurisdictions reported 
doubledigit growth in their inmate populations rhode island 203 
percent south dakota 199 percent connecticut 184 percent 
utah 132 percent the district of columbia 121 percent idaho 
113 percent mississippi 106 percent missouri 104 percent and 
kentucky 102 percent 
two states experienced declines in prison populations 
tennessee down 23 percent and north dakota down 21 percent and 
texas had such a small increase only 2 prisoners more that the 
change was listed as 0 percent 
since 1980 the number of state and federal prisoners serving 
sentences of more than one year known as sentenced prisoners 
more than doubled from 315974 while four states recorded a 
tripling of such inmates california new hampshire alaska and new 
jersey 
an additional 25 states and the district of columbia doubled

at least seven palestinians were killed in the 
occupied territories on sunday six by israelis and one by a fellow 
arab as a suspected collaborator with authorities the army and arab 
reports said 
twentynine palestinians were reported wounded including an 
18monthold by soldiers dispersing stone throwers hospital 
officials said 
late sunday troops raiding the west bank village of kafr quddum 
six miles west of nablus shot and killed a palestinian youth and 
arrested two arabs an army spokesman said 
the spokesman said troops entered the village to make arrests and 
opened fire after they were attacked by youths with metal bars and 
stones 
arab hospital officials identified the arab as sahed shetawi 20 
arab reports said the raid was carried out by about 10 settlers 
they said the settlers who usually carry army issued automatic 
weapons for selfprotection entered the village in a volkswagon 
minibus and apparently opened fire when they were hit with stones 
at least four other villagers were treated for gunshot wounds 
hospital officials said 
at least 566 palestinians have been killed by israelis in the 
22monthold uprising against israeli rule thirtynine israelis 
also have been killed 
another 112 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs during 
the uprising as accused collaborators prostitutes or drug dealers 
three prominent palestinians will travel to egypt this week to 
urge the plo to allow arabs from the occupied territories to hold 
peace talks with israel newspapers reported palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafat will be in cairo egypts middle 
east news agency reported 
the daily haaretz said egyptian president hosni mubarak will 
propose a palestinian delegation of 12 people from the occupied 
territories including two deported by israel 
the proposal apparently gets around a plo refusal to have 
palestinians represented only by negotiators from the occupied 
territories since the deported men could be seen as representing 
palestinians abroad 
the yediot ahronot independent daily quoted energy minister moshe 
shahal as saying israel most likely would agree to meet such a 
delegation about an israeli plan to hold elections in the occupied 
lands 
in the occupied west bank three palestinians were killed in 
clashes with soldiers including a 19yearold youth who was shot 
trying to throw a firebomb at troops in nablus the army said 
sundays unrest in nablus the occupied west banks largest city 
broke out after soldiers lifted a weeklong curfew that confined the 
citys 120000 residents to their homes 
after the shooting seven people were wounded by army gunfire as 
rioting spread through nablus and two nearby refugee camps the army 
said 
amid the shooting an 18monthold baby was reportedly shot in 
the eye with a rubber bullet and seriously wounded hospital 
officials said the army said it was investigating the report 
in the gaza strip soldiers clashed with arabs near the el farouk 
mosque in rafiah killing 20yearold attala el mashrahe the army 
said 
in a separate incident mohammed salim sharab 17 was fatally 
shot in the chest by an armed guard of a civilian fuel truck in khan 
yunis the army said 
the guard opened fire after youths hurled stones and metal bars 
at the truck and the matter has been handed over to the police an 
army spokesman said 
overnight a lone palestinian assailant reportedly stabbed to 
death abdullkah hajeh 27 near his home in tal village outside 
nablus hours after his house was hit with a firebomb 
hajeh had been accused of collaborating with the israeli 
authorities in helping to raze olive groves and recruiting 
palestinians for israeli intellience sources in nablus said 
the army confirmed the death but said the motive for the slaying 
was criminal not alleged collaboration 
in jerusalem police said a palestinian suspected of stabbing an 
israeli bus driver in an attempt to drive a passenger bus over a 
cliff had slain a jewish man three days earlier in tel aviv 
the suspect whose name is being withheld led police to a 
building site where the body of a 38yearold jewish man was found

it has been 55 years since a mysterious fire 
aboard the luxury liner morro castle killed more than 130 people as 
thousands watched in horror from the new jersey shore 
but the years have not erased the controversy over what really 
happened in the blaze on sept 8 1934 
six survivors met saturday at the maritime museum to commemorate 
the disaster and recall the sordid tale of arson a dead sea 
captain gunrunning to cuba international intrigue and a 
recalcitrant federal government unwilling to divulge all it knows 
about the disaster 
ruth coleman recalls the tragedy as a horrible thing 
it was a nightmare i couldnt believe that this was happening 
it was something you read about that happens to other people 
says mrs coleman who was 23 at the time 
hours before the fire capt robert wilmott was found slumped 
across his bathtub flames broke out about 245 am but it was 30 
minutes after people on shore spotted the burning ship that the 
acting captain william warms ordered an sos message be sent 
already people were jumping off the flaming decks 
by sunrise thousands along the coast saw the ship cast an eerie 
glow as it drifted toward asbury park 
while the tragedy led to an overhaul of maritime safety 
guidelines many believe the truth of what happened aboard the ship 
has never been told 
thomas torresson was an 18yearold assistant purser on the ship 
he says news accounts through the years have been slanted against 
the crew and the ships owners 
thousands and thousands of words have been written that are not 
true torresson said 
the acting captain he says did the best he could under very 
trying circumstances 
the only safety violation that torresson concedes is that the 
captain did not conduct lifeboat drills 
the truth is that when reporters wrote their stories they 
jazzed them up torresson said 
but for agnes margolis who was on the cruise with her sister 
ruth coleman the truth may lie in records the government continues 
to withhold 
there has definitely been a coverup despite the fact that there 
is a freedom of information act said mrs margolis who was 28 at 
the time 
there is even talk that the munitions which we took to havana 
were to be diverted to germany she said maybe that is one 
reason they are withholding this information 
robert mcdonnell and fred rasmussen who are researching a book 
on the morro castle have sued the government in federal court in 
trenton nj to win release of records that might solve the many 
of the mysteries 
they say the ships owners hired a man to burn the vessel to 
collect insurance complicating the case is that the arsonist 
george rogers was probably a government operative or informant and 
that the liner sometimes carried arms to the cuban dictator at the 
time the researchers say 
rogers who had a criminal record before he worked on the ship 
later was convicted of trying to kill his boss who suspected rogers 
of setting fire to the ship he was paroled but sentenced to life in 
prison for the bludgeoning deaths of his neighbors 
the morro castle bound for pier 14 in manhattan was returning 
from a forget the depression cruise to cuba 
with wilmott dead and the fire raging acting captain warms 
apparently trying to get the ship near shore turned it into strong 
winds that quickly stoked the fire out of control 
survivors claimed that the crew did little to help the 
panicstricken passengers lifeboats that arrived on shore were 
filled with mostly crew members and few passengers 
the ships officers and an official of the ward line of new york 
were convicted of willful negligence in a federal court trial but 
their convictions were overturned

were free were free its 
unbelievable shouted young east germans who piled out of 
hungarian taxis early today in a wave of arriving refugees 
celebrating with cheers tears champagne and honking horns 
its wonderful its terrific refugees shouted to reporters 
and border guards after hungary opened up its austrian frontier at 
midnight to allow thousands of east germans to go west to the 
dismay of east berlin 
some of the cars stopped just inside austria disgorging laughing 
and yelling east germans swinging foaming champagne bottles 
several of the refugees their nerves frayed after weeks of 
waiting broke into tears of joy on arrival in the west 
one man overcome with emotion tried to smile as tears rolled 
down his cheeks and couldnt speak as he arrived in this border town 
50 miles southeast of vienna 
crowds whistled cheered and clapped as other east german cars 
some with sleeping toddlers oblivious to the commotion followed 
in a rustbrown lada a sovietmade car the male driver along 
with another man and two women grinned broadly at the austrian 
border booth and waved transfixed in the glare of television camera 
lights before moving on 
one group of youths just before crossing the opened red and 
white border barriers held up a sign saying give it up erich 
a reference to east germanys communist leader erich honecker 
with open arms austrians met the new refugees whose mass 
emigration to west germany where citizenship is automatic is the 
largest of east germans since the berlin wall was built in 1961 to 
stem the flow across the border 
some of the austrians offered to feed or shelter those wanting to 
rest before continuing their journey one woman stood by the side of 
the road with a handlettered sign offering room and board for a 
refugee family with children 
red cross workers in nickelsdorf handed out steaming cups of tea 
crackers maps and advice to the east germans many of the 
refugees said they planned to drive directly to the west german 
border 400 miles to the north where tent communities awaited them 
at the nickelsdorf crossing austrian customs agents told 
reporters that about 2000 people crossed the frontier in cars alone 
in the first five hours of the exodus 
one veteran red cross volunteer told reporters the nighttime 
border influx reminded him of the thousands of hungarians who fled 
over the same border in 1956 after soviet tanks crushed the soviet 
blocs bloodiest revolt

president roh taewoo today proposed a 
broad threestep plan for unifying communist north korea with the 
capitalist south and ending four stormy decades of tension 
hostilities and confrontation 
roh called on north korean leaders to help form a korean 
commonwealth an interim association which would work for eventual 
national unification ending the tragedy of division which is 
unbearably painful 
just as the barrier of division is tall and thick so the path 
to unification is steep and rugged roh said in a televised 
address to the opening of the national assembly but he said the 
reality is that it will be impossible to achieve unification 
overnight 
he offered no timetable but said he hoped a summit would be held 
soon and a charter for the commonwealth signed by august 1990 the 
45th anniversary of partition 
roh has called for a summit with north korean leader kim il sung 
before but there has been no positive response 
political observers doubted that north korea would accept rohs 
proposal and some opposition lawmakers said it did not reflect the 
views of all south koreans the government claimed it conducted a 
poll of 15000 citizens to help formulate the proposal 
many koreans have long hoped for reconciliation between the north 
and south separated in 1945 at the end of world war ii the two 
koreas share a common culture language and history and thousands 
of families have been separated by the border 
rohs latest unification proposal comes at a time when the 
government is under increasing pressure from dissidents and radical 
students for not making stronger efforts toward unification with the 
north 
a radical student and a dissident clergymen are in prison for 
making unauthorized visits to the north to discuss unification 
radical students have staged violent demonstrations in support of 
north koreas unification proposal which includes calls for 
immediate withdrawal of 43000 us troops stationed in south korea 
under a mutual defense pact 
the norths plan calls for a confederation under which there is 
one nation for military and diplomatic matters but both sides 
maintain their different political and social systems the south has 
called that unrealistic 
rohs new threestep plan took into account north koreas 
demands according to officials in the ministry of foreign affairs 
and it also changed the basis of past south korean proposals 
under rohs new proposal delegates to the interim governmental 
bodies would be equally divided between the north and the south and 
all issues would get equal consideration 
in the past the seoul government has said that because the south 
has twice the population of the north it should have a larger 
representation in a new government 
it has also said it wanted to deal with economic and humanitarian 
issues before moving onto political and military matters under 
unification 
rohs plan did not mention the us troops stationed in south 
korea though he said measures should be taken to build confidence 
and control arms with the goal of ending the costly arms race and 
confrontation 
the first step in rohs plan calls for establishing a korean 
national community for agreeing essentially that there is a 
national community this includes a northsouth summit and the 
signing of a national community charter 
the charter would outline the korean commonwealth stage two in 
the unification plan 
the korean commonwealth would include a council of presidents a 
20member council of ministers a 100member council of 
representatives and a joint secretariat which would all be equally 
divided in membership between the north and south 
a secretariat perhaps stationed in a new peace zone city in 
the demilitarized zone would serve as a working level body to 
handle routine business for the commonwealth roh said 
liason offices operating much like quasidiplomatic missions 
would be set up in seoul and the norths capital of pyongyang he 
said 
in the final step the commonwealth would draw up a constitution 
and set up elections for a united nation roh said 
a ceasefire ended the 195053 korean war but a peace treaty was 
never signed between the north and south

head the fluid was detected during a routine physical examination 
reagans neurosurgeon meanwhile said an earlier brain clot had 
been detected but it had healed on its own without an operation the 
new york times reported today 
the neurosurgeon dr thoralf m sundt said sunday the first 
clot was smaller and in a different area of the brain than the one 
removed friday because of the first clot brain tests were included 
as part of the checkup sundt said 
reagans spokesman had not previously disclosed the earlier blood 
clot detected in early july by doctors in los angeles where reagan 
lives 
the reagans on saturday sent a message of good wishes to mother 
teresa who was hospitalized in calcutta india after suffering a 
heart attack

said he had no pain he stated that he hopes to get out soon and 
expressed his appreciation for the flowers the president and mrs 
bush sent

king of morocco and the white house executive residence staff 
because of the limited space in reagans room weinberg said the 
flowers were being shared with other patients

alexander haig the feisty career army 
officer and former cabinet member says his life in zoolike 
atmospheres prepared him well for his stage debut as a narrator for 
carnival of the animals 
on sunday night haig and his wife pat narrated ogden nashs 
verses that accompany camille saintsaens carnival of the 
animals 
the performance with the california chamber virtuosi ended a 
threeday music festival celebrating the fifth anniversary of 
leisure village ocean hills a 1200unit retirement community haig 
sits on its board of directors 
the fourstar general failed presidential candidate former 
secretary of state and onetime nixon aide was persuaded by leisure 
village developer michael tenzer to participate 
haig said it shouldnt surprise americans that a former 
politician is trying his hand at acting 
its a first for me in this category but as an expolitican i 
have been acting in the recent past rather expensively though 
said haig who owns an international marketing firm in washington 
dc and lectures frequently about global issues 
i am a departure from the norm in los angeles though where 
some go from acting to politics and i go from politics to acting 
but i dont find it unfamiliar ground because if you look at this as 
the carnival of the animals ive just left the greatest zoo in the 
world washington dc 
the nearly 1000 people at the performance heard the haigs 
narrate passages describing lions turtles elephants kangaroos 
birds swans and mules 
the narrations were followed by piano music that brought alive 
the world of apes a string quintet that transformed the stage into 
a managerie of lions elephants mules roosters and swans a 
flutist who took the crowd to ocean depths a clarinetist whose 
backstage cuckooing delighted the audience and a percussionists 
instruments that captured the dances of prehistoric fossils 
wearing a navy blue suit with a white shirt and yellow tie haig 
stood before the musicians like a general frequently glancing at 
them and the audience while clutching a black notebook containing 
his script 
he listened intently to the music then taking cues from 
conductor henri temianka haig read his lines delighting in some 
he smiled and blushed after hearing the crowd chuckle and clap 
in the world of mules there are no rules he read quickly 
and loudly as dueling violins brought the sounds of mules to life 
another verse was a tonguetwister but haig read it without 
stumbling 
come crown my brow with leaves of myrtle 
i know the tortoise is a turtle 
come carve my name in stone immortal 
i know the turtoise sic is a tortle sic 
i know to my profound despair 
i bet on one to beat a hare 
i also know im now a pauper 
because of its tortley turtley torpor

the writer who reported from afghanistan in june 
1980 six months after the soviet intervention recently spent five 
weeks there to assess changes after the soviet pullout nine years 
later 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
some of the hatred heaped on the soviet 
union during its nineyear military intervention has shifted to the 
united states the chief supplier of the guerrilla rockets that kill 
far more civilians than soldiers 
six months after the soviet withdrawal many afghans sought out a 
visitng american journalist to accuse the united states of financing 
death not promoting peace 
i hate the american government because they are assisting the 
opposition groups in our country theyre killing our people we 
want peace to come to afghanistan said 22yearold takar 
he lost three relatives in the failed guerrilla assault on the 
southeastern city of jalalabad that began after the last soviet 
troops withdrew on feb 15 
public hostility to the soviets was so strong after their troops 
poured into the country in december 1979 that few soldiers or their 
families ventured out into downtown bazaars and restaurants 
when soviets passed by afghans shouted insults sometimes 
accompanied by a shove pinch or handful of tossed pebbles in 
contrast for american visitors afghans reserved smiles and pleas 
for the united states to supply antitank and antiaircraft weapons 
to moslem guerrillas 
soviets remain unloved and still keep a low profile but they are 
no longer the enemy interloper the soviet embassy compound remains 
a favorite guerrilla rocket target even though the rebels seem to 
keep missing it and some afghans blame the soviets as well as the 
americans for prolonging the fighting 
all people think the soviet union and the united states want 
war in our country they dont want peace in our country said 
dr mohammad nasser a doctor in kabul we dont want any more 
revolution we just want afghanistan for the afghans 
in the dusty bazaars and crowded tea houses of kabul where nine 
years ago afghans spoke of fighting soviet troops the conversation 
now centers on fear of rockets leaving the city high food prices 
and prospects of a political settlement which inevitably brings up 
the united states 
the united states is now viewed by many afghans as the key player 
in the war ussupplied rockets are terrorizing kabul 
the usbacked guerrillas have failed to topple the government 
of president najib as western diplomats had predicted and as many 
afghans had expected and the rebels internal feuding had turned to 
warfare 
the united states closed its embassy in kabul before soviet 
troops left citing security concerns and there are only a handful 
of americans in kabul fulltime all missionary health workers 
for some afghans the opportunity to confront an american visitor 
was not to be missed 
several times an american journalist was surrounded by crowds of 
20 to 30 afghans many shouting that president bush should stop 
giving weapons to the guerilla mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
a few afghans out of earshot of their fellow countrymen backed 
the americans but said washington wasnt doing enough to get rid of 
najib 
nine years ago kabulis complained there was nothing to do in the 
capital and there is even less choice now the only discotheque at 
the continental hotel has closed and so have most restaurants 
curfew is now an hour earlier at 10 pm 
by day kabul is a noisy oriental bazaar where men in turbans sip 
tea and haggle over japanese cameras russian watches and sides of 
lamb 
by night the incoming rockets outgoing soviet scud missiles and 
shots fired by sentries shatter dreams 
the rebels communicate clandestinely as they did nine years ago 
through night letters circulated after curfew one of the 
singlepage letters in early august urged kabul residents to leave 
the city for two weeks to avoid heavy rocketing 
afghans have traditionally fought any foreign interloper and the 
soviets were no exception they were nonbelieving communists who 
threatened the traditional moslem way of life 
najib has gone to great lengths to rebuild mosques destroyed by 
his communist predecessors to precede all his speeches with prayers 
by a mullah and to be photographed praying toward mecca 
with the soviets gone and najib espousing islam some guerrillas 
have made peace with the government saying their fight against the 
infidels has been won but many afghans still grumble 
afghan troops have replaced their soviet counterparts on the 
streets of kabul and other major cities qargah lake outside kabul 
a favorite soviet swimming hole is now a fish farm 
but the afghan government is more dependent than ever on moscow 
for food fuel weapons and ammunition the soviet airlift continues 
with 30 to 200 flights a day according to diplomatic sources and 
hundreds of trucks rumble down the salang highway from the soviet 
border to kabul

last month a statue of tony the wonder horse was stolen from the 
mix memorial along us 89 between oracle junction and florence 
that statue had replaced the original which was taken in 1980 
after someone sawed it off its stone pedestal 
the original statue depicting a horse with its head lowered and 
its saddle empty was put up in 1947 by the florence chamber of 
commerce at the site where mix died in a onecar accident oct 12 
1940 
it was never found and sheriffs deputies said last week the 
leads arent much better in the hunt for tony ii 
ms earley said the historical society which provided materials 
for the second tony statue has been working with the arizona 
department of transportation to produce tony iii 
whether you liked him or not tom mix was an idol for many 
many people and we want to keep that monument in place ms 
earley said we hope to have the new horse in place by next 
month 
tom teague area maintenance superintendent for the department of 
transportation office in globe said the agency would provide sheet 
metal for tony iii and for a backup 
we had one piece of sheet metal and we bought another one so we 
could have another horse cut out while were at it teague said 
that way well have a backup if it gets ripped off again 
he said arizona state prison inmates who made tony ii will cut 
out the two new statues at a cost of about 100 per horse 
teague and ms earley said they knew of no way to protect tony 
iii from thieves because the site is remote and cant be guarded 
fulltime 
and you couldnt fence it theyd just cut the fence ms 
teague said

police said today that they seized the 88 pounds of 
uranium that was offered for sale to the us embassy in a case that 
has already netted seven arrests 
the uranium was seized sunday at a food dealers house in in 
kurume fukuoka prefecture 560 miles southwest of the capital 
it was contained in 41 glass bottles in six xray prevention 
bags said an official of the tokyo metropolitan police department 
who spoke anonymously 
the official said police experts on chemical materials analyzed 
the substance discovered and found it was natural uranium 
on sept 1 police arrested five people on charges of illegal 
possession of nuclear substances after they took a capsule 
containing about 35 ounces of uranium to the us embassy in early 
august and proposed to sell another 88 pounds of the same substance 
for 83 million 
two more people were arrested on tuesday and friday and an eighth 
person mitsuteru tomoda a 51yearold antique art dealer was put 
on a wanted list 
another police official also requesting anonymity said the food 
dealer told investigators tomoda had asked him to keep the uranium 
the first official said the food dealer whose name was not 
disclosed reported the uranium case to local police after 
consulting with a lawyer 
he identified the arrested groups leader as toshiko nishijima a 
43yearold woman who owns several small companies 
uranium a radioactive element can be used in concentrated forms 
to make nuclear weapons and run nuclear power plants 
police have said analysis of the uranium seized earlier showed it 
was refined natural uranium of 707 percent purity 
the science and technology agencys analysis said only 07 
percent of the uranium was uranium235 the element used for power 
generation and for bombs while the rest was uranium238 
nuclear experts said nuclear power generation needs uranium 
containing more than 3 percent uranium235 and an atomic bomb 
requires uranium that contains more than 90 percent uranium235 
police still were investigating the source of the groups uranium 
and why the group tried to sell it to the us embassy at more than 
2000 times its market value of 275 an ounce 
in japan the handling of uranium is strictly regulated by law

the big drive of 89 ended with a sigh as 
well as a whoop 
it was too soon said wagon master dave stephens i wish 
the city limits would have been another 50 miles down the road 
many of the 2400 real and wouldbe cowboys who rode the sixday 
60mile trail from roundup to billings with stephens clearly felt 
the same way hundreds lingered saturday to savor the memories 
the great montana centennial cattle drive celebrating montanas 
statehood anniversary brought 2700 cattle across open range with 
the help of 2400 horseback riders and 200 covered wagons 
i feel proud said trail boss jay stovall i know there 
were skeptics but i knew we could do it all the time 
two cattle died one just before the drive began on labor day in 
the town of roundup two calves were born along the way five people 
were injured seriously enough that they had to leave the drive a 
couple of wagons were disabled 
stovalls 105 drovers brought the herd through a huge welcoming 
crowd along billings main street on saturday as if they did it 
every day police estimated the throng at 25000 to 30000 more 
than a fourth of the citys entire population 
the cattle mostly longhorns climaxed a spectacular parade of 
the riders and covered wagons 
it all went very well although it didnt go according to 
plan said police chief gene kiser 
police said not only was there no huge traffic snarl as feared 
there also were no traffic accidents injuries or arrests 
only some of the wagons were supposed to join the parade but on 
friday night barry mcwiliams one of the drives originators 
announced in camp that all would go 
some bureaucrats said that it would cause too many problems 
he told the assembly i told them either we all go or none of us 
go 
latigo corp the nonprofit company created to put on the drive 
turns now to tabulating the costs and incomes any money above 
expenses is to go into an endowment fund to help finance a variety 
of rural projects 
latigo officials had said earlier the drive would cost 400000 
to 1 million and that final figures could not be determined until 
after the drive 
an auction of western memorabilia and art was held saturday 
afternoon and the grand finale of the drive was a country music 
concert saturday night that drew 4200 people to see such musical 
stars as lee greenwood sheb wooley and hoyt axton

two state officials who campaigned 
against a referendum that would have eliminated their jobs said the 
results of the special balloting show voters are disenchanted with 
gov gaston caperton 
but that assessment by secretary of state ken hechler and 
agriculture commissioner cleve benedict who fought hard against the 
amendments was disputed by caperton and state democratic party 
chairman lloyd jackson 
they maintained the amendments failed because voters were fooled 
by an antiamendment campaign that unfairly said caperton was power 
hungry 
one of the amendments would have eliminated the jobs of secretary 
of state treasurer and agriculture commissioner eleven percent of 
those voting supported that amendment the results were 217582 
against and 28095 for with 99 percent of the vote tabulated 
the other amendments would have brought the state board of 
education under capertons control and allowed county governments to 
restructure 
the education amendment was defeated 217727 to 28670 with 88 
percent of the voters saying no the county reorganization amendment 
was defeated 199507 to 46573 with 81 percent voting against it 
west virginia house speaker chuck chambers said the 30 percent 
voter turnout showed that voters are fed up with state government 
chambers said caperton is unpopular because of a record 392 
million in tax increases the governor pushed through the legislature 
this year

mikhail s gorbachev will meet pope john paul ii for 
the first time when the soviet president travels to italy in 
november the soviet ambassador to italy says 
yes why not replied ambassador nikolai lunkov when 
reporters in genoa asked him saturday if gorbachev would meet with 
the pope during the visit 
although such a meeting has been considered likely neither the 
vatican nor the kremlin had confirmed it will take place the 
polishborn pontiff earlier this year said he would be ready to 
receive gorbachev 
it would be the first meeting between the leader of the worlds 
850 million roman catholics and the head of the soviet communist 
party which disparages religion 
the soviet ambassador spoke to reporters in genoa at the italian 
communist partys annual festival the partys newspaper lunita 
also quoted lunkov as praising the roman catholic churchs efforts 
for peace in the world 
asked whether moscow would open an embassy to the holy see 
lunkov said such things take time one must be realistic about 
everything 
the vatican has reportedly been preparing for a gorbachev visit 
since the soviet leader sent a letter to the pope in august 
gorbachev expressed interest in meeting the pontiff to talk 
business about historically troubled vaticansoviet relations 
according to a senior vatican official 
in moscow soviet sources said gorbachev is expected to visit 
italy starting nov 25 
the vatican official said the letter from gorbachev was delivered 
to the pope last month by yuri karlov an aide to soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
chief topics for a gorbachevpope meeting the vatican official 
said would be the baltic states of latvia and lithuania where 
there are large numbers of roman catholics and the ukrainian 
catholic church which is a major stumbling block to improved 
vaticanmoscow ties 
the vatican does not recognize the annexation of lithuania by the 
soviet union in 1940 and a lithuanian exile mission is accredited 
to the holy see 
the ukrainian catholic church was forcibly merged with the 
russian orthodox church under soviet dictator josef stalin in 1946 
but there is a strong underground ukrainian church and ukrainian 
faithful have been carrying out public protests seeking official 
recognition of their church

a congressman is charging that the cia and 
pakistani intelligence have bungled the war in afghanistan 
threatening to turn what appeared to be a victory by anticommunist 
guerrillas into a triumph for the sovietbacked government there 
the cia has secretly pursued a wrongheaded afghan policy for 
years the chairman of the republican task force on terrorism and 
unconventional warfare rep bill mccollum of florida charged in an 
article published sunday in the editorial section of the washington 
post 
the most recent blunder he wrote was to shut off the supply of 
us arms while pressuring afghan guerrillas into launching an 
assault on the afghan city of jalalabad near the pakistani border 
at the same time the soviet union continued massive arms 
supplies to its client in kabul enabling that government to 
withstand the assault 
the siege of jalalabad has turned into a stalemate that threatens 
to stall the entire resistance movement 
the key mistake by the central intelligence agency and the state 
department was to give control us arms shipments to the guerrillas 
to pakistans interservice intelligence that nations equivalent 
of the cia mccollum wrote 
why the cia gave isi its proxy was easier to understand in the 
beginning as the united states began to arm the moslem 
guerrillas or mujahedeen after the 1979 soviet invasion mccollum

gro harlem brundtlands governing labor party 
braced for an election setback as norwegians cast ballots today in a 
hardfought parliamentary election 
preelection surveys predicted the nonsocialist opposition 
parties would win a majority but disagreements may prevent them 
from negotiating a common program and mrs brundtland could 
continue as prime minister by default 
mrs brundtland voted shortly after polls opened at 9 am under 
bright sunshine its a good day for an election she said 
the prime minister arrived with her husband arne olav brundtland 
who was wearing a campaign badge for the opposition conservative 
party the political division in the brundtland family is the butt 
of much national humor 
asked if she won any new supporters over the breakfast table 
mrs brundtland said she didnt eat breakfast this morning 
the first election results based on computer projections and 
preelection surveys were expected shortly after the polls close at 
9 pm 3 pm edt 
final results may become clear only wednesday because of a new 
election system that adds eight seats apportioned according to 
nationwide results to the 157 seats elected by 19 regional 
districts 
some 32 million people are eligible to vote for parliament 
which sits four years there is no mechanism for early elections 
based on the three latest polls the ntb news agency on sunday 
forecast that the nonsocialist parties would win 85 seats while 
labor and the left socialist party would take a total of 80 seats 
there is a clear nonsocialist majority the question is 
whether they can translate that into a clear majority in 
parliament said bernt ole aardal of the institute for social 
research 
he said mrs brundtland has regained some of her lost support 
during the campaign which some critics have described as unusually 
dirty for this easygoing scandinavian country she has run a 
strong campaign if she ends up with 35 percent that would be a 
success aardal said 
campaigning was abruptly suspended after fridays crash of a 
chartered aircraft carrying norwegian shipping company workers on a 
celebration flight to west germany to christen a new ship all 55 
people on board died 
mrs brundtland who was briefly prime minister in 1981 has 
headed a minority labor government since a threeparty nonsocialist 
coalition resigned in 1986 
her support has dropped from 408 percent in the 1985 election to 
around 33 percent in some recent surveys as she appeared to be 
paying for the excesses she blamed on her predecessors in the 
freespending days when oil wealth poured in from north sea fields 
she has been hurt by public discontent with high taxes high 
prices and a social welfare system which seemed on the verge of a 
breakdown 
norwegians pay as much as 627 percent income tax in the top 
bracket and international surveys list oslo as the most expensive 
city in europe 
at the same time waiting lines for public hospitals have 
lengthened there is a shortage of daycare centers and critics say 
education standards have plummeted 
economists have praised mrs brundtlands tough wagerestraint 
program which helped halve inflation since 1987 to 48 percent and 
turned a balance of payments deficit into a surplus 
but unemployment nearly tripled to a record 5 percent in two 
years and the benefits of an improving economy have not filtered 
down to the public 
though she chaired the un world commission on environment and 
development the prime minister has come under sharp attack at home 
for letting industries contaminate some of norways once pristine 
fjords 
to replace mrs brundtland conservative party leader jan p syse 
must rely on the support of the maverick party of progress which 
has made dramatic gains on a platform of sharply cutting taxes and 
privatizing public companies and services 
the progress party is led by carl i hagen a 45yearold 
britisheducated former marketing executive who has become the star 
of the political stage with his television good looks and 
unrestrained attacks on the establishment 
hagen won just 37 percent in 1985 but he took 12 percent in 
local elections in 1987 and had about 20 percent support in opinion 
polls as late as last month the most recent polls showed him 
sliding back to below 15 percent

the dollar shot up to a threemonth high against the 
japanese yen today despite the central banks dollarselling 
intervention while the tokyo stock exchanges key index fell 
marginally 
the dollar closed at 14777 yen up 115 yen from fridays 
14662yen finish it opened at 14775 yen and ranged between 14750 
yen and 14803 yen 
it was the dollars highest close since 15130 on june 15 it has 
gained 469 yen since aug 30 
minori takeuchi a trader with chemical bank in tokyo said that 
after its high opening the dollar moved little mainly because 
japanese participants who were afraid of central bank intervention 
avoided major moves 
the bank of japan sold the us currency to support the yen but 
the amount it sold was unknown the bank does not comment on its 
exchange market activities 
the market is expecting the dollar to climb as high as 14850 
yen but it wont happen overnight ms takeuchi said 
because of a steady dollarselling drive among those who had 
kept too many dollars the currency will rise only slowly but 
surely because the dollarbuying demand is much stronger she 
said 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 215 points 
or 0006 percent finishing at 3411366 the market rallied in the 
afternoon after losing 7730 points in the morning and 3675 points 
last friday 
dealers attributed the indexs fall largely to the yens recent 
weakness against the dollar 
genjiro sasaki a stock dealer with new japan securities co 
said the index started to recover as foreign investors bought nikkei 
index issues as part of arbitrage deals 
he added that some investors also helped the indexs recovery by 
picking up issues that had fallen earlier 
the majority of market players however remained on the 
sidelines discouraged by the weak yen and falling bond prices 
sasaki said

workers in the soviet republic of azerbaijan ended 
a weeklong strike today that had been called to protest kremlin 
control of a disputed territory 
leaders of the azerbaijan peoples front a nationalist group 
that called a republicwide strike more than a week ago said on 
television sunday night that most of their political demands had 
been met local activists and journalists said 
the peoples front will be officially recognized and allowed to 
speak at a special session of the republics supreme soviet 
legislature on friday group spokesman ekhtibar mamedov said 
the legislature is to address the strikers principal demand the 
return of the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh to azerbaijani 
control mamedov said speaking by telephone from azerbaijans 
capital baku 
armenians and azerbaijanis have been locked in a dispute over the 
mountainous enclave of nagornokarabakh for more than 18 months the 
conflict has cost 100 lives and forced thousands to flee their homes 
moscow took the region which is in azerbaijan but populated 
mainly by ethnic armenians under its direct control last winter to 
try and calm the area but both sides continue to press their claims 
to it 
azerbaijans idled railroads resumed operating today and workers 
at all enterprises went back to work journalist nazim ragimov said 
from baku the citys many oil refineries were reported to be at 
least partially functioning throughout the strike 
trains were running everywhere in azerbaijan except on routes to 
the neighboring caucasus republic of armenia ragimov said 
in the republic of moldavia the newspaper pravda said today that 
organizers called for an end to a 3weekold walkout but the 
republics strike committee issued a statement this morning denying 
the report 
committee member dmitri kondratovich charged the account in the 
communist party daily was part of a campaign of disinformation 
aimed at stifling and splitting the strike movement 
many ethnic russians and other minorities work in the republic 
went on strike in midaugust to protest a proposed bill that would 
make moldavian the republics official language 
most strikers went back to work after the republics legislature 
passed a compromise law recognizing the use of some russian but 
kondratovich speaking from the largely russian city of tiraspol 
said employees at more than 200 factories remained off the job 
the pravda report quoted strike leader vladimir rylyakov as 
saying the strike already achieved its goals we called the 
attention of everyone in the republic even in the country to the 
increasing nationalist and extremist phenomena in moldavia he

groups

million in lost industrial production alone mamedov said the 
peoples front estimates the total damage thus far at almost 480 
million

former housing secretary samuel pierce says he 
played no favorites in his years with the reagan administration 
a congressional investigation has found numerous irregularities 
at the department of housing and urban development under pierce 
including political favoritism in awarding of contracts and 
embezzlement by real estate agents 
the former hud secretary said in this weeks time magazine no 
request was to be given any special advantage because it was 
submitted by a republican my decisions were based on facts law 
and logic not on political party 
during his tenure pierce was known as silent sam the 
invisible man of the reagan cabinet who preferred to sit in his 
office and watch television 
but pierce said such characterizations are lopsided they 
disregard the assignment president reagan gave me to reduce the 
size and the cost of government while helping the most needy and 
they bypass my achievements 
among other things congress has found that gop consultants were 
paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to win contracts for 
wellconnected developers 
while pierce said he never intervened in the awarding of 
lucrative contracts he acknowledged writing memos to his staff 
telling them to give careful consideration to certain projects 
time reported 
in a related matter the new york times reported today that 
pierce ordered broad financial concessions for a luxury apartment 
complex in chicago despite the objections of a senior federal 
housing official 
the official the newspaper reported became so concerned about 
the 23 million deal that he refused to sign mortgage documents 
documents indicate that pierce issued the 1987 order after the 
intervention on the projects behalf by a white house official two 
members of congress a former secretary of defense and the 
university of chicago the times said 
thomas t demery former assistant secretary of housing told the 
times that he felt the concession provided to the owner of the 
regents park apartments were unfair to the taxpayer 
the apartment complex was built in the 1970s with nearly 26 
million in federally insured mortgages the times reported when the 
original owners had financial problems the title was transferred to 
bruce e clinton who made extensive repairs under an agreement that 
reduced the mortgage payments due to hud the paper said 
demery told the times that he didnt think the concessions were 
necessary

the condition of east german leader 
erich honecker who underwent gall bladder surgery last month has 
deteriorated badly west german news media reported today 
government officials in bonn declined comment on the reports 
the zdf television network today quoted western diplomatic 
sources in hungary as saying honeckers medical condition has 
deteriorated considerably 
according to information that allegedly comes from communist 
party officials honecker has no mental verve and no wish to get 
better the network said honecker has been recovering from gall 
bladder surgery he underwent last month 
honecker 77 has staunchly resisted the reforms sweeping much of 
the soviet bloc tens of thousands of east germans are fleeing their 
country because of dissatisfaction with the political and economic 
situation there 
critics in the politburo reportedly are charging that honecker 
misjudged the meaning and scope of the wave of refugees zdf said 
zdf previously had said there were indications that honecker was 
no longer fully able to reason 
today the masscirculation bild newspaper said in its frontpage 
headline honecker wants to die 
the hamburgbased newspaper added the condition of the 
communist leader has worsened badly citing unidentified sources 
in east berlin bild said that honecker has lost the will to 
live 
bild is published by the giant springer concern which has been 
bitterly at odds with communist east germany for decades 
in east berlin over the weekend communist party sources said 
there were clear signs that honeckers mental capacity was 
failing and that his health problems had delayed several toplevel 
decisions 
the sources speaking on the condition of anonymity also told 
the associated press that it was difficult to gauge honeckers exact 
condition 
in bonn foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog told the ap 
in a telephone interview that reports on honeckers condition are 
pure speculation we have no firsthand information on this 
western intelligence sources two weeks ago said honeckers gall 
bladder surgery had to be abandoned due to weakness of surrounding 
tissue news reports also speculated that honecker has cancer 
east germanys staterun news agency adn said early this month 
that honecker had been released from the hospital and taken a 
vacation to recover adn has not carried any other recent reports on 
the communist leaders health

a volkswagensized rock lodged in the mangled 
hull of the exxon valdez is among the obstacles workers face today 
when they begin repairs on the tanker that caused the nations worst 
oil spill 
during the ninemonth repair job 3200 tons of steel will be 
used to patch the hull of the 29000ton tanker that struck a reef 
march 24 in alaskas prince william sound 
reporters were allowed to view the hull saturday for the first 
time as workers at the national steel and shipbuilding co prepared 
to start the repairs estimated at 25 million 
the valdez is sitting 5 feet off the ground in a dry dock on 
dozens of concrete pylons massive hydraulic shorings are also 
supporting the tanker along its starboard side 
by far the largest visible damage was to a 300by80foot 
section of the starboard side the area is a rusted patchwork of 
scraped metal tatered gaping holes and twisted shards of steel 
its a very humbling experience to stand here and see what 
mother nature can do to threequarterinch steel nassco president 
richard vortman said there is damage to the structure in addition 
to just the skin of the ship 
the valdez was built by nassco in the same dry dock and launched 
in 1986 it would cost up to 150 million to build a new tanker the 
same size vortmann said 
we have never done repairs to a ship anywhere near as 
extensively damaged as this ship he said this will be a lot 
more difficult than building a ship from scratch its harder to 
build the bottom floors of a building when the upper floors already 
exist 
one rock about the size of a volkswagen bug and another that 
weighs an estimated 6000 pounds are lodged in the torn hull 
vortmann said 
both rocks are part of the reef that the valdez struck while 
loaded with nearly 53 million gallons of oil the puncture sent 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude pouring into the water

as a steamy summer ends the 
democraticcontrolled 101st congress is turning from its earlier 
preoccupation with scandal to face the reality that the demands 
before it far exceed the ability to pay for them 
as congress steps up the pace after its summer recess the calls 
upon it seem endless 
polands newly installed noncommunist government wants american 
cash to bring quick change to a crippled economy and build its 
strength for the future 
billions are needed for the war on drugs billions are needed for 
the war on aids 
president bush wants billions to spur the development of new 
american technology not to mention finding a way to send a space 
expedition to mars 
billions are demanded to house the homeless billions will be 
required if the nations aging superstructure of highways and 
bridges and sewers is to be repaired and replaced 
the pentagon seeks billions for the b1 stealth bomber and the 
midgetman mobile missile 
money is demanded for pay raises for federal judges and civil 
servants and congressmen the senate is earmarking a few million to 
improve its subway system so senators can zip more quickly from 
their offices to the senate floor to avoid missing rollcall votes 
some of the money will be found including billions to bail out 
the savings and loan industry without new taxes most of it will 
not 
and if the deficit reduction goals of the grammrudman law are to 
be met many existing and popular spending programs must be cut 
but congressional democrats are not about to seek the funds by 
attacking president bushs nonewtaxes political fortress 
were not going to have a light cavalry charge into the face of 
a certain veto senate majority leader george mitchell said last 
week 
but mitchell said bush may find himself on the wrong side of a 
credibility gap if he continues to propose costly new programs 
without saying how he proposes to pay for them 
we face these constant and it seems accelerating pressures 
to reduce the federal deficit and deal with these emerging 
demands mitchell said 
the president wants to go to mars but there is no plan no 
timetable no price given 
i think that what is going to happen is that the appeal of the 
presidents position is going to erode the gap between his rhetoric 
and action words and deeds continues to grow mitchell said 
while congress is unhappy at the real pain involved in 
attempting to deal with superpower problems in a tightmoney age 
many are pleased that the focus seems to have shifted to substance 
that most of the purely personal controversies that dominated the 
early months of the session appear to have been left behind 
these include the senate fight that saw the defeat of john 
towers nomination as the nations defense chief and the battle over 
ethics that led to the resignation of house speaker jim wright 
to rep lee hamilton dind congress seems less ideologically 
torn this year in spite of the bruising political struggle over 
wright 
and the principal friction now remaining between the capitol and 
white house hamilton said is that the president seems unwilling 
to back his good intentions with money 
but the hope remains that crippling distractions such as the 
fights over tower and wright are now over 
members welcome the change from the paralyzing obsession with 
scandal and ethics he said

at least six people were missing and three others apparently 
drowned 
people shouldnt be out there said jarred randall a 
narragansett ri police sergeant who rescued two teenagers from 
the water saturday night its just so majestic and inviting but 
it isnt safe 
though hundreds of miles from land gabrielles silent windless 
surges stirred waters along the northeast over the weekend 
officials attributed the deaths to the sea swells undertow and 
waves that reached 15 feet even on rivers 
by late sunday gabrielles highest sustained wind had decreased 
to 65 mph below the 74 mph threshhold for hurricanes the national 
hurricane center in florida said gabrielle had reached 135 mph at 
its height last week

north longitude 625 west or about 375 miles south southwest of 
sable island nova scotia 
gabrielle had remained almost stationary for more than a day and 
was expected to weaken further because it was over water too cold to 
provide energy for its circulation 
meanwhile another tropical depression formed and appeared headed 
for storm status forecasters said today its center was near 
latitude 130 north and longitude 257 west or about 150 miles 
southsouthwest of the southernmost cape verde islands of africa it 
was moving west at about 17 mph with wind estimated at 35 mph 
this is the peak of the tropical storm season and these 
tropical waves are moving off the coast of africa every three or 
four days like clockwork said hurricane specialist max mayfield 
at the hurricane center in coral gables 
gabrielle has been churning in the atlantic since aug 31 its 
vastness and power has prompted comparisons with last years 
hurricane gilbert which devastated jamaica 
jeff waldstreicher a meteorologist at the national weather 
service in boston said the waves and undertow were fierce up and 
down the coast 
you have these strong 100plus mile an hour winds that 
generate all these waves and long after the waves have crested you 
have all this energy moving the water from east to west 
waldstreicher said 
a 19yearold cushing maine woman apparently fell into the surf 
while walking with her brother and cousin saturday night along the 
rocky shore at the fishing village of tenants harbor the coast 
guard said 
the two men went into the water after her and also were quickly 
swept away from shore a fishing boat picked them up despite a 
coast guard search the woman remained missing sunday 
a coast guard helicopter rescued two surfers who got in trouble 
off new hampshire on sunday at the time the chopper was heading to 
salisbury beach mass to search for a missing swimmer said coast 
guard quartermaster 1st class david jersey in boston 
no one was found jersey said 
and north of boston an ipswich police patrol boat searched for a 
25yearold man who vanished in the rough waters of the ipswich 
river north of cape ann the man was with two other men and a baby 
sailing in an 18foot motor boat saturday when the vessel capsized 
the coast guard said the others were rescued by a passing vessel

soviet maverick boris n yeltsin said today that 
mikhail gorbachev has about six months to a year to achieve domestic 
progress or face revolution 
unless the soviet president can show progress during that time 
yeltsin said were going to have some very difficult times and 
this is something i want to discuss with the american 
administration 
yeltsin said on abcs good morning america that by 
difficult times he means movement from below it means 
revolution from below he added it already has begun in the form 
of strikes which are isolated but could spread and affect the 
entire country 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
asserted that yeltsin was expressing his own views and not those of 
the soviet government 
yeltsin and other deputies of the soviet parliament on visits to 
the united states are all unofficial delegations gerasimov said 
at a news conference 
a deputy has a right to his opinion gerasimov said but it 
doesnt necessarily coincide with the governments point of view 
if you want the official point of view listen to the foreign 
ministry he said if you want pluralism listen to the 
deputies 
on sunday yeltsin said newly elected soviet officials will take 
power from the communist party into their own hands as gorbachevs 
fortunes decline 
were having an economic crisis a financial crisis a 
political crisis the living standard is falling yeltsin said at 
a news conference sunday during his first trip to the united states 
we need a person who is more decisive than gorbachev he 
said adding that a revolution by the masses would be needed because 
were not really getting a revolution from above 
but yeltsin chairman of a newlyformed independent caucus in the 
soviet congress ruled out the possibility of a coup 
a coup detat is pretty unrealistic said yeltsin who 
arrived in new york on saturday to begin a private trip of about two 
weeks sponsored by the esalen institutes sovietamerican exchange 
program 
yeltsin 58 lost his position as moscows communist party chief 
in 1987 after criticizing the slow pace of change under gorbachev 
but this year he was elected with 90 percent of the vote to the 
soviet congress where he is an outspoken member of a radical bloc 
he said his country should learn from american democracy while 
changing its own political system 
we have to take what is positive from americas more than 
200 years of democratic experience and on the basis of that create 
a new model of socialism he said on cbs news face the nation 
i think you have a very healthy society here he said it 
seems as if capitalism is not rotting away and will not soon rot 
itself into extinction as we were told rather it seems to be 
prospering 
yeltsin said he hoped to meet with president bush to discuss how 
the united states could participate in measures to rescue 
perestroika 
but he said he has received no indication from the white house 
about the possibility of such a meeting 
roman popadiuk a white house spokesman said he was not aware of 
yeltsins desire to meet with bush and that there were no plans for 
such as a meeting 
yeltsin said the soviet union needs a new model of socialism 
possibly including a multiparty system 
we have to stop being so dogmatic as we were before he said 
he said the countries of eastern europe that were once pulled 
along by the soviet union have now overtaken it 
theyre now pulling us along because they can at least feed 
and clothe their own citizens 
the 25000 fees sponsors say yeltsin will receive for speeches 
during his tour will help fund aids research in the soviet union 
appearances have been announced in new york philadelphia 
chicago indianapolis minneapolis baltimore dallas miami and 
washington although final details of the schedule were not set 
sitting with reporters in the central park apartment of his 
american host yeltsin said he felt twice as free after circling 
the statue of liberty in a helicopter 
his 24 hours in new york had changed his ideas about america from 
the impression which has been pounded into my head in the 
ussr he said 
americans are in no way aggressive or badly behaved in fact 
they are very polite and optimistic lively wellintentioned and 
know how to live and know how to work

six months ago mayor edward i koch was an 
anyonecanbeathim underdog now hes a comebackoftheyear 
contender in his quest for an unprecedented fourth term 
polls have the threeterm incumbent running nearly even with his 
prime opponent manhattan borough president david dinkins in 
tuesdays democratic primary strategists on both sides said their 
ability to turn out voters would decide the election 
i think its going to be very very close said david garth 
kochs political and media adviser asked his plans for lastminute 
appeals he joked were going to ask the people to join us in 
prayer 
its neck and neck i dont think you can ever count out an 
incumbent who has been in office as long as ed koch said bill 
lynch dinkins campaign manager he claimed a slight lead 
confirmed by most polls 
a survey conducted friday and saturday by wabctv and the daily 
news found 49 percent for dinkins and 45 percent for koch but the 
margin of error for that poll was 6 points and previous polls 
showed the race within the margin of error 
koch has declared a big turnout i win but he also 
expressed more anxiety about this race than any other in his career 
meanwhile he presides over a troubled city 
when koch was elected to his third term in 1985 only a few 
investigators were aware of city corruption scandals about to break 
open crack was virtually unknown the full devastation of the aids 
epidemic was not yet generally apparent there were fewer homeless 
people crime rates had not hit the historic levels theyre at now 
the democratic primary is about all those issues said rep 
thomas manton democratic leader of the borough of queens and a new 
koch supporter but more than anything its a question of the 
incumbent and his record 
whatever the primarys outcome it will make history dinkins 
would be the first black nominated by a major party for mayor in new 
york koch would be the first mayor nominated for a fourth term 
the democratic nomination usually means election because five 
democrats are registered for each republican but rudolph w 
giuliani a popular former federal prosecutor is frontrunner for 
the gop nomination and could mount a serious challenge in the nov 7 
general election 
attention for the moment was riveted on the democratic race a 
contest of style as much as substance between the reserved 
unflappable dinkins and the outspoken occasionally outrageous koch 
but while he trailed badly in early polls koch appears to have 
regained many of the voters who had left him for the nowfaltering 
candidacy of city comptroller harrison j goldin goldin and a 
fourth candidate former transit chief richard ravitch trail badly 
as does giulianis only challenger in the republican primary 
cosmetics company heir ronald lauder 
kochs campaign has been focused on his record his tv ads are 
about what ed koch has done said lee miringoff pollster at the 
marist college institute for public opinion the net effect of 
that seems to be to have driven down his negative rating somewhat 
dinkins got help recently from jesse jackson who received 45 
percent of the new york city vote in last years democratic 
presidential primary 
jackson came back to energize our support said lynch but he 
has not played a major role because of his negative appraisal by 
many jews another important voting group 
jews may make up 25 percent of the democratic vote blacks up to 
a third koch himself is jewish 
the greatest energizer of the black vote may prove to be the aug 
23 killing of a black youth yusuf hawkins by a white gang koch 
drew sharp criticism by suggesting that protest marches after the 
killing had exacerbated racial tensions 
even before the killing dinkins stressed harmony and 
conciliation as his themes and since then he has maintained a 
soothing response but some analysts have suggested that the 
protests by militant blacks may give koch a white backlash vote 
said lynch i can make an argument for it hurting or helping 
certain help for dinkins will come from a major getoutthevote 
effort on his behalf by most of the citys largest unions including 
teachers municipal employees and teamsters 
koch with less union support and fewer volunteers of his own is 
unlikely to approach dinkins strength on the streets kochs aides 
express concern on this point and dinkins campaign manager called 
it crucial 
in a race thats neck and neck lynch said turnout is 
going to be the issue

the retail price of a gallon of gasoline 
dropped more than a penny in the past two weeks but wholesale 
prices are up meaning an increase at the pump is possible this 
fall an industry analyst says 
the nationwide average price for all grades at full and 
selfservice pumps was 10907 per gallon aug 25 to sept 9 a 
drop of 137 cents said trilby lundberg 
wholesale prices rose 033 cents as wholesalers inventories 
stockpiled after the exxon valdez oil spill returned closer to 
normal said ms lundberg director of the lundberg survey of 12000 
gasoline stations 
competition has dissuaded retailers from passing along the price 
increase but that could change ms lundberg said it now appears 
that gasoline retailers operating margins are being squeezed and 
that more of them may soon pass along the increases in the way of 
higher street prices she said 
the average price of a gallon at the pump has dropped 933 cents 
since it peaked may 19 ms lundberg said

japan will not grant refugee status to vietnamese 
and other indochinese escaping to this country solely for better 
economic prospects officials said today 
beginning wednesday japan will adopt a new screening process 
based on an international agreement in geneva in june said toshio 
tsunozaki director of the foreign ministrys human rights and 
refugee division 
we are implementing the measures to exclude the pseudorefugees 
and distinguish genuine refugees he said we would like to 
prevent abuse of very generous treatment by the japanese side 
many of the vietnamese boat people who arrived recently in japan 
told officials they came to escape poverty not because of 
religious political or racial persecution 
tsunozaki said those already granted refugee status would be 
allowed to stay 
japan would not push arriving boats back out to sea he added 
those who are refused refugee status would be detained in 
immigration centers until they can be repatriated he said 
more than 18 million indochinese refugees have been settled in 
some 30 countries but more than 165000 were still in camps in asia 
as of april 
so far this year 2950 vietnamese boat people have arrived in 
japan compared with 219 in all of 1988 
justice ministry officials have attributed the recent increase to 
japans former refugee policy 
unlike the united states as well as many asian nations japan 
has never distinguished between indochinese fleeing political 
persecution and those fleeing poverty 
tsunozaki said people from other nations fleeing political 
persecution also could apply for refugee status but would be 
handled separately from indochinese undergoing the screening process 
the geneva conference adopted a plan to screen all new arrivals 
from indochina to determine whether they should be granted refugee 
status or repatriated the conference also called for encouraging 
voluntary returns 
meanwhile 32 chinese arrived by boat on sept 3 seeking refugee 
status so that they could find jobs in japan toshiki eguchi an 
official of the justice ministrys refugee section told the 
associated press 
none of them was a political refugee they were illegal 
aliens eguchi said 
chinese also have been found masquerading as vietnamese refugees 
on some of the boats that have arrived from vietnam since may 29 
so far 639 chinese including the 32 who arrived sept 3 have 
been detained in eight immigration centers waiting to be sent back 
to china eguchi added 
some have said they fear punishment for fleeing if they are sent 
back 
tsunozaki said its not discrimination toward the chinese we 
dont want them to come to japan by boat illegally 
kyodo news service reported that some of the 32 chinese from 
fujian province had borrowed heavily to pay a broker in china to 
arrange their trip to japan 
quoting unnamed immigration officials kyodo said one of the 32 
told of borrowing 4865 at 36 percent interest to pay for the 
passage 
also each paid 1215 to another chinese broker for japanese 
immigration documents that turned out to be fake kyodo said 
in the geneva conference japan pledged to take 1000 more 
indochinese refugees as permanent residents over the next three 
years so far 6222 vietnamese have settled in japan as permanent 
residents

thomson pointed to a 1988 north carolina survey that found half 
of the high school juniors were working with 67 percent of these 
students holding jobs 20 hours or more a week 
in south korea he said students simply do not hold jobs while 
attending school in west germany students through all 13 years 
of schooling are not employed in the job market except perhaps 
informally in family businesses 
compared to their international counterparts most american 
students not only have fewer incentives to achieve good grades they 
also have more incentives to hold jobs during the school week 
thomson said in the article 
a high demand for cheap labor and a premium on teenage 
consumption lure students into the job market said thomson who 
examined five broad categories that researchers say consistently 
affect learning 
as for television thomson said 71 percent of 13yearold korean 
students consistently watch science programs while only 37 percent 
of americans of similar age watch science programs the lowest of 
any group studied in an international assessment of math and science 
schooling 
thomson said the market analysis firm teenage research 
unlimited found that televisions focus on the teenage consumer 
market has now dropped from age 18 to 15 because the typical high 
school junior has nearly 60 a week in spending money from jobs and 
allowances 
brand loyalties are established at an early age hence the hard 
sell to youth the american television industry tends to view 
children and youth as consumers rather than as learners he said 
the pressure on students to consume may soon extend to the school 
classroom as well said thomson whittle communications a 
subsidiary of timelife publishing corp is offering schools a 
daily 10minute news show with two minutes of advertising in return 
for an offer of free television monitors 
america received a d for prevalence of illegal drugs and bs for

syrian forces hammered lebanons 
beleaguered christian heartland with artillery rockets and tank 
fire early today setting pine forests on fire and trapping 
thousands of people in mountain towns 
police said 11 people were killed and 34 wounded in the shelling 
duels in the central mountains that form the eastern flank of the 
enclave and in clashes along beiruts dividing green line 
that raised the casualty toll to at least 844 killed and 2508 
wounded since march 8 when fighting erupted between christian 
leader gen michel aouns troops and the syrian army 
two syrian gunboats intercepted a merchant ship carrying food 
supplies to the enclave about 20 miles off the coast at midmorning 
police reported 
the gunboats escorted the unidentified ship to the 
syriancontrolled port of tripoli in north lebanon but police said 
they had no details of the ships nationality 
the syrian navy has turned back several ships trying to run the 
blockade of the christian sector in recent weeks eight vessels have 
been sunk or set on fire by syrian artillery as they tried to run 
the 6monthold blockade 
police said the artillery battles that intensified sunday night 
after several days of sporadic clashes were the heaviest in the 
mountains since the united nations security council issued a vain 
appeal for a ceasefire aug 16 
the surge of violence that raged through the night came two days 
before an arab league mediation committee was due to meet in saudi 
arabia to discuss reactivating a stalled peace initiative 
christian radio stations blamed the syrians for the escalation 
claiming they were out to sabotage the threenation committees 
efforts 
were back to the same old game said an announcer on the 
voice of free lebanon radio whenever the committee schedules a 
new meeting the syrians let all hell break loose while publicly 
pledging cooperation to defuse the fighting 
the centers of the fighting during the night were ein eltuffaha 
18 miles east of beirut and the christian strongpoint of souk 
elgharb 16 miles to the south 
the two towns control road networks leading into the besieged 
christian heartland from the predominantly shiite moslem bekaa 
valley and the druse moslem hinterland in the chouf mountains 
syrian guns battered the christian town of bikfaya hometown of 
former president amin gemayel for seven hours through the night 
setting surrounding pine forests on fire 
a police spokesmen who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said bikfayas estimated 15000 people were trapped in 
basements throughout the battle because the fires blocked all escape 
routes from town 
both sides battled with tanks around souk elgharb under siege 
by syrias moslem allies since 1983 
the syrians and their militia allies have been increasingly 
pressuring the christian defenses along the 66mile mountain front 
over the last few weeks 
but so far there has been no sign that they plan a major ground 
offensive into the 310squaremile enclave where an estimated 1 
million christians are trapped with their backs to the mediterranean 
sea 
along the green line syrian and christian troops clashed with 
automatic weapons behind howtizer and mortar barrages that kept most 
of beiruts remaining 150000 people in bomb shelters from dusk to 
dawn 
the rest of the battered citys 15 million people have fled over 
the last six months seeking refuge in north east and south lebanon 
the foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria which 
form the arab league committee on lebanon were scheduled to meet 
wednesday in jeddah on the red sea following weeks of highlevel 
diplomatic efforts by the soviet union and france 
it will be the committees first meeting since july 28 when it 
said its efforts had been stymied by syrian intransigence 
since then the soviets and french have sought to persuade the 
committee to try again 
aoun who wants to mobilize international support for his war 
of liberation against the syrians suffered a setback sept 6 when 
the americans withdrew their diplomats from beirut to climax a 
growing rift between the christians and washington 
with aoun and syrian president hafez assad deeply entrenched 
there were no clear signs that a renewed arab effort will succeed in 
ending the carnage and finding a settlement of the 14yearold 
lebanese civil war where previous attempts failed 
the syrians have refused to withdraw their 40000 troops deployed 
in mainly moslem areas of lebanon under a 1976 arab league mandate 
to quell the civil war

labor turmoil in which 
protesters burned trailers hurled rocks and overturned cars has 
some officials questioning the states commitment to squelching 
violence 
residents in this town of 6500 tried sunday to rebound from 
saturdays rampage by prounion activists who for weeks have been 
incensed at a contractors use of nonunion labor on a 535 million 
expansion of boise cascade corps paper mill 
damage was estimated at 13 million in the biggest disturbance 
since an estimated 150 union workers at the mill went on a wildcat 
strike in july five people were injured and 32 arrested and 
officials criticized gov rudy perpich for not calling out the 
national guard 
authorities planned more arrests after reviewing videotapes and 
perpich said evidence would be sent to the us attorneys office 
for possible federal charges 
yesterday was a sad day for us in international falls the 
rev robert a kitchen pastor of faith united church of christ 
said sunday it was a day of desperation of anger of 
hopelessness perhaps 
kitchen described the unrest as an open wound that we know has 
ripped our community apart and he prayed that the community pull 
together and denounce the violence 
about 370 nonunion workers in five buses entered the 
construction site under police escort early sunday police reported 
no problems 
on saturday about 45 police officers used tear gas to disperse 
about 400 protesters dozens of whom stormed housing trailers that 
had been evacuated the night before 
law enforcement officials requested the national guard the 
governor put troops on alert but decided not to deploy them after 
calm was restored 
perpich acknowledged sunday that intelligence reports a few days 
earlier indicated potential trouble over the weekend but perpich 
said the state could not send in the guard simply in anticipation of 
trouble 
the only place where there is complete safety is in east 
europe because the armys there all the time that way you have 
perfect control perpich said in st paul this is a free 
society and you do not use the national guard for law 
enforcement its a military organization 
union officials have not sanctioned the strike and say they have 
tried to dissuade protesters from violence or mass demonstrations 
bill peterson head of the minnesota building trades council 
said sunday that his union group planned a rally for next weekend in 
the capital st paul 
we think any rally at international falls ought not be held 
because we were sure that tensions running as high as they were 
there could be some problems he said 
boise spokesman andrew drysdale said the guard should have been 
called out because violence could erupt again i think its highly 
likely this wont be the last thing theyll pull he said 
and sheriff william elliott said hes unsure local law 
enforcement agencies have the manpower to quell future disturbances 
the problem we have in northern minnesota is were so far away 
from help he said we need an early response and the law 
enforcement agencies are so spread apart we may have difficulty 
getting that 
mark shields superintendent of the state bureau of criminal 
apprehension said eight agents were sent to international falls a 
few days ago based on reports of potential violence 
we were present perpich said and its because of our 
presence that those people who were responsible are all going to be 
brought to justice

the homely muscovy duck has exposed a 
cruel streak among floridians 
muscovies in recent weeks have been beaten to death shot with 
steeltipped darts and in one instance kicked and hacked to 
pieces in front of a group of children 
something needs to be done uniformly to stop the mutilation 
said cindy mosling who heads the bird emergency aid amp kare 
sanctuary or beaks 
normally found around the ponds of parks and apartment complexes 
the heavyset muscovies are best known for waddling after children 
eating huge amounts hissing like snakes and breeding like rabbits 
they grow up to 15 inches high and have dark feathers with white 
splotches and red wattling above their beaks 
the florida game and fresh water fish commission is drafting a 
policy on how the state should deal with the muscovies as well as 
other nuisance fowl which include urban mallards 
officials say they suspect property owners are killing the ducks 
because of their droppings there are records and records and 
records of violence against the ducks said ms mosling 
we as a society wouldnt condone it if dogs and cats were 
mutiliated on the streets she said for some reason people can 
justify cruelty if its a homely victim 
muscovies which can fly short distances are native to latin 
america twenty to 25 years ago they were brought to florida as an 
ornamental species to liven up the ponds and lagoons around 
residental communities said rich turnbull a state waterfowl 
biologist 
because they are not native to florida the muscovies are not 
protected by state wildlife laws but they are protected under laws 
against cruelty to animals

a house ways and means committee member said 
today he will attempt to amend a capitalgains tax cut that the 
panel is expected to approve this week so none of the benefit would 
go to people with incomes over 200000 a year 
if we are going to offer a capitalgains exclusion we should 
offer it to those wno need it rep byron l dorgan dnd told 
a news conference those who have incomes in the millions can well 
afford the modest top tax rates under todays tax system 
dorgans limited capitalgains reduction would be financed by 
raising from 28 percent to 33 percent the maximum tax rate that 
applies to all types of income earned by wealthier taxpayers 
the ways and means committee will resume consideration tuesday of 
a plan endorsed by president bush that would allow investors to 
avoid tax on 30 percent of capital gains which are profits from the 
sale of stock and other assets congressional staff experts estimate 
that 80 percent of the benefit of such a reduction would go to those 
with annual incomes above 100000 
that proposal sponsored chiefly by reps ed jenkins dga and 
bill archer rtexas apparently has the support of a bare majority 
of the ways and means committee 
dorgan said he would prefer no change in taxation of capital 
gains which now are taxed at the same rates as other income he is 
offering the alternative he said only because it appears the 
committee will approve a capitalgains cut 
under dorgans proposal 
thirty percent of capital gains would be excluded from taxation 
for couples with total income of 100000 or less 
the portion of the gain that would be excluded from taxation 
would decline gradually as income rises between 100000 and 
200000 at 150000 income the exclusion would be 15 percent 
no exclusion would be allowed once total income exceeds 200000 
a year 
a quirk in the 1986 tax law that has some people paying a lower 
rate as income rises would be eliminated for example a couple with 
two children and taxable income of 300000 now paying a 28 percent 
rate on all above 201500 would have to pay 33 percent on all above 
that level 
that rate change would affect only the wealthiest 1 percent of 
taxpayers dorgan said

colombians following an unprecendented government crackdown on 
traffickers announced aug 18 
the mostwanted cocaine chieftains remain at large and it doesnt 
appear the government knows where they are despite a 250000 reward 
offered for information on their whereabouts colombia on sunday 
signed extradition papers for three alleged traffickers 
the crackdown has been supported by president bush and is the 
focus of a un meeting that opened today in vienna on the issue

socalled fantasy island on the magdalena river running through 
colombias midwest 
the properties are said to belong to the top two and most wanted

active in the medellin cartel supplier of most of the cocaine sold 
on us streets 
an official of the governments drug council created to deal 
with narcotics trafficking said authorities signed the extradition 
order on the three two men and a woman who are accused by the 
united states of cocaine trafficking and money laundering

support of the united states the largest drug consumer 
the bush administration is giving colombias narcotics forces 65 
million worth of military equipment which includes planes 
helicopters jeeps and weapons for the campaign

the massachusetts bar has opened preliminary 
disciplinary proceedings against rep barney frank dmass who 
recently admitted paying a male prostitute for sex the washington 
times reports 
the proceedings were triggered when george washington university 
professor john f banzhaf iii last week filed a complaint with the 
states board of overseers 
assistant board counsel terence troyar told the times in an 
interview from boston on friday the boards proceedings are 
confidential and i can neither confirm or deny that proceedings are 
under way against any individual 
but troyar confirmed that such proceedings are automatic once a 
complaint has been filed frank has 20 days to respond in writing 
and banzhaf may then submit a counterresponse 
a bar inquiry could produce sanctions as serious as disbarment 
frank has never practiced law and is listed as an inactive lawyer by 
the board 
such inquiries are normally kept confidential but banzhaf has 
asked frank to agree to open them 
he says the matter should be cleared up banzhaf said 
certainly the public wants to know and the best way is through a 
relatively neutral forum the board of overseers which has the 
expertise to resolve these kinds of issues 
frank who is gay admitted last month that he paid prostitute 
stephen gobie for sexual services then hired the man to be his 
personal aide frank said he knew gobie was continuing to work as a 
prostitute but denied knowledge that gobie was running a 
prostitution service from the congressmans basement apartment on 
capitol hill he said he fired gobie in 1987 when he found out 
frank also said he wrote several letters to gobies probation 
officer seeking to suspend the prostitutes probationary period and 
that he used his congressional immunity to void gobies traffic 
tickets 
frank himself has called for an investigation into the matter by 
the house ethics committee saying he wants to clear the public 
record

the body of a palestinian man was found today in 
a west bank village raided by the army raising to seven the number 
of arabs killed by israeli security the previous day 
it was one of the bloodiest days of the 21month palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule in the occupied gaza strip and west 
bank 
in southern lebanon israeli troops today killed two guerrillas 
in a clash the second gun battle there in three days lebanese 
security sources reported 
they said two israeli soldiers were wounded in the firefight near 
the village of kfar kila in israels selfdesignated security 
zone 
an israeli army spokeswoman in jerusalem confirmed the clash but 
said only three soldiers were wounded and one guerrilla was captured 
the lebanese national resistance front a loose coalition of 
prosyrian leftist and palestinian guerrillas claimed 
responsibility for the shootout in a statement that gave no other 
details 
finance minister shimon peres meanwhile said he thought a 
proposal by egyptian president hosni mubarak could be the basis for 
opening talks with israel on middle east peace peres is head of the 
leftleaning labor party 
his stand will likely heighten debate in israel on mubaraks plan 
since labors coalition partner in the government the rightwing 
likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir is opposed to the 
egyptian proposal 
the victim of the army raid in the west bank identified as 
zuhair abdul halim 28 was found dead under a tree in the village 
of kafr quddum with gunshot wounds in the neck and stomach arab 
reporters said 
residents of kafr quddum said abdul halim apparently was killed 
in yesterdays clash in which another villager also died and six 
were wounded 
villagers said kafr quddum was raided by about 10 men in civilian 
cloths but the army issued a statement saying an army patrol opened 
fire in the village when it was attacked by palestinians youths 
during an arrest raid 
the army spokesmans office said it was checking the report of a 
second death 
abdul halims death was the seventh reported in scattered clashes 
sunday it was the highest oneday toll since may 19 when eight 
palestinians were shot and killed in a series of clashes with 
soldiers 
the heaviest day of casualties in the uprising occurred on april 
16 1988 when 18 palestinians were shot and killed in riots that 
followed the assassination in tunis of plo military commander khalil 
wazir better known as abu jihad 
abdul halims death raised to 567 the number of palestinians 
killed by israelis in the uprising forty israelis also have died in 
the violence 
in other violence the body of a palestinian suspected of 
collaborating with israeli authorities was found in an orange grove 
in the gaza strip 
the death raised to 113 the number of palestinians slain by 
fellow arabs during the uprising as accused collaborators 
prostitutes or drug dealers 
arab hospital officials said five palestinians were wounded in 
clashes with israeli troops today including a 17yearold youth 
from the west bank village of tamoun in critical condition with a 
bullet in the back 
the latest discussion on the stalled middle east peace process 
concerns mubaraks proposal designed to get palestinian backing for 
israels call for elections in the occupied territories 
his 10point peace plan includes israeli acceptance of the 
usbacked concept of trading land for peace and allowing the 
140000 arabs of east jerusalem to vote in the elections israel is 
proposing to choose palestinian negotiators 
a lebanese security source said todays 90minute border clash 
broke out after the guerrillas had infiltrated the israelioccupied 
area one mile west of the israeli border possibly with the 
intention of attacking an israeli post there when they were 
spotted 
the source who requested anonymity said about 120 israeli 
soldiers backed by 20 armored personnel carriers and tanks and two 
helicopters later carried out a search operation around kfar kila 
for more guerrillas 
israel carved out the six to 10miledeep border zone when it 
withdrew the bulk of its army in 1985 after a threeyear occupation 
of south lebanon 
the zone patrolled by israeli troops and militia allies serves 
as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern israeli 
settlements

the bulletin of atomic scientists whose clock has 
ticked a few minutes before nuclear midnight for 42 years says it 
will begin taking environmental dangers poverty and other threats 
into account in moving the hands 
during the cold war and detente the clock represented the 
worlds proximity to nuclear annihilation with the easing of 
ussoviet tensions the clock will also reflect other dangers to 
survival said editor len ackland 
its a recognition that international security has to be 
thought about in more than simple military terms ackland said 
it doesnt mean in any way that military security is less 
important 
the clock isnt a real timepiece it is a logo of a clock 
face printed in the bulletin beginning this week with the october 
issue the doomsday clock logo will soon consist of the clock 
face superimposed on a globe 
the clock which first appeared in 1947 has represented an 
estimate by the editors and an international board of scientists of 
the worlds proximity to the nuclear destruction the hands have 
been reset 12 times 
the closest it ever got to midnight 1157 was in 1951 after 
the soviets exploded an atom bomb and again in 1983 when 
ussoviet arms talks were suspended 
the clock has remained at 1154 since january 1988 when the 
united states and soviet union signed a treaty to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
in the past year and a half we have certainly seen progress in 
improving the ussoviet union arms control negotiations ackland 
said in a telephone interview from his suburban oak park home 
once tensions dropped down it enabled us to take a look around 
and recognize there are many other dangers that threaten our 
survival and environmental concerns are probably the most 
conspicuous 
we felt this was a very important time to redefine what 
national security is ackland said sunday 
we need to also recognize there are a lot of connections with 
environmental issues economic depression and poverty around the 
world because those are the kinds of things that could escalate 
quickly 
john peoples director of the fermi national accelerator 
laboratory near chicago said the change in focus is necessary and 
important if not tardy 
irrespective of whether the cold war is dissolving one has to 
pay attention to the environment he said certainly things like 
chernobyl and bhopal they have to have equal priority 
in 1986 the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the soviet union 
exploded spewing radiation that killed at least 32 people and 
eventually swirled around the globe a gas leak from a union carbide 
pesticide plant killed more than 3400 people in bhopal india in 
1984

thousands of ecstatic east german 
refugees poured into west germany today after hungary defied a 
warsaw pact ally and boldly threw open a door to the west 
you made it yelled one young emigre hitting the hood of his 
wartburg minibus after arriving in the largest mass migration from 
east germany since the berlin wall went up in 1961 
east germany angrily denounced the exodus and accused hungary of 
smuggling human beings 
hungary opened its border to the west at midnight to the east 
germans the decision came despite hungarys concerns that the 
nation could become a conduit for tens of thousands of other 
refugees from soviet bloc nations 
in yugoslavia meanwhile about 100 romanians who have fled from 
their communist country gathered today at a un office in belgrade 
applying to be resettled in the west 
bavarian border police said more than 2000 east german refugees 
mostly young couples or families with young children had arrived 
from hungary through austria by midmorning with hundreds more 
streaming in later in the day the total reportedly could top 10000 
austrian border officials said more than 5700 refugees had 
crossed the border into austria by midafternoon in budapest 
officials of the west german charity running the refugee camps said 
the last bus carrying the remnants of the about 7000 registered at 
the hungarian camps left this afternoon 
west germanys zdf television network said the total number 
expected to reach the west in the current exodus could be well 
over 10000 
a 40yearold leipzig man who would not give his name said i 
decided on escaping 27 years ago and today it worked its a 
feeling thats just tops just wild 
the emigration came despite efforts by diehard communists in 
east berlin to dissuade hungarys reformminded leaders 
as it took place a west german newspaper and television network 
today reported the condition of east german leader erich honecker 
who underwent gall bladder surgery last month has deteriorated 
badly government officials in bonn declined comment 
hungarian radio compared the east germans noisy departure by 
car bus and train to a new years eve celebration with horns 
blaring and people shouting 
thousands of east germans had flooded into hungary on tourist 
visas after it tore down its border fence with austria in may 
east germany accused hungary of interfering in its internal 
affairs by allowing the mass flight and becoming the first east bloc 
government to help citizens of an ally freely leave their homeland 
the staterun news agency adn said hungary under the guise of 
humanitarianism has engaged in the organized smuggling of human 
beings 
there have been news reports that the east german government was 
planning to curb travel to hungary but the east berlin leadership 
has denied it intends to impose such restrictions 
but while hungary risked worsened relations with an east bloc 
ally it could develop closer and potentially lucrative ties with 
common market member west germany 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher whose 
country offers east germans automatic citizenship and help getting 
settled hailed hungarys move as representative of its humane 
policies 
an estimated 60000 east germans were in hungary on sunday and 
the hungarian foreign minister gyula horn suggested that many more 
than the 6500 formally registered as wanting to leave might cross 
into austria 
even as the first convoys of refugees made their way into 
austria new east german arrivals were reported at several refugee 
camps in hungary 
in bavaria the refugees lined up to register with charities and 
border authorities as parents stretched filled out forms or cupped 
hands around containers of coffee handed out by volunteers children 
lined up in the morning mist for teddy bears picture books and 
other donated playthings 
west german red cross workers had braced for the onslaught by 
hastily erecting tent communities in several bavarian towns last 
month but most of those arriving early today opted to drive on to 
relatives in cities as far away as hamburg 
for many of the thousands who began crossing into austria shortly 
after midnight leaving hungary was occasion for tumultuous 
celebration 
lines of cars horns honking formed on the hungarian side with 
some passengers waving champagne bottles out of car windows on 
arrival in nickelsdorf an austrian border town dozens jumped from 
their cars to dance in the street cheered on by a growing crowd of 
austrians 
while the crossing into west germany was more subdued for most 
some of the east germans again were overtaken by emotion 
a man from thueringen accompanied by his wife and their 
3yearold son told reporters of the joy he and his countrymen 
experienced when told sunday night that they could leave for the 
west 
my wife and i bawled and the little one laughed he said 
chuckling 
this is great shouted udo a 26year old from dresden one 
of a group of four east germans in their 20s who shared a car for 
the freedom convoy 
we applied to leave three years ago and we got rejected a 
month ago he said explaining his decision to flee through 
hungary 
for those without cars the austrian federal railways had readied 
90 rail cars capable of carrying 8000 people west german rail 
officials said 
west germany moved an additional 40 railway cars to several 
border points while austrian transport officials had more than 50 
buses ready 
the fate of the refugees had been discussed for weeks by east and 
west germany but hungary said without elaboration that the talks 
had failed 
the hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow east 
german citizens to travel to west germany in violation of 
international treaty adn charged sunday night 
hungary decided to suspend a 1969 agreement with east germany 
that says hungary should not take into account west germanys claim 
to east germans said horn 
horn said hungary decided to act unilaterally after east germany 
rejected its calls to treat emigration applications by those 
returning home favorably 
about 6000 east germans had already fled to the west this summer 
through hungary which with poland is gradually liberalizing while 
neighbor east bloc governments resist the more freer climate under 
mikhail s gorbachev clinging to authoritarian ways 
several hundred east germans seeking safe passage to the west 
are now holed up in west germanys embassy in prague czechoslovakia

pilot error and bad weather caused a 
philippine airlines plane to overshoot the runway and slam into a 
busy highway last july killing eight people according to a report 
released monday 
about 90 people were injured when the twinengine bac 111 jet 
plowed through a concrete wall slammed into four vehicles along 
manilas south expressway and came to rest on railway tracks all 
the dead were in cars on the highway 
the governments air transportation office released a 13page 
report on the july 21 accident after completing six weeks of 
investigation 
the probable cause of the accident was that the pilot exhibited 
poor judgment during landing and that the weather was a contributory 
factor said the office chairman oscar alejandro who read the 
findings to reporters 
analyses of the flight recorders showed the pilot twice told 
tower controllers he could not see the runway because of heavy rains 
as he made his approach after a flight from zamboanga city 540 
miles to the south alejandro said 
when the airplane was 150 feet above the runway tower 
controllers saw the plane and told the pilot to accelerate 
alejandro said 
it was at this point that the air traffic controllers told the 
pilot to make a misapproach in other words to go around and try 
for another landing alejandro said instead the pilot decided 
to land 
alejandro said that under philippine law testimony in the report 
cannot be used against the pilot capt ricardo misa in any civil 
suits 
our investigation is not punitive we just want to know what 
happened so we can correct them so that it does not happen again 
alejandro said 
the report recommended that approach and landing lights be 
repaired both at manila and the international airport in cebu city 
alejandro said there were conflicting reports if the lights were 
actually on during the accident

a landslide that sent 25000 cubic yards 
of rock tumbling into a gorge has caused the formation of a lake in 
the siskiyou national forest 
the unnamed lake apparently was formed last year and was 
discovered three weeks ago by us forest service surveyors 
its pretty impressive said galice ranger district 
hydrologist patricia carroll who estimates the lake may be 40 to 50 
feet deep and 2000 feet long when silver creek is high 
the lake is one mile downstream from silver falls and about 25 
miles west of grants pass it probably too small and shallow to 
provide prime fish habitat but carroll and others think it can 
become a fine recreation area nearby falls rich vegetation and the 
dramatic sheer rock and cliff formations make for striking scenery

jury selection began today in the 
trial of a former nurses aide accused of smothering five nursing 
home patients in a pact with her lesbian lover 
circuit judge roman snow rejected defense requests to move the 
trial outside the county and to dismiss the charges based on a 
private polygraph test 
gwendolyn graham 25 is accused of smothering five women 
patients in 1987 during her overnight shift at alpine manor nursing 
home in suburban walker she is charged with five counts of murder 
and one of conspiracy and could be sentenced to life in prison 
the key witness is expected to be her alleged accomplice and 
former lover catherine wood last week she pleaded guilty to one 
count each of murder and conspiracy other charges were dropped in 
exchange for her testimony 
in previous court appearances wood has said she and graham 
discussed killing as many as 20 patients she described how graham 
chose patients whose poor condition would leave no signs of a 
struggle and used a washcloth she carried in her back pocket to 
suffocate them 
wood said graham told her that killing the patients helped her 
relieve tension wood 27 said she agreed to go along with the 
killings sometimes acting as a lookout because she hoped it would 
bind her with her lover 
she was always happy when one of them died wood testified 
wood also said that graham took a souvenir from each victim 
including earrings anklets and handkerchiefs and that the two had 
planned to select victims whose initials spelled murder but the 
plan failed because some victims struggled too much 
grahams attorney said he believes wood is a pathological liar 
and made up the story to get even with graham for leaving her for 
another woman 
police began investigating late last year after woods exhusband 
reported she told him she took part in the slayings 
the deaths of the five patients ages 60 to 97 had been 
attributed to natural causes and no autopsies were performed three

forest fires caused by tank and artillery 
battles raged in the hills around beirut on monday trapping 
thousands of people in mountain towns ringed by flames at least 11 
people were reported killed in the latest fighting 
in the waters off the christian sector syrian gunboats seized a 
ship carrying supplies to the beleaguered christians a senior iraqi 
official said iraq will urge arab league ministers to call an 
emergency arab summit to press syria to leave lebanon 
the second gunfight in three days erupted in south lebanon where 
israeli troops killed at least one guerrilla 
the mountain fighting centered on ein eltuffaha 18 miles east 
of beirut and the christian stronghold of souk elgharb 16 miles 
to the south the two towns sit on roads leading to the christian 
enclave from the predominantly shiite moslem bekaa valley 
syrian guns above ein eltuffaha hammered the christian town of 
bekfaya for seven hours setting the surrounding woods afire 
bekfayas estimated 15000 people were trapped in basements 
because fires blocked all escape routes from the town another 5000 
people were stuck in nearby ein saadeh said a police spokesman 
both sides battled with tank fire overnight and through the day 
monday around souk elgharb ringed by syrias druse allies 
along beiruts dividing green line syrian and christian troops 
clashed with automatic weapons as howitzer and mortar guns thundered 
overhead keeping the citys remaining 150000 residents in bomb 
shelters 
most of beiruts 15 million people have fled the battered city 
over the past six months seeking refuge in north east and south 
lebanon 
police said 11 people died and 34 were wounded in the latest 
syrianchristian duels that raised the casualty toll to at least 
844 killed and 2508 wounded since march 8 when fighting erupted 
between the soldiers of christian army commander gen michel aoun 
and the syrian army 
the mountain battles were the heaviest since the un security 
council appealed for a ceasefire aug 16 
in recent weeks the syrians and druse militiamen have been 
pressuring the christian defenses along the 66mile mountain front 
forming the eastern flank of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
where an estimated 1 million christians are trapped with their backs 
to the mediterranean 
two syrian gunboats intercepted the merchant ship carla about 20 
miles off the coast of the enclave at midmorning as it tried to 
bring supplies to the christians a police spokesman said 
the vessel was escorted to the syriancontrolled port of tripoli 
in north lebanon the spokesman said speaking on condition of 
anonymity he had no information about its nationality or owners 
the syrian navy has turned back several ships trying to reach the 
christian sector eight vessels have been sunk or set on fire by 
syrian artillery 
christian radio stations blamed the syrians for the escalation in 
fighting claiming they want to sabotage peace efforts of an arab 
league committee 
were back to the same old game said an announcer on the 
voice of free lebanon radio whenever the committee schedules a 
new meeting the syrians let all hell break loose while publicly 
pledging cooperation to defuse the fighting 
the foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria the 
three members of the committee are to meet wednesday in saudi 
arabia in an effort to reactivate peace efforts 
it will be their first meeting since july 28 when they said 
efforts to reach a ceasefire had been stymied by syrian 
intransigence 
the syrians have 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate to quell the civil war aoun says the 
syrians betrayed their peacekeeping mission by siding with the 
moslems in the civil war the syrians refuse to withdraw their 
troops 
a senior iraqi official in baghdad who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press his country believes an 
emergency arab league summit is the best way to end lebanons 
14yearold war 
he said iraq will urge arab league ministers to call the summit 
to press syria to leave lebanon 
iraq is syrias archrival in the arab world and backs lebanons 
christians 
in south lebanon lebanese security sources said israeli soldiers 
killed two guerrillas in a firefight in israels selfdeclared 
security zone the israeli army said one guerrilla was killed 
and another captured 
the sources said two israeli soldiers were wounded the israeli 
army reported three soldiers wounded 
the lebanese national resistance front a loose coalition of 
prosyrian leftist and palestinian guerrillas claimed 
responsibility for the shootout in a terse statement that gave no 
other details 
a source said the guerrillas infiltrated the security zone 
possibly with the intention of attacking an israeli post there 
when they were spotted 
israel carved out the 6 to 10milewide strip to protect itself

the defense nuclear agency says it will look 
beyond texas for a site to conduct deepunderground explosions 
after abandoning its preferred location at a del rio ranch the 
states senators said monday 
after local residents complained the tests might affect the only 
source of water in the border community the dna said last month it 
would discontinue studying the buck king ranch site but that it 
would evaluate other sites in texas 
in a letter released today by sens lloyd bentsen and phil gramm 
the dnas new director maj gen gerald g watson said the 
pentagon agency has stopped all test drilling operations at the 
site is shutting down the drilling rig and has begun cleanup 
operations 
currently we are reexamining our geologic and hydrologic data 
base outside texas for the purpose of finding the next best site for 
the program watson said in a letter dated sept 8 
the pentagon agency had spent two years before chosing the buck 
king ranch for additional evaluation to determine its suitability 
for the nonnuclear explosions the tests are designed to simulate 
the impact of nuclear blasts on subterranean missile silos and to 
evaluate the hardness of us and soviet deep underground command 
and control facilities 
this is a good decision easing our concerns about possible 
damage to the water supply in an area where water is scarce and 
responding to the strong community opposition said bentsen a 
democrat 
gramm a republican said he was delighted that the dna has 
reached a final decision to pack up and look elsewhere for a test 
site its clear from the directors latest letter that the 
unanimity of local opposition had a strong specific impact on the 
dnas decision

ten harris county jail inmates remained 
hospitalized monday eight with flulike symptoms and two with the 
same bacterial infection that has killed two other prisoners 
authorities said 
the eight inmates symptoms which included fever dizziness and 
nausea could be early signs of the same deadly bacteria or they may 
just be indications of the flu or a mild infection ben taub 
hospital spokeswoman nora shire said 
one of the two inmates who has the bacterial infection was in 
very critical condition ms shire said he has a fever congestion 
and is on a respirator 
jail inmates say they have been in near panic since the outbreak 
began last week with guards reportedly shunning anyone with a runny 
nose or other symptom of the pneumococcus bacteria infection 
this thing is either going to kill us or were going to kill 
each other inmate mike reese told the houston chronicle he was a 
cellmate of one of the men who died of the illness thursday 
preliminary autopsy results indicate the two dead men had 
pneumococcus or pneumococcal sepsis a bacterial infction that 
affects the lungs 
neither of the men who died had a spleen and that is believed to 
be a contributing factor in their deaths removal of the spleen 
which helps clean the blood can impair the immune system 
the inmate in critical condition also does not have a spleen 
said jail medical administrator lanny chopin 
chopin said county authorities have not found a common source of 
the infection the dead inmates were in separate cellblocks on the 
ninth floor officials said 
at least two representatives of the federal centers for disease 
control were to fly to houston to help investigate the illnesses 
ms shire said

a pile of more than 1 million used tires 
caught fire for the second time in five years and spewed acrid 
black smoke today 
john gifford spokesman for the state office of emergency 
management said it could take days or even weeks to put out the 
blaze at the sevenacre dump 
gov judd gregg this morning called the fire a disaster waiting 
to happen and it happened 
another fire burned at the site for days in 1984 and state 
officials later seized the dump in an attempt to clear it the blaze 
broke out as a company hired by the state in july was about to get 
rid of the tires said gregg who earlier this summer declared the 
gargantuan pile a plague on danville and the state 
about 175 firefighters from 48 communities removed tires from the 
fires path and dug trenches about onethird of the pile was on 
fire 
the fire whose cause had not been determined broke out about 
730 pm sunday at midmorning flames were visible a mile away and 
smoke could be seen from eight miles 
about 50 people were evacuated from their homes sunday and early 
today and several roads in the rural area 40 miles north of boston 
were closed 
amy juchatz a toxicologist in the state division of public 
health services said smoke from burning tires could contain harmful 
lead and zinc as well as chemicals that can cause cancer 
an environmental protection agency team was being rushed from new 
jersey to assist gifford said 
the state sued ernest hunt who began collecting the tires about 
15 years ago after the 1984 fire and later seized control of the 
dump from him 
at one point hunt was declared financially unable to clean up 
the dump but he was later indicted on perjury charges stemming from 
what he said during that hearing authorities said his whereabouts 
are unknown officials said 
after seizing the dump the state contracted with integrated tire 
of buffalo ny to shred the tires and ship them to greece to fuel 
a cement plant 
the blaze was so severe that firefighters quit using water on it 
this morning because even at 2500 gallons per minute it vaporized 
immediately 
instead a hastily assembled fleet of 22 large trucks began 
dumping 25ton loads of dirt onto the fire from a nearby 
sandandgravel pit 
fire chief bill timmons said the dumping would continue for at 
least a couple of days 
paul groulx of epas regional office in boston said 500000 from 
the agencys superfund program was allocated this morning to help 
pay for the firefighting because of the potential for contamination 
of the air and ground

noting that 10 children were among the 112 
victims of a jetliner crash in iowa us rep jim lightfoot on 
monday called for federal regulations requiring the use of child 
safety seats on airplanes 
theres good reason to believe that if some of those children 
had been better restrained they would have survived the crash 
said lightfoot an iowa republican who sits on the house aviation 
subcommittee 
lightfoot called for the federal aviation administration to write 
new rules requiring all children under 2 to be restrained in an 
approved seat 
most states mandate the use of safety seats in cars yet we 
dont extend the same protection to children who fly even though 
theyre extremely vulnerable to the hazards inherrent in air 
travel he said in a news release 
ten children including two infants died when united airlines 
flight 232 crashed july 19 in sioux city 
lightfoot said he is writing a letter to faa administrator james 
busey to ask that the agency review its regulations on the safety 
seats and he is asking the house aviation subcommittee to hold 
hearings on the issue 
faa spokesman dick stafford said from washington monday that the 
agency has been reviewing its policy on child restraints since the 
sioux city crash he said he was not familiar with lightfoots 
proposal and could not speculate on what regulations might be 
adopted in the future

police said monday they will 
stop using whips against antiapartheid protesters because of 
negative reactions at home and abroad 
two prominent critics of the police anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu and the rev allan boesak discussed their concerns in cape 
town with diplomats from the united states and 14 other countries 
tutu said he asked the diplomats to categorically condemn the 
brutalities of the security forces 
activists claim at least 23 and as many as 29 black and 
mixedrace people were killed sept 6 in election night violence 
allegedly instigated by police in townships near cape town 
law and order minister adriaan vlok has called tutu a liar and 
disputed the activists figures vlok says 10 people were killed in 
blackonblack factional fighting and that five other deaths are 
under investigation 
even if we dealt only with the police figure it is a 
scandal tutu said fifteen is a massacre 
us ambassador william swing was among the diplomats meeting 
with tutu and boesak 
my government believes it is important to listen to their 
concerns and their points of view particularly about the recent 
deaths in the cape town area swing said afterward we are 
saddened by the reports of the deaths and we deplore this and all 
violence 
relatives of several victims say police were responsible for the 
killings journalists and residents saw police marching through the 
townships firing live ammunition 
police and demonstrators have clashed almost daily since a 
nationwide campaign to defy antiapartheid laws began aug 2 the 
protests were designed to mobilize opposition to the segregated 
parliamentary elections which excluded blacks but activists have 
vowed to continue the campaign 
police have used whips live ammunition rubber bullets and tear 
gas to break up recent protests 
the whips often were employed because as a rule it may result 
in less serious injuries than for example batons a police 
statement said 
but the statement added the use of quirts has resulted in 
negative reaction from the public also internationally so it has 
been decided to stop its use 
among those alleging police brutality is a mixedrace police 
lieutenant gregory rockman who said riot squad members acted like 
wild dogs when they beat schoolchildren and bystanders during a 
peaceful preelection protest 
rockman said he received a telephone call monday at the police 
station where he works and was told he would be killed 
a march protesting police violence is planned in cape town on 
wednesday when the electoral college is expected to give acting 
president fw de klerk a full fiveyear term 
cape town mayor gordon oliver and several antiapartheid members 
of the city council say they will help lead the march along with 
tutu and boesak a mixedrace minister who is president of the world 
alliance of reformed churches 
oliver has urged police to stay away or if they must be there 
they should take a lowprofile role and not intervene 
a progovernment newspaper beeld called monday for a full 
accounting of the election violence 
did those who maintain law and order commit all those deeds 
attributed to them beeld asked in an editorial are archbishop 
tutu and dr boesaks allegations totally false or do they contain 
a grain of truth even a grain would be too much

jury selection began monday in the 
trial of a former nurses aide charged with killing five nursing 
home patients in a bizarre pact with her lesbian lover who has 
pleaded guilty 
gwendolyn graham is charged with five counts of firstdegree 
murder for allegedly smothering the women at alpine manor nursing 
home in suburban walker she also is charged with one count of 
conspiracy to murder 
kent county chief circuit judge roman snow denied defense motions 
to move the trial to another county and to dismiss the charges based 
on results of a private polygraph test 
prosecutors are basing most of their case on the confessions of 
grahams alleged accomplice and former livein companion catherine 
wood 
wood pleaded guilty last week to one count each of seconddegree 
murder and conspiracy to commit murder two counts of firstdegree 
murder against her were dropped in exchange for her testimony 
against graham wood faces up to life in prison with a chance of 
parole in 10 years 
wood has said she and graham discussed killing as many as 20 
patients during their overnight shifts at alpine manor in 1987 
graham 25 is accused of smothering the victims with washcloths 
choosing those patients whose poor physical condition would leave no 
signs of a struggle almost all of the patients were bedridden and 
many suffered from alzheimers disease 
wood 27 said graham told her killing the patients helped her 
relieve stress she said she agreed to go along with the killings 
sometimes acting as a lookout because she hoped it would bind their 
love 
graham and wood allegedly took souvenirs from each victim 
including earrings and handkerchiefs and had planned to spell 
murder with the victims initials that plan failed because 
some targeted victims struggled too much wood testified 
grahams attorney james piazza has said he believes wood made 
up the story to get even with graham for leaving her graham left 
michigan for her hometown of tyler texas after the two split up in 
july 1987 
walker police began investigating late last year after woods 
exhusband told them his former wife had confessed to her part in 
the slayings 
when the five patients died from jan 18 to april 7 1987 their 
deaths were listed as natural and no autopsies were performed three 
of the alleged victims were cremated the two other bodies were 
exhumed but autopsies revealed no definitive evidence of 
suffocation 
nursing home administrators had given both employees high marks 
and wood had been promoted to nursing aide supervisor both women 
quit their jobs before the investigation began 
the trial is expected to last about two weeks

a secret directive signed by president bush 
dealing with us military involvement in the war on drugs does not 
envision using us forces in any combat role in latin america the 
white house said today 
a member of the senate intelligence committee however said the 
military will provide protection to us drug enforcement agents and 
other law enforcement officials operating in such nations as bolivia 
and peru 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed bush 
recently signed a directive outlining the goals and limits of 
military involvement in the war on drugs but he said it does not 
authorize the use of us troops in combat 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said the directive authorizes the 
military to be physically involved with units in the field where 
we have been invited to have our law enforcement people 
he said such protection is designed to prevent incidents similar 
to the torture and murder of us drug agent enrique camarena in 
guadalajara mexico in febuary 1985 
we cant afford another camarena said deconcini a member of 
the intelligence committee 
presidential spokesman fitzwater also threw cold water on a 
statement by drug enforcement administrator john lawn that the 
administration is reconsidering whether to ban the sale of assault 
weapons produced in the united states 
we arent aware of any reconsideration fitzwater said by 
that i mean theres none in the white house i know the white 
house position has been given to me by the highest authorities 
fitzwater declined to give details of the secret directive on the 
drug war 
these documents do not contemplate the use of troops 
fitzwater said 
however he refused to disclose what the documents actually 
authorize asked if the directive left the door open for the use of 
troops under some conditions fitzwater said i really cant go 
beyond that it doesnt contemplate the use of troops i think the 
interpretation can fairly be made that it doesnt authorize troops 
either 
we can argue about words we can argue semantics but the fact 
is it doesnt not contemplate the use of troops he said 
fitzwater said the approximately 30 us advisers involved in 
antidrug efforts in colombia do have the right to defend 
themselves he said that is the standard policy for us troops 
anywhere in the world 
they are there there is a risk colombia is a very dangerous 
place to be these days fitzwater said 
bush sent security advisers to colombia as part of a 65 million 
package designed to help that nation fight cocaine and he said last 
tuesday that an additional 261 million in security aid could go to 
colombia peru and bolivia for the drug war 
drug czar william j bennett said in a televised interview sunday 
that bush is willing to send special forces advisers to the andean 
nations 
there is no plan for any special forces to accompany troops in 
peru or bolivia into combat missions bennett said in the abctv 
program this week with david brinkley 
that is not in the plan there is no such plan bennett 
said 
bennett said we see now in colombia the presence of american 
trainers working with the colombians giving them advice training 
them on equipment this is the kind of thing we would anticipate if 
peru and bolivia take the steps 
on the issue of assault rifles the administration has banned 
their import but bush has said he opposes a ban on domestic weapons 
lawn appearing on cbs face the nation was asked about 
colombias request that the united states stem the flow of usmade 
assault weapons to that country 
we must look now at our own procedures here in the united 
states lawn said i believe it is something that is under 
review and certainly citizens feel very strongly about the gun 
issue we in the law enforcement community feel very strongly 
when were out there on the firing line and our view isnt always 
necessarily the view of our leaders 
about two dozen members of the us special forces based in 
panama have been rotating into bolivias chapare valley training 
antinarcotics police there but they have been barred from patrols 
the washington post in its sunday editions said the directive 
would allow the advisers to accompany bolivian drug forces on 
patrol however an administration source said the military is not 
allowed to go out into the jungle on patrol that is the way it has 
been and the way it remains 
the post report quoted an unidentified senior administration 
official as saying that several hundred us military advisers 
could be sent to the three nations under the andean initiative 
announced by bush 
bennett said the military advisers in colombia although they 
were barred from combat were in a dangerous environment they are 
not going to seek out combat or conflict and we just all hope that 
nothing befalls them 
a possible expanded us military role in latin america received 
mixed reviews from democrats in congress 
it could be a good idea said sen joseph r biden ddel 
who has emerged as democratic spokesman on bushs plan for a war on 
drugs i can say that i do not dismiss the notion of using us 
troops in certain circumstances in the andean effort 
but rep charles b rangel a democrat who represents new york 
citys harlem section which is plagued by drugrelated violence 
said it outrages me to think that every time there is an 
international problem we have to talk about the introduction of 
american troops biden and rangel appeared on the abctv program

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze accused 
president bush on monday of depriving the world of major arms 
control agreements by not taking advantage of opportunities created 
by the reagan administration 
shevardnadze made the harsh criticism in an interview with the 
government daily izvestia in advance of his sept 2223 meeting with 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
the criticism was remarkable because it dealt not only with arms 
control but the us attitude toward perestroika president mikhail 
s gorbachevs reform program it constrasted with generally upbeat 
comments by soviet officials lately about ussoviet relations 
i think that because of the restrained indecisive position of 
the american administration both the usa and the ussr as 
well as the entire world community have lost a lot shevardnadze 
said in the interview which was splashed across a halfpage 
he contrasted the constraint and timidity of the bush 
administration on arms control with progress made during the 
presidency of ronald reagan which ended in january 
after recent stormy years a peculiar lull has set in the 
tempo of movement toward new agreements in any case on the key 
directions of real nuclear disarmament dont satisfy us 
shevardnadze said 
the soviet envoy contrasted the 1987 superpower agreement to 
eliminate mediumrange nuclear weapons with a lack of progress under 
bush on pacts to reduce strategic nuclear weapons and ban nuclear 
weapons tests 
in june he said soviet negotiators entered resumed talks on 
strategic arms with fresh proposals but despite promised new 
ideas our american partners frequently preferred to cite a lack of 
principle decisions in washington he said 
the result shevardnadze said has been the geneva talks are 
frozen further from an agreement now than during the previous 
us administration he told izvestia the negotiations should have 
resumed by building on the foundation laid last fall but instead are 
going around it without an apparent goal 
a major dispute in the talks has been over us plans for 
spacebased missile defenses the soviets want to limit the 
socalled star wars or strategic defense inititative 
disagreement also persists on longrange nucleartipped cruise 
missiles based at sea moscow wants to include them in a treaty but 
washington refuses saying compliance could not be reliably verified 
on domestic policy shevardnadze said some people in the united 
states want to stop perestroika because they think that would 
strengthen the us position in the world among them he said are 
people who hope for the restoration of capitalism here and the 
undermining of the soviet federation he did not identify the 
critics 
the foreign minister also lamented an unrealized series of 
possibilities for ussoviet economic ties and accused washington 
of being one of the participants in the senseless bloodletting 
in afghanistan 
the united states supplies rebels fighting afghanistans marxist 
government which in turn is supplied by the soviet union 
shevardnadze also accused the united states of using dictate 
and threats in central america 
still he said his talks with baker in wyoming should open new 
horizons to sovietamerican dialogue and added that he and baker 
have been told to clear the road for a new sovietamerican summit 
meeting 
gorbachev and bush last met in new york in december bush was 
vice president at the time

adult literacy congress the first lady told the dozens of adult 
learners that she understands what theyre going through 
she said that this summer on the theory that you never stop

language i dont know there seems to be some code in there i dont 
understand and young people say to me oh thats easy 
the 150 people in the east room of the white house laughed 
the weekend conference attracted literacy experts and adult 
students 
mrs bush said she hadnt mastered the computer but when she 
gets really discouraged she remembers there are a lot of 
people out there trying to learn how to read and its just as 
complicated for them and theyre learning so i guess i can 
for estel sizemore 58 a greatgrandfather who sought help three

sizemore a farmers son who never got beyond first grade 
attends oneonone classes at scarlet oaks high school in cincinnati 
its all free sizemore said its embarrassing to get 
there but once you get inside the door its like a family 
judy sawyer 48 of pringle sd didnt know the meaning of 
literacy until last year when she sought help in custer sd 
mrs sawyer a homemaker who has worked as a truck driver and 
waitress said she never learned to read growing up in moab utah 
i finished the ninth grade how i got there ill never know 
said mrs sawyer who now reads at nearly a fifthgrade level 
her goal is to get a high school equivalency diploma and become a 
school volunteer to find the small children that are having the 
hard time and help them so they wont have to go through what i went 
through 
this is like a miracle she said looking around the 
glittering ballroom i used to feel like i was the dumbest thing 
that ever walked that i couldnt do anything 
i didnt know there was so many like me i thought i was the 
only one in the world like me it felt so good not to be dumb no 
more

martinez romero pleaded innocent monday to charges of laundering 
millions of dollars in drug money in the united states a country 
he claims to have visited only to vacation at disney world 
martinez was ordered held without bond during a hearing before 
us magistrate joel m feldman who agreed with prosecutors that 
martinez would flee the country no matter how high the bail no 
trial date was set 
martinez the first of colombias extraditables brought to 
the united states is accused of laundering at least 15 million in 
us banks and of being the financial expert behind efforts to hide 
12 billion in drug profits earned by the medellin cartel 
the cartel is believed responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine 
smuggled into the united states 
martinez was extradited from colombia under heavy guard thursday 
at mondays hearing defense lawyers ed garland of atlanta and 
oscar rodriguez of miami sought to portray the 36yearold martinez 
as a highly educated businessman with a loving wife and four 
children 
they said he has a graduate marketing degree from a colombian 
university had held several management positions in medellin banks 
and had never come to the united states to set up moneylaundering 
arrangements 
the defense attorneys asked feldman to place martinez under house 
arrest pending his trial

extradited rodriguez said he has never been accused of any 
crime in colombia he has never come to the united states other than 
to bring his children to disney world on a vacation 
but assistant us attorney wilmer parker iii contended that 
martinez would likely flee if released on bail no matter how high 
colombia is hardly the only country in the world where mr 
martinez could live and live quite comfortably with the millions of 
dollars to which he has access the prosecutor said 
parker noted that martinez escaped an arrest attempt in panama in 
march shortly after his indictment he also said martinez would 
likely continue to direct the cartels moneylaundering if released 
garland argued that martinez was accused only of laundering drug 
money a financial transaction not serious enough to keep him 
without bail 
but feldman disagreed it is well recognized that money is what 
oils the machine that allows these unlawful activities such as 
cocaine distributing to go on he said it is a very serious 
offense 
rodriguez said martinez is being held in solitary confinement at 
an undisclosed location which is believed to be in the atlanta area 
martinez could receive 30 years in prison under colombian law or 
life under us law garland said it is not yet clear which law 
applies 
the case was assigned to us district judge william c okelley 
who has prohibited attorneys in the case from commenting okelley 
cited widespread publicity as the reason for the gag order 
weldon kennedy agent in charge of the fbi office in atlanta has 
said agents are on an increased state of alert against any

monday despite those concerns

president roh taewoo on monday 
proposed new steps toward northsouth korean reunification and said 
he hoped a charter for a korean commonwealth could be signed by 
next august by the longdivided and hostile sides 
i hope that a southnorth summit will take place as quickly as 
possible to successfully launch joint efforts for opening an era 
of fullfledged interkorean cooperation and unification roh said 
in a televised address to the national assembly 
but he added the reality is that it will be impossible to 
achieve unification overnight he urged north korea to abandon 
its policy of unification through communization of the south 
roh said he wants a charter for the commonwealth an interim 
stage for merging the two koreas signed by next august he also 
called for measures to build confidence and control arms in an 
effort to end the arms race between north and south 
there was no immediate response from the communist north and 
south koreas leading opposition group the party for peace and 
democracy said rohs peace gesture failed to reflect the views of 
all south koreans some of whom demand the removal of us troops 
from the south 
the opposition party called for a detailed and active 
government role in easing military confrontation with north korea 
north korea has demanded the withdrawal of us forces stationed 
in south korea contending american troops are a major obstacle to 
unification talks 
it has called for a confederation under which there would be one 
korea for military and diplomatic matters but each side would 
maintain its own political and social system 
over the past several decades unification talks have been held 
on and off but little progress has been made 
in recent years south korean dissidents have called for stronger 
efforts toward unification they want free travel across the heavily 
guarded border and the immediate withdrawal of the 43000 american 
troops in the south 
a radical student a dissident clergymen and an opposition 
lawmaker are in jail for making unauthorized visits to the north 
rohs new proposal calls for interim governmental bodies equally 
divided between the two koreas changing his earlier position that 
the south should have a larger representation because it has twice 
the population of the north 
the first step in his plan calls for establishing a korean 
national community with the holding of a summit and the signing of 
a national community charter 
the second step would be formation of a korean commonwealth 
made up of a council of presidents a 20member council of 
ministers a 100member council of representatives and a joint 
secretariat 
the secretariat perhaps stationed in a border peace zone 
would help handle routine commonwealth business with liaison 
offices operating in the capitals of the two nations as 
quasidiplomatic missions roh said 
in the final step the commonwealth would draw up a constitution 
and set up elections for a united nation he said 
five years after korea was divided in 1945 the north invaded the 
south starting the 195053 korean war a ceasefire ended the war 
but no peace treaty has been signed

singer rita coolidge visited a crimeridden 
heavily vandalized housing project monday walking over dirt paths 
littered with broken bottles and looking through paneless windows in 
abandoned apartments 
this is a wasteland of available housing she said during a 
trip to call attention to conditions in the st thomas housing 
project and the plight of the homeless she is in new orleans for a 
concert wednesday to benefit the homeless 
since 1980 the government has taken 30 billion out of the 
housing budget while the number of homeless has gone up said 
coolidge the housing budget is now only 75 billion 
if congress would just put 15 percent of the defense budget 
into housing these problems could be solved in a matter of years 
another solution she said would be to eliminate many tax 
deductions used by the rich and said she plans to tell her 
accountant she wants to pay more taxes 
its no excuse i intend to do that immediately she said

east germans expressed fear monday that the mass 
migration of thousands of their countrymen will mean more hardships 
for the millions who stayed behind 
i have this feeling that i have missed the last train to the 
west a worried student in east berlin told the associated press 
other east berliners all speaking on condition their names not 
be revealed expressed the same fear 
somehow or another those up above government officials must 
react said a teacher 
a pastor said conditions in east germany would become 
unbearable if the hardline communist government decides to 
close off its border with hungary to stem any future flow of 
refugees to the west 
after hungarys decision to allow all east germans vacationing 
there to go west more than 2000 east german refugees arrived in 
west germany on monday and more were on their way 
news reports say the final number of east germans arriving from 
hungary could top 10000 
it was the first time a warsaw pact country had aided a mass 
exodus of refugees from another east bloc nation 
the refugees point to repression and the east german governments 
staunch resistance to reforms as their reasons for leaving 
the east german government on monday angrily denounced hungarys 
actions 
the hungarian government has chosen to illegally allow german 
democratic republic citizens east germans to travel to the federal 
republic west germany staterun news media said 
it said hungary under the guise of humanitarianism is engaging 
in organized smuggling of humans 
the criticism appeared in east germanys neues deutschland and 
junge welt newspapers and was broadcast on radio and television

charged that western media were misinterpreting the defection of 
east germans as a judgment against socialism 
on sunday the communistrun news agency adn charged hungary had 
violated a 1969 agreement with east germany that forbids allowing 
each others citizens from crossing their borders to go west without 
official permission 
hungary is one of the most popular places for east german 
tourists especially since that east bloc country has been adopting 
political reforms

the international effort to stabilize the value 
of the dollar is in shambles raising the risk that americas trade 
deficit will soar as us products are priced out of overseas 
markets a washington research group said monday 
the institute for international economics said the bush 
administration must share in blame for the currency coordination 
breakdown which has allowed the dollar to rise by 20 percent 
against the japanese yen since the first of the year 
a rising dollar makes us goods more expensive on foreign 
markets while cutting the price of imports to american consumers 
economists view both developments with alarm since they would make 
americas stillhuge trade deficit even worse by boosting import 
purchases and slowing export sales 
a string of record trade deficits in the 1980s transformed the 
united states into the worlds largest debtor nation as billions of 
dollars were handed over to foreigners to pay for imported goods 
the reagan administration launched an effort with the worlds 
richest industrial nations in 1985 to push the dollar lower as a way 
of curing americas trade problems and fending off growing cries in 
congress for protectionist trade barriers 
the effort by the united states and the other countries in the 
group of seven japan west germany britain france canada and 
italy was credited with reducing the deficit sharply in 1988 as 
american manufacturers enjoyed a boom in export sales however the 
improvement has slowed this year and economists at the private 
institute predicted the deficit would begin worsening again in 1990 
because of the dollars jump in value 
the g7 countries have been frustrated in their efforts to 
stabilize the dollar at much lower levels 
in trading monday in tokyo the dollar shot to a threemonth high 
against the japanese yen despite dollarselling intervention on the 
part of the bank of japan 
the financial markets now view the g7 process as having lost 
all of its credibility said c fred bergsten director of the 
private institute for international economics they have violated 
their own target zones for the dollars value and have made no 
serious or concerted effort to preserve them 
bergsten who was assistant treasury secretary for international 
affairs in the carter administration blamed the unruly dollar in 
part on a failure by the bush administration and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady to make international economic coordination a top 
priority 
one reason the g7 process is in shambles is because the us 
government is not giving it the kind of push that former treasury 
secretary james a baker did in 1985 through 1987 bergsten said 
the institute released a new book monday aimed at raising the 
political profile of the problem by getting congress and other 
agencies of the executive branch more involved in setting dollar 
policies 
the book dollar politics exchange rate policymaking in the 
united states urged that the current process for setting dollar 
policy be broadened beyond the small group of officials at the 
treasury and the federal reserve who are now making the decisions 
it proposed setting up new congressional oversight committees in 
both the house and the senate to review decisions made by the 
executive branch building on reporting requirements established by 
the 1988 trade act 
the institute also proposed greater involvement by cabinet 
agencies responsible for trade matters in helping treasury formulate 
dollar policies and called for the creation of a private task force 
to provide advice to government policymakers 
the book said that from the nixon administration forward the 
history of international dollar policy in this country has been one 
of periods of neglect followed by hurryup efforts seeking to repair 
the damage caused by improper dollar polices 
one such period occurred in the early part of this decade when 
the reagan administration ignored a surge in the dollars value 
until 1985 even as the high dollar was pushing the trade deficit to 
record heights 
exchange rate policymaking needs to be substantially improved 
in order to avoid repeating in the coming decade the mistakes and 
unnecessary risks of the 1980s wrote im destler and c randall 
henning the authors of the book 
destler is a professor in the school of public affairs at the 
university of maryland and henning is a research associate at the 
institute which receives financing from foundations in the united 
states and other countries to conduct studies of various 
international economic issues

the state agency that disciplines lawyers would 
automatically review any complaint filed against us rep barney 
frank who recently admitted paying a male prostitute for sex an 
official said monday 
but daniel klubock bar counsel for the commonwealth of 
massachusetts refused to confirm or deny if a complaint against 
frank had been received 
george washington university professor john f banzhaf iii last 
week said he had filed a complaint against frank dmass with the 
states board of bar overseers which investigates complaints 
against lawyers 
klubock said the boards proceedings are confidential but 
klubock who said his position is roughly similar to that of a 
prosecutor with the board acting similar to a court said his office 
reviews all complaints 
our investigation can be limited to reading it and saying this 
is nonsense klubock said or it can evolve into a fullscale 
investigation 
he said the board if it decides to take action against an 
attorney can issue a private reprimand itself he said the most 
severe disciplinary action such as disbarment is done by the state 
supreme judicial court on recommendation from the board 
frank has never practiced law and is listed as an inactive lawyer 
by the board 
banzhaf has asked frank to agree to a public hearing he says 
the matter should be cleared up banzhaf said 
frank himself has called for an investigation into the matter by 
the house ethics committee saying he wants to clear the public 
record 
frank who is homosexual last month said he paid stephen gobie 
for sexual services then hired the man as his personal aide frank 
said he did not know gobie was running a prostitution service from 
the congressmans capitol hill apartment he said he fired gobie in 
1987 when he found out 
frank also said he wrote several letters to gobies probation 
officer and used his congressional immunity to void gobies traffic 
tickets

good grades have taken a back seat to american 
students desire for designer clothes and trendy gadgets the head 
of the national association of secondary school principals said 
monday 
executive director scott thomson blames mainly the job market and 
the television industry in an article written for the october issue 
of the associations monthly journal 
compared to their international counterparts most american 
students not only have fewer incentives to achieve good grades they 
also have more incentives to hold jobs during the school week 
thomson wrote 
a high demand for cheap labor and a premium on teenage 
consumption lure students into the job market said thomson who 
examined five broad categories that researchers say consistently 
affect learning 
thomson examined the learning conditions in america and compared 
them with those in south korea and west germany concluding that 
american society doesnt measure up 
a national report card prepared by thomson awarded south 
korea an aminus and west germany a bplus the united states 
received a cplus 
thomson pointed to a 1988 north carolina survey that found half 
of the high school juniors were working with 67 percent of these 
students holding jobs 20 hours or more a week 
in south korea he said students simply do not hold jobs while 
attending school in west germany students through all 13 years 
of schooling are not employed in the job market except perhaps 
informally in family businesses 
as for television thomson said 71 percent of 13yearold korean 
students consistently watch science programs while only 37 percent 
of americans of similar age watch science programs the lowest of 
any group studied in an international assessment of math and science 
schooling 
the teenage culture is influenced dramatically by broadcast 
television rock video and popular music he said it would be 
difficult to find any support for educational values in the lot 
thomson said the market analysis firm teenage research 
unlimited found that televisions focus on the teenage consumer 
market has now dropped from age 18 to 15 because the typical high 
school junior has nearly 60 a week in spending money from jobs and 
allowances 
brand loyalties are established at an early age hence the hard 
sell to youth the american television industry tends to view 
children and youth as consumers rather than as learners he said 
the pressure on students to consume may soon extend to the school 
classroom as well said thomson whittle communications a 
subsidiary of timelife publishing corp is offering schools a 
daily 10minute news show with two minutes of advertising in return 
for an offer of free television monitors 
america received a d for prevalence of illegal drugs and bs for 
the percentage of gross national product devoted to public 
education place of schooling in the family value structure and the 
percentage of families below the poverty line 
the only a for america was in the percentage of youth age 16 in 
school

leftist guerrillas said monday 
they will observe a ceasefire for 11 days to create a favorable 
climate for peace talks with the government 
the farabundo marti national liberation front said in a a 
communique that the ceasefire which it termed unilateral would 
begin at 1201 am wednesday and end at midnight september 23 
representatives of the rebels and the government of president 
alfredo cristiani who took office june 1 are to meet in mexico 
city beginning wednesday the exchange will be the first peace 
discussions between the government and the insurgents since october 
1987 
the fmln is waging a nearly decadeold revolution against a 
succession of usbacked governments an estimated 70000 people 
have been killed in the conflict 
the rebels thursday declared a halt to sabotage of the 
electricity distribution system and the national telephone network 
they also suspended the use of land mines and booby traps 
the guerrillas said monday the ceasefire and suspension of 
sabotage along with the naming of a highlevel rebel dialogue 
comission and the acceptance of a venue outside el salvador are 
clear indications of their good faith 
but we note with concern that mr cristiani and his government 
are placing obstacles in the way of the upcoming meeting by opposing 
the logical and necessary presence of international witnesses a 
moderator and national and international observers and in so doing 
are trying to establish a closed dialogue said the communique 
the government has refused a rebel request that un 
representatives attend the talks saying it is not yet time to 
include international observers 
the fmln on monday announced an eightmember delegation to the 
talks headed by commanders joaquin villalobos and schafik jorge 
handal 
cristiani last week named a commission that includes two cabinet 
members the president said he considers this weeks sessions 
preparatory and that the mechanism for proceeding with talks rather 
than substantive issues will be discussed 
everything is developing normally for the meeting and the 
reaching of agreements you must remember that this is the beginning 
of a series of conversations so you cannot expect to resolve a 
10yearold problem in a single meeting 
monsignor gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary bishop of el salvador 
was shuttling between mexico city and el salvador to work out 
details of the talks with the two sides 
he arrived in mexico city in the early morning hours monday met 
with the rebels and was to return to san salvador in the afternoon 
carrying a message from the rebels to cristiani said mercedes del

president bushs new antidrug plan focuses too 
much on lengthy prison terms and too little on treating drug 
abusers witnesses told a us senate hearing monday 
if id received a stiffer penalty i wouldnt be sitting 
before you right now said michael vann a drug convict and now 
director of a treatment center in milwaukee i wouldnt be a 
productive citizen i would still be in prison 
vann who spent 27 months in prison testified before a field 
hearing of the senate judiciary and government affairs committees 
conducted by sen herbert kohl dwis 
the hearing at marquette university was the first since bush 
unveiled his 79 billion antidrug plan last week which allocates 
about 30 percent toward treatment and prevention and 70 percent 
toward law enforcement 
witnesses told the hearing tougher penalties would be ineffective 
unless the demand for drugs disappears 
no one has addressed why are americans such heavy abusers 
said francine fineberg director of a home for mothers who are 
addicted to drugs we have to look at the moral fiber 
vann and queen hyler a milwaukee activist whose son was severely 
beaten by street gang members last year agreed that drug abuse is a 
product of poverty 
its hard to tell a 15yearold boy living in a family of eight 
to stay in school when he can go on the corner and get 1000 a day 
selling drugs ms hyler said 
the us is losing the war on drugs and will continue to lose 
it as long as we have a policy that treats drug abuse as a crime 
not as a disease she said we must make the war on drugs a 
moral crusade 
vann a recovering heroin addict said he underwent 10 months of 
treatment and education in prison and that the program more than 
his punishment helped him change his ways 
for many years i thought i only had potential to be a pimp or a 
drug dealer he said i have status now because im doing 
something positive 
kohl noted that bushs plan contains no additional funds for 
treatment and education beyond what has been proposed by congress 
im afraid the presidents plan falls short he said it 
doesnt give us enough resources it doesnt make wise spending 
choices and it doesnt focus on mobilizing and empowering 
communities to fight the problem 
milwaukee county district attorney e michael mccann who has 
seen drugrelated crime rise dramatically in milwaukee over the past 
year also said the presidents program is underfunded 
i for one am willing to pay higher taxes to fully support the 
programs needed not just to fight the war but to win the war on 
drugs mccann said

the state department said monday that 
noncommunist forces in cambodia should be strengthened as a means 
of encouraging the provietnam government in phnom penh to agree to 
a reasonable power sharing arrangement 
spokesman richard boucher also said that a strenghtened 
noncommunist resistance would be better able to hold its own 
against any attempt by the khmer rouge to seize unilateral control 
in cambodia 
the khmer rouge is one of three rebel groups opposing the 
hanoibacked government the united state opposes a return to power 
by the khmer rouge based on its 3 years of repressive rule in the 
late 1970s 
boucher declined to say whether the united states is attempting 
to strengthen the two noncommunist rebel groups with the help of 
military aid 
congress has given the administration the green light to provide 
these groups with military aid if it so wishes but the chairman of 
the house and senate subcommittees on asia last week said in 
separate interviews with the washington post that the bush 
administration should hold off on any plan to provide such aid to 
the noncommunist resistance 
last friday assistant secretary of state richard solomon said 
that to facilitate a solution in cambodia china should restrict its 
military aid to the khmer rouge and the soviet union should curtail 
its support for the phnom penh government 
cambodia has become a high priority issue for the administration 
because of the pending completion later this month of the withdrawal 
of the remaining vietnamese troops in cambodia 
efforts to reach agreement on a new cambodian government once the 
vietnamese troops are gone have not prospered raising the prospect 
of a fourway armed conflict among government forces and the three 
resistance groups

a plume of smoke from a huge pile of 
burning used tires rose 1000 feet into the air monday and was 
visible 25 miles away and firefighters dumped tons of dirt to 
smother the flames 
we cannot put this thing out today said david tordoff of the 
federal environmental protection agency we can suppress it and 
then in a few days put it out 
tordoff estimated that about 2 acres of the 7acre pile of tires 
about 30 to 40 feet deep was on fire the second fire in five years 
william toland the state fire marshal said the cause of the 
fire was undetermined it was out of control right from the 
beginning he said 
tordoff said the fires heat controlled the firefighters methods 
we switched from water because even at 2500 gallons a minute 
the water was vaporizing tordoff said instead we will smother 
it 
about 200 firefighters from 48 communities cleared tires from the 
path of flames and dumped water then dirt on the fire 
by midmorning 22 large trucks began dumping 25ton loads of 
dirt onto the fire from a nearby sand and gravel pit danville fire 
chief bill timmons estimated that the dumping would continue for at 
least a couple of days 
tordoff said his agency earmarked an emergency 500000 from the 
hazardous waste superfund for the effort 
the dump is at the sparsely populated junction of three rural 
southeastern new hampshire towns danville kingston and hampstead 
about 40 miles north of boston 
soon after the fire broke out sunday night neighbors said flames 
reached up to 40 feet and could be seen 1 miles away 
at daybreak monday the smoke could be seen in massachusetts 
communities 25 miles away 
about 35 people living within a halfmile of the dump were 
evacuated and took shelter at a church with an additional dozen 
residents staying with friends and relatives authorities said 
several nearby roads were closed 
tordoff said epa scientists were monitoring the air and 
underground water near the site for possible harmful contaminants 
from the fire 
the dump was the scene of a spectacular fire that burned for 
weeks in 1984 
ironically gov judd gregg in july had announced that the state 
had contracted with a buffalo ny firm to remove the tires 
it was a disaster waiting to happen and it happened gregg 
said 
gregg said he hoped integrated tire of buffalo could begin 
removing tires in two weeks and shredding them to make fuel for a 
cement plant in greece 
ernest hunt who began collecting the tires about 15 years ago 
was sued by the state after the 1984 fire but was declared 
financially unable to clean up the dump the state attorney 
generals office said the state seized control of the dump hunts 
present location is unknown

democratic national chairman ronald h brown 
saying lets not lead with our chin told democrats monday they 
should decide on their goals before talking about raising taxes 
brown spoke at a oneday conference called by a group of 
democratic political consultants to discuss ways to win the white 
house in 1992 
when we entangle ourselves in talk about taxes before we lay 
out clear longterm goals and objectives we dampen the 
publicspirited response of americans who want to believe that we 
can act together to make a difference brown said 
in fighting with the president for our vision of americas 
future lets not lead with our chin he said 
president bush who has persistently vowed not to raise taxes 
said last week that no tax increase is needed to finance his war on 
drugs 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said that unless the president supports the tax 
increases that will be necessary to fight this war the drug dealers 
are going to win 
brown also touched on remarks by molly yard president of the 
national organization for women who has raised the possibility of 
supporting a third party in pressing for abortion rights and other 
womens issues 
we are the party that believes women should make their own 
choice when it comes to reproduction he said we believe that 
government should protect the right of a woman to make that choice 
herself thats a clear contrast between our parties and one that i 
intend to underscore as our chairman 
but we also tolerate diversity of opinion especially on 
matters that are so morally complex he said im not willing to 
let those on the fringe of this debate define the democrat partys 
center of gravity if molly yard doubts the commitment and integrity 
of our party on the issue of choice if she insists that every 
democrat toe her line to every last detail then maybe well have to 
win this one without her 
brown urged democrats to starting preaching the democratic 
gospel by calling for a newly vigorous public spirit but 
added that programmatic liberalism is not the gyroscope that 
guides the national democratic party 
he said rankandfile democrats believe that the new deal 
shaped our history and message as democrats over four decades but 
now they are ready for something more

a un conference on strategies and 
preventive measures against drug dealing opened monday with 
delegates calling the anticocaine war launched by the colombian 
government an act of immense courage 
with worldwide traffic in drugs now second only to that in 
armaments we are forced to face the sobering fact that humankind is 
predominantly engaged in the commerce of selfdestruction 
margaret j anstee directorgeneral of the un office in vienna 
said in an opening statement 
praising the recent offensive unleashed by the government of 
colombia against cocaine producers she said the colombian 
government has been faced with a stark choice it had either to 
declare an allout war on the traffickers or in effect to 
surrender 
in an act of immense courage it has unequivocally chosen the 
former course and by so doing has earned itself a place in the 
history of what has become for all of us a world against drugs 
ms anstee told delegates 
if colombia were to lose this war we should all be lost 
colombia is represented at the fiveday conference by a 
threemember delegation headed by miguel antonio gomez padilla 
directorgeneral of national police 
the conference attended by top government and law enforcement 
officials from about 100 countries is to help police and 
enforcement officials formulate new measures against drug 
traffickers and addicts 
it is patently clear that there are no simple solutions to drug 
abuse control problems but that emphatically does not mean that 
there are no solutions that all we can do is surrender ms 
anstee said 
we must fight and we must win the cost will be high but the 
cost of surrender would be a catastrophe she said 
statistics scheduled to be presented at the conference indicate 
drug seizures rose in 1988 
opiate and morphine seizures soared by 78 percent and 104 percent 
respectively while heroin and cocaine seizures steadily increased 
the united nations said in a press release 
the delegates will examine special law enforcement techniques 
against drug abuse and illicit trafficking with emphasis on 
detection investigation search and seizure techniques 
the meeting will also try to identify ways of enhancing law 
enforcement effectiveness in seizing drugs arresting drug offenders 
and breaking up criminal syndicates

chancellor helmut kohl appealed 
monday for a friendly welcome to thousands of east german refugees 
pouring into west germany and said murmurs of discontent in the 
country were ignorant and shortsighted 
we in west germany have been able to live on the sunny side of 
german history over the past 40 years kohl said in a speech at 
the national convention of the christian democratic union we have 
no right to resist the search for personal happiness of our 
countrymen from east germany 
the dramatic opening of the hungaryaustria border to east german 
refugees has not found total approval in west germany where many 
allege that migrants are more in search of better economic prospects 
than freedom from political persecution 
kohl dismissed such complaints as ignorant bar banter 
they dont see that these people have left their homes their 
jobs their friends and their loved ones in order to live here he 
said how great the oppression must be for them to give up 
everything 
at least 2000 east germans poured into bavaria in west germany 
from austria after hungary opened its border to the west at midnight 
sunday the number of emigres from east germany is expected to reach 
100000 by the end of the year 
east germans as well as ethnic germans from other nations are 
entitled to immediate west german citizenship and social security 
under the 1949 constitution that also sets as a goal the eventual 
reunification of east and west germany 
kohl said the flow of east germans to the west is testimony that 
the dream of a unified germany has not died in the communist state 
the opposite is the case kohl said precisely among these 
young people is the dream of a common freedom for all germans kept 
alive and this is a reminder to us in west germany that our 
prosperity cannot be allowed to drag on our hearts 
unity justice and freedom for the german fatherland kohl 
declared that is not an outmoded slogan but one that belongs to 
the future

other groups and philanthropists have similarly helped pay for 
college educations under agreements with students

encourage more norfolk high school students to attend college by 
helping them find aid last year it helped 307 of 1300 seniors in 
the school system get 138 million in college aid 
batten said the foundation is trying to broaden its reach by 
targeting freshmen 
we need to start to persuade students at a younger age that 
they ought to aspire to go to college and that college is a 
realistic prospect he said

on the eve of the closest mayoral primary in 12 
years mayor edward i koch crossed paths monday with rival 
democratic candidate david dinkins and they pledged their mutual 
support no matter who wins 
they also agreed on a unity rally wednesday for the winner of 
tuesdays democratic primary 
i think thats a nice gesture said dinkins the manhattan 
borough president i mean he recognizes that the likelihood is 
that im going to succeed and he offers to help me i think thats 
fine 
koch who said a big turnout would carry him to victory said 
it was important for the party to work on defeating republican 
frontrunner rudolph giuliani in the november general election 
we gotta get started on giuliani koch said this guys got 
clay knees and the reporters are only up to his ankles 
a wabcdaily news poll conducted saturday and sunday found 
dinkins supported by 50 percent of likely democratic voters and koch 
by 43 percent with a margin of error of six points the other two 
democratic mayoral candidates city comptroller harrison j goldin 
and former transit chief richard ravitch are stalled in single 
digits 
we have never dropped save maybe a point here or there but 
we have gone constantly upward dinkins said it seems to 
indicate a solidifying of support 
but turnout considered crucial in this race is difficult to 
predict in primaries 
im no 2 koch said at a lunchtime rally mayday is a 
signal of distress for those who are nautically minded 
im saying to everybody who understands that expression i need 
you come out tomorrow vote for me mayday mayday 
koch hasnt faced a battle like this since 1977 when he won the 
office after a close primary followed by runoff and general

a committee investigating allegations that 
former premier andreas papandreou was involved in widespread 
wiretapping while in office proposed monday that the case be given 
to a special court for possible prosecution 
the parliamentary committee said in a report that papandreou 
willfully instigated through national intelligence chief costas 
tsimas and intelligence service employees the decision to commit 
illegal acts and carry out the tapping of telephones committee 
chairman theodoros anagnostopoulos told reporters 
anagnostopoulos said the committee proposal called also for 
tsimas who is now a member of the european parliament to go before 
the special court 
legislators are due to debate the committees proposal next week 
if they accept it the former premier will be sent before the 
special high court 
the special court consists of the supreme court president and 12 
supreme court judges it would be given the task of conducting a 
further investigation and formally trying papandreou and tsimas if 
it decides to indict them 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement or pasok was 
succeeded by a conservativeleftist coalition in the june national 
elections when no party won an outright majority he was not present 
when the committees report was handed to parliament president 
athanasios tsaldaris 
the 70yearold veteran politician is accused of tapping the 
telephones of his political opponents and party members from may 
1987 to midapril of this year

leader of the opposition new democracy party constantine 
mitsotakis the communist partys offices former president

tapped telephones for national security but that no witnesses had 
presented any evidence papandreou was aware of illegalities possibly 
committed by the intelligence service

net deposit withdrawals at the nations thrift 
institutions fell to a ninemonth low of 183 million in july the 
government said monday 
the outflow was the smallest since october and followed a 46 
billion withdrawal in june 
the office of thrift supervision attributed the decreased outflow 
to competitive deposit rates and growing public assurance following 
passage earlier in the summer of the new savings and loan law which 
includes 50 billion for the industry over the next 26 months 
the moderation in deposit outflows reflected a further 
narrowing in the spread between deposit rates offered by thrifts and 
their nondepository competition as well as less concern about 
thrifts following enactment of firrea financial institutions 
reform recovery and enforcement act said james barth ots chief 
economist 
until passage of the new law the ots was the federal home loan 
bank board 
the ots had attributed the june outflow to intentional shrinkage 
as thrifts prepared to meet the new laws tough new capital rule 
roughly one in four of the nations 2933 sampls do not meet the 
new standard 150 in tangible capital for every 100 in lending 
which becomes effective in three months the only way thrifts that 
cannot attract new capital can comply is to sell off assets such as 
loans and pay off liabilities such as deposits 
barth said sampls in july reduced their assets by 7 billion a 
monthly total exceeded only by 76 billion in june and 8 billion 
in january 
most of the july reduction was accounted for by a record 74 
billion in mortgage holdings including 7 billion in mortgage pool 
securities one of the most easily sold assets in a thrift portfolio 
for the first seven months of the year a net 398 billion have 
flowed out of thrift accounts compared with an inflow of 115 
billion in the first seven months of 1988

portauprince haiti ap a fiveday national conference on 
poverty began monday almost two weeks after the government decreed 
unpopular tax measures that included raising the cost of imported 
goods by 30 percent 
organized by the ministry of social affairs the conference drew 
350 local delegates to discuss the causes of poverty in haiti one 
of the worlds poorest nations 
about 80 percent of haitis nearly 6 million inhabitants live in 
absolute poverty and there is 55 percent unemployment according to 
government figures 
on august 29 the government cut tax deductions for home loans 
lowered the amount merchants must make before they have to pay a 10 
percent valueadded tax and raised the declared value of imports by 
nearly onethird 
politicians labor leaders and local businessmen protested the 
tax measures allegedly imposed by the international monetary fund 
saying they would cut purchasing power and cause social upheaval 
some delegates said the conference which hopes to provide 
possible remedies to haitis grinding poverty contradicts the 
governments economic policy 
the conference is pure demagoguery the government is trying to 
temper the peoples discontent while it imposes its austerity 
policy said sylvio claude leader of the haitian christian 
democrat party 
in july the government decided to cut spending by 15 percent and 
to control the flow of foreign currency but a 60 million budget 
deficit has accelerated depreciation of the national currency the 
gourde 
the projected 1990 budget will be around 280 million 75 percent 
will go to pay government salaries and 13 percent to meet payments 
on the 800 million national debt 
a steady decline in agricultural and industrial production has 
dramatically affected state revenue 
in the meantime the demand for imported goods has increased 
while bureaucratic mismanagement and political instability have 
dissuaded both foreign and local businessmen from investing in the 
economy

kenneth w starrs courtroom debut as solicitor 
general will take place before three appellate judges instead of the 
supreme court the usual forum for the governments chief legal 
advocate the justice department said monday 
starr will make a rare appearance for a solicitor general in a 
lower court this week when he argues a random drug testing case 
before the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san francisco the 
department said 
he is scheduled on friday to defend the federal aviation 
administrations random drugtesting order 
an appearance by a solicitor general whose primary job is to 
represent the justice department before the high court before a 
circuit court of appeals is highly unusual according to department 
officials and court watchers who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the case involves an faa order that by december the nations 
airlines devise and implement procedures to randomly test pilots 
flight attendants and ground crews for illegal drug use 
the faa rules are being challenged by airline employee unions 
who contend that the random drug testing is an unconstitutional 
search the unions also argue that the faa violated administrative 
law when it promulgated the regulations 
the faa order issued last year is part of the reagan 
administrations initiatives for a drugfree workplace random 
drugtesting of certain groups of federal employees has been upheld 
by federal appellate courts but the issue has not been decided by 
the supreme court 
the bush administration is continuing the initiative 
starr declined to comment about his scheduled appearance in san 
francisco but justice department spokesman daniel eramian said that 
when starr took office he told the staff it was his intention to 
do more actual representation in the courtroom 
starr had said this would would include appearances before 
appellate courts because what was happening in the circuit courts 
of appeal was very important eramian said 
when the supreme court opens its fall term on oct 2 starr is 
scheduled to make his first highcourt argument when he is to defend 
contemptofcourt fines against four yonkers ny city councilmen 
for defying a court order to adopt a housing desegregation plan

liberal economists monday attacked a plan 
supported by president bush to slash taxes on capital gains 
describing it as a shell game to benefit the wealthy 
this may well be the worst tax idea in the history of the 
republic harvard university economist lawrence summers said at a 
news conference at which he and other analysts said there was no 
evidence a capitalgains cut would stimulate economic growth 
this measure does precisely nothing to encourage savings 
said henry aaron an economist with the brookings institution 
as the house ways and means committee nears a vote on the 
proposed reduction this week panel member rep byron l dorgan 
dnd offered an alternative that would deny any benefit to those 
with annual incomes over 200000 
dorgans bill also would raise the maximum tax rate that applies 
to income of all kind earned by the wealthiest 1 percent 
eliminating a quirk in the 1986 tax overhaul under which the tax 
rate on some wealthy people drops from 33 percent to 28 percent as 
income rises 
there was no evidence that the bushbacked proposal was losing 
support in the committee by unofficial count 19 of the 37 
committee members enough to deliver a onevote victory favor a 
temporary capitalgains reduction proposed by reps ed jenkins 
dga and bill archer rtexas 
it appears the jenkinsarcher plan will win committee approval 
unless chairman dan rostenkowski dill can persuade one of six 
democrats favoring it to support a substitute he has drafted 
the issue has become the biggest tax question facing congress 
since the landmark overhaul of the income tax was enacted in 1986 
it was that law that took away the preferential treatment long 
accorded capital gains profits from the sale of stock and other 
assets 
capital gains are taxed at the same rate as wages and other 
income during the campaign last year bush called for a lower rate 
for capital gains to encourage saving investment and job creation 
he claimed that cutting the capitalgains tax would so stimulate 
the economy that revenue collections would increase years into the 
future thus helping reduce the deficit 
democrats dispute that claim but many expect a capitalgains cut 
to produce a oneyear burst of revenues which would make it easier 
to meet the 1990 deficitreduction target 
unable to find support for his plan bush endorsed the version 
offered by jenkins and archer it would cut the maximum 
capitalgains rate from 33 percent to 196 percent for 2 years the 
rate then would be raised to 28 percent and the system indexed so 
that gains attributed solely to inflation would not be taxed 
economists appearing at a news conference sponsored by reps 
donald pease dohio and sander levin dmich called the proposed 
reduction at best a budgetary quick fix with harmful longterm 
consequences 
it is at worst yet another shell game which will redistribute 
the nations wealth toward those already most well off according 
to a letter signed by aaron and summers 
the letter also was signed by joseph minarik executive director 
of congress joint economic committee alan auerbach chairman of 
the economics department at the university of pennsylvania and 
alan blinder head of the economics department at priceton 
university 
congress joint committee on taxation estimates that 80 percent 
of the benefits of the jenkinsarcher reduction would go to those 
with incomes over 100000 a year 
dorgan who opposes a cut offered an alternative to reduce 
benefits to those with incomes above 100000 a year and eliminate 
them for anybody making over 200000 
if we are going to offer a capitalgains exclusion we should 
offer it to those who need it he said

military president augusto pinochet wept 
monday during his last stateofthe nation address but declared he 
still is prepared to take power again if necessary 
his 88minute speech broadcast on national radio and television 
marked the 16th anniversary of the coup he led on sept 11 1973 
that left hundreds dead he is scheduled to surrender power to an 
elected civilian government next march 
as he spoke riot police used water cannons and tear gas to 
scatter scores of demonstrators trying to enter santiagos general 
cemetery to mourn the casualties of the antileftist repression that 
followed the coup there were no reports of arrests 
but people were arrested during two antipinochet demonstrations 
in vina del mar and iquique 
the coup ousted the elected government of elected marxist 
president salvador allende and allende died during the final 
assault on the presidential palace in central santiago 
as in past years several thousand people gathered to honor 
allende at his grave in the santa ines cemetery in vina del mar 75 
miles northwest of santiago 
police did not interfere with the ceremony but fired water 
cannons and tear gas to scatter demonstrators who tried to march 
downtown witnesses saw several marchers detained but police gave no 
report 
radio cooperativa reported about 100 people were detained during 
disturbances in iquique 1100 miles north of santiago no other 
information was available 
there were conflicting reports about allendes death some 
supporters said he was killed by troops who broke into his office a 
government report said he committed suicide with a carbine that was 
a gift from cuban president fidel castro 
pinochet a 73yearold general who commands the army said in 
his address the armed forces will not allow a civilian government to 
bring back the demagogic policies that he said brought the coup 
wearing his army uniform with the white red and blue 
presidential sash he said economic progress under his 
administration has placed chile very close to the most advanced 
nations 
toward the end of his speech with his voice breaking and his 
eyes brimming with tears he spoke of the unfair criticism he 
has received and the attempt to kill him three years ago 
in spite of all this we would do it again if necessary even 
if we had to offer our own lives he said 
i love my motherland dearly i love it more than i love my own 
life he added weeping openly 
several thousand people lined santiagos main boulevard to see 
pinochet ride in an open limousine for eight blocks from the 
presidential palace to a government building to deliver his speech 
in front of 3000 government officials military officers diplomats 
and special guests 
pinochet is to hand over the government on march 11 to a 
successor to be elected in balloting set for dec 14 
pinochet called the election after an october 1988 referendum in 
which voters rejected a military proposal to prolong his rule until 
1997 
patricio awlyin 70 a former senate president supported by a 
coalition of 17 opposition parties is favored to win the election 
but pinochet will retain a substantial amount of power the 
constitution written by his administration allows him to remain as 
army commander until 1998 and he has said he intends to do so 
he made clear the military will keep a close eye on the new 
government 
he said the armed forces will not allow that our national 
identity be deformed again and our sovereignty be subject to alien 
ideologies 
speaking of the coup he said if we hadnt taken power chile 
would have suffered the tragic consequences of a civilian war 
encouraged by the allende government itself and since the coup 
he said i have faced the biggest enemy of humanity leninist 
marxism 
he announced a 12 percent salary increase for all government 
employees effective dec 1 and said they will receive a 20 bonus 
this month on chilean national day

rep patricia schroeder dcolo said monday 
that congress can quell the fury that surrounds the abortion issue 
on both sides by funding birth control research 
if you had safe available family planning the abortion issue 
would almost be moot schroeder said in a speech to the womans 
national democratic club 
the nineterm congresswoman who began her law career as counsel 
to the rocky mountain planned parenthood chapter has introduced two 
bills that would give a federal push to birth control and fertility 
research and development 
the legislation is cosponsored by rep olympia snowe rmaine 
one bill is a resolution that expresses the sense of congress 
that the united states should make birth control and fertility 
research development and education a national priority by calling 
for creation of population centers to do such research she said 
the other measure would amend the public health service act to 
provide for the development and operation of three birth control 
research centers and two fertility research centers emphasizing 
clinical study of new drugs and devices 
the bill also contains a grant and loan repayment program 
designed to attract scientists to work at the centers 
it authorizes funds for five years for a total of 78 million 
schroeder assailed the republican administrations of the last 
nine years for working against family planning internationally 
she pointed out that us policy established by president nixon 
tied us foreign aid to birth control programs in the applicant 
country but under president reagan it was changed to oppose us 
involvement in family planning in other nations 
in the last decade only iran and the united states have been 
marching backward on family planning said schroeder

a federal judge said monday that john 
poindexter is entitled to any documents that might show former 
president reagan and president bush knew of the exnational security 
advisers activities in the irancontra scandal 
us district judge harold greene directed poindexters attorneys 
to explain to the court by next week how presidential and vice 
presidential documents would corroborate his claims that reagan and 
bush were aware of actions which later led to poindexters 
indictment 
neither a president nor his papers are beyond the reach of the 
law greene said 
the judge ordered independent counsel lawrence walsh to file 
court papers saying what responsibility if any he has to secure 
presidential and vice presidential documents and turn them over to 
poindexter 
under indictment for allegedly covering up oliver norths 
assistance to the nicaraguan contras poindexter says he had no 
motive to conceal norths and his own activities because reagan 
authorized them leading poindexter to believe they were legal 
if these claims of authorization by reagan and knowledge by 
bush are literally correct said greene the documents which 
would support them would be material to the preparation of 
poindexters defense 
poindexter worked directly for the former president met 
with him on an almost daily basis and the alleged violations 
occurred while he was so employed said the judge 
poindexters lawyers have asserted that reagan authorized 
poindexters responses to congressional inquiries about norths 
activities poindexter later was indicted for those responses which 
referred to letters written in 1985 by thennational security 
adviser robert mcfarlane denying that the national security council 
was supplying military advice or raising money for the nicaraguan 
contras 
mcfarlane later pleaded guilty to withholding information from 
congress in connection with the letters 
the judge said the court has a special obligation to act with 
prudence and restraint in seeking documents including personal 
diaries and notes from the heads of the executive branch of 
government 
but he said that neither a president nor his papers are beyond 
the reach of the law that requires the production or the giving of 
evidence and where a defendant in a criminal case needs that 
evidence this court will enforce his right to its production 
greene noted that many of reagans records are in his personal 
possession or with the national archives and that access to them 
might depend on the presidential records act of 1978 the 
independent counsel may not be responsible for producing documents 
from a former president noted the judge

president bush helped the department of the 
treasury observe its bicentennial monday with a speech emphasizing 
its current part in the war on drugs not its historical role in 
forging the american banking system 
bush addressing a sunbaked crowd of 1000 treasury workers and 
others paid tribute to the long illustrious history of your 
institution 
it was exactly 200 years ago that alexander hamilton took the 
oath of office as the first treasury secretary presiding over a 
department with six employees 
today it has 150000 most of them helping collect taxes but 
others engaged in tasks from the presidents protective secret 
service detail to customs agents to overseeing the nations savings 
and loans 
treasury has been in some ways the birthplace of the federal 
bureaucracy said bush noting that the us postal service the 
public health service the coast guard the departments of interior 
commerce and labor as well as the office of management and budget 
all were once part of treasurys domain 
bush used the address on the treasury portico overlooking the 
white house to declare that he does not contemplate using american 
armed forces in any combat role in the andean nations where the 
united states is supporting government efforts to break the drug 
cartels 
the president said treasury is making an outstanding 
contribution to our nations fight against drugs 
he said the customs services capabilities of interdicting drugs 
have never been better and agents from the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and fireams are on the front lines investigating the 
violent gunrunning organizations allied with the drug lords 
bush said money laundering was another front in the battle 
and he credited treasury the irs and customs with firstrate work 
tracing the path of drug profits in the worlds banking system 
he promised to track every lead that we receive from whatever 
source to separate the drug barons from the drug money weve 
got to hit the drug lords where it counts its time to take the 
profit out of the drug trade 
he also lauded treasurys role in sustaining our longrunning 
economic expansion restructuring our savings and loans and 
helping solve the third worlds debt problems 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said his department has 
responded to different challenges throughout its history from 
printing the first paper currency in 1862 to help abraham lincoln 
pay for the civil war to current efforts to find ways to preserve 
our standard of living by encouraging savings and longterm 
investment 
the event was held in blistering 91degree heat that caused at 
least one spectator to faint bush began his remarks by saying i 
notice one lady just passed out and i hadnt even begun to speak 
yet 
to mark the occasion in a more monetary way the treasury put 
more than 1 billion in currency gold and silver bullion on display 
in its cash room for visitors to gape at

the somali army murdered at least 5000 unarmed 
civilians over an 11month period according to a report 
commissioned by the state department 
the report prepared by consultant robert gersony described the 
deathtoll estimate as conservative 
the victims were members of the issak minority a group accused 
by the central government of aiding insurgents the report said the 
issaks werent in rebellion and didnt pose an immediate threat to 
the government 
the slayings according to the report began after attacks by the 
rebel somali national movement on the towns of burao and hargeisa in 
may 1988 
the somali armed forces conducted what appears to be a 
systematic pattern of attacks against unarmed civilian issak 
villages watering points and grazing areas of northern somalia 
killing many of their residents and forcing the survivors to flee 
for safety to remote areas the report said 
simulataneously the somali armed forces engaged in a pattern 
of roundups summary executions and massacres of many hundreds if 
not more unarmed civilian issaks 
survivors fleeing toward sanctuary in ethiopia were attacked by 
somali air and ground forces and hundreds were killed the report 
said many civilians imprisoned on allegations of supporting the 
rebels were beaten and choked it said 
hundreds of thousands of issak refugees reached ethiopia in march 
the report also accused rebel forces of killing civilians and 
prisoners of war from late may to late august 1988 
state department spokesman richard boucher said monday that the 
report was based on extensive interviews atrocities were committed 
by both the rebels and the military but far more were attributed to 
the somali army boucher said 
after the united states conveyed our concern to somalia more 
than 300 political prisoners were released he said however 
boucher added the state department is seriously disturbed by 
backsliding as the result of summer demonstrations in mogadishu 
the us government has a defense agreement with somalia mostly 
for use of a naval base as a result of somalias human rights 
abuses a 25 million us military support program was suspended 
in june 1988 
a 20 million economic aid program based on somalias conversion 
to a market economy and resulting hardships was suspended in july

the soviet union came to the defense of its 
embattled ally east germany on monday by condemning what it called a 
campaign to spur illegal east german emigration 
the united states britain and west germany welcomed the exodus 
monday of thousands of east germans from hungary through austria to 
new homes in west germany 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
praised hungary which boldly opened its borders to the west in 
defiance of a warsaw pact ally 
we also commend austria for its help and support and we admire 
the efforts of west germany to offer a home to fellow germans 
seeking freedom boucher said 
the soviet news agency tass made the criticism in a commentary on 
the historic exodus that followed the hungarian governments 
decision sunday to allow all east germans to leave for west germany 
a number of press bodies television networks and radio of the 
frg federal republic of germany instigate gdr german 
democratic republic people to unlawful actions while missions of 
the federal republic abroad in violation of generally recognized 
norms of international law assume protection of those persons and 
supply them with west german documents tass said 
several hundred east germans seeking safe passage to the west 
are holed up in west germanys embassy in prague czechoslovakia 
tass said western news outlets have been waging a tendentious 
campaign based on the illegal departures of some east germans 
it was the first comment on the greatest flood of east german 
refugees since 1961 the year the berlin wall halted the flow to the 
west state television in its evening news broadcast vremya 
showed some of the refugees monday 
tass said the campaign and propaganda hullabaloo were 
conducted by those who have the absurd idea of engulfing east 
germany 
the commentary reiterated the kremlins loyalty to its east bloc 
ally 
east germany is an inalienable part of the warsaw treaty and 
our true friend and ally tass said 
hungarys action marks the first time a warsaw pact country has 
aided an exodus of refugees from an allied communist nation 
britains foreign secretary john major said monday that the 
thousands of east germans left for the west because the government 
failed to provide for its citizens basic needs 
the clearest conclusion we can draw from the backdrop of the 
german refugees is the extent to which the east german government 
has failed in the job it should have done over recent years to 
provide a reasonable standard of living said major in an 
interview with the independent television network from washington 
where he met with president bush 
west german chancellor helmut kohl during a speech in bremen 
said that until east germany adopts reforms west germany will be 
seen as a mecca for unhappy east german citizens 
klaus bolling former head of the west german mission to east 
germany said there was a danger the situation was overheating he 
told itn that urgent reforms were need in east germany but that they 
were unlikely since he could not see a german version of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
bolling was referring to the freer climate in the soviet union 
under gorbachev 
i listened to a member of the central committee in east berlin 
a few weeks ago bolling said he was saying who could have 
imagined that the soviet union would be the place where the 
counterrevolution would start

chairman robert byrd dwva said he will introduce legislation 
increasing next years antidrug spending by 39 billion paying 
for it by cutting domestic and defense programs across the board by 
0575 percent 
byrd said his provision to be proposed tuesday would bring 
total federal spending on drug programs to 101 billion in fiscal 
1990 which begins oct 1 22 billion more than bush has proposed 
the president says read my lips said byrd whose panel 
oversees about half of all federal spending he says he wont 
support any increase in taxes so i have to do what i can do 
bush has proposed paying for the increases he proposed last week 
by trimming spending for several programs not across the board 
as for us troops in the drug fight about 30 servicemen have 
arrived in colombia to help train that nations military forces in 
using newly supplied us military equipment bush said colombia has 
received 10 aircraft five helicopters and an assortment of jeeps 
ambulances and armor 
the advisers and equipment are part of a 65 million package that 
bush authorized last month for colombia the president announced 
last tuesday that an additional 261 million in security aid will go 
to colombia peru and bolivia as the part of a fiveyear 2 billion 
program 
while bush tried to play down the role of us forces in latin 
america a member of the senate intelligence committee said the 
military will provide protection to us drug enforcement agents and 
other law enforcement officials operating in such nations as 
colombia bolivia and peru 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said a secret directive signed 
recently by bush authorizes the military to be physically involved 
with units in the field where we have been invited to have our law 
enforcement people 
the senator said such protection is designed to prevent incidents 
similar to the torture and murder of us drug agent enrique 
camarena in guadalajara mexico in february 1985 we cant 
afford another camarena said deconcini 
fitzwater said he could not comment on the senators remarks 
although the spokesman confirmed that bush had signed a secret 
directive outlining the goals and limits of military involvement in 
the drug fight 
fitzwater said the us forces in latin america do have the right 
to defend themselves he said that is standard policy for us 
troops anywhere in the world 
they are there there is a risk colombia is a very dangerous 
place to be these days fitzwater said 
in another development fitzwater threw cold water on a 
suggestion by drug enforcement administrator john lawn that the 
administration is reconsidering whether to ban the sale of assault 
weapons produced in the united states the bush administration has 
curtailed importation of such weapons but has not taken any action 
against those made in this country 
we arent aware of any reconsideration fitzwater said by 
that i mean theres none in the white house i know the white 
house position has been given to me by the highest authorities 
the president in a speech to treasury department officials used 
virtually the same language employed by fitzwater in talking about 
the role of us servicemen 
let me state clearly bush said none of the andean nations 
have asked for us troops and there is no contemplation of the use 
of american armed forces in any combat role 
no us military personnel will accompany hostgovernment 
forces on actual field operations the president added our 
personnel will provide training equipment and operational support 
as we have been asked to do and i will see that it works just 
exactly that day 
fitzwater refused to give details of the secret directive on the 
drug war 
asked if the directive left the door open for the use of troops 
under some conditions fitzwater said i really cant go beyond 
that it doesnt contemplate the use of troops i think the 
interpretation can fairly be made that it doesnt authorize troops 
either 
during the day bush met with britains new foreign minister 
john major afterward major told reporters that britain has had a 
team of experts in bogota for the past few days to assess how london 
can help the government of president virgilio barco fight drugs 
major said british officials have developed a package of training 
and technical assistance itll certainly also deal with 
protection of personnel he said 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
that a multicountry drug interdiction program called operation 
snowcap resumed over the weekend in peru 
operations had been suspended since february because of security 
concerns but are resuming with the completion of a secure base in 
santa lucia he said 
we have approximately 45 logistics personnel i think these are 
contractors basically they maintain the equipment which supports 
the snowcap operations as well as about 14 us enforcement 
personnel advising peruvian police in the upper huallaga valley

the national education association unveiled 
teaching guidelines monday to help the nations children appreciate 
the plight of the 3 million homeless families forced to live out of 
cars and in parks 
housing and homelessness a teaching guide is geared to 
grades 4 through 12 with the goals of teaching children about 
homelessness and the need for affordable housing and changing 
negative attitudes toward homeless people 
field trips to homeless shelters are encouraged in the guide as 
well as classroom discussions about substandard and overcrowded 
housing and income levels of groups in a community 
teachers are asked to involve younger students in role playing by 
giving them monopoly money and then asking them to stretch the 
meager wage to cover utilities gasoline and rent 
if this curriculum is well understood by the teacher and taught 
in an open questioning environment it can afford the student the 
opportunity to be educated and to act said carol fennelly 
coauthor of the publication 
as with most americans and as with most social issues the 
problems of poverty and housing are further burdened by a wide 
variety of myths such as people can make it if they want to or 
there is enough housing for everyone if they just work hard enough 
and save 
fennelly said the most positive means of dispelling myths is 
with a clear and simple presentation of reality 
neas new president keith geiger estimated that more than half 
a million children are homeless including as many as 15000 in the 
nations capital alone an estimated 10 million live in substandard 
housing and millions more live in cramped quarters 
the curriculum was produced by housing now a national coalition 
of homelesss and housing groups with assistance from educators 
geiger said neas 1 million members are being encouraged to use 
the curriculum which has been distributed to state affiliates and 
200 of the groups largest local affiliates

the american bar association on monday urged 
president bush to end the export of usmade assaultstyle weapons 
to colombia saying such a ban would not run afoul of the 
constitution 
aba president l stanley chauvin jr in a letter to bush 
responded to statements made recently by drug policy director 
william bennett that banning the manufacture of assaultstyle 
weapons might be unconstitutional 
over the years the american bar association has carefully 
studied similar legislative proposals to restrict handguns or 
automatic weapons for example and concluded that legislation to 
ban or restrict a specific class of weapons rather than all 
weapons would not run afoul of the second amendment to the us 
constitution chauvin said 
the american bar association believes restrictions should be 
placed on military assault weapons whether made in the united 
states or elsewhere chauvin said 
chauvin did not take a position on specific legislation pending 
in congress 
but he urged bush to ban the export of assaultstyle weapons to 
colombia where 50 percent of sophisticated military equipment 
seized from drug lords in the last 18 months was found to have been 
made in the united states 
chauvin urged bush to respond swiftly and affirmatively to the 
urgent request of the colombian government to end us exportation 
of military assault weapons to the drug cartels in that country 
failing to take this step not only undermines the valiant 
efforts of the colombian leadership to preserve democracy and 
justice indeed civilized society in that country but 
contributes dramatically to the death and destruction being 
inflicted on our own citizens by these drug cartels chauvin said 
earlier this year the bush administration virtually banned the 
importation of foreignmade assaultstyle weapons 
despite bennetts comments last week drug enforcement agency 
administrator john c lawn said sunday that the administration is 
reconsidering a proposal to ban those assaultstyle weapons produced 
in this country 
the first step was the banning of the weapons from other 
countries lawn said during an appearance on cbss face the 
nation 
we must look now at our own procedures here in the united 
states he said

the 17nation european jewish congress said monday 
it asked jewish organizations worldwide to cease formal contact with 
the roman catholic church because of the dispute over a convent at 
the auschwitz death camp 
at issue is the word of the church it is difficult to speak 
with someone when you have this kind of problem said theo klein 
who led the french delegation to the twoday annual meeting 
klein a former president of the european jewish congress said 
he has appealed to jewish organizations to suspend official contacts 
with the catholic church he said there had been no dissent 
each organization is free to make its own policy so i cannot 
say to you that all organizations have stopped dialogue but i think 
so said klein who helped negotiate a 1987 agreement with 
catholic representatives to remove the carmelite convent 
the meeting was dominated by the convent issue which has split 
catholics and revived debates about lingering antisemitism in 
europe many jews regard the convent at the camp where at least 
25 million jews were among the estimated 4 million victims during 
world war ii as offensive 
under the 1987 accord negotiated in geneva between international 
jewish organizations and a representative of the polish catholic 
church cardinal franciszek macharski it was agreed the convent 
should be removed by feb 22 
but the polish primate cardinal jozef glemp continues to back 
the convent which is in a hut where the nazis stored gas used in 
the mass murder of jews he has said the geneva agreement was not 
negotiated by competent people 
two french cardinals and a belgian cardinal who helped negotiate 
the 1987 agreement have rejected glemps stance 
klein said he wrote to french cardinal albert decourtray in july 
announcing that all formal jewishcatholic contacts would cease 
until the convent issue is resolved 
since then klein said he has refused all invitations from 
catholic organizations including a recent invitation to address a 
french catholic student body 
the catholics themselves understand it is very difficult to 
have a dialogue now without having solved this problem of the 
carmelites said klein 
informal contacts will continue with the european catholic 
cardinals who want to stick to the agreement klein said 
it seems to me that in the vatican some people will try to find 
a solution but if it will be the boss i dont know said klein 
referring to pope john paul ii who has not publicly expressed his 
opinion on the issue 
lionel kopelowitz president of the european jewish congress 
said the meeting endorsed the suspension of formal contacts 
in a resolution the congress urged swift removal of the convent 
and said it hoped that the hitherto fruitful jewishcatholic 
dialogue strongly affected by the situation will not suffer 
lasting damage 
auschwitz itself is holy ground said kopelowitz it needs 
no memorial of any sort to any faith it is soaked in the blood 
of all those who died 
glemp has canceled a us visit scheduled to start on sept 21 
the polish news agency pap reported over the weekend 
the announcement came after us jewish leaders said they planned 
to sue glemp for defamation claiming he implied that jewish 
protesters sought to harm the nuns during a july 14 demonstration at 
the camp

the government may have to write off much of 
the 38 million owed by violators of federal mine reclamation laws 
the general accounting office said monday 
the money may not be collectable because many of the companies 
that failed to restore mining sites and then failed to pay their 
penalties are either bankrupt or no longer mining said a report 
by the investigating arm of congress 
about 99 percent of the money owed by penalized mining companies 
was considered delinquent as of the end of the last fiscal year 83 
percent had been in the delinquent column for an entire year the 
report said 
the government may never be able to achieve a high rate of 
collection the investigators concluded 
the federal office of surface mining has been criticized for 
about five years by rep morris udall dariz and other members of 
congress for poorly tracking cases after imposing penalties the gao 
said the agency had improved its procedures and has a better system 
for collecting the money owed by mine law violators

the chairman of the senate appropriations 
committee said monday he will introduce legislation increasing next 
years antidrug spending by 39 billion paying for it by cutting 
most domestic and defense programs 
the proposal by sen robert byrd dwva would mark a concrete 
response from democrats who have said president bushs own new 
drugfighting proposals are inadequate and underfunded 
in particular a number of democratic leaders have said bushs 
79 billion program would be difficult to finance without raising 
taxes an option bush has steadfastly rejected 
the president says read my lips said byrd whose panel 
oversees about half of all federal spending he says he wont 
support any increase in taxes so i have to do what i can do 
his proposal would bring spending for federal drug initiatives to 
101 billion in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 22 billion 
more than bush has sought 
byrd not only topped the dollars bush would spend but said his 
proposal of 0575 percent acrosstheboard cuts to pay for the extra 
spending was fairer than what the president proposed 
last tuesday bush asked congress to increase antidrug efforts 
by 717 million he said he would pay for it by paring a handful of 
programs including immigration aid rural development housing and 
a defense department radio system 
the drug epidemic facing this country is a crisis that affects 
us all byrd told reporters in my view it is critical that we 
look for solutions that will seek to spread not only the pain but 
also the gain in a fair and evenhanded manner 
byrd said 53 percent of the additional money would be spent on 
law enforcement efforts and 47 percent would be for education 
treatment and prevention programs 
his proposed cuts would not effect social security or other 
federal benefit programs 
bush has reacted to the quick democratic criticism of his 
proposals by dismissing it has partisan carping 
democratic leaders have responded by accusing bush of 
recommending expensive programs the manned space mission to mars 
was another they cited while giving little indication how congress 
was supposed to find the money

students who want to play football at arlington 
high school have to come up with 125 and wouldbe cheerleaders 
need 80 to root for them 
its part of the price being paid these days for massachusetts 
slipping economy and no one is feeling it more than the kids 
some school districts have dropped afterschool activities 
entirely others reduced bus service at the states largest public 
university courses are eliminated buildings are going unrepaired 
and libraries cant buy books 
education in massachusetts is among the best in the country 
franklyn jenifer state chancellor of higher education said monday 
in an interview with current fiscal problems however it is a 
bad time for us all he said 
we must maintain stable and rational policies so that we do not 
throw away the seed corn for when the good times come back he 
said 
great expectations for state tax revenue growth of 109 percent 
for fiscal 1989 shriveled to 65 percent growth a difference of 
364 million 
this year its a similar story the fiscal year that started july 
1 was expected to see revenue growth of 7 percent thats already 
shrunk to 51 percent 
lack of money takes its toll 
some schools are charging fees for extracurricular activities for 
the firs time springfield dropped such programs entirely 
at the lincolnsudbury regional high school youngsters are 
charged 100 for each sport they play 
jim dusenbery director of student activities in the affluent 
suburban district said participation remains high although some 
students are on a paylater plan or getting financial aid 
we were vehemently opposed at first of course dusenbery 
said its difficult to charge for math classes but many schools 
are charging for extracurricular activities 
he wasnt being facetious about charging for regular classes his 
district gave some thought to making students pay for such extra 
courses as economics and accounting 
historically and traditionally those things have been provided 
for as part of a public school system its not a very positive 
development said edward melikian spokesman for the state 
education department 
state budget cuts forced the cities of springfield and chicopee 
to eliminate some bus routes 
at the 26000student university of massachusetts at amherst 31 
million cut from a twoyear budget of 193 million is leaving 
buildings unmaintained and libraries out of pocket by the end of 
the school year 5000 seats available in classes will be eliminated 
roland sarti chairman of the umass history department said 
1500 students scrambled last week for the 300 class openings in 
required history courses 
some students much attend for a fifth year just to take required 
classes 
the students arent so much irate as just very depressed

palestinians in clashes and a cabinet minister blamed an escalation 
in violence in the occupied territories on the united states 
dialogue with the plo 
a palestinian man was found beaten to death in the occupied gaza 
strip and arab reports said he was slain as an alleged collaborator 
with israel 
the death came a day after seven palestinians were killed by 
israelis and an eighth by a fellow arab in one of the bloodiest days 
of the 21monthold uprising against israeli rule 
at least 113 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs as 
accused collaborators prostitutes or drug dealers and another 567 
have been killed by israeli soldiers and civilians since the 
uprising began in december 1987 forty israelis have died in the 
violence 
the israeli minister avner shaki of the national religious 
party spoke at a funeral for an israeli who was bludgeoned to death 
last week allegedly by an arab man from the occupied west bank 
to our good friend the united states your contacts with the 
plo your regonition of the plo and your continuing discussions with 
the murderers encourages more bloodshed said shaki a minister 
without a portfolio if you dont cease these talks this blood 
will be on your hands 
the us began talks with the palestine liberation organization 
under israeli protest in december after the arab group renounced 
terrorism 
meanwhile a military governor in the disputed lands warned 
palestinians to diminish the violence or face the consequences 
speaking on israels state arabic language television brig gen 
sheike erez military governor of the west bank urged palestinians 
to stop the deterioration because they will pay for it in the 
end

the west german news media said 
monday that the health of east germany leader erich honecker has 
worsened and he has lost the will to live 
honecker a hardline communist underwent gallbladder surgery 
last month 
the zdf television network quoted western diplomatic sources in 
hungary as saying honeckers medical condition has deteriorated 
considerably 
according to information that allegedly comes from communist 
party officials honecker has no mental verve and no wish to get 
better zdf said 
the hamburgbased newspaper bild had a frontpage headline saying 
honecker wants to die 
bild citing unidentified sources in east berlin said the 
condition of the communist leader has worsened badly and honecker 
has lost the will to live 
the 77yearold honecker has resisted the reforms sweeping much 
of the soviet bloc and thousands of east germans are fleeing their 
country because of the political and economic situation 
thousands escaped monday to west germany after hungary allowed 
east germans who had gathered in refugee camps to pass freely across 
the border into austria east germany bitterly denounced hungary a 
fellow member of the warsaw pact 
zdf said of east germanys ruling communists critics in the 
politburo reportedly are charging that honecker misjudged the 
meaning and scope of the wave of refugees 
west german foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog told the 
associated press in a telephone interview that reports on honeckers 
condition are pure speculation we have no firsthand information 
on this 
two weeks ago western intelligence sources said honeckers 
gallbladder surgery had to be abandoned because of the weakness of 
surrounding tissue 
some news reports speculated that honecker has cancer 
east germanys state news agency adn said early this month that 
honecker had been released from the hospital and had taken a 
vacation to recover it has not carried any recent reports on his 
condition 
communist party sources in east berlin speaking on the condition 
they not be identified told ap over the weekend that there were 
clear signs honeckers mental capacity was failing and his 
condition had caused a delay in toplevel decisions 
bild is published by the springer concern which has been a 
critic of honecker for decades

be reversed and poland has a chance to lead other east bloc nations 
while poles are obliged to make most of the new opportunities 
i dont believe that one can turn the course of events back 
you can pay for it more you can do it longer it can last longer 
but the direction of perestroika reforms must continue and must 
achieve success he was quoted as saying 
perestroika is soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs term for

a deputy from the governing motherland 
party was reelected speaker of parliament on monday in a vote seen 
as a preview of the election of a president by the legislators in 
november 
yildirim akbulut premier turgut ozals handpicked candidate 
was elected on the third ballot he got 250 votes in the 450seat 
singlechamber parliament where the motherland party holds 289 seats 
under the constitution in the first two ballots a twothirds 
majority of 300 votes is needed to elect a speaker 
on the third ballot the winner needs only a majority 226 
akbulut 54 failed to get the required majority on the first two 
ballots because four other candidates from the motherland party 
divided the votes and he received no support from opposition parties 
three motherland candidates withdrew after the first two ballots 
leaving only akbulut and ilyas aktas in the contest aktas received 
173 votes 
the motherland deputies including aktas said they entered the 
race to show opposition to ozals deciding on akbuluts candidacy 
without consulting his partys parliamentary group 
the same balloting procedure will be followed for novembers 
presidential election in which ozal may be a candidate the premier 
has not announced his candidacy but has not denied news reports that 
he may run 
the opposition parties in parliament the social democrat 
populist party and the conservative true path party say parliament 
is no longer representative because the motherland party has lost 
substantial support since the last general elections 
in local elections in march the motherland party won only 218 
percent of the vote finishing third after the two major opposition 
parties 
the next general elections are scheduled for 1992 
political analysts have said ozal may use his partys 
parliamentary majority to become president and cap his political 
career rather than face possible defeat in 1992 
ozal told a news conference last week that parliament would elect 
a civilian president through its own free will 
president kenan evren a leader of the former military junta 
will retire at the end of his sevenyear term as president 
the armed forces have for decades taken an active part in 
selecting the president and six of the last seven presidents have 
been former military men 
akbulut a lawyer was elected to parliament in 1983 and became 
speaker in 1987 the speaker of parliament becomes acting president 
in the absence or illness of the president he can call parliament 
back from recess

a group of 16 americans headed monday for a 
small desert island in the south pacific where two retired military 
airmen believe amelia earhart died of thirst after her plane crashed 
52 years ago 
we wouldnt be going if we didnt think there was something 
there said richard gillespie president of the international 
group for historic aircraft recovery in wilmington del 
the expedition was spurred by research conducted by two fort 
walton beach fla men tom willi a former navy pilot and tom 
gannon a retired air force navigator 
willi and gannon studied aircraft navigation of the 1930s to plot 
a probable course followed by earhart their research pointed toward 
nikumaroro island about 1000 miles east of fiji 
gannon and willi accompanied the group to fiji but will remain in 
suva to handle communications with the expedition to nikumaroro 
also known as gardner 
the expeditions archaeologist thomas king said the group hopes 
to find traces of the fuselage of earharts lockheed electra plane 
and its two steel engines 
earhart set off from papua new guinea on a journey that began in 
oakland calif her disappearance july 3 1937 made headlines 
around the world president franklin roosevelt authorized a search 
for the plane but nothing was found 
the american flier was 6820 miles short of her goal of flying 
around the world when she and navigator fred noonan vanished her 
stopover destination en route to hawaii was howland island about 
500 miles north of nikumaroro 
gillespie said that in the three days after earharts last 
message was received 24 radio communications were picked up at 
various locations gillespie said they were on earharts frequency 
and in a female voice when plotted these radio communications 
crossed with nikumaroro he said 
the us navy flew over the supposedly uninhabited island during 
the 1937 search and one of the pilots reported clear signs of 
recent human habitation gillespie said but no landing was ever 
made 
it was the most likely alternative destination for earhart yet 
no one ever really searched it he said 
gillespies group of 16 aviation historians archaeologists 
divers sonar experts and photographers chartered a converted 
japanese trawler pacific nomad for their search they expect to 
reach the island this weekend 
numerous theories about earharts disappearance have been made 
including speculation she was a us spy or that she was captured by 
the japanese and executed 
another explanation is that she simply ran out of fuel and 
crashed while trying to locate howland a tiny speck of land in the 
south pacific

wished her exiled predecessor ferdinand marcos a happy birthday as 
long as he spends it outside of the philippines 
as a christian i pray that god will give him his blessings 
from this day mrs aquino told reporters on marcos 72nd 
birthday i am holding fast to what i believe is for the national 
interest and that is not to allow marcos and his family to return 
at this time 
mrs aquino has cited national security for refusing to allow 
marcos to return from hawaii where he has lived since his ouster in 
a civilianmilitary uprising in february 1986 
marcos has been hospitalized in honolulu since january with 
heart kidney liver and lung ailments and is reported in critical 
condition 
nearly 1000 marcos supporters held a peaceful rally monday to 
mark the expresidents birthday 
his followers published a fullpage advertisement monday in the 
nationally circulated philippine daily inquirer extending birthday 
greetings and calling for his return in the interest of true 
national reconciliation 
also on monday airports in manila and cebu were alerted to 
prevent a marcos supporter who also is related to mrs aquino from 
slipping back into the country from the united states 
bienvenido alano acting commissioner of immigration and 
deportation said the alert was ordered because of reports that 
businessman eduardo cojuangco might enter the country 
we have information that mr cojuangco has a plan to return 
alano said in a radio interview so i alerted immigration officers 
in manila airport and in cebu because the report is he will come in 
via cebu in any case when we find out that he came in we will 
detain him at the airport 
cojuangco a first cousin of mrs aquino fled the country 
shortly before marcos was ousted and has been living in santa 
monica calif he has been linked to previous attempts to topple the 
aquino administration 
in another development the official in charge of recovering 
marcos alleged hidden wealth said his agency will need an 
increase of more than 500000 in its budget to continue the search 
the government claims marcos and his backers embezzled up to 10 
billion during the 20 years that marcos ruled 
mateo caparas chairman of the presidential commission on good 
government asked the house appropriations committee to increase his 
budget from 950000 to 15 million for 1990 
caparas also said the commission needs more than 2 million to 
pay american lawyers representing the philippines in civil suits 
pending against marcos in us courts 
the government has said that so far it has recovered about 133 
million in cash and the money has been turned over to the land 
reform program

norways lapps won a 100year struggle for 
limited selfrule but few of these arctic reindeer herders used 
their chance to vote on monday for lapplands first national 
assembly 
in a 1987 law norway granted this oncenomadic people the right 
to elect an assembly to represent their minority interests but with 
no mandate to enact legislation 
the sami have finally won political rights as a people it has 
all happened so fast i wouldnt have believed it possible even a 
few years ago said hans guttorm a sami candidate the lapps 
prefer to be called sami 
but of the estimated 24000 lapps eligible in norway less than 
5500 registered to vote in the election for an assembly held in 
conjuction with national elections in which they also vote 
those who did marched to the polls under their own flag in 
brightly colored woven costumes trimmed with reindeer leather 
the lapps were electing 39 representatives to the assembly 
called the sameting it will convene oct 9 in karasjok in the 
northern finnmark province 
analysts said the low turnout showed that many lapps 
traditionally hunters fishermen and herdsmen have lost their roots 
there is a certain skepticism especially among older sami 
said peder andersen 72 a pioneer lapp activist told the news 
agency ntb he said the assembly needs time to prove itself 
the sameting wont fix everything that was wrong my hope is 
that it just makes things a little better for the new generation 
the lapps are scattered through the scandinavian and soviet 
arctic their ancient culture was nearly destroyed by active 
policies of assimilation about twothirds of all sami live in 
norway the foreign ministry says 
until the 1950s lappish a language related to finnish was 
forbidden in schools churches and government many sami stopped 
speaking it to their children 
lapps once had to assume norwegian names if they wanted to own 
property sami culture was severely represeed 
an 1890s education document said the sami have no other route 
to a higher level of culture than through the norwegian language and 
culture 
norwegianization was successful an 1888 census showed that 88 
percent of the residents of kvaenangen in northern norway called 
themselves lapps by 1950 none admitted being sami there were no 
mass migrations or major epidemics during the 62 years 
a sami consciousness movement began growing in the 1950s pride 
of their ethnic heritage spread to the scandinavian peoples who 
governed them 
norway now encourages sami culture this autumn the countrys 
first sami university opened sami cultural artistic and media 
institutions have also been formed with government support 
on monday with the assembly vote some lapps said they finally 
felt like equals to norwegians 
mainstream national parties put up candidates for the sameting 
but the sami national union was projected to win a clear majority 
ballots must be collected from isolated villages delaying the 
count results were not expected until wednesday 
election platforms mainly concerned ways to used the new powers 
to influence norways parliament and local governments on sami 
issues 
we sami are one people and national boundaries will not break 
our peoples union we have our own history our own culture and our 
own language which we intend to pass to coming generations 
declared one election platform

agreements to return the skeletal remains of 
american indians and to renovate a museum in new york city are 
helping push plans to create a national museum of the american 
indian here closer to realization 
reps charles rangel and ted weiss both new york democrats met 
last week with robert mcc adams secretary of the smithsonian 
institution and all agreed that the smithsonian would renovate the 
current museum in upper manhattan to create an exhibition space 
spokesmen said monday 
we have agreed to renovate 2000 square feet to bring it up to 
certain security safety and basic standards of museum exhibitry 
said smithsonian spokeswoman madeleine jacobs 
in a related matter adams rep ben nighthorse campbell 
dcolo and sen daniel k inouye dhawaii on tuesday were to 
announce an agreement between the smithsonian and american indian 
groups on the return on skeletal remains in the museums possession 
the issue could have been another obstacle to passing indian 
museum legislation but jacobs said that problem has been resolved 
theres kind of a realization thats dawning that the spiritual 
needs of the living indian people as well as their spiritual 
traditions have to be considered and not secondarily to 
archaeological pursuits said carolyn light a spokeswoman for 
campbell 
the smithsonian has a collection of the bones of approximately 
18000 indians eskimos and aleuts most of which were unearthed 
during archaeological excavations construction or erosion about 
4000 of the specimens came from the army medical museum and were 
transferred to the smithsonian at the turn of the century 
the new york congressmen had been unhappy with a plan to move the 
current museum of the american indian from audubon terrace to the 
old us custom house in lower manhattan and transfer the bulk of 
the collection to a new museum to be built on the mall in 
washington they were displeased that the agreement reached in may 
did not guarantee a continued presence at audubon terrace 
according to language drafted last week the smithsonian will 
lend artifacts and exhibitions to a successor museum at audubon 
terrace and provide training technical assistance and other 
support to the facility 
adams has estimated it would take about five years to build the 
new museum in washington once congress passes legislation 
authorizing and funding it

the commander of the 1961 bay of pigs invasion of 
cuba was found dead at his home a possible suicide more than 28 
years after the failed mission that haunted him police and friends 
said monday 
jose alfredo perez san roman 58 led the 1500man brigade of 
cuban exiles in the abortive assault on their island homeland in 
april 1961 they were defeated by troops loyal to the communist 
government of fidel castro who had seized power in 1959 after 
dictator fulgencio batista fled amid guerrilla fighting 
san roman and more than 1000 of his followers were imprisoned 
nearly two years 
san roman whose body was discovered at 920 am sunday at his 
mobile home spent much of his own imprisonment in solitary 
confinement 
he reportedly had a history of depression in the years that 
followed 
police were considering the death a suicide pending the results 
of an autopsy a note was found on the scene and will be compared 
with mr romans handwriting said metrodade police spokesman 
george reyes 
col ramon j ferrermena san romans chief of staff at the bay 
of pigs said his commander took the defeat personally and didnt 
accept the missions failure even as it collapsed around the small 
exile invasion force 
by the middle of the invasion i was convinced that everything 
went wrong ferrermena said monday but he never accepted that 
even when we were in the swamps 
he took it quite personally said ferrermena he felt 
responsible for every man who died there and every widow and child 
left without a father 
robert kennedy then us attorney general said san roman told 
him after his repatriation from cuba that ten times as many troops 
would have been needed to succeed 
failure of the invasion plan has been attributed to limited 
support from the us government and almost no air support 
veterans of brigade 2506 the exile military detachment that 
landed on the central southern cuban beaches still meet in miami 
and discuss what might have been 
the invasion cost almost 100 lives and the more than 1000 
prisoners were held until december 1962 when they were freed in 
exchange for food and medicine 
col humberto olivera another veteran of the bay of pigs 
described san roman as a hero in the exile community 
during his trial he behaved as a commander said olivera 
he never said no and he was a man who faced a firing squad and 
never turned his back on his principles he was a brilliant man 
olivera said san roman was an honor student and graduate of 
managua military academy the cuban equivalent of the us military 
academy he also was one of the youngest captains of the cuban army 
olivera said 
during the final days of the batista regime san roman opposed 
batista and was put in jail said olivera later he saw the new 
cuban goverment was communist and joined the exile opposition 
he was the man who led the invasion he refused to leave the 
beach when he had a chance olivera said monday he said the 
famous words we came here to fight

a sheriffs deputy testifying at a 
hearing for ramon salcido on monday fought back tears monday when 
identifying a photograph of the former winery workers young 
daughters found with their throats slashed 
salcido is accused of killing seven people in a killing spree 
april 14 
sonoma county sheriffs deputy mike mcmanus spoke haltingly as he 
described finding the bodies of sofia 4 and teresa 1 lying near 
their sister carmina 3 who survived the attack 
mcmanus the first officer to arrive at the county dump where the 
girls bodies were discovered testified in the opening day of a 
preliminary hearing for salcido 
salcido is accused of killing his wife two daughters his 
motherinlaw and her two daughters and a coworker during the 
rampage he also is accused of attempting to murder carmina another 
coworker and the coworkers wife 
sonoma county judge knoel owen denied a defense motion to 
continue the hearing for 30 days to assure the appearance of two 
us drug agents who help captured salcido in his native mexico five 
days after the rampage 
salcido told the agents he killed his wife and a coworker in a 
jealous rage believing they were romantically involved federal 
officials have said 
salcidos defense attorney marteen miller has accused mexican 
authorities of coercing a confession he said it would take 30 days 
for authorities in washington dc to ensure the agents 
appearance 
owen said he would reconsider millers motion if at the end of 
preliminary hearing the agents had not testified 
dr william vogel an administrator with the california forensic 
medical group who examined salcido in custody testifed that he 
found no physical evidence of torture 
also testifying was richard waller a criminalist with the 
california department of justice laboratory who said that blood 
found on the body of salcidos motherinlaw and her 12yearold 
daughter appears to be salcidos 
the finding based on tests of genetic markers in blood also 
linked a sample found on a 22caliber semiautomatic pistol to 
salcido said waller 
salcido 28 who has pleaded innocent to the charges sat quietly 
throughout the hearing 
after mondays session assistant district attorney peter bumerts 
called the physical evidence in the case as conclusive as it 
gets 
i dont think this is a whodoneit and i dont think miller 
has ever indicated it would be said bumerts 
the hearing is expected to last two weeks and then the judge 
will decide whether enough evidence exists to hold salcido over for 
trial 
on aug 31 owen ordered the prosecutor to turn over to the 
defense all information about salcidos arrest authorities also 
must cooperate in the release of details surrounding salcidos 
arrest in mexico owen said 
salcido allegedly confessed voluntarily to the slayings to 
mexican authorities before being turned over to sonoma county 
deputies 
miller in asking for release of arrest information argued that 
any challenge to that confession will have to go into the original 
arrest in mexico not just the arrest by the sonoma county sheriffs 
department during a flight from mexico city to santa rosa 
miller also hinted that salcido may been right in suspecting his 
wife of infidelity but miller refused to reveal any evidence to 
support his claim

a tunisian minister urged the bush 
administration monday to grant a visa to yasser arafat so the 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization could address the 
un general assembly 
but a state department spokesman richard boucher said arafat 
had not applied last week arafat told a saudi arabian newspaper he 
planned to attend the un session which opens in two weeks 
in a meeting with reporters habib boulares the tunisian 
minister of culture and information said issuing a visa should not 
be a problem we consider he has the right to go to the un 
boulares said 
the tunisian said he did not think the bush administration would 
want to see the united nations shift its deliberations to geneva in 
order to hear arafat 
he referred to the transfer to the swiss city of a special 
session on the palestinian issue after the reagan administration 
denied arafat a visa for new york last year subsequently the 
administration concluded arafat had renounced terrorism and opened a 
dialogue with the plo 
it is being held in tunisia where the plo maintains its 
headquarters the talks have not helped to break a stalemate in 
addressing the arabisraeli dispute 
but boulares said the dialogue should go on when people talk 
together they can find a good way to solve pending problems he 
said 
on another subject boulares urged the bush administration and 
the world bank to ease tunisias 5 billion debt burden by 
stretching out repayment of loans and lowering interest rates 
he said the north african country had undertaken political 
reforms that included abolition of forced labor and restricting 
pretrial custody 
boulares said a drought and infestation of locusts contributed to 
tunisias difficulties 
he is in the united states in connection with an exhibition of 
mosaics to be exhibited on thursday in los angeles

arafat arrived in cairo early monday it was not clear how long 
he would stay in egypt 
last week mubarak met with arafat during a brief visit to 
tunisia and said the palestinian leader would travel to cairo for 
talks on egyptian ideas for israelipalestinian peace talks

the bush administration has decided to hold 
refugee admissions to the united states to 125000 in the next 
fiscal year an increase of slightly less than 8 percent from this 
year a congressional source said monday night 
the figure would include slots for 50000 from the soviet union 
no change from this years allocation the current soviet figure is 
almost double what it was during the start of the current fiscal 
year last oct 1 
but the administration with congressional support in both 
parties has decided it cannot handle any more refugees from the 
soviet union according to several recent reports and the source 
israel has also expressed concern that jewish refugees from the 
soviet union were increasingly choosing to head for the united 
states once out of their homeland depriving the jewish state of 
needed settlers 
the congressional source affiliated with the immigration 
subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee said the issue is 
not the numbers but the backlog he estimated there are 20000 
soviet emigres in rome and vienna awaiting us decisions on their 
eligibility to enter the united states 
under a revision of regulations ordered last year by attorney 
general ed meese each person applying must prove individual 
eligibility for refugee status which means government aid in 
resettlement and admission outside the normal immigration rules 
previously jews from the soviet union were automatically considered 
refugees 
the new decision has made the backlog grow faster than it can be 
processed 
overall this years refugee quota arrived at by the 
administration each year in consultation with the house and senate 
judiciary committees is 116000 persons up from 94000 at the 
start of the fiscal year 
the 125000 figure for next year would include 10000 whose 
resettlement would be paid for by private organizations 
to take more people wed have to find more money and in the 
current budget situation that would mean robbing peter to pay paul 
doing things like taking money from famine relief in africa nobody 
wants to do that the source said 
administration representatives scheduled to make a formal 
presentation to the subcommittee on friday gave informal briefings

the soviet union could be enveloped in strikes 
that would bring down mikhail gorbachev unless the soviet president 
achieves domestic progress soon boris n yeltsin said monday 
gorbachev has not more than one year and probably about six 
months the soviet deputy told a television interviewer if 
gorbachev fails then were going to have some very difficult 
times and this is something i want to discuss with the american 
administration 
yeltsin 58 a maverick ousted as moscows communist party chief 
in 1987 but then elected to parliament with overwhelming popular 
support in a contested election arrived saturday for a twoweek 
us tour during which he hoped to see president bush 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said at this 
point no decision has been made on whether bush will meet with 
yeltsin 
yeltsin will meet in washington with secretary of state james a 
baker iii on tuesday afternoon to discuss the process of change 
in the soviet union said richard boucher a state department 
spokesman 
the unfolding of this process is something that will be 
determined within the soviet union boucher said we are 
interested observers more than anything else 
yeltsin spoke on abcs good morning america program and 
later made a visit to a temple of capitalism the new york stock 
exchange he also spoke to the council on foreign relations at a 
lunch closed to the press 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
asserted that yeltsins views were his own and not necessarily the 
governments he said deputies visiting the ubited states are all 
unofficial delegations 
if you want the official point of view listen to the foreign 
ministry he said if you want pluralism listen to the 
deputies 
yeltsin in his tv appearance said gorbachev could face 
revolution from below 
he added this has already started in the form of strikes but 
today just occasional strikes hot spots here and there in the 
country a revolution would occur when these hot spots spread and 
the whole country is affected 
early in the interview yeltsin gestured with the middle finger 
of his hand later the interviewer charles gibson explained that 
it had not been what americans might interpret as an obscene gesture 
yeltsin was injured by a hand grenade when he was 11 and 
because he is missing two fingers thats the only way he can 
point said gibson 
at the stock exchange yeltsin chatted for about half an hour 
with the chairman john j phelan jr then got a tour of the 
trading floor 
yeltsins visit was being organized by the esalen institute 
sovietamerican exchange program he is receiving 25000 per 
speech which will pay for the trip and contribute to aids research 
in the soviet union 
at columbia university later monday yeltsin did not discount the 
chances of a second political party gaining power in the soviet 
union in the future 
but our country is not ready he told a audience of about 
700 it has trouble supporting a single party as it is 
he told the group that soviet people should throw off our false 
pride and take a lot from the american experience of running a 
country 
if the soviet union is to solve its economic and social problems 
the politburo needs to be revamped yeltsin said 
we have so many odious and incompetent people in the 
politburo he said all they do is raise questions and never 
answer them they are hanging on to their positions with dear life 
we need to catapult them out like they do with ejection seats but 
the question is who is willing to push the button

norwegians on monday dealt the governing 
labor party its worst election setback since world war ii but prime 
minister gro harlem brundtland indicated she would fight to stay on 
that would force the opposition to try to oust her in a 
noconfidence vote when the new parliament convenes oct 2 
with 997 percent of the ballots counted official results showed 
both labor and its main rival the conservative party losing 
support they won in the 1985 elections 
the results showed labor with 885291 votes received 344 
percent a loss of 64 percent from four years ago the 
conservatives had 565901 votes and 221 percent for an 83 percent 
loss 
major gainers were the rightist progress party with 331944 votes 
for 13 percent which was 92 percent more than in the last 
election and the socialist left with 257579 votes 101 percent 
of the ballots and a 46 percent improvement 
smaller parties showed modest gains or losses 
labor was hurt by record unemployment and widespread discontent 
with public services but remains the largest party in this country 
of 42 million people norway has been under welfare state policies 
for 40 years 
clear weather encouraged a good turnout of the 32 million 
eligible voters 
nonsocialist parties which retained a combined majority said 
they would try to smooth over differences to form a coalition 
bargaining could take weeks 
mrs brundtland has governed with a parliamentary minority for 
the last three years and said the situation was unchanged implying 
she could continue in office 
many disenchanted voters switched loyalties to the socialist 
left which supports labor leaving the socialist bloc with minor 
losses 
the socialist left campaigned on a strong environmental platform 
but it also opposes norways membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
final seat results may not be known until wednesday because of a 
new election system that adds eight posts to the old 157member 
storting or parliament 
norways freespending days came to an abrupt end with the il 
price crash of 1986 when its north sea wealth evaporated 
mrs brundtland said she was concerned over labors losses but 
that it still looks like well have a parliament that isnt bad as 
a whole 
labor was projected to win 64 seats of the 165 seats its 
socialist ally would add 16 the threeparty nonsocialist alliance 
conservatives christian democrats and center party would get 61 
seats the unpredictable rightwing party of progress would have 
20 with small parties and independents getting a total of four 
seats 
the tendency is clearly toward a nonsocialist majority that 
means there will be negotiations for an alternative government 
said wenche frogn sellaeg deputy chairman of the conservatives 
norways second largest party 
the key lies with carl i hagen leader of the party of progress 
an antitax party 
hagen who held the balance between blocs in the previous 
legislature toppled the last nonsocialist government in 1986 over 
a proposed tax increase allowing mrs brundtland to take over with 
a minority cabinet 
the opposition would need to overcome deep divisions on such key 
policies as taxation and farm subsidies to form a coalition 
we have always stretched out our hand to be part of a 
coalition hagen said but the three other parties have rejected 
us 
the progress party has been excluded from alliances because it 
challenges the basic principles of norways social democracy 
the conservatives led by jan p syse would remain second to 
labor 
asked by a reporter if he was going to be next prime minister 
syse drew a laugh from supporters by replying we always work 
toward the highest possible goals 
labor has governed norway for 34 of the past 44 years and 
fashioned a welfare society taxes on income range up to 627 
percent the government runs powerful companies like statoil which 
exploits north sea oil fields 
labors previous worst outcome in a postwar election was in 1973 
when it won 353 percent until 1961 it was a majority party 
mrs brundtland 50 is a ustrained doctor who specialized in 
public health 
economists credit her for fiscal policies and wage restraints 
that halved inflation in two years to 48 percent and turned a 
balance of payments deficit into a surplus but unemployment nearly 
tripled in the same period to 5 percent and companies went bankrupt 
at the fastest rate since world war ii surveys show oslo to be 
europes most expensive capital 
hagen 45 a former marketing executive complained that public 
services were in a shoddy state he proposed allowing private 
services to compete with governmentrun institutions privatizing 
public companies and limiting immigration which he says norway 
cannot afford 
despite her international reputation as a conservationist mrs 
brundtland also was attacked for alleged laxness toward pollution of 
norways fjords

clarence mcclain a former aide to the late mayor 
harold washington was sentenced monday to eight years in prison for 
his conviction on mail fraud and racketeering charges 
us district judge ilana rovner handed down the sentence after 
an unusual hearing in which mcclain took the stand himself and spent 
an hour castigating the prosecution and the news media 
rovner also ordered mcclain to pay 35000 in restitution and 
sentenced him to five years probation 
mcclain who did not take the stand during the trial itself 
accused federal prosecutors of and the media of suppressing video 
and audiotape evidence that he said would have cleared him 
mcclain also said he would call for a congressional investigation 
of his prosecution which was part of the fbis operation incubator 
probe of alleged corruption in city government 
mcclain became so agitated during his speech that ms rovner 
ordered a fiveminute recess so he could calm down throughout his 
appearance he kept handing the judge documents which he said would 
clear his name 
mcclain was accused of accepting bribes from undercover fbi 
informant michael raymond and the president of a new yorkbased 
company in exchange for using his influence to make sure the 
company systematic recovery services got a lucrative city contract 
for retrieving delinquent parking fines 
mcclain was an aide to washington when washington was a state 
representative and a member of the illinois congressional 
delegation but was dismissed by the mayor shortly after his 1983 
election when reports surfaced about mcclains prior criminal 
record which included a conviction for pandering 
mcclain nonetheless reportedly told raymond and others that he 
still had the ear of the mayor and could direct bribes in 
washingtons direction

the beat of western disco music and 
the flashes from multicolored strobe lights reflect uneasily off 
the dim cobblestone streets and decaying turnofthecentury 
buildings of weimar 
hundreds of people join the dance at the communist youth leagues 
meeting hall on a square named after weimars most illustrious son 
johann wolfgang von goethe 
the rest of the city is quiet its peeling apartment blocks dark 
and its uneven streets deserted 
for decades this oncehistoric city has been neglected by east 
german authorities who have diverted most resources into rebuilding 
east berlin from the rubble of nazi germany that attempt to match 
the opulence of western europe and west germany may have succeeded 
but it has left deep resentment in the provinces of the country 
we are a little town and theres not much left over because the 
bigger cities have priority a young east german woman tells a 
western visitor a popular saying in the country is much harsher 
what the war didnt destroy socialism finished off 
the fortunes of this city have swung from one extreme to another 
since it was the center of german cultural life 
throughout the 18th and 19th centuries weimars enlightened 
royal court attracted the brightest talents in art literature 
philosophy and music johann sebastian bach lived in weimar from 
1708 to 1717 as the court organist and conductor 
later germanys other literary giant of the classicial period 
friedrich von schiller joined goethe and other humanist 
philosophers at the elegant saxon and weimar court 
weimar rose to prominence again in 1919 when after the fall of 
the monarchy the national assembly met here to adopt the weimar 
constitution the document was the framework for a democratic 
republic that would last only until 1933 when adolf hitler came to 
power 
now weimar has come again to resemble what an english 
philosopher said of it in the last century weimar wrote gh lewes 
in 1854 is a very queer little place where the streets are so 
dim that theatergoers take a servant with them to carry a 
lantern 
the english traveler could hardly have predicted the bucolic 
regional capitals rapid industrial growth its rise to prominence 
as the namesake of a doomed democratic republic and its slow decline 
during four decades of communist party rule 
like many small cities in east germany weimar has suffered from 
a chronic shortage of building materials and construction labor 
while the nations communist leaders have invested millions in 
modern concrete housing blocks and launched an ambitious building 
and restoration program in east berlin rural and regional capitals 
have withered and decayed 
despite piecemeal renovation efforts the citys landmarks 
including the stunning 18th century residential palace stand 
peeling and chipped their facades blackened by layers of diesel 
exhaust and coal soot 
outside the city center rickety scaffolding stands in front of 
dozens of onceelegant turnofthecentury apartment buildings 
dont let it fool you said an apartment dweller from a dank 
vestibule theyre not remodeling she said the scaffolding went 
up after a woman was struck and killed by a falling chunk of the 
buildings granite facade 
but were still lucky leipzig and dresden are worse 
considering the tremendous destruction wrought during world war 
ii and the enormous reparations east germany paid to the soviets 
great strides have been made in making the nation the most properous 
in the east bloc 
east berlin is a glittering bustling metropolitan center with 
crowded department stores and cafes there is an emerging nightlife 
that is the envy of russian tourists and anyone who has spent the 
night in dresden rostock or weimar 
slowly laborously the east german provinces are catching up 
dresden once known as the valley of the unaware because its 
geography blocked the reception of western television programs has 
since gotten cable tv 
in weimar workers using period plans have begun rebuilding a row 
of houses on market square that were destroyed during the war 
theyre going to have shops and cafes said a clerk at a 
nearby hotel as you can see weimar needs them very badly 
but for the foreseeable future most east germans will continue 
to live in a crumbling dreary world where as goethe once wrote 
from weimar time does not relinquish its rights either over 
human beings or over monuments

as john tuccillo sees it the long term holds 
less and less value in our american economic system money now not 
later is more important even if it might diminish personal or 
business longevity 
look around and see the evidence college coaches suspended for 
trying to buy success elected officials throwing away careers 
wellpaid brokers and some executives jailed for manipulations 
all says tuccillo have this in common they sacrificed a very 
good longterm situation by succumbing to the temptations of the 
moment they had it good but it wasnt good enough they couldnt 
take the time 
in a sense he suggests the values of these folks arent much 
different from those of the drug seller or drug user both of whom 
cannot resist the temptation of now while diminishing the 
chances of a long life span 
tuccillo is a business economist and he insists these are 
economic considerations specifically he is a real estate 
economist and he believes the now mode of thinking can damage 
real estate sales 
in his fears he has plenty of company including president george 
bush and treasury secretary nicholas brady who are examining ways 
to build longterm incentives into the business system the better 
to compete 
while americans are accustomed to hearing of easy money and quick 
results in sports the underworld lotteries corrupt politics and 
entertainment they sometimes fail to realize that it prevails 
elsewhere too 
in business he relates the prominent figures no longer make 
cars or steel or produce petroleum products today ford carnegie 
and rockefeller are donald trump and carl icahn guys who makes 
deals not sedans 
he concedes there are some executives such as chrysler chairman 
lee iacocca who may be viewed as exceptions but he notes 
chrysler makes more of its profit from financing cars than it does 
from making them 
all this he suggests is a product of the incentives systems 
permeating our society and economy reward structures have become 
increasingly shortterm in focus benefiting consumption at the 
expense of building for the future 
government service is no longer viewed as a longterm career 
as it is in japan or europe but a twoyear steppingstone to big 
consulting contracts he says even some business activities that 
appear longterm are more on the order of rearranging the deck 
chairs involving debt and sales of assets 
consumers are no exception says economist tuccillo we want 
what we want when we want it and if achieving that requires 
spending more than we earn so be it 
what has this got to do with real estate well its hurting home 
sales by now everyone has heard that firsttime buyers find it 
difficult to afford a house its hard on them no doubt but 
reason to give up 
based on past experience it isnt in the past families somehow 
managed to buy against what might appear by todays standards to be 
insurmountable odds they would have bided their time worked and 
saved 
today says tuccillo rising house prices combined with a 
disappearing savings discipline persuade young families that its 
more reasonable to spend 250 for a new vcr than to put the money 
toward a down payment 
he suggests that we might see how deeply ingrained this mindset 
has become if interest rates fall he suggests it could trigger 
only a modest rally in residential numbers why the down payment 
was spent on other things 
thats one of the shortterm impacts longer term he says all 
this puts us at a substantial disadvantage relative to our 
industrial rivals the japanese are focused on the longer term and 
building toward it europe too 
to a real extent he concludes we are courting the fate of 
aesops hare who having achieved much got lost in his own 
excellence and eventually lost it all

now that theres a war on politicians who want 
to cut federal programs or change priorities are going to be trying 
to wrap their proposals in the banner of the fight against drugs 
that worked first time out with senate approval of an amendment 
to cut spending for postagefree mailings to constituents the gop 
already was on that case complaining about the steady expansion of 
the free mail franking privilege which works to the advantage of 
incumbents seeking new terms 
the amendment passed the senate easily 839 on thursday but it 
will be a hard sell in negotiations with the house where 
republicans are trying to make incumbency an issue against the 
majority democrats who have dominated the place for 35 years 
republican sen pete wilson of california who is running for 
governor next year sponsored the amendment shifting 45 million 
from free mail to a program for drugaddicted mothers and their 
babies that would leave about 35 million for franked congressional 
mail if the house went along 
the numbers dont make a dent in the 79 billion president bush 
wants spent on the drug war a sum democratic leaders argue is too 
low wilson said it was almost symbolic 
democrats will be back with their own arguments in favor of cuts 
and shifts in administrationproposed spending especially on 
defense contending the money should be used against drugs 
the administration proposes to get additional funds for the drug 
war by shifting 751 million from other programs most of them 
domestic democratic leaders have said the drug crisis could 
increase pressures for a tax increase a step bush rejects i 
dont think we have to think of the war on drugs as a war on the 
taxpayer said drug policy adviser william j bennett i dont 
think anybody thinks that the reason we have a drug problem in this 
country is that taxes are too low 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the cut in free 
mail privileges would send a signal that we are not going to be 
hypocrites on the drug issue 
if the critics want a down payment on the war on drugs vote 
for this amendment he said it is only 45 million but that is 
a start we only need to find 740 million more 
wilsons amendment would eliminate financing for mass 
congressional mailings to constituents senators and representatives 
now can send newsletters and the like to every address in their 
state or district two times a year for senators four times for 
house members theres no limit on the size of each missive 
members of congress still could send free mail addressed by name 
but they couldnt send franked mail addressed to occupant or postal 
patron 
dole said the measure was a way for congress to enlist in the war 
on drugs and do it with a sacrifice these funds will come out of 
our budgets out of our pockets for a change he said dole said 
theres too much congressional junk mail anyhow 
while it was a republican amendment stiffest opposition came 
from sen ted stevens ralaska who argued that a lot of his 
constituents are isolated cant get daily newspapers and get their 
information about washington from his newsletter and others 
but it was a losing argument not only because of the drug war 
but also against the complaints of reformers about congressional 
mass mailing and senate resentment against the house which spends 
a lot more money on them the house had voted 1245 million for 
free mailings in its version of the legislative appropriations bill 
a conference committee will have to negotiate a settlement between 
the two bills it is not likely to settle on a cut nearly as drastic 
as the wilson amendment 
in the house rep john g rowland a republican opponent of the 
b2 stealth bomber said he will propose a bill this week to cancel 
more than 1 billion in appropriations for the costly warplane and 
put that money into the drug war 
that wont be done but it is the kind of cut that will be 
proposed often in the weeks ahead as evidence of a commitment to the 
drug war

editors note kristin baker has toyed with all sorts of 
futures but the one she settled on will go down in the history of 
the united states military academy meet the head of cadets a 
21yearold firmjawed woman of rare capacities 
</TEXT>

the new first captain of the united 
states military academys corps of cadets is an eclectic if not a 
renaissance woman the first female to reach that rank in the 
history of the nations oldest service academy 
i had wanted to be a veterinarian kirstin baker says then 
i wanted to be a doctor and i guess at one point i wanted to be a 
stewardess 
but instead she now oversees the lives of 4400 cadets 90 
percent of them men and heads a staff of 40 she is also a 
crosscountry skier who loves to dance a soccer player with a 
penchant for country and rock music and an army brat who graduated 
from the armys elite air assault school 
now baker a 5foot4inch 112pound senior from burke va 
sports the same badges of rank that have adorned the uniforms of men 
like douglas macarthur and john black jack pershing but baker 
21 is determined to keep her boots firmly on the ground 
i have an office thats adjoined to my room now thats one of 
the benefits i guess so i have two places to study instead of 
one 
she was chosen on the basis of academic excellence athletic 
abilities and military skill demonstrated during the last three 
years 
this summer as baker drilled a crop of new cadets or 
plebes she was notified by brig gen fred gorden the 
academys commandant that shed been picked 
i dont know how i reacted to it baker said i mustve 
reacted kind of funny because he went you did want it didnt 
you 
surrounded by reporters and cameras soon after marching the 
plebes 13 miles from lake frederick baker talked about the military 
with the same ease and frankness that she discusses her love for the 
music of lee greenwood and the cure 
i love to dance she said i tended in high school to 
listen to a lot of punk rock just kind of one of those things i 
still do sometimes 
reactions by cadets to bakers appointment were generally 
supportive if indifferent on some lips was the name mike thorson a 
senior from onalaska wis and a standout defensive back on the 
army football team who apparently was bakers chief rival for the 
job 
there were a couple of guys that were higher than her much 
higher than her academically athletically and probably militarily 
but thats not the only criteria they use said senior bill burke 
of wilmington del 
as for thorson he said we just knew he was up for it because 
of how good he was hes going to be a rhodes scholar and 
everything he wanted to be the brigade commander hes a good 
friend of mine and i think hes a little bit disappointed but hell 
do a good job working for kristin 
junior kara soules of ocala fla said a lot of guys are 
like i cant believe a girl got it shes not qualified and she 
got it just because shes a girl of course theres a lot of guys 
who are going to be upset 
other female cadets couldnt understand why so much attention was 
being paid to bakers historic appointment 
well its just like any other person said junior pam horne 
of san antonio i mean if she works as hard as a guy i dont 
think theres any difference being the fact shes a woman i think 
women are perfectly accepted here i dont think its that big a 
deal shes just the brigade commander for a year

junior lisa buskirk of perry ill agreed theres been a lot 
of company commanders and platoon leaders that are female that 
hasnt been a problem at all its just that brigade commander 
sounds so big 
baker is sensitive to suggestions that her achievement is but 
another step by the academy to try to catch up with the 20th century 
after a long period of resisting change in august 1987 gorden 
became the first black to be named commandant at west point 
its funny because everybody always talks about changing 
traditions at west point baker said you dont change 
tradition you enhance it the tradition at west point is the 
excellence the honor the gray uniforms the things that happen 
because society changes dont change the traditions they simply 
enhance the traditions 
women comprise 10 percent of the cadets at west point which 
academy officials say is proportional to the number of women in the 
us army as a whole 
as captains and colonels map out bakers hectic schedule to make 
time for interviews photo opportunities and television appearances 
the star attraction seems to be wondering what the fuss is all about 
i dont think that your role as a leader is based on sex at 
all leadership is an individual idiosyncrasy said baker a human 
factors engineering psychology major with a 336 grade point 
average because leadership is something that people have and its 
from inside themselves 
baker admits that fate may have played a role in making her 
competitive for the first captain job a rank other women have 
aspired to since they were first allowed to become cadets 13 years 
ago 
last year the academy for the first time in recent memory gave 
the cows or juniors all the sergeant positions which are 
usually reserved for seniors appointed a regimental command 
sergeant major baker performed well and credits the visibility with 
putting her out in front then 
shortly before she would be formally inducted into the long gray 
lineage of first captains that includes william westmoreland 
jonathan wainwright and pete dawkins baker pondered the challenging 
year that lay ahead 
i really havent developed a solid philosophy yet baker 
said id really like to see the corps with a lot of spirit and 
stress that sense of honor and integrity that i think are more the 
leadership qualities that are very important when you graduate from 
the academy 
it was during a family vacation that baker first was impressed by 
the aura of the 187yearold academy overlooking the hudson river 
i came in and saw the uniforms and i saw the rooms and i kind of 
got drawn in by all the tradition that was wrapped up in west 
point she said not a lot of cadets want to admit that 
her family moving from south carolina to virginia when she was a 
senior in high school had a lot to do with her decision baker who 
had been leaning toward attending the university of virginia 
changed her mind after the move because everybody i knew was going 
to the university of virginia so it wasnt as exciting anymore as 
it was when i was in south carolina 
her father is a us army colonel and a 1966 graduate of west 
point but she says that that didnt make her automatically consider 
a military career 
she thinks the opportunity to help her fellow cadets would be the 
most rewarding part of her new job 
its really the cadets that matter to me most she said

editors note southernstyle barbecue in vermont yep 
twentyfive years ago curtis tuff a former migrant worker built a 
brick pit on route 5 just outside putney and began dispensing 
barbecued chicken and ribs from an old school bus that serves as a 
stand around these parts its known as the ninth wonder 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
youd be hardpressed to tell that the symbol 
painted on curtis tuffs brightblue school bus was a map of america 
if it werent for the marker pointing to putney 
the map seems wildly out of scale the marker is the size of 
australia but it isnt not really 
putney population 2188 looms just as large to curtis tuff it 
was here 25 years ago that he rediscovered kindness and decency 
it was here that he settled out of the life of a migrant farmworker 
and made his home and it was here that he found a calling 
dispensing chicken and ribs out a bus window a rustic barbecue 
stand his customers dubbed the ninth wonder of the world 
before that it hadnt been a very nice life says curtis 
51 i never had the opportunity to know my father my mother was 
killed in a car wreck when i was 15 or 16 my oldest brother in 
tampa fla took care of me until i got big enough to go out on my 
own 
but the world had little to offer a teenager with a ninthgrade 
education so he says i followed the season that way there was 
enough work to last all year 
in 1961 a putney apple orchard became the last stop on his 
annual migration from the citrus groves of florida to the peach 
trees of north carolina the potato fields of virginia and the 
cherry orchards of new york 
at 23 curtis already had an old mans knowledge of how hard life 
can be as a migrant worker you dont get what you should be 
paid and you get treated bad 
ive been there and lived through it its awful to see you 
cant stop cause you dont ever make enough to settle down 
putney was different at green mountain orchard they always 
treated the men nice the people in town were nice too 
the kindness of the people and the decency of his bosses were 
revelations that accompanied curtis over the next few years the 
white clapboard houses and rolling hills of putney would come to him 
as he dug potatoes picking peaches hed find himself daydreaming 
about apples 
eventually rather than follow the season curtis tuff followed 
his heart green mountain orchard got a new fulltime employee and 
a perennial wanderer got a home 
putney got something too the best barbecue north of 
georgia says joe delio of east swanzey nh whos been known to 
belly up to the bus twice in a day 
its a 60mile round trip between curtis barbecue and delios 
driveway childs play to delio a drug and alcoholabuse counselor 
whose hunger for authentic barbecue has taken him as far as texas 
before curtis came to vermont barbecue had been nothing more 
than a vague memory of a happier time id been to one barbecue in 
my life as a kid a man in georgia cooked hams on a grill he cooked 
them over a wood fire and i watched him do it course i also 
watched his daughter which is why i was there 
oddly enough he found the hams more compelling i said hows 
he gonna get those done he said you just watch it took six 
hours but that ham had a really good taste to it 
i was 12 years old and i never forgot it 
years later still haunted by the taste he built a brick pit 
forked over 150 for a license and began cooking chickens beside 
route 5 just off the interstate 91 exit for putney 
from his post by the pit hes in the perfect position to catch an 
oftheard refrain barbecue in vermont 
thats why its called the ninth wonder he says 
curtis tuffs reputation grew along with his operation 
over the years the pit and a tin shack have been joined by 
picnic tables 23 at last count the school bus a badminton net 
an outdoor sink a portable toilet and a fencedin playground with a 
swing set sandbox and toys 
this years improvements a border of marigolds impatiens 
gladioluses and pansies and a second school bus painted the same 
signature blue and equipped with freezers stocked with ice cream 
business cards postcards and tshirts are also available 
eventually curtis left the orchard to devote himself to what 
passes for fulltime barbecuing in southern vermont april to 
november thursday to sunday snow sleet hail rain or shine 
in the clearing behind rods car care center where the smoke is 
thickest is where youll find curtis presiding over the fearsome 
assemblage that replaced the brick pit sheltered by a tin roof and 
mounted on an old hay wagon its fashioned from two 375gallon oil 
drums turned on their sides tops sawn off and bellies blazing with 
chunks of seasoned hardwood

editors note theres a new oasis in central washington state 
and it is copying its future after the california wine country to 
the south its a new tourist draw and washingtonians are putting 
out the welcome mat with a little homebrewed romance 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
romantic dinner trains rumble through 
canyons famous musicians perform along the columbia river and 
bedandbreakfast inns seem as ubiquitous as apple trees 
its a long way from californias napa valley but central 
washingtons wine country is slowly developing into a tourist 
attraction 
as many as 300000 people a year visit state wineries where an 
array of facilities and activities are being developed to 
accommodate them 
the wineries have drawn an awful lot of people here says 
gary hogue president of the hogue cellars winery near prosser 
therefore the need for goods and services follow 
still theres no mistaking the area for napa north even though 
washington trails only california and new york in wine production 
the napa valley has more than 250 wineries crowded into a 30mile 
long area with attractions and services for more than 25 million 
visitors a year 
central washington by contrast has about 35 wineries scattered 
across 180 miles from wenatchee to walla walla many in small towns 
lacking sophisticated amenities 
look at napa 15 years ago and it was similar to what we have 
now says randy tucker director of tucker cellars in sunnyside 
there were no motels no restaurants no bedandbreakfasts 
i think the wine industry has laid the groundwork for bringing 
people in in large numbers 
already there are signs of change 
the champs de brionne winery outside george wash for several 
years has booked bigname musical performers such as bob dylan rod 
stewart and the judds at its natural amphitheater above the columbia 
river they draw up to 17000 people to a town with a population of 
just 260 the winerys products are the only liquor that can be 
brought into the shows 
recently washington central railroad co began operating dinner 
trains that include winery stops 
the friday dinner and sunday brunch train departs yakima for the 
college town of ellensburg where riders spend a halfhour at the 
cascade crest estates winery in the converted railroad depot as the 
engine is turned around 
on saturday night the dinner train runs from kennewick to 
prosser stopping at the hogue cellars the threehour rides cost 
45 a person 
i think its good for the wineries and good for the 
passengers says brig temple manager of the dinner trains for the 
railroad some outoftown passengers get a chance to taste the 
local flavors it adds to the trip 
another sign of tourisms impact is tucker cellars decision to 
build a tasting room in yakima in addition to its winery tasting 
room 40 miles south in sunnyside the downtown yakima facility is 
designed to draw some of the convention visitors to central 
washingtons largest city tucker says 
they dont have time to go through the valley he says 
washington has more than 70 wineries with about half clustered 
in the fruitgrowing central region the rest are scattered in 
western washington with a handful in the spokane area 
studying reports from 33 wineries across the state from may to 
september of 1987 a washington state university survey found that 
visitors ranged from 12 a month at one remote winery to 5500 a 
month at the busiest one 
the average age of the visitors was 40 years old and the 
average income was estimated at 40000 per year folwell says 
adding most of the visitors lived in washington 
largescale wine production is only about a decade old in 
washington and gail thompson of the state department of tourism 
says promotion of the wineries to outofstate visitors is still in 
its infancy 
we havent been in the business of promoting visitors for years 
and years like the california wine country ms thompson says 
noting that one problem was inadequate maps on winery brochures to 
direct visitors to some of the most remote locations 
but everywhere there seems to be an awakening 
wil masset owner of yakimas birchfield manor recently opened a 
fiveroom inn above his gourmet restaurant 
there were six wineries in the state when we came masset 
says now there are really super deluxe facilities a few miles 
from here 
another inn opened recently in sunnyside three have opened in 
prosser in the past year along with a 30unit motel 
festivals provide the busiest weekends for the wineries 
including the spring barrel tasting when thousands of visitors 
sample newly made wines right from the barrel 
tucker says 3500 people visited his winery over that weekend 
but for all the activity winery owners are aware that central 
washington will never rival the napa valley located near san 
francisco primarily because the population density is just not 
there hogue says 
as lively as the tourist business is the wineries rely on sales 
to retail stores for volume only 13 percent of total production is 
sold by the tasting rooms just about two bottles to the customer

editors note its a tiny town thinking about selfdestructing 
because it cant take care of itself anymore with its population 
aging and shrinking jacksonville pa simply cant raise the money 
to do the things the state government says it must do one solution 
would be to link up with a neighboring township but that might be 
easier said than done 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
tired old jacksonville is running out of 
coal youth taxes and time 
hanging on with only about 60 residents caught between 
decreasing tax revenues and increasing state pressure to install 
sewers the borough council has begun talk about disbanding and 
casting jacksonvilles nearly squaremile of territory to the mercy 
of neighboring townships 
if we go another five or 10 years no one is going to be here 
anymore says councilman stanley gryczuk 77 a retired miner and 
butcher 
the old ones are dying off and the young ones leave us says 
councilwoman mary grimm 81 a retired cook 
jacksonville about 50 miles east of pittsburgh was never as big 
as nearby saltsburg but plentiful coal and hard work kept it on the 
map its young folks close and its future hopeful 
with neat frame houses scattered along a hillside it boasted as 
many as 150 residents in the 1930s mostly coal miners and their 
families and even a bank barber butcher blacksmith and railroad 
station 
it was the quietest nicest town youd ever want to see says 
jacob grimm 84 mary grimms husband a retired miner and himself a 
councilman for oh about 30 years 
council members say there are fewer people willing or able to 
govern 
mayor tom salva in his 60s has been too ill to attend a council 
meeting in two years 
we dont expect him to come to the meetings we bring things to 
him mrs grimm says in the last election we were trying to 
get someone new to be the mayor but no one would run so we just 
wrote tom in 
the average age of the council members including the grimms and 
gryczuk is 715 years without counting young frank stango 
stango 21 a business major at nearby indiana university of 
pennsylvania was recruited for the council several years ago by his 
mother councilwoman josephine stango 56 a parttime postal worker 
councilman adam gordish a retired coal miner is 75 years old 
his soninlaw robert yatzkanic 56 is also a councilman delores 
yatzkanic gordishs daughter and yatzkanics wife is borough 
secretary 
most everyone is a democrat mrs grimm says there are six 
republicans and she can give directions to each of their houses 
townsfolk say yatzkanic an xray technician at a nearby 
westinghouse electric corp plant is one of the halfdozen or so 
people in jacksonville still working 
everybodys retired mrs grimm says we have more widows 
in town than anyone else the young people grow up go to school and 
then they leave 
the council also expects young stango to leave town one of these 
days it recently won permission from a common pleas court judge to 
allow it to eventually reduce its numbers from seven to five members 
jacksonvilles as big as its going to get stango says with 
a shrug unless something comes this way i dont see any reason 
for anyone to move in 
the borough has no property no municipal building and no 
equipment of its own the council pays 10 to meet once a month in a 
classroom at the united presbyterian church about halfway up mill 
street 
mrs yatzkanic estimated the boroughs annual budget at about 
19000 mostly to keep water in a few fire hydrants street lights 
illuminated and mill street and a few side roads repaired and 
plowed 
we didnt have to name our side streets until we got ambulance 
service mrs grimm says 
the borough pays a man with a pickup truck 45 to plow and sand 
the streets whenever it snows 
council members were shocked when a state agency said 
jacksonville must contribute 700 a year for unemployment insurance 
for the trucker and the boroughs parttime solicitor 
they are angry that state or indiana county officials often 
charge the borough the same standard governmental fees paid by 
larger communities such as indiana the county seat of about 16000 
people 
most public tasks such as patching a municipal road are too 
small for local contractors to bother with gryczuk says bigger 
projects would jolt the municipal budget and the taxpayers 
we have to wait three or four years to accumulate enough money 
to get a road fixed gryczuk says 
council members also are worried about a potential financial 
knockout a longstanding demand by the state department of 
environmental resources that jacksonville install a sewer system to 
replace septic tanks 
mrs stango says the lastest estimates put the cost for sewers at 
about 40 per month for each homeowner mostly for interest on the 
capital expenditure 
mrs stango says the borough doesnt have the money for 
engineering studies for the sewer project mrs grimm says most 
residents cant afford sewers anyway 
at the golden pheasant tavern on the twolane state highway 
owner eddie sklar himself a former councilman worried that new 
talk of disbanding the municipality may cost him his liquor license 
eventually 
this is my livelihood he says i dont want to lose it 
sklar suggested the borough can save money by asking homeowners 
to pay for the street lights near their homes and by asking 
neighboring townships to run their plows down mill street 
occasionally 
he says council members should have installed sewers years ago 
when costs would have been less 
sklar was instrumental in getting an oil driller to sink the 
communitys water well just outsde the borough line for free 
but he concedes that running a little town is difficult when he 
was a councilman more than a decade ago for example he recalls 
that the borough received 180 in revenue sharing money but had to 
spend 144 on a required newspaper advertisement to describe 
publicly how the money would be spent 
nobody wants the responsibility no one wants to do anything 
sklar says but i dont see what theyre going to gain going to a 
township 
mrs stango says officials are reluctant to break up the borough 
which was founded in 1853 and named after president andrew jackson 
we would never disband if it would hurt anybody she says 
still with an eye on lowering taxes and benefiting from ample 
road equipment in neighboring municipalities council members say 
they are considering overtures to officials of adjacent black lick 
and young townships 
but who would take us mrs grimm says we dont know

in a place where world war ii 
ended late the soviet union has finally started letting foreigners 
in to see the red flag flying over the kuril islands 
the kurils which arc from northern japan to the soviet 
mainlands kamchatka peninsula were held by japan from 1875 to 1945 
and in the early postwar years became one of the spawning grounds of 
the cold war 
in august 1945 soviet troops advanced across the kurils for more 
than two weeks after japan had surrendered to the allies 
heightening suspicions in washington about soviet designs on japan 
and starting a territorial dispute with tokyo that still blocks a 
world war ii peace treaty between japan and the soviet union 
but now a warmer wind is blowing from moscow and militarily 
important regions in the soviet far east are being opened to foreign 
eyes as never before because of president mikhail s gorbachevs 
policies of glasnost and perestroika openness and reconstruction 
through local initiative and a hunger for foreign investment 
foreign expertise and foreign contact 
the kurils although japan still holds claim to them may have a 
role in those kremlin plans for far east development at least for 
foreign tourism 
now we live in such an interesting period when foreigners are 
not afraid of russians and russians are not afraid of foreigners 
said a soviet teacher here in yuzhno kurilsk the main town on foggy 
kunashir island a former japanese island just 10 miles across a 
strait from northern japan 
moscowbased western reporters visited vladivostok the 
headquarters of the soviet pacific fleet last fall for the first 
time 
recently a group of about 40 tokyobased us and european 
journalists and japanese photographers plus a few business people 
were allowed to tour khabarovsk on the soviet mainland and kunashir 
in the kurils and sakhalin a long narrow island just off the 
soviet mainland and about 50 miles from japans hokkaido island 
the soviets would talk about anything but military details four 
of the visiting journalists were briefly detained when they neared 
the sokol air base on sakhalin 
soviet fighter planes took off from sakhalin to shoot down the 
south korean airliner kal 007 with the loss of 269 lives six years 
ago on a flight from the united states to seoul 
there would have been less noise about this plane if the 
government had described everything about this tragedy said 
valery belyaev chairman of local radio and television on sakhalin 
authorities in moscow he added had tried to explain away the 
tragedy by saying the jumbo jet was a spy plane or carried no 
passengers 
many soviet people today think the plane was empty but we 
know that almost 270 people did not return home belyaev said 
the shootingdown of the airliner was one of many tension peaks 
in asia in the past 10 years for which blame was laid on moscow 
including the soviet intervention in afghanistan and the vietnamese 
invasion of cambodia 
now under gorbachev the soviets have withdrawn from afghanistan 
and the sovietbacked vietnamese are to leave cambodia by sept 26 
moscow also has patched up relations with china and in trying to 
join the economic boom on the asian rim of the pacific has invited 
foreign investment into the soviet far east including the kurils 
so far however the soviets have done little more than realize 
how big the economic problems are 
the far east region from vladivostok in the south to the arctic 
north covers more than a quarter of the immense soviet land mass 
but has only 79 million inhabitants yet its mineral and forest 
resources are huge and the fisheries are among the worlds richest 
sakhalin a vast and miserable prison camp in czarist times has 
important oil deposits and coal mines 
the regions people however live in cramped apartments in 
shabby buildings as in most of the soviet union 
despite sakhalins energy resources the tourist hotel in the 
regional capital yuzhno sakhalinsk had no hot water the use of 
electricity is low the ferry terminal in the port of holmsk had no 
outdoor lighting at night several sidewalks and streets had open 
manholes 
officials and ordinary citizens alike complained about the sparse 
supplies of fish in the shops despite the teeming seas and 
salmonchoked rivers the manager of a cannery in sakhalin said he 
had problems sometimes with shortages of cans 
how did it get like this 
we are to blame said pavel minakir deputy director of the 
institute for economic researches of the far eastern branch of the 
soviet academy of sciences for a long time we developed 
separately from the world market 
the resulting list of problems is long he said poor technology 
inefficiency low investment in infrastructure the ruble currencys 
lack of convertibility into hard currency 
the chinese proved themselves better businessmen than the soviets 
in barter trade which minakir said had to be curtailed because 
exports of construction materials caused shortages in the soviet far 
while japan does not seek the return of southern sakhalin it 
insists that moscow return the other islands 
while talks on the dispute take place regularly the soviets are 
unlikely to give up territory to japan when other soviet regions are 
agitating for independence 
the soviets pointedly brought the journalists to yuzhno kurilsk 
on kunashir to observe a rainswept ceremony sept 3 marking the 44th 
anniversary of the capture of the island 
an honor guard fired a 21round salute a brass band played 
marches a crowd of about 200 townspeople watched and a few 
bemedaled veterans of the last fighting in the northern pacific 
stood proudly before a monument extolling the soviet soldiers who 
died to return the southern kurils to the motherland

because she lives in one of the 
most remote places in the soviet union galya chinchikova makes 
about triple the national average wage but it doesnt translate 
into a life of luxury 
we have plenty of money but we have nothing said the 
34yearold communist party worker in yuzhno kurilsk a fishing town 
of 7000 people on kunashir southernmost of the disputed kuril 
islands 
the lack of comfort didnt make mrs chinchikova any less loyal 
however its simply the way pioneering life is on the cold and 
rainy island where the sun shines only 50 or 60 days a year 
her husband vassily chinchikov 37 is an exuberant artist whose 
seascape murals decorate the walls of the town canteen he sells 
paintings to supplement his wifes 600ruble 925 monthly income 
the couple both born on kunashir invited a foreign visitor to 
stay the night in their warm and brightly furnished but tiny 
apartment they slept behind a curtain in an alcove off the living 
room their 7yearold son andrei had a bunk bed over a workshop 
table in a small room off the kitchen the plumbing was primitive 
but it was indoors 
the family is among the betterhoused on the island 
the poorer housing is low tarpapercovered wooden huts whose 
residents draw water from wells or standpipes outdoor privy toilets 
are common few streets are paved in the hilly town 
chinchikov said he loved the wildness of the volcanic island 
which has such abundant nature that visitors may be served bear stew 
and homesmoked salmon 
but as an artist he said the main problem is the lack of 
contact with the rest of the world 
that may change now that the soviet government wants foreign 
tourists to come to the formerly offlimits region 
living standards will change by the end of the century 
vyacheslav gudakov deputy chairman of the town government said as 
he conducted a tour featuring an almostcompleted new hospital 
streets will be paved he said and comfortable apartments will 
be built as well as a new school culture center and department 
store 
the rich fishery of kunashir and nearby shikotan island earns 70 
million rubles 108 million a year for the central government 
while moscow sends back only half that money gudakov said 
now we have a very funny system the soviet interpreter 
interjected wryly 
gudakov said new regulations soon will let the local government 
decide how to use most of its revenues 
asked if moscow had neglected the island outpost 5000 miles from 
the capital gudakov replied it was the same in all the country

here are some milestones in the changing ownership of sakhalin 
and the kuril islands 
early history sakhalin was probably first explored by the 
chinese russian and japanese explorers and traders reached sakhalin 
in the 17th century by 1739 russians had plotted the kurils coming 
into conflict with japanese who traded and fished in the islands 
then peopled by the ainu the aboriginal people of northern japan 
1855 in the first diplomatic agreement between russia and 
japan the two agreed to jointly settle sakhalin and japan was 
given ownership of the kuril islands just north of hokkaido 
iturup kunashir shikotan and the habomai group czarist russia got 
title to the rest of the kurils 
1875 russia ceded all the kurils to japan in exchange for 
ownership of sakhalin 
1905 after japans victory in the russojapanese war a treaty 
gave japan the southern part of sakhalin up to the 50th parallel 
japan later imported up to 80000 forced laborers from korea then a 
japanese colony they and their descendants are a sizable minority 
today on sakhalin which is called karafuto in japanese 
1945 the soviet union declared war aug 8 two days after the 
first us atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima and soviet troops 
swept into southern sakhalin and through the kurils several hundred 
thousand japanese civilians later were evacuated to japan 
1956 in negotiations establishing diplomatic relations the 
soviets offered to return shikotan and the habomai group to japan 
after the conclusion of a world war ii peace treaty between the two 
countries moscow later withdrew the offer on grounds that the 
united states has military bases in japan aimed at the soviet union 
1989 negotiations on a peace treaty remain stuck over moscows 
rejection of japans demand for a return of the southern kurils 
japan does not claim southern sakhalin but does not recognize 
soviet ownership

after a traumatic decade of defeats in battle with 
margaret thatcher british labor unions are flexing their muscles 
again 
in some ways this summers spate of strikes has been reminiscent 
of the years before mrs thatcher was elected prime minister in may 
1979 on a wave of antiunion sentiment 
but in crucial other ways they reflect a recognition that the 
old days of militancy and unbridled power which was partly to blame 
for infecting the economy with the socalled british disease 
are over 
strikes this summer in public transportation city halls and the 
british broadcasting corp ended with employers surrendering on all 
fronts yielding near doubledigit pay raises and abandoning demands 
for higher productivity and new bargaining procedures 
but dockworkers striking to preserve a 42yearold system of job 
guarantees were soundly defeated 
the longshoremen were the last of the oncemighty bluecollar 
battalions of organized labor to be vanquished by a conservative 
government that had already emasculated the steel coalmining and 
newspaperproduction unions 
the public could see a case for giving railwaymen and town hall 
clerks pay increases that overtake resurging inflation but it would 
not buy the longshoremens attempt to preserve what it saw as a 
relic of union featherbedding 
the unions have learned to play by the thatcher rules among the 
toughest in any western democracy and even to turn them to 
advantage 
its been a very difficult 10 years for the trade union 
movement but it hasnt been deadly said norman willis general 
secretary of the trades union congress the national labor 
federation anyone who thought the unions could be written off was 
wrong 
laws passed since 1980 ban sympathy walkouts and force unions to 
hold secret ballots by members before calling strikes unions that 
call illegal strikes can be bankrupted by fines for contempt of 
court and lawsuits by employers for strikeinflicted losses 
the rail unions won public sympathy partly because their leaders 
followed the rules and could not be accused of foisting their wishes 
on the rankandfile 
unions have learned to live within the law said the tucs 
willis 
public opinion polls indicate that for the first time in 25 
years most britons no longer consider the unions too powerful 
soundings in september by gallup and by market opinion and 
research international also found majorities sympathizing with this 
summers wage strikes despite the commuter misery and blaming the 
government not the unions for economic problems 
fiftyfour percent still think the unions are dominated by 
extremists and militants the poll showed but overall the 
change is profound 
no longer disliked because they are no longer feared the unions 
have faded as an issue and the unionbashing that helped mrs 
thatcher to three successive election victories no longer looks 
like a votepuller now that the unions are being seen as underdogs 
none of this means that the unions are on the offensive 
cautions martin jacques editor of the monthly marxism today what 
is does mean is that the unions have got their heads above the 
parapet again and for thatcherism they no longer represent easy 
political pickings 
the victorious summer strikes have encouraged others like 
ambulance drivers who are citing the railwaymens increase in an 
attempt to justify their demands for a raise above the 83 percent 
inflation rate 
with pay settlements averaging 95 percent fears have arisen 
that britain is headed back into the inflationary spiral of the 
1970s 
both in numbers and political clout the unions have taken a long 
fall from their 1970s heyday when striking miners helped topple 
prime minister edward heaths conservative government and when labor 
governments consulted union bosses almost as regularly as cabinet 
ministers 
the membership of the trades union congress has slumped from 122 
million to 87 million the lowest in 20 years in 1979 295 
million work days were lost through strikes last year the total 
was 37 million 
a record 13 percent unemployment rate in the mid1980s also 
dampened union militancy and with the 1985 collapse of a yearlong 
strike by the marxistled national union of mineworkers which 
directly challenged the conservative government the thatcher 
victory seemed complete 
but while most analysts agree that things will never be the same 
the unions are emerging from the 1980s in fair shape after some 
painful adaptations

you have to stop and think then run dont walk to your nearest 
video store and pick up the naked gun from the files of police 
squad 
be prepared for a zany sidesplitting collection of gags some 
of them offcolor and most of them outrageous and get ready to give 
your laugh muscles a workout 
naked gun is the product of those masters of hilarity david 
zucker jim abrahams and jerry zucker who gave us the memorable 
airplane and the notsomemorable top secret 
this time theyre parodying one of their own failures the 
shortlived tv series police squad which is currently being 
shown on cabletv

the police world lt frank drebin who smashes police cars into 
trash cans gets his hand stuck in a fish tank and falls over his

lean on me warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated pg13 
 
anyone who has ever met joe clark the principal of eastside high 
school in paterson nj knows that he would never allow a film 
crew into his school unless for the greater glory of joe clark this 
is after all the same joe clark who in 1987 virtually barred a 
state monitoring team from inspecting his building 
so its hardly a surprise that lean on me a movie shot on 
location at eastside and purporting to be based on the true 
story of the tough principal turns out to be little more than 
blackboard jungle propaganda aimed at vindicating clarks 
batandbullhorn educational methods 
the video is from warner bros which also made the vastly 
superior stand and deliver a film with twice the plot and a 
hundred times more character development stand and deliver was 
about a high school math teacher in a los angeles barrio school who 
proved that inner city kids respond to the same kinds of positive 
things that rich kids do adults who really care 
clark by contrast captured headlines in recent years as the 
principal who restored order to an innercity school described by 
local prosecutors as a cauldron of violence 
he prowled the hallways with a baseball bat and bullhorn 
suspended hundreds of students and made it clear to all that the 
sign in his office one way my way applied to teachers and 
students alike 
lean on me starring academy award nominee morgan freeman 
paints clark as a principal who bleeds for his kids but will stop 
at nothing including breaking labor and fire laws cursing out his 
superiors and humiliating teachers to achieve his aims 
it opens with a brief shot of eastside high in more idyllic days 
in 1967 the school was mostly white boys wore ties clark then a 
young teacher wore a dashiki 
twenty years later we see a very different eastside with 
graffiti covering anything standing still long enough to be 
spraypainted girls openly molested drugs freely dispensed fights 
commonplace 
into the breach steps clark his challenge brush aside the 
smallminded politicians and school board restore order and raise 
standardized test scores quickly enough to avoid a state takeover of 
the school 
hey no sweat 
freeman turns in a credible performance as clark nicely 
capturing clarks selfrighteousness the script by michael schiffer 
doesnt leave much room for character development clark himself had 
this to say of freeman hes a good actor but i dont think 
anybody can fully portray me theres only one joe clark

cosmic thing reprise the b52s 
 
ten years after crashing the worlds party with the zany rock 
lobster the b52s remain intact as improbably enough a hardy 
band of survivors 
this band of georgian bohemians transplanted to new york survived 
the death of instrumentalist ricky wilson and have emerged with 
cosmic thing this years comeback lp 
cosmic thing is an amiable collection of danceable rock tunes 
anchored as usual by fred schneiders deadpan vocals and the more 
accomplished singing of cindy wilson and kate pierson 
at their best the b52s sound like theyre inviting listeners to 
a real cool private party where everyones a friend deadbeat 
club and love shack two of this records strongest cuts 
beckon fans to outoftheway places with great jukeboxes and 
25cent beers 
even the b52s politics are toetapping the slyly titled 
bushfire condemns the burning of south american rain forests 
the mood is far better than on 1986s downbeat bouncing off the 
satellites which featured the band soldiering through songs 
wilson left halffinished before his death blessedly producers 
nile rodgers and don was employ live drummers avoiding the drum 
machines that made past songs sound like nervous breakdowns 
and yet like so many records these days it all seems like a 
triumph of form over substance some of these party tunes have all 
the bite of dayold champagne what does a onejoke band do when the 
laughter dies down and the record contract remains 
the answer of course is repeat the joke and hope someone who 
wasnt around the first time is listening

maria mckee geffen maria mckee 
 
in an effective solo debut singer maria mckee draws a picture of 
romantic longing and world weariness surprising for a woman of only 
24 years 
the former leader of the nowdissolved country rockers lone 
justice mckee packs a huge voice into a small body that voice is 
the centerpiece of a melancholic album that comes closer to 
realizing mckees talents than either of lone justices two records 
the trio of opening songs ive forgotten what it was in you 
that put the need in me to miss someone and am i the only 
one who ever felt this way dutifully record romantic longing 
without lapsing into comic selfpity 
mckee displays her singing power with the rocker cant pull the 
wool down over the little lambs eyes and the gospel song more 
than a heart can hold 
though mckee is backed by several studio pros better known than 
she producer mitchell froom wisely lets her voice carry the show 
the backing is supportive and largely anonymous with the exception 
of some twisted guitar work by marc ribot 
the sour notes seem the result of caring too much rather than 
too little panic beach a tale of aging vaudevillians playing 
out the string is both overwrought and overwritten and the dying 
swan pirouettes and fawns by the light of the street lamp moon 
mckees voice is overly mannered on the richard thompson cover 
has he got a friend for me 
mckee also sets some sort of record for longest song titles of 
the year with annoying parentheticals too 
one consumer note this records best song cant be found on the 
lp the cdonly cut drinkin in my sunday dress is an inspired 
piece of lunacy where a bawdy mckee is lectured by her preacher 
just remember whos beside you when its no business of mine 
this song plus the cdaccentuated spaces of silence froom builds 
around mckees voice makes the compact disc the best bet for those 
who have a choice

shirley valentine has her moment of blossoming in 
the new film with that title and pauline collins had hers at 
montreals 13th annual world film festival 
of the 250 movies from 52 countries shown at the 10day festival 
paramounts shirley valentine was chosen for the premiere at the 
theatre maisonneuve of the place des arts 
at the reception afterward collins was the center of attention 
a new experience for the pert roundfaced mother of four making 
her film debut in the new movie 
it was very traumatic to see the film for the first time the 
english actress observed in an interview after the screening 
i tried to detach myself and sit back and enjoy the film i 
tried to pretend it was somebody else up there and not me maybe 
because its 3 oclock in the morning for me right now i can feel 
that way she had flown from london that morning 
what is curious is to come to the film having done the play 
recently i only finished on broadway eight weeks ago some things 
have changed and sometimes my ear would say oh thats different 
but i really enjoyed it especially the greek part all that 
beautiful water 
collins performed shirley valentine four months in london 
winning the olivier award for best actress in a new play in new 
york she was awarded the tony in the play written by willy russell 
who provided julie waters with a starmaking role in educating 
rita 
when i first read the play i thought it was a very long 
speech she recalled then i discovered that it was all one 
speech nobody told me i would be on stage alone for the whole 
play 
shirley valentinebradshaw is a middleage english housewife with 
a distant husband and two grown spoiled children out of boredom 
she talks to the wall in the kitchen where she prepares meals 
between sips of wine her life changes when a woman friend invites 
her to share a contest prize a trip to the greek islands there she 
meets a cafe owner costas who changes her life 
in the play collins created shirley as well as 29 other 
characters the movie adapted by russell and directed by lewis 
gilbert alfie educating rita supplies other actors 
including tom conti as a kind of laidback zorba 
tom and i did a play together romantic comedy collins 
remarked and were neighbors our daughters go to the same 
school tom and i work very easily together first of all we trust 
each other a lot and we laugh a lot 
in the film shirley and costas take a boat cruise and skinnydip 
in a secluded cove collins declined an offer by director gilbert to 
use a body double 
its not a big deal in europe nudity she explained most 
people are nude or seminude on the beaches people dont wear tops 
there anymore my only qualms were that i wished i was younger and 
thinner giggle but i aint 
nonetheless she is attractive at 49 with mischievous eyes and 
apple cheeks she was born near liverpool of a family of irish poets 
and teachers she initially decided to be a teacher then shifted to 
acting 
i started out at the theater royal windsor which is where the 
royal family have their country seat she said ive done 1516 
plays in the west end and lots of television series many of them 
with my husband john alderton american viewers know him from 
upstairs downstairs he was the chauffeur and i was the 
downstairs maid 
i didnt start early as an actress i was 22 when i began most 
of the peaks in my a career have been rather late upstairs 
downstairs came when i was 30 until that year i hadnt earned much 
money that year i earned 1200 pounds so i was in the money at 
30 
collins admitted that she wasnt the first choice for the film 
version of shirley valentine 
several american actresses were considered by paramount because 
i have no track record nobody knew me from adam or eve she 
said about five paramount people flew to london to see me in the 
play and they began to think they might have me in the film and 
arent i lucky 
lucky enough to be predicted for an academy award nomination as 
some reviewers of shirley valentine have suggested 
ive heard that and its very breathtaking she said 
especially for someone who has just embarked on a film career 
already she has received offers for american roles but she 
doesnt think shes right for them shirley valentine is a tough 
act to follow she commented adding with a giggle maybe i 
should retire

an elderly woman tugs on her 
husbands arm outside a house in this worldrenowned artists haven 
and says do you think anyone famous lives there 
welcome to worpswede where mobs of tourists roam quaint little 
streets hoping for a glimpse of bigname artists while their elusive 
quarry hole up inside studios guarding their solitude 
worpswede home to about 150 painters sculptors poets and 
other sorts who live by their creative talents is celebrating its 
100th year as a yearround artists colony 
artists and affluent commuters live in the little town about 16 
miles north of bremen with its quaint old stone homes and 
treelined streets a number of lesserknown artists and craftsmen 
from glassblowers to weavers to painters operate their own 
galleries and some give lessons to supplement their incomes 
placid canals that were once used by area traders flow through 
the moorland fields outside the village limits 
the anniversary has already drawn about a quarter of a million 
people and armies of reporters and television crews who have 
overrun this northern village of 8000 
there are some who come here who know the history of worpswede 
and why its important to art says village manager guenther 
wellbrock but there are many expecting to find a theme park or 
they just think its a nice place to drink coffee 
worpswede has sheltered some of germanys bestknown artists 
from turnofthecentury painter paula modersohnbecker to 
modernday sculptor waldemar otto whose works are known around the 
world famed poet rainer maria rilke also spent much time here 
it boasts 15 art galleries art lessons for amateurs pricey 
boutiques cafes souvenir shops hawking everything from incense to 
neckties and an astrologer who also gives vacation tips the town 
also has openair cafes several small hotels and of course art 
supply stores 
on worpswedes 100th birthday german news media have described 
it as a place where art and tackiness meet 
wellbrock says many tourists expect a close encounter with 
artistic geniuses there is this naive idea that anyone can go see 
how the artists work but these artists dont see themselves as 
being like their works as exhibition objects 
otto who has had major exhibitions in new york and other us 
cities says he does not feel threatened by intrusive tourists 
his house concealed by thick bushes is on a hill overlooking 
worpswede center there is nothing to indicate that its the home of 
a famous artist 
worpswede is such a good place to work because it still has a 
lot of its smalltown qualities said otto standing amid a sea of 
sculpted human figures in his studio 
his studio has a cathedral ceiling gleaming white walls and is 
as large in area as his house to which it is attached many 
unfinished sculptures of human figures and heads sit atop work 
benches and his tools are strewn around the room a lifesize 
plaster figure dangled from a blockandtackle connected to the 
ceiling 
he is known for works that portray humans trapped by anonymity or 
pressures in modernday life just outside his studio is a lifesize 
bronze sculpture of a scrawny faceless man desperately trying to 
squeeze his way past two enormous walls 
otto says he has a special fondness for the natives artists 
have been here for 100 years the residents are used to being around 
crazy people 
but artist verena vernunft who now lives in hamburg has harsh 
words for her former home i dont like tourist places and 
worpswede has tourists on every corner she said 
a number of artists are in worpswede on stipends from private 
organizations such as the barkenhoff foundation which chooses 
promising young painters sculptors and others and provides them 
with room and board for a sixmonth stay many work and reside at 
the barkenhoff heinrich vogelers majestic former residence and 
studio vogeler one of germanys bestknown art nouveau 
practicioners went to worpswede in 1893 and moved into the palatial 
residence called the barkenhoff 
more than half the artists including otto have permanent 
residences in worpswede 
some of worpswedes betterknown artists are also university 
professors otto for example has been a guest professor at the 
university of notre dame in south bend ind 
worpswede was just an anonymous little farming village in the 
north german moorland until three artists took up residence in 1889 
fritz mackensen otto modersohn and hans am ende were mesmerized by 
the beauty of the countryside and recreated it on canvas others 
followed such as paula becker who married modersohn in 1901 
the barkenhoff was the scene of evening songfests artistic 
discussions openair plays and readings by rilke it is now a 
shrine for thousands of tourists who visit every year 
but worpswede has its tragic side as well 
vogeler and his wife became estranged at a time when he was 
struggling with uncertainty about his artistic direction depressed 
and disoriented he joined the german army at the start of world war 
i he returned to worpswede an ardent communist he was harassed for 
his beliefs and closely watched by anticommunist informants he 
fled to the soviet union in the 1930s and died there a disillusioned 
man in 1942 
he is now revered as one of worpswedes greatest talents 
paula modersohnbecker was also a tragic personality she 
eventually found worpswede and marriage artistically stifling and 
began spending long stretches of time in paris 
she died in worpswede during childbirth in 1907 at age 31 
despite scant recognition during her lifetime she is now considered 
a pioneer in modern german painting

stevie ray vaughan had all the makings of a blues 
legend a kid from texas practicing the moves in front of a mirror 
overnight success comparisons to jimi hendrix bb king and eric 
clapton the last of the guitar heros playing his heart out 
only one part remained for vaughan 34 to complete the story 
join hendrix robert johnson mike bloomfield and others by dying 
young three years ago he nearly did 
this might sound funny but fortunately i collapsed said 
vaughan who named his new album in step after the 12 
steps program used by recovering alcoholics 
in a sense i knew this thing was coming i knew i couldnt 
keep going the way it was i had a nervous breakdown i was throwing 
up blood the whole thing i had not been able to obtain any drugs 
for about two weeks but the drinking was still going on if i was 
awake i was guzzling something he said 
wed been touring doing all kinds of things i went through a 
divorce i couldnt write during that i wanted to but divorces are 
sick people dont treat people like people lawyers get together 
and try to trick each other 
the first steps of 12 steps modesty a sense of limits 
were once a million miles away for vaughan on and off stage he 
felt invincible the baddest kid on the block 
he could play anything cover any song and write his own as 
well from the swirling hendrixlike guitar that kicked off his 
1983 debut album texas flood vaughan was a sensation a 
throwback to rocks simpler days music magazines honored him so 
did the grammys making vaughan an almost automatic nomination for 
best rock instrumental 
i didnt know what grammys were growing up he said the 
radio i listen to has more to do with soul stations that dont 
necessarily play all the new stuff i dont really care to get into 
any formula if you play the game our way well play your stuff 
 
those first records in every way were a blur vaughan and his 
band double trouble quickly followed his debut album with 
couldnt stand the weather soul to soul and live alive 
all gold sellers 
unafraid of comparisons vaughan covered hendrixs voodoo 
chile buddy guys mary had a little lamb and willie dixons 
youll be mine the slow songs jimmy reeds tin pan alley 
vaughans own lenny were a release temporary mercy a long 
sigh of relief 
he lived and breathed the blues and almost died 
i thought i was real cool because i was higher than you and you 
didnt know what youre missing i was aware i had many big 
problems i could not stop and didnt know how he said 
i was addicted to people that i wasnt treating like people i 
was treating people like drugs too if there was somebody that 
would put up with anything that was fine luckily there were 
people who still cared 
now preaching sobriety in his private life vaughan still 
worships the blues on record for in step he covers howlin 
wolfs love me darlin buddy guys leave my girl alone and 
willie dixons let me love you baby drawing material from his 
substantial record collection 
theyre like my books like my school vaughan said you 
put it on and it hits you its always been that way 
i can take just about any one of my records and if something 
about the way they play or sing gets a hold of me ill try to find 
what they did ill wrestle with myself playing their stuff for a 
while and ill absorb it into my own sound 
he ends in step with riviera paradise a lengthy jazz 
instrumental he wrote in 1984 
its an extension of sorts of the same style as lenny in my 
heart and in my mind they were written for the same reason to 
soothe it had to come out at the end of the record i couldnt see 
any other place for it really 
vaughan who once dreamed of playing like bluesman albert king 
now finds himself being approached by young guitarists all just 
beginning their own stories 
some of them want to know technical things some of them want 
to know what to do how to go about getting a record deal i can 
just tell them who i listen to what i did he said 
i remember when the biggest thing in my life was getting to 
meet bb king i thought in my mind it was not only important for 
me but important for him i had all this confidence it was 
incredible seeing somebody who was such a gentleman ive been so 
fortunate to meet all these people

after more than three decades author allan 
gurganus can still remember seating charts from first grade front 
to back right to left its a writers gift he insists a 
wonderful asset 
another gift for the 42yearold writer is mimicry the ability 
to assume the voice and experiences of another in 1981 gurganus 
read a story about 19 women still on the pension payroll as widows 
of confederate soldiers a character took shape in his head 
99yearold lucy marsden 
gurganus was soon writing in the voice of lucy who talks to a 
young reporter from a nursing home in falls nc shes offering 
history an occasional fib mixed in with the wink of an eye no 
longer able to see 
lucy was drawing on gurganus experiences and for both author 
and subject survival became the key to oldest living confederate 
widow tells all knopf 2195 
i wanted the book to be a collaboration so the reader is 
implicated gurganus said the reader feels he has to come back 
to hear the rest of the story and also come back to keep lucy alive 
the suspense of whether she can in fact finish telling the story 
before she runs out of time is a subtext 
confederate widow is 718 pages of stories legends anecdotes 
and folk wisdom holding everything together is the voice of lucy 
amiably spinning yarns that reach back more than 100 years 
ive always been a storyteller and storylistener said 
gurganus who grew up in rocky mount nc i think the bargain of 
stories is you know how to hear them and know how to tell them like 
musicians listening to each other great storytellers never 
interrupt each other 
lucys voice seems set to music the sentence rhythms sing with 
her unique inflections and cadences like a rustic country ballad 
the author read his book aloud several times making sure the 
writing had perfect pitch 
ive always thought the ear is the best possible editor i love 
jazz improvising on a theme i can imagine four crystal goblets and 
one plastic goblet four of them ping and one doesnt editing is 
this perpertual weeding out of the one that does not ping 
its a great title of a hymn some things always sing im 
going to use it as a title of a novel if it sings its true 
some facts about lucy she grew up in falls at 15 she married 
captain william marsden 36 years her senior her best friend was 
castalia marsden an exslave she had nine children and outlived 
them all 
some facts about gurganus he went to the university of 
pennsylvania and the pennsylvania academy of fine arts he was 
drafted by the army during the vietnam war but chose to serve in 
the navy instead getting out in 1970 he went to the iowa writers 
workshop in 1973 and became close friends with john cheever 
his first short story was published in 1974 and gurganus taught 
at stanford and duke universities before moving to new york in 1978 
he currently teaches at sarah lawrence college 
truths however matter more for lucy and for gurganus events 
in confederate widow are seen through mirrors distorting but 
also enlightening lucys stories are really myths facts filtered 
through memory and time that touch upon universal experiences 
i think part of the equipment of the writer is to be a 
professional rememberer the author said an invented memory 
you make up one thing and if thats true then six other things 
will come with it 
i wanted to investigate the beauty of memory and the faults of 
memories i wanted a kind of doubleness im very interested in the 
old testament and im very interested in grimm fairy tales i see 
this book as an enormous fairy tale a morality tale about true 
things 
chapters mirror each other as well in black white and 
lilac lucy recalls lady marsden the captains mother whose 
dream world is shattered when union soldiers burn down her mansion 
while freed slaves taunt their exmaster 
in the tribe that answers castalia and other africans are 
lured onto a slave ship unaware of what awaits them in america on 
board the elderly miss reba insists that they will be welcomed as 
heroes valued for their wisdom and experience hauled in front of 
slave owners bidding for her services reba tragically still sees 
herself as visiting royalty unaware of laughter hissing from the 
audience 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i plans and go slow at first her cried crackly yet loud as 
she could starting off might seem real hard but then one day 
just like things done dawned on reba here you gone see whatall we 
come to teach tribes lessons bout to break over you heads like 
so many rare red birds eggs full of that 
you gone to say so it that then you sure will laugh even 
took your old reba here a day of six to see you reasons for toting 
us on on over here

when reba finishes two young whites carry her away on a 
stretcher nobody wants this crazy old woman 
to have your values and your wisdom unheard is the most 
terrible fate gurganus said in lucy i wanted to create a 
witness to history somebody who was always present but never 
central not beautiful not welleducated and yet terribly 
observant terribly intelligent and terribly greedy for 
information 
gurganus like fellow southern writers eudora welty and flannery 
oconnor appreciates the value of a freak and always seeks to 
find magic in the lives of people otherwise forgotten 
in plantation days when people got together they sat down and 
talked and talked and talked and talked the good things became 
better and the worse things became worse 
now you see an old guy at the service station with no teeth 
no means of support and sweat stains on his hat he just sits on a 
cocacola crate all day yet hes a genius talker and people 
gravitate to him and ask questions and ask for stories to be 
repeated

theres a retreat tucked away in the green mountains at ludlow 
vt where overweight women go to swear off diets forever 
the retreat named green mountain at fox run isnt a luxury fat 
farm but it does have something many others dont a 54 percent 
success rate among its graduates who have maintained their 
weight loss or lost more 
the women most of them professionals who had been locked into 
highpressure highcalorie lives are attacking their weight 
problems by learning how their metabolism works and why their diets 
dont 
then they demonstrate the principle to themselves by eating 
real food and working it off by jogging biking hiking 
swimming or hitting tennis balls they unlearn what the codirector 
dr alan h wayler calls the allornothing diet mentality and 
importantly they learn how to keep using this knowledge after they 
go back home 
dieting is passive says wayler to lose weight you really 
need to take active steps put on your shorts and your tshirt and 
get out and go 
the women are grounded in the basic physiology of metabolism or 
the efficiency of the body in burning fuel they find out why 
exercise is the key to its maintenance they learn how stress 
psychology and social pressure affect their weight and says 
wayler they learn the bottom line diets dont work 
the problem is metabolically based dieting actually may make 
people fat says wayler who with his mother thelma j wayler 
founded and runs the retreat 
your body says to itselfim starving and uses the hunger to 
protect itself wayler says when you give up or go off the diet 
the body responds by trying to make up for what it sensed it lost 
hence the yoyo dieters syndrome 
a more rational approach is called for he says people need to 
understand that the changes they make should be reasonable simple 
and easily attainable 
both waylers are nutritional experts he is a specialist in 
nutritional biochemistry and metabolism and an assistant professor 
at the harvard school of dental medicine and the harvard medical 
school and she is a former assistant nutrition professor at long 
island universitys department of nursing and author of several 
nutrition textbooks 
wayler says they stress being healthy over being thin and being 
realistic instead of idealistic 
you may be looking for the perfect diet but there is no 
perfect you have to say to yourself im not perfect im me 
and you get to the point where you say to hell with my 
weight im going to get healthy 
he says all people should try to work exercise into daily 
activity and avoid weekend athletic heroics which can result in 
injury at minimum they should be exercising in some way three days 
a week they cant maintain good physical condition with less 
citybound people can find ways to exercise he adds just 
learning to walk from one place to the next helps health studios 
that open early before work are another possibility the people who 
have been to the green mountain retreat have learned body 
conditioning routines that can be used anywhere 
we started green mountain at fox run in 1973 because there 
was all this new information from research about nutrition becoming 
available but of very little benefit to people nobody had a way of 
translating it to practical use wayler says 
the typical session is four weeks though alumnae sometimes 
return for shorter periods to regain momentum or work out specific 
problems 
the waylers program is directed at women he says that women are 
usually more proactive more observant and more willing to learn 
while men tend to be reactive only making changes after something 
like a heart attack scare the woman is the educator in the 
family by teaching her youll be teaching others 
the green mountain retreat the waylers call it an educational 
community for weight and health management offers its 
participants the chance to analyze what it is in their lives thats 
causing their weight problems and then to take command and manage 
them 
they establish priorities and health has to be a priority 
says wayler its a tradeoff they realize they cant have it 
all

the numbers are growing louder even as the sound 
fades for more noisebattered americans most of them of working age 
an estimated 22 million americans currently have hearing losses 
according to the better hearing institute 
over the next 25 years 28 percent of all working age people in 
the country will have lost part of their hearing if estimates by 
the national institute on aging are on target 
the instance of hearing loss in the workplace is increasing for 
a number of reasons our environment is noisy people are living 
longer and theyre retiring later says nancy b nadler director 
of career counseling and job placement services at the new york 
league for the hard of hearing 
moreover the noise contributing to the problem is pervasive in 
the workplace says dr jane madell director of audiology at the 
league there are air conditioners telephones ringing people 
talking typewriters and xerox machines these are not at levels 
above the limit but they are factors above communication level 
federal law sets an 85 decibel limit for the workplace the league 
and similar organizations around the country work with hearing 
impaired employees and their employers to help them cope with this 
increasingly common disability 
ignorance about how to go about it is shared by employer and 
employee alike ms nadler says the individual must learn to be 
more assertive about his needs while his managers need to know more 
about how to meet them 
there are she says few things that hard of hearing people cant 
do in the workplace and employers in most cases can easily 
accommodate them 
amplified phones and location of desks away from noisy areas are 
examples slightly restructuring the job so that someone else 
answers the phone is another 
but these sometimes have to be pointed out to the employer 
dont assume that your supervisors are not providing support 
for you because they dont want to it may be that they dont know 
what is needed she says 
she advises the employee to speak up for changes in office 
arrangements if the employee needs a piece of equipment such as a 
gain handset for the phone he can find out model numbers and costs 
and pass that information to the supervisor for approval and action 
if there is excessive noise in the work area the employee should 
say so and ask to be moved away from it 
the job search for the hearing impaired person is much the same 
as for others except that every step of the way may be affected by 
the impairment 
selfdoubt is an early stumbling block she sees often the 
beginner may think he will be excluded from many occupations and 
doesnt even know what to aim for another obstacle along the way 
may be the simple problem of using the phone to make an interview 
appointment then there is question of how early in the job search 
to reveal the impairment 
just think how nervous any person is when he goes for an 
interview imagine how it is for the hearing impaired person with 
these other fears 
an established employee has another set of fears losing his 
job being demoted or not being promoted he may try to hide the 
impairment withdrawing from natural interaction in meetings and 
with other employees he risks being marked as unmotivated and 
passive 
both on the job and in a job search the best approach is to be 
open ms nadler says while she advises against putting this 
information on a resume or covering letter since its personal 
she says the hearing impaired person should bring it up during the 
interview she points out that the employer legally cant ask about 
it but the candidate who initiates the subject and outlines 
accommodations needed will put the employer at ease and clear the 
air at the outset 
new and established employees can help educate their managers 
about the impairments impact with the help of organizations like 
the league or self help for the hard of hearing shhh a national 
group with local chapters across the country the league runs 
ongoing workshops for hearing impaired employees and counsels 
employers as well 
ms nadler says her role is to help both employee and employer 
develop realistic expectations about the options and limits imposed 
by the impairment then armed with knowledge and helped with 
hearing aids and other devices they can mimimize its impact and 
explore potential instead

technology and medicine are coming to the aid of hearing impaired 
and deaf people with cochlear implant surgery fm or infrared 
transmitters and improved hearing aids 
perhaps the most exotic is the bionic ear or cochlear 
implant that helps profoundly deaf people hear sound and recognize 
speech 
a tiny receiver is surgically implanted in the bone behind the 
ear and electrode channels inserted into the cochlea or inner ear 
after surgery the patient is fitted with an externally worn 
microphone transmitter and speech processor these send sound 
through the implants to stimulate nerve fibers which in turn relay 
messages to the brain the latest version is a 22channel implant 
which lets the patient to hear a broad range of pitches 
cochlear corp which manufactures the devices says 300000 
people in the united states alone could benefit from cochlear 
implant technology 
the system implantation surgery and followup rehabilitation 
currently run around 25000 insurance plans or medicaid cover the 
cost in many cases 
infrared and fm devices have greater range and power than 
conventional hearing aids helpful in public places and meetings and 
for television listening in both types of systems the user hears 
sound through a headphone radio receiver 
an infrared system pairs a transmitter connected to a microphone 
or directly into a television audio jack with a headphone worn by 
the user volume can be adjusted on the headphone without disturbing 
neighbors or other viewers the microphonetype of transmitter also 
can be used for room conversation or meetings 
the same headphone can be worn or borrowed at the site at many 
theaters churches temples and other public places where infrared 
transmitters have been set up infrared listing systems of new york 
for example has equipped most theaters and concert halls in new 
york and many others across the country for the consumer who wants 
a transmitter and headphone for his own use costs average about 
125150 for each element 
fm systems have receivers that are customtailored to split and 
reform frequencies according to the users profile sound is 
transmitted from one other person a speaker wearing a neck 
microphone this oneonone connection cuts background noise making 
it a good choice for classroom or meeting use cost is approximately 
1000 for the system 
improved circuitry in hearing aids the most common devices used 
by hearing impaired people has made it possible to get high power 
in the small intheear instruments many aids have dualchannel 
circuitry that balances high and lowfrequency sounds adjusted to 
the users hearing loss profile the dualchannel processing which 
splits the frequencies and combines them again in the appropriate 
proportion helps the wearer distinguish sounds in noisy 
environments hearing aids have a fairly wide price range from 
around 400 up to 1500 
the user should have a hearing test and consultation with an 
audiologist or otolaryngologist before choosing either a hearing aid 
or fm system

weightconscious americans may be giving themselves short shift 
on nutrition says the center for vitamin and mineral communications 
the organization cites a us department of agriculture survey of 
21000 people in which not one person got the recommended dietary 
allowances rdas of 10 nutrients needed for basic good health 
the cvmc lists the 10 most needed nutrients what they do and 
where you can get them 
iron it helps build healthy blood an iron deficiency leads to 
anemia meaning blood cannot carry enough oxygen to the bodys 
cells leaving you tired weak and irritable best sources for iron 
are lean meats organ meats green leafy vegetables nuts breads 
cereals and eggs eating these in combination with a vitamin c 
source such as orange juice can help your body absorb more iron from 
other foods 
folacin its vital to fetal growth and in making maternal 
blood a womans blood volume doubles during pregnancy and her 
folacin stores may be depleted quickly if not enough is in her diet 
folicin is found in leafy green vegetables and organ meats 
overcooking should be avoided because folacin is sensitive to heat 
and easily destroyed even with a microwave 
calcium a bone and teeth builder it also helps in blood 
clotting which helps the heart and nervous system work efficiently 
three out of four women dont get enough calcium and the deficiency 
has been implicated in osteoporosis and high blood pressure best 
sources are lowfat milk and cheeses soy products such as tofu and 
broccoli cottage cheese however is not as rich in calcium as in 
other dairy foods 
zinc zinc helps make up many of your bodys enzymes that 
regulate metabolism and also helps produce hormones for growth 
sexual development taste sight smell and protein building recent 
research also reveals zinc helps heal wounds and supports immune 
functions women the elderly and vegetarians are most likely to 
lack this element best sources are oysters herring milk and eggs 
zinc also can be found in whole grains but in less absorbable form 
water water is essential for proper functioning of all cells 
making up two thirds of the body choose plain water juices or 
decaffeinated beverages alcoholic and caffeinated beverages though 
liquid are dehydrants 
fiber fibers promote digestion and alleviate constipation 
soluble fiber may help lower blood cholesterol and to a more limited 
extent blood sugars best sources are oat bran legumes such as 
dried peas and beans rice bran fruits and vegetables insoluble 
fiber can reduce risk of colorectal and similar cancers and can help 
diabetics whole grains especially wheat and rye some fruits and 
vegetables are good sources to increase fiber in your diet do so 
gradually and drink plenty of liquids too much fiber can cause 
bloating cramping and diarrhea 
beta carotene though not a vitamin itself it can be converted 
to vitamin a in the body essential for night vision healthy skin 
strong teeth and bones and immunity beta carotene is an 
antioxidant which will help protect body cells from damage that can 
cause cancer foods with beta carotene are easy to spot because of a 
characteristic carroty color cantaloupe carrots sweet potatoes 
winter squash and apricots it also is found in dark leafy greens 
vitamin b6 along with other b vitamins this element helps 
produce energy in body cells its main job is to metabolize 
proteins so how much you need depends on how much protein you eat 
inadequate b6 may cause memory loss lack of energy irritability 
poor concentration muscle aches cold sores and digestive problems 
its estimated that only 20 percent of all americans and only 7 
percent of women get enough of it lean meats whole grains 
legumes liver wheat germ salmon bananas and sunflower seeds are 
sources these same foods also provide many of the bcomplex 
vitamins including niacin thiamine b12 riboflavin folacin and 
others 
vitamin c important for healthy gums strong bones and teeth 
vitamin c also helps form collagen the most abundant body protein 
it also is thought to act as an antioxidant helping protect against 
certain types of cancers citrus fruits tomatoes potatoes and red 
fruits like cherries and strawberries are good sources 
magnesium its part of every body cell activating enzymes 
that keep the body running smoothly it also promotes bone growth 
and helps the nervous system function inadequate magnesium in the 
blood can cause abnormalities in the heartbeat called arrhythmias 
muscle cramps and muscle twitching an estimated 75 percent of the 
population and 86 percent of women fail to meet daily 
requirements for magnesium sources include soybeans and soy 
products nuts legumes and whole grain foods

most americans want nutritionally sound meals for themselves and 
their families but dont have a good enough understanding of 
nutrition to do so according to a survey conducted by the post 
center for nutrition and health 
the survey asked 1000 adults what questions they want answered 
about nutrition more than half the responses showed a 
misunderstanding or lack of information and 14 percent reflected a 
high level of confusion 
virgil brown president of the medlantic research foundation and 
post center advisor was surprised by the basic level of questions 
about cholesterol and thinks that existing information may have 
become too technical 
the percentage of fat and saturated fats as well as the actual 
recommendations on cholesterol consumption are useful to 
nutritionists and health professionals but are of little direct help 
to most people in the grocery store he says 
while the survey domonstrates an interest in nutrition among 
the public it highlights even more the need to provide clear 
concise information that will enable people to choose a diet that 
will contribute to their good health adds helen guthrie 
chairperson of the nutrition department at pennsylvania state 
university and another advisor to the post center a division of 
post cereals

athletic trainer bob kersee has called in the 
diet cops to keep nutritional tabs on his star performers 
olympians valerie brisco jackie joyner kersee and roy martin 
diet cops is the nickname for specialized diet consultants in 
the persons of susan cohen and carol saunders advising athletes on 
optimum diets for performance and they make weekly field calls to 
athletes in training 
many athletes believe that their burning of calories in 
workouts is all that is necessary to control body fat says cohen 
the empty calories that some athletes fill their bodies with 
cannot repair the muscle injury bone and joint bruises that most 
athletes suffer 
she says that the recommended diets are nutrient dense with 
lots of vitamins and minerals per calorie the plans call for a 60 
percent carbohydrate ratio with little fat and limited protein 
women athletes tend to eat fewer calories and are more likely 
to develop nutritional deficiencies she says 
brisco martin and the kersees say the steroid scandal of the 
olympics was the catalyst for them to adopt a rational nutrition 
program 
our medical counsel has demonstrated that steroids build 
inherent weakness what appears as strong muscle is fat and water 
says jackie joyner kersee our own timetable with frequent travel 
and long workouts makes our eating cycles erratic we suffer from 
too many meals grabbed on the run

behavior modification changing the way you 
feel about food and eating is a key part of controlling your 
weight says a cornell nutritionist 
for many people it means adopting techniques that will help 
them eat less without feeling deprived says christina stark 
nutritionist with the cornell cooperative extension 
she says behavior modification healthful dieting and a regular 
exercise program are the three elements of a successful 
weightcontrol plan 
keep track of your eating patterns says stark and try to 
substitute good eating habits for the bad ones 
choose one specific behavior that is a problem for you and work 
to change that one stark says dont try to change too many 
things at once or you may just frustrate yourself 
if watching television means settling down with a big bowl of 
buttered popcorn for instance try to eliminate that betweenmeal 
snack or at least learn to like popcorn without butter and salt 
if skipping breakfast means leaves you tempted by a midmorning 
doughnut from the office canteen try bringing a piece of fruit or 
wholewheat bread from home instead 
if snacking is a problem try to modify that behavior by deciding 
to eat only when seated at a table 
any changes you make must fit your lifestyle says stark 
or they wont help with weight control in the long run 
dont decide to get more exercise by rowing if you hate to row 
instead choose one or more physical activities you like and can 
stick with 
and dont pick a diet based on exotic foods that you dont 
normally eat

your resolve to exercise on your own may evaporate after the 
first week of your selfdesigned program or perhaps you enjoy the 
camaraderie of other exercisers and the convenience of an indoor 
environment you cant get rained or snowed out of 
an exercise studio is probably the answer but how do you sort 
out the legitimate ones from the flybynights 
good exercise instructors will be certified and have that 
certification posted in the studio says molly fox an instructor 
who runs her own studio in new york city look for certificates from 
the international dance and exercise association the aerobics 
fitness association of america or the american college of sports 
medicine 
next evaluate how well the studio and the instructor fit your 
needs there are so many qualifications one should have besides a 
certificate she says some things to look for 
an instructor who will help you set a realistic fitness goal 
and help you achieve it even in a class setting the teacher should 
be able to give you some personal coaching 
one who is knowledgeable about the field keeping abreast of 
new information through trade magazines professional conventions 
and attendance at advanced classes with other teachers 
one who pays primary attention to the student evaluating 
performance and giving advice a good instructor is a good listener 
and responds to questions he or she also will call students by 
name ms fox observes 
an instructor who is well organized with attention to certain 
parts of the overall program on given days 
versatility and flexibility ms fox points out that a good 
teacher will teach a low impact class differently than a high impact 
one or a body sculpting class differently than a body blaster class 
a teacher who looks and acts the part he or she should be 
healthy and in good shape physically and mentally teachers should 
enjoy what they do and be motivated not burned out 
the studio thats clean and has equipment in good condition 
look for flooring thats safe for exercise and dance usually wood 
never concrete 
a program with variety you should be able to vary your 
exercise routine 
a studio thats accessible with classes and workouts scheduled 
for your convenience 
ms fox studied with jane fonda in san francisco before opening 
her studio in new york shes an active member of idea and afaa

remember how your piano teacher told 
you to hold an orange in each palm to get you to arch your fingers 
correctly over the keys 
the teacher probably was right purdue university researchers 
looking for sources of hand pain have discovered that slightly 
curving the fingers alleviates joint stress while playing with 
straight or nearly straight fingers parallel to the keyboard is the 
most harmful way to play the piano 
ben m hilberry professor of mechanical engineering at purdue 
and graduate student david c harding say their research into hand 
mechanics may eventually help people in handintensive occupations 
pianists were chosen for their study because their finger movement 
is primarily twodimensional 
harding says that knowledge of mechanical dynamics can help 
pianists with an alternate treatment for overuse syndrome hand 
pain traditionally the treatment has been to cut down on playing 
hours 
they cant practice or the pain hurts them during a 
performance and for professionals that means their job is on the 
line he says 
the researchers used a special piano calibrated to record the 
force of a fingers impact on a key video cameras simultaneously 
recorded the angle of the finger from the side and above these data 
were analyzed by computer to calculate the forces at each of the 
finger joints and tendons 
early research with five pianists with different playing 
techniques showed vast differences in the amount of stress on the 
finger joints these results led to development of a computer 
program to determine finger positions to minimize force on the 
joints and tendons 
we started out with the idea of trying to create a tool to 
examine this issue harding says we didnt anticipate being 
able to also find the best playing positions to minimize forces on 
fingers but we were able to also accomplish that he notes that 
piano teachers who have traditionally maintained that a curved hand 
position is the best playing technique now have scientific evidence 
to back them up 
the research was aimed primarily at developing a computer program 
to analyze differences in technique among pianists and other 
musicians it was suggested by dr kenneth d brandt head of the 
rheumatology division of indiana universitys school of medicine and 
director of its performing arts medicine program

stylish spikeheeled shoes with pointed toes can seriously damage 
your feet 
so says dr john hunter associate professor of orthopedic 
surgery at the university of oklahoma health sciences center in 
oklahoma city 
feet already are some of the most used and abused parts of our 
body taking daily wear and tear and other special stresses such as 
regular running says hunter noting that wearing the wrong shoes 
can cause bunions heel spurs corns and other serious foot ailments 
i think women abuse their feet more than any other group 
because they tend to wear highheeled pointedtoed shoes the shape 
of which is dictated by a fashion designer rather than by their 
anatomy 
lots of women who have feet that just dont fit into this type 
of shoe will jam them in anyway and as they get into middle age 
they begin to have problems its an especially significant factor 
in the development of problems such as bunions corns and 
callouses 
women who want to be stylish but avoid problems should look for 
thicker cushioned soles a larger toe box a soft upper a flexible 
forefoot that allows the foot to bend and if necessary room for 
arch supports or orthotic inserts hunter advises 
extra cushioning is particularly important because fat tissues in 
the sole waste away as a person ages he says 
thats one reason people in their 40s and 50s start to develop 
callouses when they havent changed their shoe style or their 
lifestyle

perils of modern life staring at your computer screen or 
spending long hours on the road are sources of damaging stress to 
the eyes according to the american optometric association 
there are simple steps you can take to offset this stress the 
organization says 
if you spend many of your working hours in front of a video 
display terminal make it a habit to take a 10minute break every 
hour and relax your eyes by looking at something in the distance 
room lighting should be soft with lamps to provide extra light for 
paperwork shades blinds or drapes should be angled to reduce 
window glare 
aoa cites studies that show eyestrain is the most frequent 
complaint among office workers and says that poorly designed 
workspaces and poor lighting are most often to blame eyestrain can 
lead to headaches body aches and irritability 
taking breaks while on the road also is advised drivers on long 
highway trips should stop after the first 200 miles and every 100 
miles thereafter 
driving at 55 mph requires concentrated focus on a narrow field 
and this can lead to fatigue and highway hypnosis to offset 
this periodically focus on objects ahead and blink frequently 
and of course wear sunglasses on bright days 
the association advises a yearly checkup to detect vision 
changes which can occur subtly without your being aware of them

blindness can catch people unaware says the american foundation 
for the blind some warning signs can tip you off that something is 
wrong 
bumping into objects 
groping for objects or touching them in an uncertain way 
squinting or tilting the head to see 
holding books or other reading material close to the face 
dropping food or utensils at mealtimes 
difficulty recognizing faces 
looking ungroomed or sloppy 
acting confused or disoriented 
sight may be lost so slowly that it is not until a significant 
amount of vision has been lost that the person realizes something is 
wrong says afb executive director william f gallagher 
most vision loss will result from diabetes cataracts macular 
degeneration and other eye diseases that affect primarily older 
people and develop gradually with few early symptoms he says

no harm in that afterwork drink with friends as long as you 
remain a social drinker and dont wander over the line to alcoholism 
you could be wrong say joseph barbato and allan luks both 
social drinkers and coauthors of you are what you drink 
villard books 
even if youre not headed off the deep end alcohol can have its 
effect on your looks how you feel and how you function say 
barbato former public information director for the alcoholism 
council of greater new york and luks executive director for the 
institute for the advancement of health 
for example alcohol can make your skin look red and blotchy when 
it reaches the vessels just under the skins surface it can push 
your weight up because it is a genuine appetizer making you hungry 
and at the same time confusing your sense of satiety alcohol also 
can keep your body from absorbing nutients and vitamins 
particularly folic acid making you tired it can disrupt your 
rapideyemovement sleep producing insomnia it also upsets your 
normal immune responses making you more vulnerable to invading 
microbes the authors also cite studies which say alcohol can make 
you aggressive rather than euphoric playing hob with your emotional 
and sexual relationships 
if thats not enough you also can get the oldfashioned 
hangover nausea headache and exhaustion can follow even modest 
intakes of alcohol 
you dont have to give it up but the authors say that you need 
to know your limit and be aware of the negatives of just one more

the belief that children outgrow their allergies is a myth says 
an allergy specialist at the university of californiadavis 
symptoms may moderate over time but the potential for an 
allergic reaction once the right set of circumstances pops up is 
always there says professor eric gershwin once allergic 
always allergic 
according to gershwin allergic youngsters are more vulnerable to 
recurrent colds sore throats or ear infections short attention 
spans poor academic performances sleep disturbances poor 
appetite irritability and psychological disturbances 
allergies are certainly a major social psychological and 
financial burden for children and their parents says gershwin 
chief of the universitys division of rheumatology allergy and 
clinical immunology 
despite new technology allergies remain one of the most common 
and troublesome health problems around he adds 
one of every six children suffers from allergies with symptoms 
ranging from an occasional sneeze to lifethreatening asthma 
attacks says gershwin coauthor with retired professor edwin 
klingelhofer of a recently published book conquering your childs 
allergies addisonwesley 
both authors have allergies and are fathers of severely allergic 
children 
allergies can be tied to a host of factors or conditions from 
the time of the year or the weather or what your child had for lunch 
to the arrival of a new pet moving to a new house or apartment 
using makeup or even taking a walk in the country they write 
they point out that cafeteria lunches physical education 
classes field trips school parties or just being in the classroom 
near chalk heating and air vents dust glues and paints can 
trigger allergic reactions 
children can learn how to manage their allergies but each child 
first must know exactly what the allergy is what triggers it and 
what to do to avoid the reaction gershwin says 
the parents and other health care providers must spend the time 
and energy to convey the avoidance and treatment strategies in terms 
the child can comprehend 
they must show children how to go about making their own 
independent health care decisions give them the freedom and 
opportunity to do so and review the decisions and their outcomes 
carefully

assert their right to question their doctors and not be intimidated 
by the medical establishment they need to find out their options

and drugs then with informed consent they should take equal 
responsibility with their doctors about treatment decisions

americans will spend an estimated 5 billion this year on 
cosmetic dentistry and may spend as much as 9 billion by 1992 
according to customedix corp developers of dental products 
three years ago the figure was about 25 billion 
the company says the increase is because people today are more 
cosmetic conscious there is more disposable income and new 
dental products provide a more natural look 
a new porcelain has been developed for example that has three 
times the compressive strength of standard porcelains says dr 
gordon cohen chairman of customedix he says porcelain has a 
natural translucency transmitting and reflecting light in a way 
that matches real teeth 
cohen believes the use of high strength porcelains will increase 
over the next decade while alloys and conventional porcelains will

women in poor physical shape are three times more likely to die 
of heart disease at an early age than are those who keep themselves 
in good condition according to a longterm study 
dr lars g ekelund the principal author of the study said it 
provides the first strong evidence that exercise protects women from 
heart disease just as it does men 
poor physical fitness is almost as important as smoking as a 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women said ekelund a 
researcher at the university of north carolina 
the study was based on a 10year followup of 2802 women who 
ranged in age from 30 to 69 
fodors publishers of travel guides has come out with a book 
describing 240 healthoriented spas and resorts 
health and fitness vacations by travel writer bernard burt 
covers everything from weight loss spas to mineral water retreats 
and sports conditioning resorts in the united states canada mexico 
and the caribbean 
fodors will update the book frequently says michael spring 
editorial director 
the american red cross has launched a national campaign to help 
prevent child deaths from choking suffocation and drowning 
the infant and child cpr campaign will encourage parents 
grandparents baby sitters and others to learn how to deal with 
breathing emergencies in infants and children 
theres a lot a parent can do before the ambulance arrives 
said robert burnside director of health services for the american 
red cross 
one of those things however is not the heimlich maneuver 
that method of using abdominal thrusts to dislodge obstructions 
in the breathing passages is effective on choking adults but it 
does more harm than good when used on a baby burnside said 
a choking baby needs to be held in a certain way and be given a 
series of blows to the back and thrusts to the chest to restore 
breathing he said 
bicycle helmets are so effective at preventing head injuries that 
a major campaign should be launched to encourage riders to wear 
them a report published in the new england journal of medicine 
concludes 
the report based on a study of injuries treated at five seattle 
area hospitals over a oneyear period shows that riders with 
helmets had an 85 percent reduction in their risk of head injury and 
an 88 percent reduction in their risk of brain damage the study was 
directed by dr robert s thompson of the group health cooperative 
in seattle 
safety helmets are effective but they are not being used 
enough the researchers wrote the time has come for a major 
campaign to increase their use 
knowing how to use a computer as a clinical tool to analyze 
patient data and search the medical literature is going to be as 
important in the next decade as knowing how to use a stethoscope 
says family practice news 
citing a seminar run by the american association of american 
medical colleges the publication predicts the use of computers 
involving medical informatics will give the physician more time 
for the patient 
the report noting that computers are not just teachingmachines 
predicts that they will be indispensible in clinical care and basic 
research for that reason a medical informatics curriculum should 
be on the agenda of medical schools 
the medical journal adds that a number of medical schools 
including ucla have begun to offer courses on medical informatics 
 
high blood pressure affects one of every four americans of all 
ages and lifestyles and many of those afflicted dont even know it 
according to a report issued at redwood wash 
high blood pressure is the leading cause of heart attack stroke 
and kidney disease say officials of health monitor centers which 
offer free blood pressure reading and health screenings in retail 
stores across the nation 
the report says 60 percent of all americans will develop some 
type of elevated blood pressure during their lifetimes with one of 
every four suffering from hypertension 
eye examinations not only can disclose visual problems they also 
can detect high blood pressure diabetes and high cholesterol says 
a university of alabama optometry professor 
in many cases optometry is the entry point for health care 
explained dr larry alexander at an education course at the american 
optometric associations congress in new york city 
the majority of optometric patients havent had a physical exam 
for years so its the optometrist whos picking up on these 
cardiovascular conditions 
for example an optometrist can spot high blood pressure or 
diabetes by observing hemorrhaging or blocked blood vessels in the 
eye 
or a person with high cholesterol may have fatty particles in the 
eyes blood vessels blocked vessels a gray ring around the eyes 
cornea or fatty deposits on the eyelids

the finance ministry said monday that the 
countrys commercial lenders have agreed in principle to reschedule 
575 million in debts due over a 30month period 
the agreement announced by staterun jordan radio is part of a 
series of steps taken by the government to overcome a balance of 
payments crisis largely triggered by mounting obligations on 
jordans 83 billiondebt 
the agreement followed two days of talks between six banks 
representing the london club of commercial lenders and jordanian 
officials led by finance minister bassel jardaneh and central bank 
governor mohammed said nabulsi 
the commercial banks grouped under the club hold about 11 
billion of jordans debt 
the statement quoted an unidentified finance ministry official as 
saying commercial bank representatives had agreed to reschedule the 
575 million in debts due from the start of this year through 
mid1991 
after a fiveyear grace period the money would be paid over 11 
years 
it also said jordan had pledged to pay interest due on the debt 
amounting to 82 million this year 
bankers earlier said jordan had not made any payments this year 
on its commercial obligations 
this agreement will uphold jordans standing in international 
financial circles which will have positive results in strengthening 
the balance of payments and encouraging investment in jordan the 
statement said 
jordan earlier reached agreement for a similar rescheduling plan 
with the paris club of governmental lenders although that plan did 
not extend into 1991 
the paris club governments hold 43 percent of jordans debt but 
the percentage of payments was lower because of interest rate 
differences 
jordan also reached agreements for relief from the soviet union 
the world bank and international monetary fund and won more than 
350 million worth of grant aid from arab oil states in the gulf 
the help sent jordans dinar shooting up to 150 last month from 
a low of 1 it was worth 3 early last year before the central bank

french tire maker michelin is rumored to be 
interested in acquiring uniroyal goodrich tire co but analysts 
differ on whether the purchase would fit in with michelins normal 
purchasing patterns 
michelin is locked in a threeway contest with goodyear and 
bridgestone of japan to be the worlds largest tire company 
analyst harry millis of mcdonald amp co in cleveland said 
acquiring akronbased uniroyal goodrich just would not fit 
michelins normal pattern at all 
he noted that a 1970s purchase of a tire plant owned by gates 
rubber co of denver didnt work to michelins satisfaction 
historically michelin has had very little interst in buying 
other peoples facilities he said 
but at least one other industry observer said an acquisition 
would be benefit michelins in carrying out its strategy in the 
united states giving it a domestic market share almost equal to 
that of industry leader goodyear tire amp rubber co 
francophiles like to be kind of top of the hill and they see 
goodyear and they know they cant get to be no 1 by themselves 
said arvid jouppi analyst with keane securities co in grosse 
pointe mich 
michelin spokesman jim morton said friday he had heard 
acquisition rumors for the last day or two but he said it was 
company policy not to comment on rumors or speculation 
uniroyal goodrich became the secondlargest tire manufacturer in 
north america and fifthlargest in the world when bf goodrich co 
and uniroyal inc of middlebury conn merged their tire operations 
on aug 1 1986 
michelin which has us headquarters in greenville sc 
operates eight tire plants in the united states and canada while 
uniroyal goodrich own seven plants in the two countries 
analysts estimated a buyout could cost between 700 million and 
1 billion 
uniroyal goodrich had total sales last year of 22 billion and 
reported profit of 192 million including a onetime gain of 93 
million from the termination of a pension plan during the second 
quarter ended june 30 
the company however lost 7 million during the first quarter of 
this year after incurring additional interest expense from last 
years restructuring which wiped out operating profits the company 
said 
jouppi said it would be logical for michelin to acquire uniroyal 
goodrich because michelin would win the ohio firms market share 
greatly boost its manufacturing capacity and prevent uniroyal 
goodrich from being bought by another competitor 
uniroyal goodrich declined comment on the prospects of 
acquisition by michelin

one of donald trumps atlantic city casinos 
knowingly distributed incorrect roulette instructions for more than 
a year a newspaper reported today 
winners were not paid according to the gaming guide issued by 
trump castle hotel amp casino but were instead paid under the actual 
rules of the game 
among the errors was an illustration showing that a gambler who 
puts down money on black is paid off if the ball lands on red and 
that a ball landing on an odd number pays off a bet on an even 
number the philadelphia inquirer said 
the guides were distributed in 1986 1987 and part of 1988 the 
paper said 
regulators knew the guide was inaccurate as early as september 
1986 but fred gushin deputy attorney general for gaming 
enforcement gave trump castle permission to keep distributing the 
booklet until copies ran out the paper said 
no one was cheated here because while the gaming guide 
contained technical errors the game was played according to the 
rules approved by the commission gushin said 
robert signore of ambler told the newspaper that he followed the 
guide after discovering it contained mistakes after 22 spins of the 
roulette wheel signore had lost 600 but should have won 200 
according to the guide he said 
signore has sued in small claims court to recover the 800 he 
says he is owed 
gushin and officials from trump castle did not immediately return 
calls this morning

employees and franchise owners i have discovered that this is a 
very big job and it is not fair to give divided attention to 
dominos pizza and my foundation work 
the letter was sent to 800 franchise owners who own about 
twothirds of the more than 5100 dominos stores in 17 countries 
it also went to dominos 16 regional offices and to about 300 
employees at its ann arbor headquarters 
they havent put a value on the company and i think thats what 
he meant by exploring the possibility of a sale dominos 
spokesman ron hingst said sunday he emphasized that a sale is only 
a possibility but said we felt we owed the employees and 
franchisees a letter 
dominos a privately held company is the worlds largest pizza 
deliverer its sales reached a companyrecord 23 billion in 1988 
its net income fell to 61 million from 77 million in the 
previous year according to news reports that hingst did not dispute 
monaghan who also owns the detroit tigers supports the catholic 
church cs mott childrens hospital in ann arbor and the 
university of michigan school of architecture he also is the 
founder of the dominos foundation which has supported healthcare 
agencies and educational and cultural groups 
the thought of selling dominos pizza is not a pleasant idea 
monaghan wrote i must emphasize that it is only a possibility at 
this point 
monaghan 52 remains chairman and chief executive officer of the 
company but gave up running daytoday operations earlier this year 
he holds about 97 percent of the stock in dominos

environmentally damaging projects today announced increased lending 
to populationcontrol projects and forestry development to help 
combat global atmospheric warming

environment that the bank is committed to environmental issues 
and what is more this commitment does not detract at all from our 
primary mission of global development

third world development spoke at the opening of a conference called 
to address how to raise living standards in poor countries while 
preserving the environment 
sponsored by the japanese government and the united nations 
environment program the conference has drawn dozens of officials 
and experts from many countries and international organizations 
at the end of the conference wednesday they are expected to issue 
recommendations on ways to combat the main problem on the agenda 
global warming scientists warn that the socalled greenhouse 
effect could scorch parts of the earth and raise sea levels unless 
checked 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu whose country is under 
environmentalists attack as the biggest importer of tropical forest 
products pledged increased assistance to research on sustainable 
development of tropical forests 
kaifu welcoming the conferees said japan intends to raise its 
foreign environmental aid to 225 billion in three years

in depth during his justcompleted series of summit meetings in the 
united states canada and mexico

will grow to 6 billion by the year 2000 adding to the use of fossil 
fuels that is blamed for the greenhouse effect and atmospheric 
warming

patterns may be impacted and marine food chains affected he told 
delegates 
tolba called for full partnership in all countries to phase 
out all ozonedestroying chemicals and said he was concerned that 
just 13 of the worlds 120 developing countries have ratified the 
montreal protocol on those chemicals 
brazil china india the republic of south korea and some 
other major producers and users of chlorofluorocarbons in the thirld 
world are yet to join the protocol he said 
regarding other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide 
tolba urged developed countries which now emit threefourths of 
such gases to decrease energy use and increase energy conservation 
and efficiency 
but we have to be quite objective he went on if the 
industrialized world meets the challenge the results of its efforts 
could be completely wiped out if china and india continue to burn 
their huge reserves of coal and they will continue to do so unless 
they are assisted financially and technologically to use 
alternatives

top executives of the nations big three 
automakers have agreed with some oil companies to quash moves which 
would require that cars burn methanol instead of gasoline an 
automotive journal reported today 
automotive news quoted unidentified sources as saying general 
motors corp chairman roger smith and vice chairmen harold poling of 
ford motor co and gerald greenwald of chrysler corp have signed 
documents for their companies to work with oil refiners to develop a 
reformulated gasoline which would steer them clear of methanol 
conversion costs 
the weekly journal said in the copyright story that killing any 
methanol initiatives would save the automakers millions of dollars 
in research and development costs and eliminate competition for oil 
companies 
gm spokesman bill noack was in a meeting and not immediately 
available for comment this morning 
spokesmen tom foote of ford and tom houston of chrysler said 
their companies had no immediate reaction to the automotive news 
report 
it would take the oil industry years to develop and produce 
reformulated gasoline which would meet federal cleanair standards 
automotive news said some efforts already are under way 
each of the big three has an active methanol research program 
outside engineers also have been studying ways including new fuels 
to reduce automotive pollution and its effects on the environment 
president bush this summer announced a plan that beginning in 
1995 would phase in cars that burn clean fuels such as methanol 
in connecticut and the cities of los angeles houston new york 
milwaukee baltimore philadelphia san diego and chicago 
the society of automotive engineers and gm last spring sponsored 
a methanolfueled car rally in which the automaker supplied a fleet 
of chevrolet corsicas to 15 colleges and universities the schools 
converted the cars and drove them from detroit to washington via 
canada and new england 
automotive news said not all of the nations oil producers are 
involved in the reported effort now but that by a summit 
meeting of top automotive and oil industry executives tentatively 
set for january most of the major oil refiners will have signed 
commitments 
getting the major auto companies and the gasoline makers 
together on the emissions problem is a bit like getting two 
elephants to dance automotive news quoted a ford fuel engineer as 
saying it takes time inevitably toes are going to get stepped

environmentalists want to enlist grocery chains 
as allies in their fight against pesticides on foods but the 
campaign is showing only limited success and meeting stiff 
resistance from the largest retailers 
one environmental group the national toxics campaign announced 
today it has signed up a halfdozen grocery chains in a pledge to 
shift growers away from using pesticides especially cancercausing 
chemicals 
environmentalists called the agreement a major breakthrough 
although it amounted to little more than a general pledge to work 
toward elimination of pesticide use 
this is the beginning of a national campaign said craig 
merrilees of the national toxics campaign calling the pact a 
first of a kind dramatic breakthrough for the environmental 
movement 
the participants represent fewer than 200 stores in the united 
states and are firms primarily in california and arizona that have 
broken ranks before with their industry colleagues on the pesticide 
issue 
the agreement which involves five grocery chains and a produce 
distributor represents only the kickoff of a national campaign to 
enlist grocers in the fight against pesticides the 
environmentalists told a news conference 
merrilees said he expects other grocers to join but acknowledged 
that the industry hierarchy including grocers trade associations 
is strongly opposed to pushing growers to reduce their pesticide use 
at a separate news conference the food marketing institute and 
several producer associations denounced the environmentalists plans 
robert l carey a spokesman for the industry group accused the 
environmentalists of seeking to create a major crisis of 
confidence in the food supply 
they apparently believe they can coerce supermarket retailers 
into assuming the job of government he said their intention is 
to pit company against company and retailers against their 
suppliers 
karen brown of the national food institute accused the 
environmentalists of more scare tactics 
we dont think its our job to play the role of government or 
science said ms brown whose group represents 1500 grocery 
companies including the countrys 100 largest chains 
pesticide use has received heavy attention following the uproar 
earlier this year over the pesticide alar which ultimately was 
pulled off the us market by its manufacturer after sales of apple 
products plummeted last week the manufacturers of the fungicide 
ebdc said they were taking it off the market for use on a number of 
crops because tests showed a higherthanacceptable cancer risk 
in the agreement reached with the environmentalists the grocers 
pledge to request growers to disclose what pesticides were used 
on produce to actively encourage the phaseout of 
cancercausing chemicals on produce by 1995 and to whenever 
economically feasible carry certified organic produce and 
produce certified to contain no detected pesticide residues 
but the pledge omits stronger provisions once sought by some 
environmentalists such as demands that grocers post pesticide 
content of fruits and vegetables in stores or demand immediate curbs 
on pesticide use 
there are scant signs that the pledge sought by the national 
toxics campaign is finding many converts among the nations grocers 
merrilees conceded there remains outright hostility from industry 
trade groups 
the food institute recently wrote to its members urging them not 
to participate in the national toxics campaign agreement merrilees 
said 
among those signing the agreement with the national toxics 
campaign are several sizeable local chains such as raleys with 55 
stores in the sacramento calif area and abco supermarkets with 
about 60 stores in arizona yet the large chains are missing and 
there is virtually no representation from stores outside california 
nevada and arizona 
a spokesman for safeway stores corp which has shown little sign 
of talking with the environmentalists declined to discuss in detail 
the companys policy on pesticides 
donald beaver president of the california grocers association 
complained that too often the environmental groups have asked 
grocers to be on the front line of the war against pesticides 
were not going to shoot ourselves in the leg and end up having 
nothing to sell in the stores said beaver explaining that 
grocers will not sign a pledge against accepting produce with 
pesticides when there is no assurance that alternatives will be 
available 
what our industry supports and what everybody is working 
towards is to set up programs to fund research that will reduce the 
necessity of pesticides said beaver in a telephone interview 
were caught between the grower and the consumer

the number of working oil and gas rigs throughout 
the country fueled by a doubledigit increase in texas jumped by 
14 last week to total 950 and again was ahead of last years levels 
for the second straight week baker hughes inc reported 
a year ago the count stood at 938 the company said monday 
the latest increase continued to reflect the yearlong volatility 
of the count which rose by 27 a week ago when it marked the first 
time in 13 months that the count was higher than the previous year 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
collecting figures 
texas which jumped by a 20rig gain during the previous 
reporting period gained another 10 rigs last week while oklahoma 
was up by three 
among other major oil producing states louisiana and wyoming 
each were up by four while california increased by one kansas saw 
a loss of six rigs during the week

the effort by the united states and other top 
industrial countries to stabilize the value of the dollar has broken 
down running the risks of higher us trade deficits in future 
years economists at a washington research institute said today 
the coordination process is in shambles said c fred 
bergsten director of the institute for international economics 
he said the effort launched by the united states and the 
governments of japan west germany britain france canada and 
italy had failed to keep the dollar from rising this year above the 
upper targets set by the worlds richest industrial countries 
that will spell trouble down the road as american exporters find 
that the higher value of the dollar makes it more difficult to sell 
their goods abroad bergsten said at a news conference 
he forecast that the us trade deficit which improved 
dramatically in 1988 will begin rising again by 1990 further 
worsening the countrys position as the worlds largest debtor 
nation 
the institute today released a new book dollar politics 
exchange rate policymaking in the united states which called for 
increased emphasis by us policymakers both in the executive branch 
and in congress on the dollars proper level on foreign currency 
markets 
in may and june the dollar shattered its upper limit against 
the yen 140 yen to one dollar and the mark 190192 marks 
to one dollar rising above 150 and 200 respectively to a 
2year high wrote im destler and c randall henning the 
authors of the new study 
destler is professor in the school of public affairs at the 
university of maryland and henning is a research associate at the 
institute a private study group with financing from the united 
states and other countries 
the price of the dollar is important because of its effect on 
trade a low dollar makes us goods cheap encouraging exports and 
discouraging imports a rise in the dollar has the opposite effect 
governments including the bush administration agree that this 
country buys far too much in comparison with what it sells the 
resulting trade deficit has made the united states the worlds 
biggest debtor nation 
on friday the price of the dollar was above 146 yen and 199 
marks despite efforts to keep it down one report said the central 
banks of 10 countries had been selling dollars in an unsuccessful 
attempt to keep their price down 
a 1985 agreement to work together on the price of the dollar and 
other currencies was made by secretary of state james a baker iii 
then secretary of the treasury and his counterparts from japan 
west germany britain france italy and canada 
they have never published their targets for the dollars price 
the upper limits named by destler and henning are often cited by 
unofficial experts 
the two authors complained that us exchange rate policy is made 
by a small group of senior officials and should be more closely 
coordinated with broader economic policies and private business 
they proposed setting up new committees in congress to watch the 
dollars price a private sector group to advise treasury secretary 
nicholas f brady and more involvement by other government agencies

the world bank said monday it will boost its funding 
for programs to combat global atmospheric warming following 
criticism that it has not been sensitive to the environmental 
consequences of its loans 
president barber conable said the bank will triple its lending to 
forestry programs and has established a new gas development unit to 
encourage developing nations to use natural gas instead of fuels 
that create more pollutants linked to the rise in world temperatures 
we do not believe that development and environmental protection 
are mutually hostile objectives he told an environmental 
conference sponsored by the japanese government one cannot be 
sacrificed for the other 
mostafa tolba head of the united nations environment program 
told 60 officials and experts at the meeting that about 50 million 
people around the world may become environmental refugees 
because of global warming 
the earths warming has been linked to gases such as carbon 
dioxide methane and freon byproducts of the burning of fossil 
fuels and other industrial and agricultural processes released into 
the atmosphere they trap heat like a greenhouse preventing it from 
escaping 
if the release of gases continues at current levels the earths 
temperature is likely to rise by 25 degrees to 8 degrees 
fahrenheit over the next 50 years scorching parts of the world 
and melting polar ice flooding densely populated coastal areas 
tolba said 
lowlying developing countries such as bangladesh egypt 
indonesia and pacific islands are likely to be particularly hard 
hit he said 
the conference on global warming and environmental protection in 
developing nations is part of a new japanese government policy of 
becoming more involved in international environmental issues 
prime minister toshiki kaifu welcoming the conferees monday 
pledged that japan will provide about 225 billion in special 
environmental loans over the next three years and will work to 
develop environmentally appropriate technology 
japanese environmental groups have criticized the conference 
saying it is likely to whitewash japanese links to environmental 
degradation and have protested the governments decision to exclude 
private groups from the sessions 
in separate demonstrations monday several environmental and 
citizens groups protested japans status as the largest importer of 
wood from endangered tropical forests and its alleged export of 
polluting industries to the third world 
a coalition of groups held its own threeday peoples forum 
on environmental issues before the government conference the 1000 
participants called for more careful citizen monitoring of japans 
overseas aid programs 
under the name of environmental aid japan is promoting 
certain types of tree plantations such as eucalyptus plantations in 
northeastern thailand that are proven to destroy the natural 
environment and ruin local forestdwelling communities said 
surisuwan kuankachorn of thailands project for ecological recovery 
a participant in the forum 
the best thing that japan can do for the outside world is 
to listen to the real needs of the people in other countries not 
just japanese companies he said 
conable said the world bank has become committed to 
environmental issues and is increasingly integrating environmental 
values into its development programs 
the bank the leading institutional supporter of third world 
development has been criticized for funding projects such as dams 
and roads that have damaged the environment and disrupted 
traditional living patterns 
we are changing direction but must turn very slowly like an 
ocean liner conable said 
he said the bank also would boost funding for a tradiional 
emphasis family planning from 500 million in the past five years 
to 800 million in the 199092 period 
he said the worlds population currently about 5 billion will 
grow to 6 billion by the year 2000 adding to the use of fossil 
fuels blamed for atmospheric warming 
tolba said all countries must cooperate in dealing with global 
warming but developed nations he said are responsible for 
production of threequarters of the greenhouse gases 
the challenge before japan the united states and east and west 
europe is to decrease energy needs increase energy conservation and 
efficiency and keep pace with an accelerating global economy he 
said 
but we have to be quite objective if the industrialized world 
meets the challenge the results of its efforts could be completely 
wiped out if china and india continue to burn their huge reserves of 
coal and they will continue to do so unless they are assisted 
financially and technologically to use alternatives

would cost 563 million over the next 20 years for the worldwide 
fleet an average of 290000 per aircraft 
none of the work is urgent and the airliners remain safe to fly 
said clyde kizer spokesman for the task force set up 14 months ago 
by the airline industrys air transport association 
the faa order covers only us planes over the next four years 
with work required as each airliner logs a set number of landings 
and would total 53 million said ray ramakis assistant faa 
director for maintenance programs and flying standards 
industry officials said many of the changes already are being 
made at airline maintenance bases and no disruptions of service or 
fare increases are expected as a result of the orders 
foreign airlines and regulatory agencies generally adopt faa 
orders for usbuilt aircraft 
ramakis said the faa would issue formal airworthiness 
directives within the next few days they would become law after a 
period of several weeks for public comment 
the changes are designed to eliminate the potential for 
structural fatigue problems as the aircraft reach their economic 
design goal ramakis said 
he said the orders will affect 218 dc8s 568 dc9s 173 md80s 
and 194 dc10s with additional aircraft added as they accumulate 
service time 
the orders will include modifications to the fuselages landing 
gears and doors of the airliners he said 
the proposals and orders are similar to those made for airliners 
manufactured by boeing co after another task force completed its 
work earlier this year 
the panel reviewed 3900 service bulletins put out by mcdonnell 
douglas only 159 were recommended for modification or replacement 
action 
the faa which made the boeing recommendations mandatory in may 
participated in the latest group along with airlines manufacturers 
and some foreign aviation safety officials 
a third study will cover older airliners built by other 
manufacturers 
the formation of the industrygovernment task force on 
airworthiness assurance is one of the best things that has happened 
in the aviation industry in the last 30 years said dale warren a 
vice president of douglas aircraft co a division of mcdonnell 
douglas 
he said the estimated cost for each model aircraft would be 
90000 for older md80s 74000 for dc10s 161000 for dc8s and 
490000 for dc9s the dc9 work is more costly because it requires 
the greatest number of changes and involves expensive replacement of 
main landing gear fittings officials said 
an industry analyst paul turk of avmark inc said mandatory 
work on mcdonnell douglas aircraft should be less extensive than 
that required for boeing models because the douglas construction 
philosophy is heavier with fewer corrosion problems 
avmark lists 306 dc8s which were first built in 1958 as still 
carrying passengers or freight throughout the world 888 dc9s 
first manufactured in 1964 and 372 dc10s which entered commercial 
fleets in 1971 and are no longer in production 
the boeing recommendations called for 800 million worth of 
mandatory work on more than 1300 early 747 737 and 727 airliners 
amounting to about 600000 for each aircraft airlines said most of 
the alterations were already accomplished or scheduled 
when the faa adopted the report on boeing planes it marked a 
major change in the governments approach to aging airliners 
previously the faa had required periodic inspections with 
replacement required only when corrosion cracking or other signs of 
metal fatigue were found 
for boeing planes the faa issued a series of airworthiness 
directives initially affecting 115 airliners and others as they 
age or accumulate flying hours 
the decision to set up the task forces came after an aloha 
airlines 737 with nearly 90000 flights lost an 18foot section of 
fuselage in an april 1988 flight over hawaii a flight attendant was 
sucked out of the plane and killed but the aircraft landed with no 
other fatalities

rockefeller group inc confirmed monday it was 
seeking ways to raise more cash for the family members who are 
majority shareholders after a published report indicated part of 
the firm could be up for sale by months end 
the companys management has been authorized by the board of 
directors to explore strategic alternatives for 
recapitalization said vince silvestri a spokesman for 
rockefeller group whose vast holdings include the 19building 
22acre rockefeller center in manhattan 
but silvestri said he couldnt comment on a report in mondays 
wall street journal that said rockefeller group was trying to sell a 
large stake in the familyowned company to outside investors for 
more than 1 billion 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources familiar with the 
proposal said rockefeller group may seek between 13 billion and 
2 billion for 40 percent to 80 percent of the company it said 
family members were hoping to raise cash without losing control over 
the management of company assets 
the company is preparing a prospectus that will be available by 
the end of the month to a limited group of potential investors 
according to the journal 
the plan would represent another step by rockefeller group to 
raise cash for a generation of rockefellers whose inheritance is 
largely locked up in real estate and other corporate holdings 
four years ago rockefeller group refinanced rockefeller center 
by taking out a 13 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space 
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real 
estate investment trust the company also sold a 15 percent equity 
interest to outside investors and some properties around the country 
among those alternatives being considered are longer financial 
restructuring the sale of shares or a possible joint venture 
arrangement with selected investors said silvestri 
he said proceeds would be used in part to provide greater 
liquidity for current shareholders 
the rockefeller family fortune was built by john d rockefeller 
founder of standard oil co and was estimated at 900 million by 
1911 
his son john d rockefeller jr created a series of five trusts 
for his children in 1934 those trusts are the principal owners of 
rockefeller group with descendants of john d rockefeller jr the 
main beneficiaries 
as the family now moves into the sixth generation the need for 
cash to finance various business efforts has increased 
besides the rockefeller center complex which includes the 
general electric building formerly known as the rca building radio 
city music hall and the timelife buildings rockefeller group 
operates several businesses 
they include rockefeller center development corp rockefeller 
center management corp rockefeller group telecommunications 
services inc radio city music hall productions inc and cushman amp 
wakefield in which the company holds an 80 percent stake

dominos pizza inc owner tom monaghans 
disclosure that he may sell the company comes at a time when the 
fastfood concerns fastrising star may be dimming an industry 
analyst said monday 
dominos the no 2 pizzamaker in the nation behind pizza hut 
inc is the leader in pizza deliveries 
but analysts say the privately held companys sales growth rate 
has slowed and its profit reportedly declined last year from the 
previous year 
dominos has been on such a fantastic growth rate said gary 
stibel founder of new england consulting a marketing and 
management consulting firm in westport conn 
companies like dominos cannot continue to grow at their 
pace he said 
monaghan who owns 97 percent of the ann arborbased pizza 
delivery company sent a letter last week to about 800 franchise 
owners 16 regional offices and 300 employees at corporate offices 
that he is exploring a sale so he can spend more time doing charity 
work 
but stibel said there may be another reason 
dominos has become principally concerned about the cap on the 
growth of this business he said their share of the total 
universe is beginning to start to flatten out 
dominos spokesman ron hingst said monday he knows of no active 
sale negotiations he hasnt even made a decision to sell it or 
not to sell it he said 
he monaghan has had a number of offers over the years 
hingst said ten to 15 years ago he had an offer from pizza hut 
and turned it down 
although it is second to pizza hut in overall pizza sales 
dominos is the worlds largest in pizza deliveries with 1988 sales 
at 23 billion pizza hut had overall sales of 32 billion in 1988 
but only 20 percent to 30 percent of that was for consumption 
outside its stores 
hingst said dominos sales have set company records every year 
since the early 1980s as the number of its stores grew now 
dominos operates or has franchised 5200 stores worldwide 
the company is privately held and does not publicly report its 
earnings but hingst did not dispute news reports that its profit 
fell to 61 million last year from 77 million the previous year 
dominos dominance of the delivery business is being threatened 
pizza hut with 7000 restaurants began a delivery service out 
of existing sitdown restaurants and other deliveryonly storefronts 
in 1985 
pizza hut spokesman jim schwartz said from corporate headquarters 
in wichita kan that sales from the delivery stores is growing at 
an annual pace of 15 percent to 16 percent 
detroitbased little caesars pizza with about half as many 
stores as dominos is the nations thirdlargest pizza company and 
had sales last year of about 908 million 
dominos has been struggling with some damaging news this year 
its guarantee of 30minute delivery has come under criticism for 
putting delivery time ahead of safe driving dominos conducts 
driver safety classes for its deliverers 
monaghan has come under fire from womens groups critical of his 
outspoken opposition to abortion and the national organization for 
women has organized a national boycott of the chain 
the 52yearold monaghan supports the roman catholic church cs 
mott childrens hospital in ann arbor and the university of michigan 
school of architecture he also founded the dominos foundation 
which has supported healthcare agencies and educational and 
cultural groups 
he also owns the detroit tigers baseball team 
the thought of selling dominos pizza is not a pleasant idea 
monaghan wrote in his letter i must emphasize that it is only a 
possibility at this point

here are some recent incidents involving metal 
fatigue or other problems associated with older airliners that have 
had large numbers of landings 
none of the incidents has involved mcdonnell douglas aircraft 
which are the subject of the latest federal aviation administration 
precautionary orders for modifications to increase the safety of 
older airliners 
dec 26 1988 an eastern airlines boeing 727 built in the late 
1960s was forced to land in charleston wva after a 14inch hole 
opened in its fuselage at 31000 feet there were no injuries among 
the 110 people aboard 
the incident led to fleetwide inspections and discovery of a 
3inch crack in another old eastern 727 
sept 21 1988 an american airlines 727 made a belly landing at 
dallasfort worth airport after metal fatigue in its landing gear 
prevented the pilot from opening the wheelwell door the 88 
passengers and crew evacuated with three people injured 
boeing had recommended inspections eight days earlier after 
finding metal fatigue in the same area in other 727s 
may 9 1988 a 20yearold american airlines 727 was forced to 
make an unscheduled landing at detroit after a 15inch crack in a 
wheel well caused a drop in cabin pressure none of the 112 people 
aboard was injured 
april 28 1988 a flight attendant was killed and 61 people 
injured when a portion fo the fuselage on a heavily flown aloha

after months of unsuccessful legal and financial 
maneuvering high voltage engineering corp on monday terminated its 
700 million offer to buy milwaukeebased universal foods corp 
clifford press deputy chairman of high voltage blamed 
wisconsins antitakeover law as the primary reason for giving up 
the fight which began in december 1988 
evan zeppos a spokesman for high voltage said the company would 
continue its effort to have the law overturned in the us supreme 
court but he conceded the chances were slim that the court would 
hear the appeal 
wisconsins law passed in 1987 bars an acquiring company from 
merging with a target company or sellings its assets if the original 
takeover was not approved by the target companys board of directors 
in the unlikely event that the law is overturned high voltage 
will reconsider its offer zeppos said 
the boards rejection of our proposals and its refusal even to 
meet with us to discuss any questions they may have had did not 
serve the interests of universals shareholders press said in his 
statement 
after the announcement the price of universal shares in trading 
on the new york stock exchange slid 225 a share to 3250 a 
share before recovering to 3412 
the 9monthlong takeover attempt was especially costly for high 
voltage which fought unsuccessfully in us district court in 
milwaukee and the 7th circuit court of appeals in chicago to 
overturn the antitakeover law 
zeppos declined comment on the costs but guy a osborn 
president and chief executive of universal foods said high voltage 
had spent more than 15 million in financing and legal costs 
osborn declined comment on the costs incurred by universal foods 
but he said he was pleased high voltage based in burlington mass 
finally had relented 
we feel its good news for us at the company and its good news 
for wisconsin he said its good news for business in general 
our plan now is to devote 110 percent of our time to the business 
goals we are committed to 
high voltage began the battle with a 3050pershare tender 
offer to universal shareholders last december later the company 
upped the ante to 35 and then to 38 it later offered 42 per 
share to universals board of directors for a negotiated merger 
universals board rejected each offer and recommended 
shareholders not tender their shares 
the continued legal battle over the validity of the antitakeover 
law apparently frustrated high voltage said richard elam a 
chicagobased investment analyst with blunt ellis amp loewi inc in 
milwaukee 
they got bogged down in the legal system elam said i 
think high voltage either became impatient or decided it cost too 
much

intel corp on tuesday will unveil a 
superfast microprocessor that marks a breakthrough in chip design 
by carrying out two tasks at once and up to 66 million instructions 
per second 
the 32bit i960ca chip smaller than a dime but more than twice 
as fast as the i486 chip intel introduced last spring packs 600000 
transistors and is the first commercial chip to employ 
superscalar technology 
superscalar design allows a chip to execute more than one 
instruction for each tick of its internal clock 
instead of cramming more transistors onto the chips to get them 
to work faster during each cycle the i486 for example has 12 
million transistors intel appears to have solved the elusive 
problem of how to get the chip to carry out two instructions per 
cycle 
imagine a car wash that can run two lanes through at a time 
instead of one said michael slater editor of microprocessor 
report an industry newsletter in palo alto the car wash with two 
lanes can obviously get more cars through in the same time 
intels speed rating for the i960ca chip is derived from taking 
the chips clock speed 33 million cycles per second and doubling 
it 
many other chipmakers are working on superscalar designs said 
slater who expects to see several of those products next year and 
many more in 1991 
millard h phelps an analyst with hambrecht amp quist in san 
francisco said the i960 shows that were going into a new era 
of microprocessors 
computers have been doing multitasking and multiprocessing and 
were going in that direction right down to the chip itelf phelps 
said thats quite a departure 
intel the company that invented the microprocessor says the 
i960ca is the fastest 32bit chip yet but the chip which is 
expected to be priced at about 300 isnt compatible with msdos or 
other software commonly used in desktop computers and isnt expected 
to have an immediate impact on that market 
instead the chip is aimed at laser printers robot controllers 
telephone switching systems and automobiles of the future the auto 
industry which is largely using 8bit chips is slowly moving into 
faster 16bit chips and may be several years away from using the 
superfast 32bit chips to control brakes and engines 
the i960 design has been endorsed by a group of avionics systems 
suppliers and could have a significant impact in that field said 
thomas a thornhill of shearson lehman hutton inc in san francisco 
thats a pretty strong endorsement for the architecture 
thornhill said 
what i think is interesting beyond the product itself 
thornhill said is that some of the design techniques used to 
achieve the superscalar architecture may be applicable to intels 
other chips and may show up in other products like the i860 and 
future versions of the 486 in the past intel has tended to do some 
of its design work in modular form so can be applied or altered for 
other chips 
intels i860 chip introduced earlier this year also is capable 
of doing certain types of operations two at a time but doesnt 
employ the superscalar design the i860 a 64bit microprocessor 
with more than 1 million transistors is capable of performing up to 
80 million calculations per second the 750 chip is designed for 
highend workstations and is more mathintensive than the i960ca

a small american company has been picked to 
supply schools in the soviet union with personal computers and help 
set up soviet factories to produce pcs soviet officials announced 
monday 
phoenix group international of irvine calif was picked from 
among 17 companies worldwide including ones from west germany 
france austria singapore malaysia canada and the eastern bloc 
the soviets said 
all the computers involved are cleared for export by the us 
department of commerce 
soviet education officials said they hoped a joint venture with 
phoenix would supply 3 million personal computers to schools and 
universities and 3 million more to other buyers in the soviet union 
by 1994 
although it is impossible to estimate whether the soviet sales 
projections will be met phoenix chairman charles w missler said 
its a very substantial opportunity for us 
phoenix which broke even on sales of about 10 million in the 
past 12 months is majorityowned by missler and its vice chairman 
peter von braun its lightly traded stock rose 25 cents a share to a 
bid 4 after jumping 1 a share friday on early word of the deal 
the late asking price was 550 a share 
phoenix was picked because it did not insist on being paid 
entirely in dollars and was willing to help the soviets learn the 
computermanufacturing business said vv krynkin an official of 
the state committee for public education 
a phoenix affiliate resdel industries provided some of the 
communications links for the soyuzapollo joint space mission 
a lot of other companies primarily looked at it from the point 
of view of business were not talking here strictly from the point 
of view of buying and selling products krynkin said through an 
interpreter at a new york news conference 
the new joint venture samcom will start out by shipping kits 
from the united states the plan envisions the soviets gradually 
taking over manufacturing so that in five years 85 percent of the 
work will be done in the soviet union 
the initial system for schools will consist of a network of 10 
student workstations clustered around an instructors computer and 
a file server computer that will store programs and data 
the system is new technology that is being announced this week at 
a computer networking trade show in dallas missler said 
missler said he and von braun saw the joint venture as a chance 
to establish links that could lead to other business deals and 
improve relations between the united states and soviet union 
perestroika in the soviet union requires that the quality of 
soviet specialists training must be sharply increased as well as 
the level of education in general leonid tereschenko the deputy 
chairman of the state committee for public education said in a 
written statement

trump castle hotel amp casino did not 
intentionally mislead gamblers with incorrect instructions in a 
roulette guide that has been distributed since 1986 state gaming 
officials said monday 
however robert signore of ambler pa says he lost 800 
because of the faulty guide and has filed a lawsuit in small claims 
court to recover the money according to mondays editions of the 
philadelphia inquirer 
michael weber a spokesman for the casino run by developer donald 
trump said monday the casino would have no comment on the lawsuit 
state documents show that both the state division of gaming 
enforcement and the casino control commission knew as early as 
september 1986 that the trump castle gaming guide was inaccurate 
the newspaper said 
the incorrect guides were distributed in 1986 1987 and part of 
1988 said fred gushin deputy attorney general for the division of 
gaming enforcement 
gushin said monday that he gave trump castle permission to 
continue distributing the booklet until the stock was exhausted 
signore said he followed that guide after discovering it 
contained mistakes after 22 spins of the roulette wheel signore 
had lost 600 but should have won 200 according to the guide 
the dge questioned why signore continued to play after he 
realized he was losing money gushin said 
why didnt he question it after the first bet gushin said 
that seemed a bit curious 
gushin said the error was not intentional and didnt appear all 
that material 
among the errors was an illustration showing that red paid off on 
black and that even numbers paid off on odd numbers 
gushin said the casino followed the rules of roulette and that 
the gaming guide did not unfairly lure patrons

automotive giant daimlerbenz on 
monday accepted the conditions set by economics minister helmut 
haussmann for its planned takeover of a majority in the aerospace 
and defense concern messerschmittboelkowblohm 
that means that west germanys largest postwar merger can now be 
formally completed before the end of the year officials said 
although the diversified automaker said the conditions would have 
a sizable impact on the company chairman edzard reuter told 
reporters they were just within the limits of what could be 
accepted without putting into question the total industrial 
concept it had in mind 
the bonn government on friday approved the merger on condition 
that daimler spin off certain daimler and mbb defense technology 
activities that daimler executives give up certain outside board 
seats and that it relieve the government of a stake in the troubled 
european airbus aerospace consortium three years earlier than 
planned 
daimler said its approval is conditional on a similar nod from 
mbbs current owners but reuter said he had no doubt that 
daimler would formally have completed the merger by the end of the 
year

bellsouth corp and lin broadcasting corp said 
monday they were merging their cellular telephone operations to 
become a powerhouse company with a halfmillion customers and 
dominance in some of the industrys top markets 
they certainly will be a very big cellular company said 
kevin kelley a spokesman for the washingtonbased cellular 
telecommunications industry association it looks like they could 
be the largest 
the noncash deal announced by the two companies comes just a few 
months after new yorkbased lin rejected an unsolicited 585 
billion buyout offer from mccaw cellular communications inc the 
current no 1 in potential customers lin rejected that offer 
demanding at least 622 billion 
the merger subject to the approval of lin stockholders and 
regulatory agencies would give atlantabased bellsouth 50 percent 
of the stock of the combined company before the completion of the 
merger new yorkbased lin will spin off its television broadcasting 
subsidiaries to stockholders and will pay each shareholder a 20 per 
share special dividend 
lin currently operates in fewer markets than does bellsouth but 
lin does business in five of the top 10 cellular phone markets the 
industry operates under a duopolistic system that allows only 
two companies in each market one of which is the local phone 
company 
the merger will give atlantabased bellsouth entry to the 
lucrative new york philadelphia and dallas markets and will 
increase its presence in los angeles and houston where it already 
had a joint operating arrangement with lin 
those five cities all are among the nations top 10 markets for 
cellular telephone service 
overall the new company yet to be named will start with about 
500000 customers in 43 markets 
bellsouth a baby bell company had 1988 revenues of 137 
billion and net income of 17 billion lin had 225 million in 
revenues and earnings of 82 million though company officials say 
the rapid growth of lin makes the company worth more than its 
earnings figures might indicate 
this new company clearly will be the powerhouse of the cellular 
industry said bellsouth enterprises president william o mccoy 
kenneth leon a cellular industry analyst at bear stearns amp co 
in new york said the bellsouth package is worth about 105 a share 
to lin shareholders 
the mccaw offer was worth 120 a share but leon suggested the 
bellsouth deal may be more desirable to lin shareholders because it 
keeps them involved in cellular instead of just giving them cash 
mccaw owns 10 percent of lin and its offer for the rest of lin 
is still is on the table mccaw spokesman steve bruce said he said 
he could not comment on the bellsouthlin deal because it has not 
yet been filed with federal regulators and mccaw has not seen the 
official merger proposal 
bruce barnes of wasserstein perella amp co lins financial 
advisers said the deal with bellsouth was attractive in ways that 
the mccaw offer was not 
what the other offer involved was someone buying the company 
out for an amount of cash that the board felt was inadequate he 
said in this we have increased the value of our own stock and 
will be able to participate in the upside of the cellular business 
barnes said bellsouth provides lin with new markets technical 
expertise and marketing knowhow and lin offers bellsouth a 
management team very good at making the cellular business 
profitable 
lin chairman donald a pels will become chairman president and 
chief executive officer of the combined company which has not been 
named earle mauldin group president for mobile systems at 
bellsouth enterprises will be executive vice president and chief 
operating officer 
the combined company will serve markets totaling 62 million in 
population however since they will not have full ownership in 
cellular companies in each of the markets its prorated potential 
customer base would be 46 million that leaves it behind mccaws 52 
million prorated potential customers bellsouth currently ranks 
third and lin seventh in the industry measure

federal regulators sued two commodity options 
firms monday charging they misled customers on investment risks 
that ran up millions of dollars in losses over five years while the 
firms took hefty sales commissions 
siegel trading company inc based in chicago and international 
trading group ltd with headquarters in san mateo calif were 
sued separately by the commodity futures trading commission at 
federal court for the central district of california 
this is probably the largest antifraud sales solicitation case 
the cftc has ever brought said dennis klejna director of the 
commissions enforcement division 
a spokesman for chicagobased siegel was not in his office when 
called for comment and did not immediately return a reporters phone 
call 
in san mateo calif itg issued a statement that said it was 
reviewing the charges but intended to defend against them 
vigorously adding itg sales practices comply with applicable law 
and regulation do not mislead potential or actual customers and are 
proper in all respects 
itg also said it is not connected in any way with siegel 
options are contracts that give their owners the right to conduct 
a specified transaction such as buying or selling a certain number 
of shares of a given common stock at a set price within a stated 
period of time usually just a few months 
options can be highly risky and since they are usually shortterm 
investment vehicles they involve a lot of buying and selling for 
which commissions must be paid each time 
in the international trading group itg case the cftc stated 
that between jan 1 1984 and may 31 this year more than 85 percent 
of the firms customers lost a total of 428 million 283 million 
of it in commissions collected by itg 
itg collects a 40 percent commission premium on the options 
themselvessaid klejna who said other firms charge 
substantially less 
explaining the long lag time between when the alleged illegal 
activity began and the filing of civil charges klejna denied it had 
anything to do with recent congressional criticism of the cftc 
which is up for reauthorization later this month 
it has everything to do with the fact that weve looking at 
these things for a long time said klejna adding that it takes a 
long time to investigate and file charges in such cases 
itg also maintained offices in san francisco foster city 
newport beach and san diego calif honolulu and in coconut grove 
fla 
in the other case officials said siegel also charged 45 percent 
commission plus 155 for each trade from jan 1 1984 until the 
present according to the complaint about 85 percent of the firms 
customers lost money totaling 336 million for the same period 
the firm took in 40 million in commissions 
the cftc charged that itg fraudulently misrepresented and omitted 
important facts when it sold dealer and exchangetraded options to 
customers through mass mailings of promotional materials nationwide 
advertising and high pressure phone sales among other sales tactics 
the complaint alleged that itg misled customers about the risks 
involved and the returns to be expected in the commodity options 
market the experience and expertise of its sales force and the 
skills of its research department 
officials also charged that the firm claimed it had an 
outstanding track record which the cftc maintains is not borne 
out by the performance of itg customers accounts 
itg also failed to diligently supervise its employees while 
encouraging boilerroom type tactics of unsolicited 
highpressure telephone sales pitches the cftc charged 
in the other case the cftc charged that siegel which employs 80 
people at offices in los angeles and irvine calif directed each 
sales person to make up to 100 telephone sales solicitations a day 
more than 7000 customer accounts were opened with siegel and 
customers were falsely told they would earn fabulous profits 
trading commodity options with the firm without being told the 
actual risk according to the complaint 
the complaint also stated that siegel also solicited customers 
through a 15minute commodities television program broadcast 
transmitted on cable television every business day the name of the 
program was not given in the complaint and klejna declined to 
discuss it 
both lawsuits seek preliminary injunctions barring the firms from 
continuing their alleged illegal practices klejna said the cftc 
also would seek to have the firms return all profits made through 
illegal practices 
klejna would not comment on whether evidence from the civil cases 
had been turned over to federal prosecutors

prices nosedived at the opening in reaction to the london metal 
exchanges report that copper stocks in the exchangeapproved 
warehouse had risen last week by 4800 metric tons an unexpectedly 
large increase 
the big buildup in lme stocks appeared to contradict the 
tightsupply fears that have provided the main support for coppers 
price during the past 1 months 
but the market bottomed out quickly rallied steadily and ended 
with a strong burst of buying by some of the same speculative funds 
that had sold the market earlier in the day 
the decline was probably excessive said bette raptopoulos 
metals analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
analysts could not agree on a reason for the turnaround william 
oneill director of research with elders futures inc cited strong 
buying by the japanese who have been hit hard by the twomonth 
shutdown of the bouganville copper mine in papua new guinea 
continued violence in that area on monday reinforced predictions 
that production at bouganville will not resume this year 
meanwhile a 9weekold old strike at a highland valley copper 
co mine in british colombia continued monday and a strike at the 
chilean copper cos el salvador mine entered a second week after 
workers there voted against a settlement offer 
oneill said coppers fundamentals were still supportive despite

percent in the past two weeks 
we are dealing with a market that has a bullish supplydemand 
equation he said i think the markets healthier after this 
type of correction

grain and soybean futures prices finished mostly lower on the 
chicago board of trade amid forecasts for drier weather in the 
midwest and fading fears of an overnight freeze in important corn

earnings dropped to about 3 million in its latest fiscal year from 
47 million in the comparable yearearlier period mainly due to 
higher programming costs 
the cable television network said earnings per share were 17 
cents in the fiscal year ended june 30 compared with 30 cents in 
the tenmonth period ended june 30 1988

since that was the first full period of its new fiscal year

fnn attributed the decline in earnings mainly to increased costs 
stemming from new primetime business programming

million in the tenmonth period the yearearlier figure reflects

believe igt will pursue the lawsuit because universals video 
poker machine is substantially different than igts 
all of the video poker machines look basically alike on the 
outside lattin said its like buying a refrigerator therere 
lots of different brands but they look the same 
lattin said the inner components of universals video poker 
machine are very different from igts and universal never let igt 
officials examine the inside of the machine during the dispute 
larry semenza the reno attorney for nevadabased igt refused to 
comment on the lawsuit saying the parties had agreed not to talk to 
reporters about the dispute in what is a highly lucrative and 
growing market 
there was a stipulation entered into said semenza making 
his only comment about the document filed monday in us district 
court 
the hearing before judge bruce thompson was scheduled to 
determine whether to grant igts motion for a preliminary injunction 
to prevent universal from distributing the disputed video poker 
machine 
earlier this summer thompson handed igt an early victory in the 
dispute issuing a temporary restraining order to prevent universal 
from distributing its disputed video poker machine 
igt attorneys said the companys players edge machine was 
displayed during a february 1988 trade show and must have been 
copied by universal workers who viewed the device 
igt now the no 1 gaming device manufacturer in the nation and 
universal are battling along with ballys manufacturing for a bigger 
piece of the gambling market 
lattin said the gaming device market has become very competitive 
because of rapidly changing computer and electronic technologies 
that make gaming devices almost obsolete within a couple of years 
after introduction 
under the stipulation between the companies if igt doesnt 
object to the design of universals latest video poker machine the 
japanese company can approach gaming authorities for approval to 
distribute the device 
igt and universal have been involved in other disputes including 
one last year in which igt complained to nevada gaming regulators 
about a near miss slot maching universal was distributing

for business 
a religious group monday urged consumers not to buy the talking

which matchbox toys usa ltd announced last week would be 
available for halloween sales 
the group also urged a boycott of stores that stock the doll and 
a boycott of all other matchbox toys 
this doll is the product of a sick mind the fact that a major 
toy manufacturer would promote this doll is tragic said rev 
donald e wildmon executive director of the american family 
association 
we call upon concerned americans not only to refuse to purchase 
the freddy doll but to boycott all stores which sell it and to 
boycott other matchbox toys products said wildmon who is a 
united methodist minister 
the american family association formerly known as the national 
federation for decency has advocated numerous boycotts in the past 
earlier this year it protested pepsico incs use of rock star 
madonna in television commercials for pepsicola because of her 
performance in a separate video for her song like a prayer that 
showed a burning cross and other images that offended some 
christians 
pepsi in april withdrew its tv commercial featuring madonna 
saying consumers were confusing the music video with its commercial 
which contained no religious imagery 
allen wildmon associate director of american family association 
and donald wildmons brother said the group is asking supporters to 
contact their local stores and encourage them to refuse to carry the 
freddy krueger doll 
we hope to keep this doll from being marketed he said 
the american family association journal has a circulation of 
about 380000 including nearly 180000 churches and pastors 
freddy krueger the main character in the five nightmare on elm 
street horror films takes revenge on residents of a town by 
murdering teenagers the latest sequel a nightmare on elm street 
5 the dream child was released over the summer 
the film character who has long bladelike fingernails has 
developed a cult following and has generated an estimated 300 
million in domestic and foreign box office receipts and 
videocassette sales 
a spokeswoman for matchbox toys said no one at the company was 
immediately available to comment on the boycott being urged by the 
american family association matchbox a maker of small toy cars

another round monday in his attempt to block state insurance 
regulators from reviewing his 211 billion bid for bat industries 
plc the parent of insurance giant farmers group inc 
us district judge edward rafeedie rejected the request by 
goldsmith and his hoylake investments ltd for a preliminary 
injunction barring the review by californias department of

deadline by which he must complete the acquisition of bat under 
british takeover rules

insurance company in the united states to the french insurer axa 
midi assurances for 45 billion if his takeover succeeds for bat 
the londonbased tobacco retailing paper and financial services 
concern 
meantime goldsmith filed federal suits in all nine states in 
which farmers does business contending state regulatory review of 
the proposed hostile takeover is an unconstitutional infringement on 
foreign commerce 
after the nearly twohour hearing monday in los angeles federal 
court however rafeedie refused to grant the requested preliminary 
injunction 
the plaintiff has not demonstrated the probability of success 
or that the state act directly regulates foreign commerce

the state statutes involved give insurance departments authority 
to protect insurance policyholders by reviewing insurance industry 
takeovers
