a column of about 100 military vehicles 
rolled through the lithuanian capital before dawn saturday in what 
apparently was another bid by the kremlin to unnerve leaders of the 
breakaway republic 
lithuanian leaders condemned the maneuver and accused the soviet 
union of waging psychological warfare against the small baltic 
republic which declared independence on march 11 
nervous lithuanian legislators passed a resolution transferring 
power to the senior diplomat of independent lithuania in washington 
in case of emergency and several of them walked about 100 yards 
from legislative chambers to a highway overpass to watch the column 
rumble through the city at 4 am 
this is absurd armored vehicles dont usually drive through 
the middle of town in the middle of the night lithuanian prime 
minister kazimeira prunskeine told reporters at the legislature 
were not afraid but we dont know what they want and we 
dont know what they will do in the next few hours she said 
the convoy moved along the main highway through the heart of 
vilnius in the early morning darkness without stopping 
a spokesman for the lithuanian parliament said he had seen the 
convoy pull into a military base at siaures miestelis on the north 
side of the capital 
audris butkavicius a lithuanian deputy who said he talked to 
some of the soldiers said they told him there were about 1000 
paratroopers in the column 
there were at least 22 tanks and armored personnel carriers and 
dozens of green military trucks the parliaments information 
deparment quoting witnesses said there were 59 tanks and 50 other 
vehicles 
deputies who were still meeting in the supreme council 
legislature to finish forming their independent government said 
they had not been notified in advance of the convoys movement 
after deputies checked out the columns movement they broke up and 
began to go home 
gorbachev and his advisers have pledged not to use force to halt 
lithuanias formation of an independent government but lithuanians 
are concerned the soviet military will forcibly try to detain 
soldiers who deserted and returned to their native land after the 
declaration of independence saturday was the deadline for them to 
return to their units 
a top military adviser to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev indicated friday the military would 
try to round up the deserters even if some people dont like 
it 
gorbachev also told the republics president vytautus 
landsbergis on thursday that lithuania should stop signing up 
volunteer forces and sought a response from the lithuanian leader 
within two days 
landsbergis in an early morning telegram to moscow said the 
volunteers would not replace soviet kgb border guards and uniformed 
police as gorbachev suggested the lithuanians would 
speaking about saturdays maneuvers landsbergis said tension 
is rising with this demonstration of military force with this 
frightening of people with soviet soldiers 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
friday afternoon the situation appears to progressively get 
worse 
the republic is working to restore the independence lost to 
stalins army in 1940 
us officials said the soviet union had ordered two american 
consular officers out of lithuania giving them 12 hours to leave 
us officials said other foreign diplomats and some journalists 
also had been told to leave the lithuanian capital 
the diplomats leningradbased consuls douglas wake and jon 
purnell said friday night in vilnius that they had heard nothing 
about the order for them to leave 
while fitzwater said the diplomats will comply he said the 
united states was not given a reason by moscow for the 
expulsion he said the soviet chief of protocol relayed the 
expulsion notice to officials at the us embassy in moscow 
he said the two officials were in vilnius on routine reporting 
and analysis as they do for the embassy 
they are staff people in our consulate in leningrad he 
said theyre not spies 
wake the us diplomat said us officials regularly traveled 
to lithuania in the course of their consular work but declined to 
comment further on his mission there 
later friday fitzwater said it was unclear what specific 
actions have been taken against journalists but we are opposed to 
any infringements on freedom of the press 
soviet officials on friday continued to increase their pressure 
on lithuania to renounce its declaration of independence from the 
soviet union 
the soviet union informed poland it was suspending visafree 
travel for poles and lithuanians across the border the official 
tass news agency said 
a military helicopter with a soviet red star emblazoned on its 
side dumped leaflets on downtown vilnius containing a copy of 
gorbachevs directive that the republic of 38 million respect 
soviet law 
foreign ministry officials said soviet embassies would review 
foreigners visa applications to travel to lithuania to keep out 
people inclined to engage in illegal activities tass said it 
did not elaborate 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania latvia and estonia 
a halfcentury ago as part of an agreement between josef stalin and 
adolf hitler 
president bush said friday that any attempt by the soviets to 
intimidate lithuania or to use force is bound to backfire that 
is inevitable 
lithuania issued an appeal to the world for support late 
thursday

a federal agency overseeing part of the 
savings and loan bailout last year awarded a 49000 nobid 
contract to an attorney who had pressed regulators not to seize the 
california thrift that later suffered a 2 billion failure 
margery waxman was awarded the fivemonth contract by mary k 
bush the acting director of the federal housing finance board one 
of several agencies established under the sampl bailout plan to 
regulate the nations 12 regional federal home loan banks 
the finance board replaced the federal home loan bank board in 
1988 waxman represented the lincoln savings and loan when the bank 
boards san francisco office was urging its washington headquarters 
to seize the thrift 
in a may 1988 letter to lincolns owner charles keating waxman 
said she had lobbied board officials and told keating you have 
the board right where you want them 
waxman worked with ms bush in the early 1980s at the treasury 
department the waxman contract was one of three ms bush awarded 
last year without competition to longtime friends 
the housing board is overseen by the department of housing and 
urban development and its chairman is hud secretary jack kemp hud 
officials said friday that kemp met with ms bush this week and 
told her he was cutting her powers and assuming final authority for 
all agency contract awards 
a 37000 nobid consulting contracts went to wendell w gunn 
who was kemps chief of staff for several months last year the 
third was a 100000 contract with an atlanta management consulting 
firm whose partners include kevin coyne also a former colleague of 
ms bushs at the treasury department work on all three has been 
completed 
a spokesman for ms bush said she awarded the contracts because 
she knew the recipients had the expertise to help the agency the 
contracts were not put out for bid because the housing finance 
board receives no tax dollars and so is not subject to competitive 
procurement guidelines 
kemps top deputy hud undersecretary alfred dellibovi said 
friday that kemp was not aware of the contracts until this week 
dellibovi said kemp knew gunn was advising ms bush but did not 
know he was being paid and would not have approved of such an 
arrangement because of gunns past work at hud 
dellibovi said kemp continues to support ms bush whose 
expected appointment as chairwoman has not been announced by the 
white house some seven months after the agency was created 
the name of waxman of the washington office of the law firm 
sidley amp austin surfaced in connection with the lincoln case last 
week when house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez dtexas 
released her letter to keating and said it suggested a fix was 
in at the bank board 
in the letter waxman told keating she successfully lobbied m 
danny wall then the director of the nowdefunct board 
as you know i have put pressure on wall to work toward 
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff waxman 
wrote 
ten days later despite recommendations from its san francisco 
office the bank board declined to take action against the thrift 
and took the unusual step of shifting oversight responsibilities 
from san francisco to washington 
wall last week denied being pressured by waxman and her law firm 
denied any impropriety 
keating has gained notoriety because of his large contributions 
to five senators who intervened with regulators on his behalf

the bush administration has its first payoff 
after 10 months of pressuring the japanese to buy more american 
products but members of congress are warning much more needs to be 
done 
the administration announced friday an agreement designed to 
boost sales of usmanufactured supercomputers in japan by 
removing some restrictions imposed by the japanese government 
the agreement which is expected to be formally signed in april 
should open a 130 millionmarket for supercomputers purchased by 
japanese universities and other government agencies 
the breakthrough came late thursday night following two days of 
intensive negotiations us trade representative carla hills said 
the new pact should give us full and effective access to the 
japanese government market 
it marked the first success for the administration since it put 
japan on a hit list last april of countries accused of erecting 
unfair barriers to sales of american goods 
treasury secretary nicholas brady in los angeles for talks 
friday with japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said that 
with the agreement were showing that we can make some 
progress 
supercomputers were among three product areas singled out for 
negotiations little progress has been reported so far in talks on 
americanmade satellites and wood products 
are supercomputer concessions all we want brady said 
no are we going to get more yes when i cant say i hope 
soon 
the japanese are facing a june 19 deadline to show a willingness 
to open their markets or face possible us retaliation in 
increased tariffs on japanese products sold in america 
members of congress have been pushing the administration to take 
a tougher line in the trade negotiations with tokyo pointing to 
the 49 billion deficit the united states is running with japan 
that is close to half the total us trade deficit last year 
sen john danforth rmo said the supercomputer agreement was 
encouraging but would have to be followed by increased sales 
japan must recognize that promises without performance are 
simply unacceptable danforth said 
sen max baucus dmont noted a 1987 agreement by the japanese 
to buy more american supercomputers had not produced results he 
said us negotiators shouldnt declare victory too soon 
nonetheless progress is always encouraging i hope this is a 
sign that the united states and japan can jointly work out their 
trade frictions said baucus who is chairman of the senate 
finance trade subcommittee 
in addition to the product talks the administration is 
conducting separate discussions on broader structural impediments 
to trade such as exclusionary japanese business practices 
brady met with hashimoto as a followup to trade discussions 
held by president bush and japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
a us trade official briefing reporters in washington on 
friday said the japanese showed new urgency in the latest round of 
computer talks apparently reflecting the impact of the bushkaifu 
meeting 
their negotiators came with instructions to make a deal 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity we hope 
the japanese will perceive the same kind of guidance in the other 
issues 
negotiators handling the structural impediments talks met at a 
remote hideaway in the virginia countryside earlier this week in 
advance of more formal discussions in washington april 23 
however us officials said the discussions near warrenton va 
failed to make any progress 
there have been reports from tokyo that kaifu is preparing trade 
concessions in these areas in hopes of dampening growing 
protectionist sentiment in congress 
under the computer agreement announced friday the japanese 
promised to open the procurement process for supercomputers to 
foreign firms and to base government purchase decisions on quality 
as well as price

commandant paul yost defended the coast 
guards method of tracking vessels through prince william sound 
instead blaming human error for the exxon valdez oil spill a year 
ago today 
nevertheless the coast guard will install a new radar system 
better able to track tankers especially in bad weather yost said 
friday 
the system was never designed to track tankers outside the 
valdez arm yost said bligh reef where the exxon valdez 
grounded is near the end of the arm 
the new radar system probably will cover bligh reef although 
the area never has been considered difficult to navigate yost said 
yosts comments came the day exxon valdez skipper joseph 
hazelwood was sentenced to spend 1000 hours helping clean beaches 
fouled by the spill march 24 1989 and to pay 50000 restitution 
the coast guard plans hearings to determine if hazelwoods 
maritime masters license should be revoked yost told a news 
conference 
exxon fired the captain shortly after the accident his future 
also is clouded by more than 100 lawsuits filed by assorted victims 
of the spill the nations worst 
the spill poured nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude into 
the pristine sound killing countless birds fish and other animals 
hazelwood was convicted of the misdemeanor charge of negligent 
discharge of oil he was acquitted of two other misdemeanors 
operating a vessel while intoxicated and reckless endangerment and 
a felony criminal mischief 
yost appeared to partially absolve hazelwood of responsibility 
noting he wasnt on the bridge at the time of the accident 
a fully qualified third mate ran the vessel aground he said 
it was clear from the trial and from other evidence that human 
error caused the grounding yost said no matter what technological 
changes are introduced or what laws are enacted the coast guard 
cannot guarantee against similar groundings he said 
weve got to be very careful we dont have a spasm response 
to the spill he said

in a quiet corner of chicagos southwest side 
world politics have taken center stage 
tens of thousands of lithuanianamericans live here and on 
friday many made phone calls wrote letters and sent telegrams 
urging the bush administration to take a stronger stand in support 
of lithuanias independence from the soviet union 
lithuanianamericans in other cities also were collecting 
donations to send to their relatives and friends and prepared for a 
lithuanian independence rally today near the lincoln memorial in 
washington 
at nidas delicatessan and restaurant in chicago the bush 
administrations stand was virtually the only topic of conversation 
everybodys talking about it said owner liutas mockunas 
everybody is listening to the news people are disappointed by 
president bushs policy theyre really upset 
are we going to have to see massacres like chinas tiananmen 
square to get the bush administration to wake up asked daiva 
meile spokeswoman for the lithuanian american council in chicago 
everyone is extremely upset that bush has not come out forcefully 
for lithuanian independence 
early today the soviet union apparently stepped up pressure 
against the breakaway republic as an armored column of almost 100 
military vehicles rolled through the center of vilnius the 
lithuanian capital on friday the kremlin ordered foreign 
diplomats and some journalists to leave lithuania as tensions 
mounted in the baltic republic officials of the bush 
administration said 
in one of his strongest statements on the issue to date bush on 
friday warned the soviets against military intervention saying the 
united states backs the lithuanian peoples right to 
selfdetermination 
but lithuanianamericans said the administration has fallen 
short in supporting lithuania since it declared its independence 
from the soviet union on march 11 
we are concerned about president bushs lackadaisical 
attitude said fran salutas cohost of lithuanianamerican 
radio a show broadcast from chicago each saturday and monitored 
closely by the citys large and tightknit lithuanian community 
we need moral and political support from the united states

to work in the burgeoning textile mills of lawrence and lowell 
have maintained close ties to their heritage cepas said 
we dont see a silver lining right now and thats kind of 
scary he said

letterwriting campaign to fuel us support for the independence 
movement 
activist antanas mazeika said many of californias more than 
50000 lithuanianamericans were calling the white house opinion

politicians

the first time this nation took its own 
measure there were fewer than 4 million americans most living on 
farms or in small towns 
its a far different mix of a quarterbillion people scattered 
from maine to hawaii that are being counted in the upcoming 21st 
census 
americans began getting their census forms on friday the census 
bureau said as the first of an estimated 95 million forms began 
arriving in mailboxes across the nation the postal service says 
all the forms should be delivered by next tuesday 
the changes in family and lifestyle population size location 
and employment have been charted every decade by the census 
indeed the us national head count is one of the longest regular 
series of such efforts in any country 
yet the concept of taking a census is ancient dating back at 
least to biblical times when the roman census brought joseph and 
mary to bethlehem 
unlike mary and joseph americans dont have to go to the 
census it will come to them mostly through the mail 
census takers will travel only to those places where address 
lists couldnt be obtained or where people dont mail back their 
forms 
delivering the forms and bringing them back will cost the census 
bureau nearly 44 million in postage the postal service reports 
president george washington was in his first term when federal 
marshals went out in the summer of 1790 to take the first national 
head count secretary of state thomas jefferson was in charge 
completed in 1792 that census reported there were 3929214 
americans 
this years census is scheduled for april 1 with a report due to 
the president on dec 31 analysis of all the 1990 data will go on 
for years 
census takers traveled by foot boat stagecoach and horseback 
in 1790 those were about the only choices 
horses are still used to reach some indian reservations 
census takers in 1790 asked only a few questions and then posted 
lists of their findings in public places people who had been 
missed were expected to add themselves to those lists 
there are long and short forms today which ask dozens of 
questions too many some contend though government officials say 
they need the data to set policy and operate social programs 
information provided is kept confidential now and census takers 
can go to jail if they reveal information about any individual 
that first census found 45 persons per square mile and rhode 
island was the most crowded state at 634 per square mile 
the whole nation in 1987 had 688 per square mile and new jersey 
was the most crowded that year with 10273 people per square mile 
there were five big cities in 1790 five that is that had at 
least 8000 people new york boston philadelphia baltimore and 
charleston sc 
the population was 803 percent white and 197 percent black in 
1790 by 1988 it was 843 percent white 123 percent black and 33 
percent other races 
americans will also have more ways to find out about the results 
of the census there were 103 newspapers and periodicals in the 
country in 1790 as of 1987 the nation included 1645 daily papers 
and 11566 magazines

be back in nicaragua by april 20 five days before mrs chamorros 
prous government is inaugurated the contras said another 4000 
fighters in nicaragua would move into security zones 
the accord was announced in tegucigalpa by obando y bravo the 
roman catholic archbishop of managua 
a communique issued at the end of the sevenhour talks said the 
usbacked contras were ready to disband because the feb 25 
general elections had established a process of democratization 
in nicaragua 
ortega mrs chamorro and president bush who has asked congress 
for a 300 million aid package that includes 45 million for 
demobilization have all called upon the rebels to disband 
the agreement to dismantle the contras appears to remove the 
biggest stumbling block to the transfer of power 
the outgoing sandinista government had said they could not 
relinquish control of the armed forces as long as the contras 
refused to demobilize the senior contra military commander israel 
galeano had said the rebels wouldnt put down their guns as long 
as the sandinistas kept theirs 
ortega was at the airport to greet the cardinal and mrs 
chamorros negotiators when they returned to managua friday night 
from the honduran capital 
i am going to give instructions immediately to the foreign 
ministry and the defense ministry to take steps to apply the letter 
of this accord he told a news conference it is possible that 
there wont be a single armed contra in nicaragua on april 25th 
but ortega also said he was concerned that galeano had not 
signed the accord 
we hope that this accord will be accepted and respected by all 
members of the contra who are in nicaraguan territory and that we 
can save the nicaraguan people from a bloodbath he said 
antonio lacayo one of mrs chamorros negotiators said it is 
up to the contras to make sure galeano respects the accord 
ortega said there were between 4000 and 6000 contra rebels 
inside nicaragua preparing for a major military offensive for the 
days prior to the inauguration the demobilization accord should 
put an end to any plans for an offensive he said 
the head of the contra negotiating team said 12000 rebels 
living in base camps in yamales honduras along with 42000 
relatives would be home by april 20 
the nicaraguan resistance begins its return to nicaragua 
today rebel negotiator oscar sovalbarro said the process 
will culminate on april 20 with the goal of reincorporating its 
members into the civilian society 
another 4000 contras in nicaragua would move into security 
zones supervised by obando y bravo and the united nations which 
has observer and demobilization missions in the region he said 
the agreement calls for an immediate ceasefire to be monitored 
by the united nations and obando y bravo who said the sandinistas 
should cease attacks on the rebels as a gesture of good faith 
toward the pact 
we trust in obando y bravos moral force sovalbarro said 
mrs chamorros team promised pensions for contra widows and 
orphans and to wounded rebel veterans in recognition of their 
patriotic labors 
the chamorro delegation also agreed to set up a commission 
including representatives of the new government and of the contras 
to monitor demobilization 
the commission and humanitarian aid for the rebels and their 
families were conditions the contras set for demobilization at the 
outset of fridays talks 
the rebels went into the talks with a long list of demands 
including several such as the demobilization of the sandinista 
army that would have required the agreement of the sandinistas 
the sandinistas were not represented at the talks 
ortega agreed to the feb 25 elections which were monitored by 
several thousand international observers as part of a central 
america accord on demobilizing the contras 
within hours of her upset victory mrs chamorro had called upon 
the rebels to disband saying the democracy they had been fighting 
for had arrived in nicaragua and there was no longer any reason to 
fight

president bushs savings and loan bailout has 
a reprieve from legal disarray at least until a federal appeals 
court can review a lower court ruling that thrift regulators were 
appointed unconstitutionally 
us district judge royce c lamberth on wednesday barred the 
treasury departments office of thrift supervision from seizing 
olympic savings and loan association of berwyn ill 
but on friday the us court of appeals for the district of 
columbia circuit lifted the order it said regulators could take 
control of the sampl but forbade them from liquidating the thrift 
and selling its 11 billion in assets 
lamberth had ruled that acting thrift office director salvatore 
r martoche and his predecessor m danny wall had no authority to 
order the takeover because they were not nominated by the president 
and confirmed by the senate 
the appeals court made no decision on the merits of lamberths 
reading of the constitution but it said barring a takeover of 
olympic could hurt the public 
while olympic may have a strong likelihood of success on the 
merits of its case the harm to the public outweighs the harm to 
olympic in this instance the appeals court wrote 
government attorneys had argued lamberths injunction could cost 
taxpayers millions of dollars by encouraging a flood of similar 
suits from other weak thrifts 
in a reply attorneys for olympic said allowing regulators to 
seize the thrift would make its suit pointless 
olympic will clearly suffer irreparable injury they wrote 
the appellate court gave the two sides deadlines for filing 
written arguments and scheduled a hearing before a threejudge 
panel on april 11 
meanwhile bush is moving on another front to blunt the effect 
of the suit by nominating a former top labor department attorney 
t timothy ryan jr to a fiveyear term as director of the thrift 
office the senate banking committee could hold a confirmation 
hearing on ryan as soon as next week

president bush says he opposes government 
censorship even though he is offended by some of the 
sacrilegious blasphemous depictions that are portrayed by some to 
be art 
i am deeply offended by some of the filth that i see and to 
which federal money has gone bush told a luncheon of regional 
news editors at the white house on friday 
he made the comment in response to a question about his 
administrations opposition to restricting national endowment for 
the arts funds for controversial art 
congressional conservatives have criticized that position which 
was outlined by nea chairman john frohnmayer this week at a 
congressional hearing the critics contending his administration 
is flouting a congressional ban against funding obscene art for 
this fiscal year have proposed tighter constraints on art funding 
however frohnmayer said the white house opposes extending the 
restrictions to the next fiscal year bush said friday he wants the 
matter handled administratively by frohnmayer rather than by new 
legislative standards 
i am against censorship but i will try to convince those who 
feel differently in terms of legislation that we will do everything 
in our power to stop pure blasphemy bush said 
still he contended he did not want to risk censorship or 
getting the federal government into telling every artist what he or 
she can paint 
bush said he was thinking of two examples of blasphemous 
material that has no business getting one cent of the taxpayers 
money he said he did not want to say what they were 
at the questionandanswer session bush also 
indicated he would back moving the shipping lanes away from 
california shores to help guard against oil tankers fouling 
beaches but said he wouldnt support banning the tankers from the 
coast 
renewed his plea to congress for passage of his embattled 800 
million aid package for panama and nicaragua 
said its not time to change policy on sanctions against 
south africa i want to see more progress from south african 
president fw de klerk he said adding however that he also does 
not believe the economic sanctions against pretoria should be 
increased 
said his administration would rejoice in being able to help a 
democratically elected government in cuba but there is none on 
the horizon president fidel castro he said is swimming against 
the tide of democracy in the world 
spoke against making the district of columbia a state this 
is a federal city and my view is it should remain that he said

portauprince haiti ap gangsters and soldiers fatally shot 
14 members of civilian defense groups and angry mobs captured and 
killed three thugs in a wave of attacks that has followed haitis 
return to civilian rule 
the state hospital said it treated at least 20 people for 
gunshot and machete wounds and sporadic gunfire was heard friday 
in most parts of the capital 
at least 40 people have been killed since sunday in nightly 
shootings widely blamed on gangsters and those still loyal to 
ousted leaders lt gen prosper avril and jeanclaude duvalier 
according to radio reports friday 
avril resigned march 10 following a week of nationwide 
demonstrations against his military government three days later a 
provisional government led by ertha pascaltrouillot took office 
and the army pledged to support her mrs pascaltrouillot a 
supreme court justice is to pave the way for elections in three to 
six months 
the unity assembly a coalition of civic and political leaders 
that helped negotiate avrils departure attributed the violence to 
rightist thugs angered by the shift in power from the military to 
civilians 
after this night of intimidation the army high command owes 
the people an explanation said centerleftist politician dejean 
belizaire a member of the coalition 
the coalition urged residents to form the civilian defense 
groups known as vigilance brigades to compensate for a dearth 
of police protection 
the army had tolerated the civilian patrols but on thursday a 
communique read by radio stations said because of the widespread 
violence the high command was urging civilians to disband the 
neighborhood groups to not interfere with the work of soldiers 
the army alone has the responsibility of maintaining order 
the communique said 
before dawn soldiers attacked a neighborhood selfdefense group 
in the st joseph slum killing three members shortly after 
midnight soldiers killed two others in separate incidents 
according to radio metropole and radio haiti inter 
gunmen killed two other civilian defense group members radio 
metropole said 
a wounded youth speaking on the roman catholic churchs radio 
soleil said a truckload of soldiers opened fire on neighborhood 
selfdefense youths in the la saline slum killing seven he said 
soldiers removed the bodies and warned him and several others 
wounded in the shooting to keep quiet 
radio reports said angry residents killed three thugs 
apparently former members of the tonton macoutes the feared secret 
police who served under the brutal 29year duvalier family 
dictatorship 
most of the macoutes sought obscurity after duvalier fled to 
exile in france in 1986 but hundreds linked up with the army and 
police and are believed responsible for much of the violence 
plaguing haiti a caribbean nation of 51 million people and the 
poorest country in the western hemisphere 
the involvement of soldiers in attacks this week appears to 
indicate some soldiers remain loyal to avril despite their pledge 
to the new civilian administration 
belizaire said however that paramilitary gunmen may be 
disguising themselves as soldiers and said some selfdefense 
groups have been infiltrated by thugs 
many members of the 1100man presidential guard supposedly 
confined to quarters since avril was ousted are believed to remain 
hostile to the shift in power to avrils former enemies mrs 
pascaltrouillot governs with a 19member state council composed 
of prominent civilians some of them persecuted by avril during his 
18month tenure 
jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile following a popular uprising 
in february 1986 he was replaced by lt gen henri namphy who was 
ousted by avril in 1988

the united states is protesting the ouster of 
us diplomats from lithuania and president bush is cautioning the 
soviets that force against the secessionists would be bound to 
backfire 
the protests were delivered friday in washington and in moscow 
after two american consular officials were given 12 hours to leave 
vilnius the capital of the breakaway baltic republic 
the soviet foreign ministry gave no explanation in telephoning 
the order to the us embassy in moscow us officials said 
the two americans douglas wake and jon purnell had gone to 
vilnius from leningrad to assess the standoff between local 
authorities demanding national recognition and soviets determined 
to hold the ussr together 
other foreign diplomats were ordered to leave along with a 
number of journalists according to the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the actions could reduce the information reaching the outside 
world about the independence movement in lithuania and the soviet 
effort to maintain authority there 
there was no immediate word of us retaliation and even with 
the protests the administration again sought to minimize tensions 
its not being treated in a crisislike way from our 
standpoint white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he again 
appealed for a peaceful settlement said us options were limited 
and that the administration wanted to keep the rhetoric down 
bush declared on friday that the united states stands with the 
brave men and women of lithuania in their struggle for 
independence 
and he said any attempt to coerce or intimidate or forcibly 
intervene against the lithuanian people is bound to backfire that 
is inevitable 
the president did not threaten any us response however 
fitzwater meanwhile said the situation appears to 
progressively get worse 
tass the soviet news agency said the situation in vilnius was 
approaching anarchy in all its manifestations 
meanwhile soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin said after a 
meeting with deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger that he 
had no information from moscow about the expulsions 
richard boucher a state department spokesman said they had 
discussed lithuania and soviet emigration 
earlier bush said at a luncheon meeting with visiting media 
representatives we know that the soviet union has a longstanding 
interest in lithuania but those interests can only be addressed 
through dialogue and negotiation 
we want to see the people of lithuania make their independent 
determination on what their future is going to be and not the 
soviet union vice president dan quayle said from scottsdale 
ariz 
let is hope and let us pray that it is resolved without 
violence and that the people of lithuania can go free he said

astronaut william fisher says he is confident 
nasa will find ways to cut down on the number and length of space 
walks the proposed space station will need to keep it running 
this is an engineering problem said fisher engineering 
is what nasa does better than anything in the world 
fisher and nasa engineer charles r price head a space agency 
committee that recently said the station will need impossibly large 
amounts of maintenance they stuck to their estimate after meeting 
with nasa executives friday but said its only our preliminary 
first cut at this data 
fisher a physician and price said in their study that the 
station as now conceived would require 2284 hours of 
maintenance each year by astronauts working in the harsh 
environment of open space 
after the new york times published those findings on monday 
congressional space committees expressed their concerns and three 
of them will hold hearings next week 
no i havent changed my mind no i havent been pressured 
fisher told reporters after fridays review but he said the 
numbers were obtained by asking all nasa space station contractors 
to total the amount of time they think it will take astronauts to 
fix what breaks 
the number we have come up with in our preliminary first cut 
at this data is 2284 hours in eva time fisher said eva for 
extravehicular activity is nasas term for space walks fisher 
said thats 32 percent higher than estimated in a similar study 
last october 
he said that would require an average of 37 space walks a week 
william b lenoir nasas space flight boss who conducted fridays 
review told reporters he would prefer no more than one space walk a 
month 
i do think theres room for it to go down fisher said 
its our hope we can drive it down significantly the function of 
the next four months is to take piecebypiece the components of 
this number and see how much of its real and to see how much we can 
cut down on it 
the space station expected to cost more than 30 billion by the 
time its completed and manned in 1999 is undergoing final design 
reviews now with the first construction trips into orbit scheduled 
for 1995 fisher and price said their study initiated by nasa is 
part of those reviews

a democratic study says defense secretary dick 
cheneys proposal to close military bases as a costsaving measure 
is an attempt to divert attention from an inflated defense budget 
the report released friday criticized the bush administration 
for its 307 billion fiscal 1991 defense budget that increases 
spending over last year including money for strategic weapons such 
as the b2 stealth bomber 
in the face of dramatic changes in the external threat faced 
by the united states the president has proposed nominal growth in 
defense spending for not only the coming year but for the 
foreseeable future the democratic study group said in its report 
the pentagon has argued that the budget fails to keep pace with 
the 21 percent increase in inflation 
the study faults cheney for requesting new legislation to close 
military facilities thus ending the congressional oversight of 
pentagon decisions on the bases and bypassing the recent process in 
which an independent commission recommended which bases to close 
complicating matters was cheneys january announcement of the 
candidates for closure or realignment before the department had 
completed its review the study said 
the administrations alternative process involves listing 
bases being considered for closing long before final decisions 
are made thereby creating maximum opportunity for fullblown 
lobbying campaigns against possible cutbacks the study said 
cheneys recommendations called for closing or scaling back more 
than 72 domestic facilities and 14 overseas installations members 
of congress including rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee have criticized cheneys list as 
partisan 
the defense secretary has declined to give exact figures on the 
savings from the base closings 
the study the great base closing ploy creating a political 
tempest to shield a bloated defense budget said that 19 of 21 
proposed base closings are in democratic districts 
of the 41638 civilian jobs affected by the closings 41139 
or 99 percent were in democratic districts the report said 
the pentagon in response to the partisan charge noted that 
democrats are the majority party in the house

new regulations proposed by the department of 
health and human services would put the burden on states to ensure 
that the mentally ill and mentally retarded get appropriate care in 
nursing homes 
the proposal friday would put into effect a law passed by 
congress in 1987 requiring states to set up programs to screen 
nursing home applicants and find more appropriate placements for 
mentally ill and mentally retarded applicants who do not need 
nursing facility care 
another proposed regulation would require nursing homes to meet 
new training and competency standards for nurse aides 
the screening requirement took effect jan 1 1989 although no 
regulations were in place the health care financing administration 
notified state medicaid directors at the time that compliance was 
required and provided preliminary guidance to the states 
failure of a nursing home to meet the terms of the screening 
requirement could result in its termination from the medicaid 
program 
the proposed rule outlines the specific details of the 
preadmission screening programs and requires an annual review of 
current nursing home residents with mental illness and retardation

100 million was squandered building forprofit hospitals with 
swimming pools and tennis courts a consumer group charges 
half of 575 community mental health centers funded under the 
program are violating federal regulations that require them to be 
nonprofit to provide certain essential services and to make some 
services available to the poor public citizen health research 
group said friday 
one of the most visible consequences of the failed program has 
been a significant increase in the number of seriously mentally ill

of violations 
weiss called for a general accounting office investigation to

joseph hazelwoods attorney accused the 
judge of hazelwood bashing in ordering the exxon valdezs 
exskipper to pay 50000 and help clean beaches fouled when his 
tanker hit a reef a year ago today 
hazelwoods lawyers said the 1000 hours of community service 
ordered friday by superior court judge karl johnstone are excessive 
and the amount in restitution is illegal and arbitrary punishment 
for a single misdemeanor conviction for negligence 
defense attorney thomas russo accused johnstone of playing to 
the media and trying to override the jurys verdict thursday that 
absolved hazelwood of more serious intoxication and recklessness 
charges 
during sentencing the judge denounced hazelwood for drinking 
before his ship sailed and for being off the bridge when it went 
aground and caused the nations worst oil spill 
this is another instance of hazelwood bashing russo said 
and in light of the jury verdict this type of demagoguery should 
stop 
he said 90 percent of johnstones comments were directed at 
issues that the jury had already decided he said if blame is to be 
leveled people should begin looking at the coast guard oil 
companies and the state itself 
the judges speech which in my mind was designed for the 
media was out of step with reality he said to continue this 
notion that captain hazelwood bears all the responsibility for what 
happened in prince william sound is ridiculous its got to end 
as he imposed the sentence johnstone said this isnt a 
runofthemill misdemeanor 
the judge said he wanted to quell public outrage something 
hazelwood attorney michael chalos said he had seen little of 
whatever outrage ive seen was directed at larger entities 
chalos said 
the judges sentence also met with the disapproval of the jury 
forewoman lori wing who was in the courtroom with four other 
jurors 
i had high hopes he would walk out of here a free man and get 
on with his life she said 
johnstone sounding angry said he had hoped the 43yearold 
skipper would make a public apology but lawyers said they advised 
hazelwood of huntington ny to stay silent because of more than 
100 civil lawsuits still facing him 
johnstone also imposed the maximum 90 days in jail and 1000 
fine but suspended that sentence he suggested that imprisoning 
hazelwood would not restore the environment but having him clean 
beaches might help 
i think captain hazelwood has been deterred he said in 
shunning jail time its very unlikely he would be given the 
opportunity to operate another tanker he has suffered shame 
but there is community outrage and something has to be done to 
provide condemnation and reaffirmation im sure deep down he is 
very shameful 
hazelwoods attorneys said they thought the sentence would be 
overturned on appeal in part because the order to pay restitution 
to the state was illegal 
dick madson another lawyer for hazelwood said that in almost 
any crime a judge can assess an amount that goes to the victim but 
it partially must be based on the defendants financial status 
defense attorneys said johnstone chose an arbitrary figure without 
measuring hazelwoods ability to pay 
a 12member jury found hazelwood guilty thursday of a 
misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil but he was 
acquitted of three more serious charges including a felony that 
he was reckless and drunk during the disaster that blackened the 
rocky shoreline of prince william sound 
hazelwood faced a maximum 7 years and 61000 fine on all four 
charges 
the judge acknowledged that pending litigation might delay 
hazelwoods arrival at prince william sound but he said if the 
cleanup there is finished by the time appeals are resolved then 
hazelwood could do other environmental work 
the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker ran aground on march 24 
1989 and gushed nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the pristine 
sound it killed countless birds fish and wildlife in the scenic 
area

some nuclear waste storage tanks at the 
hanford nuclear reservation could explode and spew radiation into 
the air because of hydrogen gas building up inside them a new 
federal study says 
experts dont fully understand the danger but dont believe an 
explosion is imminent a department of energy official said in 
announcing the study results friday 
gas buildup in the tanks which hold waste from the processing 
of plutonium for nuclear weapons was first noticed in 1977 
the worst case is any explosion that could cause the dome to 
collapse and send the contents up to the air hanford manager 
mike lawrence said i cant sit here and say its not going to 
happen 
department officials think the danger of explosion is low and 
the potential for release of radioactive material even lower 
lawrence said thats because the tanks are made of 1footthick 
steelreinforced concrete and are buried as much as 8 feet deep 
hydrogen is accumulating in 20 of hanfords 169 storage tanks 
lawrence said 
the gas is formed by the breakdown of organic material added to 
the tanks in the 1970sin an effort to recover radioactive 
strontium lawrence said 
weve taken every precaution we can think of but i cant give 
you an absolute guarantee lawrence said this is something 
where we dont fully understand what is going on 
no storage tank at hanford has ever exploded but a blast that 
spread radioactivity over a wide area in the soviet union in 1957 
is believed to have been in a waste storage tank 
a 1989 report by the soviet news agency tass said 10000 people 
were evacuated after a 1957 explosion the cia has said deaths were 
in the hundreds and analysts note that 30 central soviet villages 
disappeared from maps after the disaster 
the 560acre hanford reservation in southeast washington dates 
back to the manhattan project of the 1940s that produced the first 
atomic bomb while plutonium processing continues there much of 
the work involves cleaning up waste produced over the last five 
decades 
the danger came to light in a study by westinghouse hanford co 
the main energy department contractor at hanford the study was 
prompted by concerns raised in congress late last year about the 
possibility of ferrocyanide exploding in the tanks 
although the ferrocyanide threat was ultimately found to be low 
scientists discovered the hydrogen was a greater danger than had 
been previously thought lawrence said 
scientists hope to produce a plan for dealing with the problem 
by june 
meanwhile precautions are being taken with the one tank in 
which the problem is worst all transfers of waste in or out of the 
tank have been stopped and care is taken to avoid generating heat 
or sparks nearby 
that tank is one of hanfords 20 newer doublewalled storage 
tanks and holds 1 million gallons of radioactive waste the waste 
level has risen and fallen by as much as 33 inches because of 
hydrogen gas buildup lawrence said 
hydrogen concentration in the tank has been measured at up to 5 
percent at an exhaust vent and may have been higher down near the 
source a 5 percent hydrogen buildup is considered potentially 
flammable and an 18 percent buildup is considered potentially 
explosive lawrence said 
the waste rise was first noticed in 1977 and scientists since 
1984 have tried various methods to reduce the gas including 
injecting water into the waste slurry and lancing the surface crust 
with pipes to relieve pressure those measures failed lawrence 
said 
lesser hydrogen buildup also has been spotted in four other 
doubleshell tanks and in 15 of the reservations 149 older 
singlewalled storage tanks lawrence said

streets of bogota shattering windows and burning buses to protest 
what they said was government involvement 
jaramillo was the 1044th patriotic union member to be killed in

rightwing death squads the patriotic union has claimed colombias 
army and police are involved in the death squads to quell a leftist 
insurgency 
jaramillo was the second presidential candidate slain in recent 
months 
the capital was quiet friday but armored cars with 20mm cannons 
and jeeps mounted with machine guns cruised the city of 6 million 
people the government banned alcohol sales and closed all private 
schools in bogota 
the president of the patriotic union diego montana said in a 
televised interview friday his party was withdrawing from the 
presidential elections 
the patriotic union conservative and communist parties all 
asked the governing liberal party of president virgilio barco to 
postpone the may 27 elections saying they feared for the safety of 
their candidates 
shortly after jaramillos slaying a telephone caller who 
claimed the assassination for the medellin cocaine cartel said drug 
traffickers were renewing their war with the government the caller 
also said cesar gaviria the liberal party candidate would be the 
next victim 
on jan 18 traffickers declared a unilateral ceasefire in a 
5monthold war with the government they appealed for the 
government to stop extraditing suspects to the united states

colombia traffickers often intimidate or bribe judges to ensure 
light or no sentences 
the protests in bogota began when jaramillo was slain at 
bogotas international airport thursday a 16yearold youth who

refinery workers of the state oil company ecopetrol reacted to the 
assassination by staging a 48hour walkout another 48hour strike 
was declared in the northwestern region of uraba where jaramillo 
began his political career 
on friday escobar sent a letter to colombian news media denying 
his complicity he suggested other drug traffickers were to blame 
according to the colombian radio networks rcn and caracol 
but on friday the national security council reiterated that 
escobar head of the medellin cartel ordered jaramillos 
assassination a communique from the council said security forces 
monitored a telephone call in which escobar ordered the 
assassination 
the unidentified youth captured after jaramillos slaying said 
he was hired in medellin to kill the candidate but investigators 
said he would not say who hired him

a complicated legislative compromise to put abortion before 
maryland voters apparently has been derailed and a federal judge 
on guam temporarily blocked the us island territorys new 
abortion law the nations strictest 
either the guam law or a less stringent measure awaiting the 
governors signature in idaho could be the vehicle to challenge the 
us supreme courts landmark 1973 roe vs wade decision that 
legalized abortion 
the maryland measure which emerged from the state senate after 
an eightday filibuster by antiabortion forces was rejected 
friday by a house of delegates committee 
the unusual arrangement would have required the legislature to 
pass two measures one permitting unrestricted access to abortions 
during the early stages of pregnancy the other restricting 
abortion to cases of rape incest or dire threat to the mother in 
essence the voters through referendum would have decided between 
the two measures 
legislators who advocate abortion rights generally opposed the 
compromise while antiabortion lawmakers favored putting the issue 
before the electorate 
we think the process would be far too confusing for voters 
said delegate patricia r sher a democrat who supports a womans 
right to choose abortion abortionrights forces she added feared 
the amount of money that the churches would bring in here would 
be awesome 
democratic sen francis x kelly a leading abortion foe and one 
of 16 senators who mounted the filibuster noted that the groups 
original goal to block the abortionrights bill was met 
i cant say im unhappy kelly said but from the 
experience i believe the voters should decide its a shame the 
voters wont be able to 
the house environmental matters committee voted 1312 against 
the package friday night 
the measure could be revived on the house floor but that was 
considered unlikely because of house democratic leadership 
opposition 
in agana guam us district judge alex munson issued a 
temporary restraining order friday blocking enforcement of the 
territorys new law a few hours after residents and medical groups 
filed a classaction lawsuit he scheduled a hearing for monday on 
whether to extend his order 
guams law which gov joseph ada signed this week prohibits 
abortions except when a pregnancy endangers the life of the mother 
it makes it a felony to perform abortion or aid in the procedure 
and a misdemeanor for a woman to solicit or have an abortion or 
for a person to solicit a woman to have an abortion 
it provides for a referendum nov 6 for voters to decide whether 
to retain the law 
the lawsuit alleges the measure violates constitutional 
guarantees of privacy due process free speech equal protection 
and religious freedom 
also friday idaho gov cecil andrus was the target of a brief 
sitin by highschool students demanding he veto an abortion bill 
approved by the legislature thursday 
the measure the strictest yet approved by a state legislature 
would ban abortion except in cases of nonstatutory rape reported 
within seven days incest if the victim is younger than 18 severe 
fetal deformity or threat to the mothers life or health 
andrus an opponent of abortion hasnt said if he intends to 
sign the bill 
abortionrights groups in california michigan wisconsin rhode 
island and north carolina have threatened to boycott idaho potatoes 
if andrus fails to veto the bill

cleanup crews are gearing up for a 
second season of trying to erase the signs of the nations worst 
oil spill but theres little agreement on just what needs to be 
done 
alaska gov steve cowper who toured prince william sound spoke 
friday of deformed herring eggs and streams bereft of young salmon 
but coast guard commandant adm paul yost in his own news 
conference friday disputed the governors gloomy assessment of the 
damage wrought by spill from the grounded exxon valdez a year ago 
today 
yost said he learned from his own visit to four heavily oiled 
shores this week that cleanup still is needed but he said exxons 
1989 efforts and the effects of winter storms and waves made a 
major major difference 
there is a tremendous improvement in the situation yost 
said 
for its part exxon corp is proposing a cleanup smaller than 
last years 2 billion effort that the state considers inadequate 
cowper told reporters there is a lot of cleanup work left to 
do this summer 
the indications are that there is biological damage we hope 
it isnt longterm said cowper who on thursday visited shores 
blackened when the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef and 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude 
cowper released preliminary data from the state department of 
environmental conservation that suggests damage to salmon and 
herring fisheries in some streams that enter the sound 
at one heavily polluted site a normally rich salmon stream on 
latouche island not a single small salmon exists this spring 
cowper said though results of the state data are not definitive 
he said it indicates that the oil in the substrata killed 
whatever was there 
the governor also said 90 percent of the herring roe at another 
site have shown aberrations 
dramatic measures may be required in this summers cleanup 
program to save the fisheries and other resources cowper said 
yost said he doubts the existence of state biological data 
mentioned by cowper if the state is holding secret data it 
should be released immediately he said 
cleanup is scheduled to begin may 1 after the coast guard 
determines on a milebymile basis what kind of treatment will 
be required this year yost said the coast guard has final say on 
details of cleaning an estimated 120 miles of shore affected by the 
spill 
exxon contends it should use less intrusive measures than it did 
in last years effort which depended on such drastic techniques as 
blasting oilfouled rocks with hot water or steam oileating 
bacteria are a possible weapon company officials have said 
cowper said he would urge more intrusive techniques including 
such unproven tactics as bulldozing shorelines if they get rid of 
the oil and allow microorganisms and other life to recolonize the 
fouled areas

president fernando collor de mello 
softened harsh antiinflation measures that have almost paralyzed 
the economy lifting restrictions on bank withdrawals for some 
poorer brazilians and charities 
collor announced the adjustments just one day after saying his 
measures which threatened to plunge the nation of 150 million into 
recession were not negotiable 
in his announcement friday he maintained the basic structure of 
the 8dayold plan which includes an 18month freeze on savings 
account withdrawals of more than 1200 and a limit on money market 
withdrawals to 600 the emergency measures froze 115 billion in 
savings 
the president appealed to brazilians to save and warned spending 
could lead to higher annual inflation now at 2700 percent 
we have begun slowly to open the tap and irrigate the 
economy collor said in a nationally televised meeting with 
congressmen and cabinet ministers 
the adjustments announced friday allow special bank withdrawals 
in certain cases such as for retired people recently laidoff 
workers truckers charities union funds and farmers with 
employees to pay it was not immediately clear whether any amount 
for additional withdrawals was specified 
the freeze which was maintained for the rest of the country 
has caused a brutal shortage of cruzeiros the local currency 
sales at stores and restaurants have plummeted and businesses have 
begun laying off employees 
collor urged brazilians to just buy what is strictly 
necessary and avoid a spending boom which would cause prices to 
rise 
prices are falling because there arent enough cruzeiros in 
the marketplace he said dont spend money on superfluous 
items bargain bargain bargain and make your money go farther 
the mar 16 plan froze prices for a month and guaranteed a wage 
increase in march of 73 percent equal to february inflation the 
cost of living in march is expected to reach 85 percent 
the president also appealed to businessmen not to fire workers 
and implied banks could face retaliation if they dont cooperate 
more vigorously with the plan 
collor predicted that in 30 or 45 days inflation will be 
totally under control 
according to some union estimates more than 30000 workers were 
fired in the past week hardest hit were construction workers 
including some 19000 let go in the southern state of parana alone 
in sao paulo brazils biggest city and financial center 
federal police arrested four executives of the eldorado supermarket 
for raising prices despite the freeze 
a poll conducted in brazils 10 largest cities published friday 
in the folha de sao paulo newspaper showed 81 percent of the 
population supported the measures only 5 percent opposed them 
the 26 economic reform measures became law immediately but can 
be repealed by congress within 30 days the reforms also included 
drastic spending cuts to eliminate a budget deficit higher taxes 
for the rich and a new currency 
collor said he would limit payments on the 115 billion foreign 
debt this year to just 5 billion about half last years total

a judge rejected most of a xerox corp 
lawsuit contending that apple computer inc pirated the screen 
display responsible for much of the popularity of its revolutionary 
macintosh personal computer 
xerox said it would appeal fridays ruling by us district 
judge vaughn walker 
the 150 million lawsuit filed in december alleged that apple 
derived the software for its lisa and macintosh computers from 
xerox computer programs 
the lawsuit alleged that steven jobs cofounder of apple had 
seen a demonstration of a xerox program called smalltalk at xeroxs 
palo alto research center in 1979 and that he and other apple 
employees copied the concept jobs left apple in 1985 
smalltalk was the first computer language to use a mouse a 
small handheld device used to manipulate information on a 
computer screen 
since then most personal computer makers have adopted the mouse 
and socalled windows programs that let the average person operate 
a personal computer without learning complicated typedin 
commands instead they use the mouse to move a pointer around the 
screen and execute commands 
vaugh dismissed five of six counts in the xerox lawsuit the 
dismissed counts involved allegations of unfair competition and 
attempts to have apple copyrights invalidated 
the only remaining count sought a declaratory judgment stating 
that xerox owns the copyright to its star program one of those it 
accuses apple of pirating 
in a news release from its stamford conn headquarters xerox 
said this ruling does not mean apple has not taken substantial 
portions of star and claimed them as their own the court merely 
held we believe erroneously that xerox did not have standing to 
present facts in support of that contention we intend to 
appeal 
from apples cupertino headquarters spokeswoman carleen 
levasseur responded we welcome the ruling in every way im 
confident that the sole remaining issue will be dismissed in the 
near future 
referring to the remaining accusation levasseur said apple 
has never disputed the validity of xeroxs registration 
apple responded at the time of the lawsuit that xeroxs concepts 
werent protected by copyright any more than birds or trees were 
protected by the copyright on a painting 
the lawsuit said xerox had never licensed apple to use the star 
computer program or its graphics it also accused apple of gaining 
unauthorized access by hiring several xerox employees in the late 
1970s and early 1980s including star software developers 
the lawsuit claimed apple employees saw the star program at the 
trade show in houston in june 1981 and copied substantial portions 
into its lisa and macintosh finder

estonias divided communist party is meeting with 
independence for their republic topping the agenda but party 
leader vaino vyalyas is making it clear he intends a more cautious 
approach than lithuania 
in a report friday to the party congress he emphasized the need 
for party reform and support for estonian independence according to 
his secretary nina slavina and radio moscow but vyalyas talked 
of negotiations with moscow 
another major topic at the congress is a possibile party split 
with moscow 
the party heard a draft program which declared that the party 
supports the independence of the estonian state on the basis of 
the free expression of the peoples will with due account for 
processes taking place in the soviet union and europe the soviet 
news agency tass reported 
however the program described the path to independence as an 
arduous and controversial process that requires legal 
foundation and the establishment of a solid economic and social 
basis 
it said estonian independence should proceed through 
negotiations between estonia and the soviet union tass reported 
vyalyas chided the neighboring baltic republic of lithuania for 
its march 11 declaration of independence from moscow 
he said in remarks monitored in london that the estonian 
communist party does not approve of all the political steps taken 
by the new lithuanian parliament 
baltic states lithuania estonia and latvia were forcibly 
incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 following the signing of 
a pact between dictators adolf hitler of nazi germany and josef 
stalin of the soviet union in 1939 
moscow has not recognized lithuanias independence declaration 
final results of estonias election on sunday made public 
friday indicated that the independenceminded peoples front won 
46 of 105 seats in new legislature tass said the front also 
enjoys support by some small parties 
about 55 lawmakers also are members of the communist party 
which embraces 106000 of estonias 16 million people 
the communists are split however among peoples front 
supporters backers of the free estonia movement and followers of 
russianspeaking groups 
tass said election results would make it hard for estonians who 
want independence to get the twothirds majority needed to push 
through a parliament decision on independence 
russianspeaking members strongly oppose such a move and can 
join with free estonia to block it the agency said 
estonian activists however say they expect free estonia to 
support the independence drive with some reservations 
before the party congress the communist party was split between 
those who wanted to cut off from moscow as lithuanias communists 
did in december and those supporting the moscow party platform 
ms slavina said a compromise proposal was submitted to the 
congress 
tass said the draft program should unite all honest 
communists wanting to contribute to the development of democratic 
socialism in estonia it also said estonias communist party 
abandons the practice of administrative socialism and utopian 
models of the future 
no details of the compromise proposal were immediately available 
radio moscow said the congress was also to consider a draft 
resolution on the partys history attributing its faults to its 
never having been independent 
the resolution condemns the false policy and activity of the 
party that have had serious consequences for the estonian people 
and the estonian independence and says the party together with 
moscow and party authorities there bears responsibility for acts 
of force against the estonian people

the last indian peacekeeping 
soldiers withdrew from sri lanka today after 30 months of a 
stalemated jungle war against tamil guerrillas 
a sri lankan naval band played auld lang syne and sri 
lankan soldiers unsheathed swords in a guard of honor for the 
departing indians who came to enforce an agreement supposed to end 
the guerrilla war 
about 2000 soldiers the last to be withdrawn from a force 
that once numbered 125000 sailed from from the eastern city of 
trincomalee for madras in southern india 
you have made a great sacrifice there is no doubt about 
that sri lankas defense minister ranjan wijeratne told the 
camouflageuniformed troops 
at least 1155 soldiers died fighting guerrillas of the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest militant group 
demanding an independent tamil nation 
the indian troops arrived in northern and eastern sri lanka in 
july 1987 under an indiasri lanka accord to disarm the tamil 
tigers and several other tamil separatist militant groups 
while most groups surrendered their arms the tamil tigers 
reneged on the accord in october 1987 and turned their guns on the 
indian soldiers who had once trained them the tigers claimed the 
provisions of the accord which promised limited autonomy did not 
meet their aspirations 
as the jungle war continued india sent more reinforcements at 
one point about 125000 soldiers patrolled the northeast 
last summer the new government of president ranasinghe premadasa 
reached an agreement with the tigers and asked india to pull out 
its troops by july 29 1989 the second anniversary of the peace 
accord 
at that time indian forces controlled most of the larger towns 
in northern and eastern sri lanka but the tamil tigers ran an 
effective underground movement from the dense jungles and swamps 
new delhi stalled on the withdrawal request for about six 
months leading to diplomatic standoff between officials of the two 
countries 
in january after the new indian government of prime minister 
vp singh took office india and sri lanka agreed on a march 31 
deadline 
the long stay brought severe criticism in both sri lanka and 
india many indian newspapers said the troops were needlessly 
fighting somebody elses dirty war 
weve been ordered to leave and thats what we are doing 
said a commando at the trincomalee dock pushing back his red beret 
to wipe sweat from his forehead we dont think we have lost a 
war were just obeying orders 
across the bay from where magar sailed tamil tigers patrolled 
trincomalees streets accompanied by sri lankan soldiers and 
police the forces which desperately tried to put down the tamil 
rebellion between 1983 until the indians arrival in 1987 
in recent months the tamil tigers have joined other groups in 
negotiations with the sri lankan government 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
wanted to set up a separate homeland in the northern and eastern 
districts where most of the countrys tamils live the tamils 
claimed they were discriminated in jobs education and the use of 
sinhala language by the majroity sinhalese 
the predominantly buddhist sinhalese make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and the military tamils are 
mostly hindus 
besides the indian troop casualties 10000 sri lankans have 
died in the tamil insurgency in addition the 1987 peace accord 
and the presence of indian soldiers sparked a backlash by 
chauvinist sinhalese guerrillas that cost 6000 lives since 1987

human rights groups and lawyers called on the 
government today not to extradite a chinese hijacking suspect to 
what they say could be his death in china 
zhang zhenhai who is being held for the dec 16 hijack of a 
chinese airliner with 233 people aboard to japan is facing 
extradition despite his claim that he was fleeing persecution 
because of his political activism 
the air china boeing 747 on a flight from beijing to new york 
flew to fukuoka in western japan after it was commandeered and was 
refused landing permission by south korea 
we will do everything we can in order to keep mr zhang from 
being sent back to china said shoichi kawaguchi a member of the 
foundation for asian human rights 
he said lawyers university professors and groups supporting 
asian workers and students are seeking ways to stop the government 
from repatriating zhang 
zhangs trial on charges of air piracy opened friday at the 
tokyo high court 
the court must decide by april 22 whether to agree to a chinese 
request that the 35yearold man be sent back to china japanese 
authorities handed over zhangs wife and young son to china within 
hours after the chinese jetliner landed at fukuoka prompting 
public criticism that officials had not done enough to investigate 
whether they were leaving china for political reasons 
in fridays court session zhang repeated statements he has made 
to investigators that he fled china to seek political asylum after 
he taking part in the prodemocracy movement in beijing last spring 
however prosecutors told the court zhang hijacked the aircraft 
to escape criminal charges in china and find work in japan the 
reports said 
court and justice ministry officials were not available for 
comment today because of the weekend holiday 
the prosecutors said testimony from zhangs wife and 
acquaintances provided by china said the defendant had never 
participated in antigovernment activities 
a coalition of groups including the national christian council 
of japan and the catholic council for justice and peace have 
demanded the justice ministry and tokyo high court not repatriate 
zhang and called for him to be tried in japan 
we are not saying the hijacker should be forgiven the 
groups said in a statement but japan seems to be trying to 
repatriate zhang without a full investigation into the case such 
an attitude raises questions from the standpoint of the 
constitution international law and humanitarianism 
kazuyo iwaki one of three lawyers defending zhang has said 
japanese officials should not assume that he will not be executed 
if he is extradited 
the chinese government has told japan it will not execute zhang

leaflets calling for an end to chinese rule have 
appeared in chinas westernmost region raising concern of ethnic 
violence an official from the xinjiang autonomous region said 
today 
the sparsely populated desert region in chinas northwest is 
home to 25 different minority groups including several large 
moslem groups who account for 62 percent of xinjiangs population 
amudun niyazi chairman of the xinjiang peoples congress 
standing committee told the associated press that there has been 
no violence in the region so far 
but he said authorities recently have discovered handbills 
leaflets and other materials instigating separatist activities 
circulating through the region one of chinas largest ethnic 
minority areas 
niyazi said most of the material has come from former xinjiang 
residents now living overseas but declined to provide other 
details 
in the past few months news reports from xinjiang have hinted 
of ethnic trouble editorials and commentaries stressing the need 
for unity and stability and denouncing separatist activities 
have increased markedly 
china violently imposed its rule on the region in the 1950s 
slaughtering those who took part in antichinese revolts 
since then the ethnic groups have largely accepted beijings 
domination although tensions remain and ethnic trouble has 
surfaced from time to time 
the largest ethnic groups include the moslem uygur and kazakh 
minorities central asian groups with close ties to people living 
across the border in the soviet union 
in january the regions armed police were ordered to intensify 
riot training and intelligence work as a prevention against unrest 
xinjiangs delegates to the national peoples congress holding 
its annual session in beijing this week were earlier quoted by the 
xinjiang daily as saying currently xinjiang still has a small 
number of separatists who present the greatest threat to 
xinjiangs stability we must be on the alert 
the delegates called them the scum of the chinese people and 
said they were carrying out their activities under the guise of 
advocating religious freedom and democracy 
xinjiang communist party secretary song hanliang who toured 
southern xinjiang in february told party members every place 
and work unit now has some hot spot problems and urged them 
to handle the problem while it is still in the embryonic stage 
in the early 1980s there were sketchy reports of a series of 
antichinese rebellions 
in may moslems protesting a chinese book that they said 
desecrated their religion stormed party headquarters in urumqi 
official reports said 43 trucks were overturned and smashed and 150 
policemen injured one person was sentenced to life imprisonment 
for pillage and at least nine others received jail terms

the national centers for disease control halted 
imports by three of the nations largest monkey dealers effective 
today amid concerns over the spread of deadly ebola virus in 
monkeys in at least two research centers cdc director william l 
roper said cdc inspectors had found inadequate isolation and 
quarantine conditions at the three suppliers this week 
the concerns arose after ebola virus known in preaids days as 
the deadliest virus in the world was spotted in the united states 
in november in three monkeys at the hazleton supplier in virginia 
in january an ebolarelated virus turned up in a monkey in a 
pennsylvania laboratory 
humans can be infected but its not very common said dr 
susan fisherhoch of the cdc 
medical researchers and drug manufacturers on friday urged roper 
not to ban imported lab monkeys saying that could set back efforts 
to find cures for aids and other serious diseases 
roper said in notices thursday to worldwide primates of miami 
charles river primates corp of port washington ny and hazleton 
research products inc of reston va that effective today your 
registration to import nonhuman primates into the united states 
will be revoked 
the three are among four importers who handle 90 percent of us 
monkey imports cdc officials said the fourth supplier was 
inspected and found to be in compliance with cdc guidelines and no 
action has been taken there 
dr we tucker jr of the pharmaceutical giant burroughs 
wellcome co argued against a ban during a special cdc meeting 
if a ban is put into effect it will seriously affect our 
efforts to develop agents to treat very serious diseases he said 
monkeys often are used for aids research and banning them could 
cut aids research by 50 percent said dr frederick king director 
of the yerkes regional primate center in atlanta 
im for not throwing out the baby with the bath king said 
we must take all precautions but we must not needlessly 
sacrifice the research which depends on these primates said dr 
vance gordon of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association

rival christian forces battled with 
howitzers and mortars north of beirut early today stirring fears 
of a new round of allout fighting in the christian enclave 
police said three people were killed and seven wounded in the 
fighting in kesrouan province between gen michel aouns troops and 
the lebanese forces militia led by samir geagea 
the latest fighting raised the casualty toll since aoun moved 
against geagea jan 30 to at least 765 killed and 2123 wounded 
most of them civilians 
both sides accused each other of provoking the latest clashes 
the most serious violation of a march 3 ceasefire in the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
the two armies had fought each other to a standstill before the 
ceasefire arranged by a threeman committee of neutral christian 
mediators 
fears that a new flareup was looming have been raised by the 
mediators failure to work out a political settlement to end 
struggle for domination of the estimated 1 million christians in 
the enclave 
tens of thousands have fled in recent weeks because of the 
fighting the bloodiest confrontation between christian forces 
since the christianmoslem civil war erupted in april 1975 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said a largescale battle appears to be in the 
offing especially if the mediation committee is unable to work out 
a settlement 
that would mark another serious setback for an arab 
leaguebrokered peace accord aimed at ending the nearly 15yearold 
civil war 
syrianbacked president elias hrawi elected nov 24 to 
implement the peace plan has not been able to extend his authority 
in the christian enclave because aoun refuses to recognize him and 
rejects the accord 
beiruts independent annahar daily quoted unidentified 
government sources as saying the united states has informed 
officials that aoun must step down in favor of the legitimate 
authority of hrawi 
the report did not elaborate but the united states like all 
countries with which lebanon maintains diplomatic relations 
recognizes hrawi as head of state 
aoun 54 considers himself the sole legitimate authority in 
lebanon 
in september 1988 aoun the army commander was named head of a 
caretaker military government by outgoing president amin gemayel 
before his sixyear term expired with parliament unable to elect a 
new head of state 
hrawi a maronite catholic like aoun and geagea sacked aoun as 
army chief and interim prime minister in november but aoun has 
refused to quit either post 
he considers hrawis election unconstitutional on the grounds 
that parliament elected in 1972 before the civil war began is no 
longer representative of the nation 
aoun rejects the peace accord endorsed by parliament in the 
saudi arabian resort of taif in october because it does not 
guarantee the withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops from lebanon 
the syrians entered lebanon in 1976 under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
geagea recognizes the presidency and has made cautious signals 
welcoming the taif accord

bias against women in the california 
justice system is often blatant sometimes subtle and apparent in 
the sharp contrast between the opinions of female and male judges 
a state report found 
the report released friday said gender bias in the state would 
decline if the proportion of women judges increased above the 
current 13 percent a figure already nearly twice the national 
average 
the gender bias that we have found in the judicial system 
reflects the society said los angeles county superior court 
judge david rothman cochair of a state judicial council committee 
that produced the study 
as judges we have an obligation to do something about it he 
said 
a theme common to many of the findings was the lack of 
credibility with which women are regarded in the courts said los 
angeles county superior court judge judith chirlin vicechair of 
the study 
she said bias shows up in many ways judges who call a male 
expert witness doctor but ask a woman with the same credentials 
whether she prefers miss or ms another tendency by many 
male judges is to doubt womens stories that their husbands beat 
them or molested their children 
the report offered 65 recommendations including simplifying and 
speeding up procedures for restraining orders against domestic 
violence improving health care for female prisoners and putting 
antibias provisions into the judges code of conduct the law 
school curriculum and the bar exam 
the study was begun in 1986 by chief justice rose bird and 
continued by successor malcolm lucas after birds defeat in the 
1986 election 
the study cited a survey last year of 473 california judges that 
showed some sharp differences in attitudes between men and women on 
the bench 
forty percent of the male judges but only 22 percent of the 
women thought domestic violence cases should be dealt with by 
counseling instead of prosecution 47 percent men but 75 percent 
women disagreed with a statement that domestic violence allegations 
were often exaggerated 7 percent men but 45 percent women said 
they had heard other judges make remarks demeaning to women 
many of those comments were chronicled most of them 
anonymously a male judge who told a female lawyer not to try any 
of your feminine tricks any of your emotionalism another who 
asked two women lawyers if theyd had a cat fight others who 
invariably asked the woman in a group of lawyers if she could type 
up a settlement agreement 
the study said demeaning comments were more likely to come from 
lawyers than judges committee members speaking to reporters also 
said individual remarks by judges however shocking were not as 
pervasive a problem as others covered by the report such as the 
difficulties encountered by women in divorce courts domestic 
violence cases and prisons 
most of the gender bias is institutionalized watson said 
for example she said members visiting the main womens jail in 
los angeles county found pregnant women who had not seen a doctor 
for four months they also said mothers awaiting trial for a year 
were not told where their children had been placed and were given 
only one change of underwear a week 
chirlin said another important finding was the low status and 
relatively meager budgets of family law courts 
any issues relating to families and kids are quote womens 
issues and are seen as less important she said the report 
urges an increase in family court judges and a study of the 
adequacy of child support levels

a cia employee says there was no attempt to 
cover up a missile shipment to iran only a great deal of 
confusion over the 1985 delivery of hawk missiles central to the 
irancontra affair 
norman gardner testified on friday that john poindexter and 
william casey the late cia director did not orchestrate a false 
cover story about the us governments role in the november 1985 
shipment of 18 hawk missiles 
poindexter who was president reagans national security adviser 
at the time is accused of conspiracy obstructing congress and 
making false statements by saying he didnt find out until january 
1986 that hawks had been delivered to iran 
casey told congress on nov 21 1986 the same day as 
poindexters alleged lies that the cia had been asked by israel to 
arrange to fly bulky cargo to iran the planes crew said 
casey was told it was oil drilling equipment 
casey and poindexter had attended a meeting the previous day to 
go over caseys upcoming congressional testimony 
gardner later reported to the white house on how caseys 
appearance went on capitol hill 
did you tell admiral poindexter that the cover story wasnt 
holding up very well irancontra prosecutor christian mixter 
asked gardner 
no i didnt said gardner denying there was a false cover 
story 
gardner said that after much review in november 1986 it was 
determined that the cia found out hawk missiles were aboard the 
plane when the flight to iran already was under way 
the cia shipped the missiles yet didnt know they were 
missiles us district court judge harold greene asked 
the missiles were being shipped from israel explained gardner 
but this was the cias airline said greene 
thats right replied gardner 
hours after poindexter briefed congressmen and casey testified 
on nov 21 1986 the national security adviser tore up a 
presidential document ratifying the hawks delivery 
the politically embarrassing document called a finding 
depicted the shipment as part of an armsforhostages deal 
neither poindexter nor casey had told congress of the findings 
existence the cia director sent it directly to poindexter in 
november 1985 with instructions to keep it secret from anyone 
below our level although by november 1986 gardner knew of its 
existence too 
according to gardners notes of the meeting poindexter told 
house intelligence committee members that reagan did not approve 
the shipment 
why didnt gardner speak up and disclose the finding asked 
mixter 
because it was not done before the shipment responded the 
cia employee explaining that it had been drafted a day or two 
after the missiles were delivered 
gardner at the time special assistant to the agencys 
thendeputy director of operations clair george is now the cias 
deputy director in the office of congressional affairs

greyhound says it wont move to reopen talks 
with picketing drivers until the union tries to end strikerelated 
violence 
the union says the comments by anthony p lannie greyhound vice 
president and the companys chief negotiator are nothing more 
than a subterfuge to avoid going to the bargaining table 
lannie met for two hours friday with bernard e delury the 
director of national mediation and conciliation service but no new 
talks with the union were scheduled 
we will not bargain with a gun pointed at us lannie said 
after the meeting 
the mediation service said both sides were maintaining an 
ongoing dialogue with the agency and that there was a prospect 
of resuming negotiations in the near future 
the company broke off talks last sunday accusing union leaders 
of failing to negotiate and of stepping up violence 
we do not condone violence our position on that is clear 
said nick nichols a spokesman for the amalgamated council of 
greyhound local unions 
lannie said wages job security and grievance procedures key 
issues in the strike did not come up in fridays meeting as 
company officials and federal mediators focused on ways to end 
strike violence 
since the strike began march 2 21 buses driven by replacement 
workers have been shot at and several more have been pelted with 
bricks and rocks the company said there were no serious injuries 
the latest incident occurred friday night in tucson ariz when 
a bus en route to el paso was struck by one bullet as it crossed 
the picket line said greyhound spokeswoman melanie scofield the 
bullet struck the windshield she said none of the 21 people 
aboard were injured scofield said the driver decided to maintain 
his schedule and did not report the shooting until he arrived in el 
paso 
earlier friday a bus carrying 59 passengers was the target of a 
bow and arrow attack in cleveland no one was hurt 
also friday a striking driver was hit by a bus in atlanta and 
was taken to a hospital for observation nichols said more than 60 
pickets have been struck by buses hit by security guards or 
injured in other incidents over the three weeks nichols said 
on the second day of thestrike a veteran greyhound driver was 
crushed to death on the picket line by a bus driven by a 
replacement in redding calif no charges were filed 
lannie said the union could join the company in offering rewards 
for information leading to the arrest of people responsible for the 
violence and urge union members to turn in anyone who commits an 
illegal act 
the union has not cooperated with the authorities theyve not 
taken any affirmative action to bring this violence to a halt to 
take a handsoff wedontknowanything approach is absurd 
lannie said 
nichols said the union has told members it would support 
prosecution for those responsible for violence or property damage 
as to putting bounties on peoples heads we believe that 
local law enforcement agencies are best trained and best equipped 
to investigate these matters nichols said 
nichols said negotiators representing the 6300 drivers and an 
estimated 3000 other greyhound workers had hoped federal mediators 
could prod the company to resume talks 
we can be there on an hours notice nichols said 
both sides accused the other of skewing the figures on proposed 
wage increases 
greyhound said its offering 63 million over three years while 
the union wants 180 million the union says its asking for 40 
million and charges that the companys proposal is not hard 
money because it is contingent on profit increases 
greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service 
the strike has affected many smaller communities for which buses 
are the only public transportation

im sorry if people were offended about it but my point was to

the government has been ineffective in breaking up death squads 
killing people at the rate of about one a day this year and 
abducting dozens of others 
in guatemala the agents of human rights violations persist 
government level efforts to preserve human rights are useless 
ramiro de leon carpio said friday in a report to the guatemalan 
congress 
there are extremist sectors involved in the violation of these 
rights which have caused the disappearance of many people and the 
murder of others de leon carpio said 
clandestine jails have not ceased to operate he added 
demands are presented daily for their disappearance but no 
positive results are being obtained he said

54 were killed in january and february throughout guatemala he 
said in the first two months of 1990 at least 52 people 
disappeared and 23 threats were reported he said 
the president of the congressional human rights commission 
oliverio garcia chastized the administration of president vinicio 
cerezo for its negligence in the investigation of these events 
and the capture of the responsible parties

authorities have discovered mass graves 
containing thousands of victims of a former soviet internment camp 
from the stalin era an east german newspaper reported today 
among those killed at the camp were nazi prisoners of war such 
as ss members police officers nazi party officials and former 
soldiers in adolf hitlers army the berliner zeitung said 
but the newspaper said victims also included many innocent 
people and teenagers the youngest victim was 12 years old it 
quoted a surviving inmate as saying the report did not say how 
many thousands of bodies were found 
the camp was run by the soviet unions dreaded nkvd state 
security force a forerunner of the kgb according to the report a 
local historian discovered the remains earlier this month at 
fuenfeichen near neubrandenburg 80 miles north of berlin the east 
berlin newspaper said 
berliner zeitung quoted west german estimates that 65000 men 
women and children died in red army imprisonment at the end of 
world war ii it likened the stalinist terror to nazi death 
camps 
the report accompanied by a graphic photograph of an uncovered 
skeleton would have been impossible before the peaceful revolt 
that toppled hardline east german communist leader erich honecker 
in october and set the country on course for democracy 
east germany formed out of sovietoccupied germany after the 
fall of hitlers third reich was a particularly staunch soviet 
ally for decades but now is dealing publicly with its past 
this includes reports on brutality in the postwar period when 
the soviet bloc was in the iron grip of kremlin chief josef stalin 
berliner zeitung noted that many german communists and 
socialists were also killed in soviet camps 
forest wardens and farmers knew about fuenfeichen but kept 
silent until now the newspaper said 
the camp operated from april 1945 until october 1948 many 
inmates were taken to the soviet union when the red army closed it 
and were never heard from again the report said 
it said one prisoner who died there had just been released from 
a nazi camp and was arrested by the soviets because he resisted the 
expropriation of his home

presidents hosni mubarak of egypt and hafez assad of 
syria today met for the first time since ending a 12year rift 
between their countries joining other arab leaders in libya a 
news report said 
the leaders were attending ceremonies marking the 20th 
anniversary of the expulsion of british forces from libya the 
libyan news agency jana said in a report monitored in rome 
the news agency said libyan leader col moammar gadhafi welcomed 
assad mubarak and sudanese leader omar hassan elbashir who were 
among the leaders at the ceremony in tobruk on the mediterranean 
coast in eastern libya 
assads foreign visits are rarely announced in advance and his 
trip to tobruk surprised officials in his own government 
jana said mubarak and assad met at the libyan air base where the 
ceremony was being held it was their first meeting since the two 
countries resumed diplomatic ties in december after mediation by 
saudi arabia and jordan 
the report did not say what they discussed 
assad broke ties after egyptian president anwar sadat made a 
dramatic visit to jerusalem in 1977 the opening move in two years 
of negotiations that resulted in the egyptisrael peace accord 
signed by sadat most other arab countries broke ties with egypt 
when it signed the treaty with israel in 1979 and the feud had 
been a major obstacle to arab cooperation 
but links have been restored since a 1987 arab summit decided to 
allow egypt back into the arab fold libya long allied with syria 
in a radical front has also been patching up its differences with 
egypt 
in cairo egyptian officials said today that mubarak planned 
talks with gadhafi on international and arab issues and recently 
improved relations between the two countries 
the 1970 british pullout from tobruks eladem air base took 
place the year after gadhafi overthrew the monarchy in a military 
coup and established a republic us forces withdrew from libya in 
june 1970 
libya was under british and french administration from 1942 
when the germans and italians were driven out in world war ii 
until independence in 1951 but the british retained the air base 
until the year after gadhafi toppled the libyan monarchy in 1969 
gadhafi renamed the base after egypts late president gamal

khmer rouge commanders claim that elite 
vietnamese troops have been secretly sent back into cambodia to 
block a guerrilla advance on the countrys second largest city 
the guerrilla officers interviewed friday in a jungle base 
said vietnamese troops disguised in cambodian uniforms have mounted 
a series of counterattacks in a wide area of territory seized 
earlier by the khmer rouge 
the sovietbacked vietnamese maintained about 100000 troops in 
cambodia for several years until hanoi claimed it withdrew its 
forces in september 1989 
cambodia has denied repeated claims that vietnamese forces have 
returned and the vietnamese army newspaper quan doi nhan dan said 
friday that the allegations were groundless reports cooked up by 
the khmer rouge and spread by foreign mass media 
the communist khmer rouge one of three guerrilla groups 
fighting the government in cambodia has seized hundreds of square 
miles of territory in the northwestern province of battambang and 
threatened the capital phnom penh 
the vietnamese reinforcements are a major obstacle to us 
capturing battambang the khmer rouge division commander gen 
yat thim said in february the vietnamese sent many 
reinforcements to battambang and have mounted operations against 
us on many occasions this month 
the rare interview with a khmer rouge commander took place at a 
jungle base near the thai frontier recently captured from 
government forces the explosions of mines being cleared and 
detonated by the guerrillas could be heard at short intervals 
western analysts at the thaicambodian border confirmed that 
vietnamese troops were fighting in northwestern cambodia but the 
reports did not specify the number of troops involved 
there is no doubt the vietnamese are back said one western 
analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity they are now 
attacking the khmer rouge in several areas of battambang 
the khmer rouges military objectives are unclear but yat thim 
confirmed the guerrillas intend to seize battambang cambodias 
second largest city and center of the countrys most fertile 
ricegrowing region 
the khmer rouge produced three captured vietnamese soldiers on 
friday who they said were seized in the recent fighting the three 
were clearly vietnamese but their accounts could not be 
independently verified 
we were sent back to cambodia because the government couldnt 
beat the resistance alone said a manacled lieutenant ly guan 
thien through an interpreter we were told to put on cambodian 
uniforms so we wouldnt be recognized 
he said he was captured early this month when his unit of 150 
vietnamese was attacked by the khmer rouge in battambang province 
pvt long ngoc tho said he arrived in cambodia in early february 
with 500 other vietnamese troops and was captured 12 days later in 
fighting around the gemmining town of pailin 
there are now many of us in cambodia he said we were 
told that we needed to help cambodia fight the enemy 
the khmer rouge and two noncommunist groups fighting the 
government made major gains after the vietnamese pullout but since 
last month a counteroffensive has forced the guerrillas to give up 
some ground 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 ending a nearly 
4yearlong khmer rouge reign of terror during their rule 
hundreds of thousands of cambodias 8 million people were executed 
or died from famine and civil unrest

about 100 soviet military vehicles 
rumbled past lithuanias parliament building early today and 
nervous lawmakers voted to transfer power out of their baltic 
republic if they are assaulted or arrested 
after the convoy roared through the lithuanian capital was 
quiet and polls opened for elections to local governing councils 
a deadline for lithuanian deserters to return to their soviet 
military units passed with no immediate reports of action being 
taken to round them up 
in moscow a us embassy spokesman said two us diplomats 
ordered out of lithuania by the soviet government on friday would 
comply with the order but he could not confirm the officials 
actually had found transportation out of the baltic republic and 
left 
in referring to todays maneuver lithuanian president vytautus 
landsbergis told the supreme council legislature we felt we were 
really in an occupied country an alien power sent forces and we 
dont know why 
tension is rising with this demonstration of military force 
with this frightening of people with soviet soldiers 
the legislators who were in session about 300 feet from the 
path of the convoy when it rumbled through vilnius about 4 am 
passed a resolution transferring power to the senior diplomat of 
independent lithuania in washington in case of a soviet assault or 
their arrests 
since lithuania declared independence from moscow on march 11 
soviet leaders have repeatedly warned the baltic republic to return 
to the soviet union president mikhail s gorbachev has called the 
move illegal but said he would not use force against the republic 
of 38 million people 
lithuania a formerly independent republic was crushed by 
stalins army in 1940 and annexed by the soviet union 
moving the column into vilnius increased the military pressure 
on the lithuanian government by making it simpler for moscow to 
send the troops quickly into action but it appeared calculated to 
enter the city when it was deserted seemingly to avoid 
confrontations 
this is absurd armored vehicles dont usually drive through 
the middle of town in the middle of the night lithuanian prime 
minister kazimeira prunskeine told reporters at the legislature 
were not afraid but we dont know what they want and we 
dont know what they will do in the next few hours she said 
official lithuanian sources said vehicles containing at least 
1000 paratroopers armed with automatic weapons rumbled along the 
main highway through the heart of vilnius without stopping 
there were at least 22 tanks and armored personnel carriers and 
dozens of green military trucks the parliaments information 
department quoted witnesses as saying there were 59 tanks and 50 
other vehicles no incidents were reported 
a spokesman for the lithuanian parliament said he saw the column 
enter a military base at siaures miestelis on the north side of the 
capital where it stayed 
on thursday gorbachev told landsbergis that lithuania should 
stop signing up volunteer forces and sought a response from the 
lithuanian leader by today he also has demanded lithuanians 
surrender their firearms 
a senior military adviser to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev marshal sergei f akhromeyev indicated friday the 
military would try to round up the deserters even if some people 
dont like it 
landsbergis in a telegram to moscow early today said the 
volunteers would not replace soviet kgb border guards and uniformed 
police as gorbachev suggested the lithuanians would 
romas gudaitis a lithuanian representative to the national 
parliament in moscow said he handed a letter friday to gorbachevs 
secondincommand anatoly i lukyanov asking national legislators 
for negotiations 
he said lukyanov the chairman of the supreme soviet 
categorically rejected the request 
on friday foreign ministry officials said soviet embassies 
would review foreigners visa applications to travel to lithuania 
to keep out people inclined to engage in illegal activities 
the official soviet news agency tass said it did not elaborate 
the soviet union also told poland it was suspending visafree 
travel for poles and lithuanians across the border the official 
soviet news agency said 
in tokyo the head of tass said today he believes that a state 
of emergency might be declared in lithuania although it was 
unclear what that would mean 
just because they have formed a independent legislature 
they are mistaken to think that they can secede tass president 
leonid kravchenko told the japanese ntv television network

local roman catholic leaders 
say they hope monsignor oscar romero murdered in church 10 years 
ago today will be declared a saint by the vatican 
monsignor romero is already a saint for the people of latin 
america what the vatican does would be a recognition of his 
popular canonization said father rogelio pedraz a close friend 
and colleague of romero 
local and foreign religious dignitaries attended ceremonies 
thursday friday and today for romero who was slain by a single 
bullet through the heart as he said mass at a hospital chapel march 
24 1980 the killing was blamed on rightwing death squads but no 
suspects were ever arrested 
in rome today pope john paul ii sent a message to romeros 
successor archbishop arturo rivera damas expressing the hope that 
the slaying will serve as a call to reconciliation and pardon 
the message did not mention efforts to make romero a saint 
in announcing plans to propose romero for beatification the 
first step toward sainthood the church has instructed its 
officials to ensure observation of the non cultu edict that is 
a reference to a decree pope urban viii issued in the 17th century 
that public ceremonial tribute to a candidate for sainthood would 
diminish the nominees chances 
only one archbishop delared a saint was assassinated in church 
thomas becket killed 820 years ago by four local knights who 
supported henry iis feud with the cleric 
pedraz director of the publishing house of the jesuitrun 
central american university says canonization could take up to 30 
years 
what monsignor romero finally leaves us as a lesson is that it 
is not possible to kill him said juan jose garcia director of 
the universitys human rights institute 
the figure of monsignor romero does not end when he dies 
there begins the process of his resurrection a resurrection that 
means his return to life in todays circumstances 
to the despair of 5 million salvadorans todays circumstances 
do not differ greatly from those of 1980 when the country was 
descending into fratricidal war 
it is a great sadness that 10 years after the murder of one 
who spoke with such passion of the need for peace el salvador is 
still locked firmly in the embrace of mutual enmity and fierce 
civil war said the new yorkbased rights organization americas 
watch the group commented in a report titled a year of 
reckoning el salvador a decade after the assassination of 
archbishop romero 
cruel irony attends the 10th anniversary 
the nation is governed by the rightist arena party founded by 
cashiered army major roberto daubuisson former president jose 
napoleon duarte accused him of being mastermind of the conspiracy 
to kill romero 
daubuisson denies involvement in the murder 
despite evidence incriminating several alleged members in a 
farrightist plot no one has been arrested or tried for the 
slaying some officials have called the case closed 
the anniversary comes just four months after another heinous 
crime against men of the cloth 
before dawn on nov 16 army troops broke into the residence of 
six jesuit professorpriests at central american university roused 
them from their beds forced them to lie face down on the lawn and 
shot them in the head then they killed the priests housekeeper 
and her daughter 
these two events the murder of archbishop romero in 1980 and 
the slaying of the jesuits in 1989 stand as bookends to the 
decade offering harsh testimony about who really rules el salvador 
and how little they have changed americas watch said ten 
years later priestkilling is still a preferred option for those 
who simply will not hear the cries for change and justice in a 
society that has had too little of either 
romero and the jesuits exercised what in modern theology has 
come to be called the preferential option for the poor they 
lived humbly and described and condemned exploitation inequality 
oppression and repression for their outspokenness they were 
labeled subversives by the radical right 
romero was a pastor a prophet a friend a brother and a 
father to the entire salvadoran people especially the poorest the 
weakest and most downtrodden the local church said in a 
publication dedicated to his memory he was the voice of those 
without voice 
the day before he was killed in his final homily romero issued 
an impassioned appeal to soldiers to disobey orders to torture and 
murder 
in the name of god in the name of this suffering people whose 
cries rise to heaven more loudly each day i implore you i beg 
you i order you in the name of god stop the repression he said 
the government and rebels in recent weeks have talked separately 
with a representative of un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar about resuming peace talks broken off last november 
we hope that in the year of this 10th anniversary the war 
ends said monsignor gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary bishop of 
san salvador because it is possible to end the war this very 
year the year of the beginning of his canonization he told us how 
we could have avoided all this suffering but his voice was not 
heeded we hope that now with more serenity his voice will be 
heeded and that finally the violence will end and peace will 
arrive

efforts to encourage peace in southern africa 
baker on the last leg of his sixday trip through africa that 
included stops in south africa and newly independent namibia met 
with angolan rebel and government leaders to seek a solution to 
their long conflict 
the angolans are still proposing what they call a biafran 
solution said the us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the official was referring to nigerias policy toward defeated 
rebels who had sought independence for the countrys eastern region

about onethird of the mineralrich country in southwestern africa 
baker held brief talks with savimbi on friday night savimbi 
who has been supported by the united states repeated a pledge to 
honor a ceasefire if the angolan government would begin 
negotiations to end the war 
zairean president mobutu sese seko received baker today on his 
riverboat the kamanyola on the congo river mobutu has sought to 
mediate the angolan conflict but a ceasefire he brokered in june 
quickly broke down 
baker refused to comment on the talks except to say we had 
almost three hours that were constructive and helpful 
in harare zimbabwe shevardnadze said the soviet union was 
optimistic about the prospects of peace in angola and mozambique 
where guerrillas are fighting the sovietbacked governments 
there is a certain degree of readiness by both the leaders of 
these countries and their opponents to engage in dialogue 
shevardnadze said 
meanwhile two attorneys of the us lawyers committee for human 
rights accused zairean security forces of attacking them and 
stealing their briefcases on march 15 
the new yorkbased committee said in a letter to baker that five 
men beat americans peter rosenblum and kenyan makau mutua outside 
their hotel in downtown kinshasa 
bystanders chased the attackers but abandoned their pursuit when 
one shouted that he belonged to the security forces the letter 
said zaires intelligence service denied it was involved in the 
attack 
the letter asked baker to raise the incident in todays talks 
with mobutu baker did not say whether he had but the talks were 
to have included bilateral relations 
zaire is a top beneficiary of aid from the united states 
amnesty international the human rights organization has for 
years accused mobutus administration of arbitrarily detaining and 
torturing opponents

rival christian forces battled with 
artillery and machine guns through the night and again saturday 
raising fears of a new round of allout war for control of 
christian territory 
three people were reported killed and eight wounded in the 
battles which took place in east beirut and in the kesrouan 
province north of the city most of the victims have been civilians 
the clashes were the most serious since a ceasefire was 
declared march 3 between the troops of gen michel aoun and samir 
geageas lebanese forces militia the truce has been violated 
repeatedly 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations predicted allout warfare would break out again if a 
mediation committee is unable to work out a political settlement 
between the rival christian groups 
a christian source close to the mediators said the gap 
separating geagea and aoun remains very wide the mediators havent 
been able to bring them closer 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
committee was convinced that its efforts have reached a dead end 
but doesnt want to announce failure hoping that a miracle of some 
sort might emerge 
meanwhile beiruts independent annahar daily quoted unnamed 
government sources as saying the united states has informed 
officials that aoun must step down in favor of the legitimate 
authority of president elias hrawi it did not elaborate 
the united states like all nations with which lebanon has 
diplomatic relations recognizes hrawi as head of state 
aoun refuses to accept his authority because he was elected as 
part of a peace accord the christian general opposed aoun rejected 
the accord because it did not include a timetable for the 
withdrawal from lebanon of syrian troops 
aoun considers the syrians who entered lebanon in 1976 under an 
arab league peacekeeping mandate to be an army of occupation

the respected british actor alec mccowen is 
back again reciting st marks gospel and it is mesmerizing 
the solo performance opened wednesday night to play through 
april 15 at the offbroadway lambs theater 
mccowen learned the second and shortest of the four gospels in 
the new testament of the bible during 16 months in 1976 and 1977 
he has been occasionally speaking it in theaters ever since 
including previous engagements here 
he is acting more now previously he delivered the story 
primarily by voice and there are more props instead of one chair 
there are now three which he moves around 
when jesus is on a ship the actor turns a chair and sits on it 
backwards when a madman speaks his hand goes in front of his 
face palm out when a blind man speaks a hand covers his eyes 
temple officials speak with plummy selfsatisfied voice and 
expression 
this makes surprisingly little difference st marks gospel 
fascinates however mccowen delivers it to a audience familiar with 
its story or not believers or not firsttime hearers or those 
whove heard it before 
this gospel concentrates on jesus ministry he is baptized by 
john the baptist chooses his disciples goes to many villages to 
cast demons out of people cures illnesses and handicaps and 
teaches by telling parables in this gospel the common people 
figure out the parables better than the disciples 
this gospel doesnt have many women in it jesus mother isnt 
mentioned the stories of mary magdalene mary and martha and the 
woman at the well arent told the writing style is never flowery 
mccowens hair now is gray his closely trimmed beard is white 
he doesnt wear a suit as when he first did st marks gospel 
here now he wears a dark red sweater over a shirt and gray slacks 
in an introduction he explains that he uses the 1611 king james 
version of the bible he says that peter is believed to have told 
this story to mark 
one thing that mccowens acting has done is to give st marks 
gospel more amusing moments than before before james and john 
ask jesus if they can sit beside him in heaven he looks all around 
to see if anybody is eavesdropping

when the principal at jc nalle elementary 
school recently asked for community volunteers to sub for her 
teachers at lunch time more than twodozen parents jumped right in 
for the teachers it was a welcome opportunity to grab a 
90minute break from the rigors of an innnercity school day for 
parents it was a gratifying means of getting involved in the 
education of their children 
the parents came in overwhelmingly school principal shirley 
williams said of the lunch program which was designed to honor 
teachers during american education week and the teachers were 
pleased 
stronger parental involvement in schools is a key aim of the 
national education strategy developed by the bush administration 
and the nations governors the policy stresses that parents 
should play an active role in their childrens early learning 
but instituting such a policy in the druginfested neighborhoods 
surrounding nalle is no mean feat 
nearby drake place was described by time magazine as one of the 
nations meanest streets 
many children at nalle at one time or another have been a 
witness to a crime or have been affected by a crime said ms 
williams noting the drug epidemic has torn down traditional family 
structures 
yet said the rev nathaniel thomas president of the schools 
parent teacher association in spite of the drug abuse or other 
conditions parents still want the very best for their children 
but the challenge is how to help them and how to get us the 
necessary support 
most of the parents are in their early to mid20s so very 
young themselves that they are seeking guidance as well he said 
thomas who has a daughter at nalle said he became active at 
the school about the time ms williams became principal because i 
attended the school as a child and my parents still live in this 
community 
i refuse to run away from my roots he said this is where 
the seed was planted right here in spite of all the problems that 
exist now we can change that by way of a cooperative network among 
the teachers principal and parents 
president bush recently criticized parents for thinking of 
education as a service we can hand over to the school boards much 
the same way we expect our cities to provide electricity or water 
bushs criticisms came as the national pta released a survey of 
parents that found less than half had visited their childrens 
schools to participate in a backtoschool night or to attend 
parentorganization meetings last fall 
many of the parents cited lack of time or work commitments as a 
deterrent to participation 
parents of the 413 black students attending jc nalle have 
additional problems the school is located in a neighborhood where 
during the 198889 school year there was a crime committed there 
almost every night ms williams said some parents struggle 
themselves with drug and alcohol problems 
to ensure parental awareness of a students progress ms 
williams requires parents must pick up their childrens report 
card only a few refuse to do so 
just today one little boy was just beaming because his mother 
was here to pick up his report card said ms williams it 
didnt matter that she was more than a month late 
ms willians who has been principal at nalle for the past 18 
months said the key is getting them parents to trust you and 
letting them know that they are welcome in the schools that you 
have the same concern for their children and that the staff is 
flexible willing to listen and help their children be successful 
the first challenge for ms williams and thomas has been to 
establish an active pta but few parents can afford to supplement 
many of the extracurricular activities school officials insist are 
essential so ms williams and other school officials are searching 
for corporate sponsors too 
thomas has persuaded howard universitys school of education to 
establish a partnership with nalle to provide educational 
counseling staff development and cultural enrichment opportunities 
for faculty students and parents 
nalle currently has five parent partners assisting teachers 
in the school the parents usually start out as volunteers and 
later are paid small stipends to work about four hours twice a week 
helen williams a parent who has volunteered worked as a parent 
partner and now is an aide she has a fifth grader at nalle and 
her oldest son attended 
i know a lot of parents who dont work and could come up and 
help the teachers said mrs williams who is not related to the 
principal but a lot of them didnt finish school and figure they 
cant teach the children because they dont know a lot of things 
themselves 
ms williams the principal said some of the parents have 
values different from those taught in the school 
children go by peer pressure and the code of the street you 
dont talk about things that go on she said but those things 
cannot exist here at a public school you come in and if theres a 
problem we will talk about it were going to listen and were 
going to try to guide the kid to understand we dont want to put 
the home down but as i say to parents we have a standard and we 
must measure up to the standard

the white house will review all the 
governments overseas broadcasts to determine what changes should 
be made in response to political upheaval in eastern europe 
the review to be headed by the national security council will 
examine the radio programs of the voice of america and of radio 
free europe and radio liberty according to a letter from president 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
the president strongly shares your view that the dramatic 
opening of eastern europe and the soviet union requires us to look 
afresh at all our broadcasting activities scowcroft wrote rep 
dante fascell chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
among its other tasks the review panel will consider a 
suggestion by fascell that a presidential commission be appointed 
to offer recommendations about the longterm future of the radio 
stations scowcroft said 
since world war ii the administration has used its radio 
stations as instruments of foreign policy to influence events 
around the world especially in communist countries an alternative 
to the strict statecontrolled media in those countries the 
american stations drew a clandestine following of millions of 
listeners the us programs were often jammed 
voa broadcasts in 43 languages around the world radio free 
europeradio liberty based in munich targets only eastern europe 
and the soviet union their combined budgets are about 400 million 
the stations have already begun changing programming to reflect 
the changes in the communist world growing emphasis has been 
placed on howto programs that instruct listeners in onetime 
communist countries about life in the western world 
special emphasis is placed on programs about starting up 
businesses and callin shows with experts on such subjects as 
writing constitutions and laws 
members of congress have proposed a bill that would reexamine 
the direction of the governments broadcasting which has been hit 
by increasing budget problems in recent years 
testifying at a house hearing on the subject last week rep 
james scheuer dny urged that the mission of the radio stations 
be changed 
it simply doesnt make sense to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars to increase our ability to penetrate eastern europe 
when they probably will be showing the cbs evening news or cnn 
and probably even the cosby show on their networks within a few 
years scheuer said

australians voted in parliamentary 
elections today and preliminary returns showed a tie between prime 
minister bob hawkes governing labor party and andrew peacocks 
conservative opposition 
hawke said he will remain as a caretaker prime minister until 
official election results are released the voting was so close 
the election may not be decided until thursday when postal ballots 
are counted 
computer projections gave hawkes ruling party 73 seats two 
short of the majority it needs to form a government in the 148seat 
house of representatives peacocks coalition was also expected to 
capture 73 seats with independents taking parliaments other two 
seats 
a preliminary count of 82 percent of the ballots also showed the 
liberal and labor parties running neckandneck television 
stations said 
labor had 85 seats entering the election peacocks liberal 
party 45 and its coalition partner the national party 18 seats 
speaking to reporters after the ballots closed hawke sounded 
confident that his party would win an unprecedented fourth 
consecutive term 
when the counting is finalized i will on behalf of the 
australian labor party be in a position to form a government he 
said 
but peacock also said that he was optimistic that his party 
would capture the vote i still think we are in with a very 
decent chance said peacock who is making his second bid for 
prime minister 
we are quite optimistic and believe we will shortly be in a 
position to form a government he said 
television commentators said the election could be decided by 
2500 voters stranded by a hurricane in kennedy a small town in 
the northern state of queensland they will cast their votes on 
sunday when floodwaters clear 
forty of the 70 senate seats were also contested todaybut the 
results will probably not be known for two weeks because of the 
complicated voting system 
australia has 106 million eligible voters among its 165 
million people and voting is compulsory 
the election concentrated on australias economic policies and 
an opposition victory would not dramatically affect foreign policy 
australia is a close us ally and president bush said he hoped 
to visit the country before the years end 
hawke said a victory for his 7yearold administration would 
allow it to complete its economic reforms 
australias sagging economy has been the focus of a largely 
uneventful fiveweek campaign during which peacock claimed hawkes 
policies werent working and that the country faced a recession 
hawke the nations most enduring and popular labor party 
leader campaigned on his record of economic reform even though 
the foreign debt has grown to 100 billion 
peacock has criticized the government because of the countrys 
high home mortgage interest rates now at a record 18 percent 
hawke came to power in 1983 was reelected the following year 
and again in 1987 he has said that if reelected in this race he 
will seek a fifth term before retiring

when swedes voted in a referendum 10 
years ago to phase out nuclear energy they thought they put the 
question to rest 
they were wrong 
many in this country which depends on nuclear power for half 
its electricity are having second thoughts about the decision to 
stop building new reactors and to close the 12 existing atomic 
power stations by the year 2010 
a recent poll said 54 percent of 2500 swedes queried wanted to 
keep nuclear power after 2010 compared with 30 percent four years 
ago 
friday was the 10th anniversary of the passage of the 
referendum it brought new calls to rethink the idea of closing the 
first reactor in 1995 and a second in 1996 
in a possible sign they want to back out of the timetable 
environment minister birgitta dahl and industry minister rune molin 
wrote in a joint article that their no 1 priority was to protect 
full employment 
the day the dismantling leads to loss of jobs factories 
closing and rationing electricity the nuclear power lobby will win 
its strongest arguments they wrote in fridays dagens nyheter 
daily 
the two who have been at loggerheads in the past over energy 
policy promised to come up with a longterm strategy later this 
year 
advocates of nuclear power cite tightened safety regulations 
the safety and security have been extraordinarily good said bo 
wergens a leader in swedens profitable pulp and paper industry 
it relies heavily on nuclear power which is relatively cheap 
critics note that in swedens frigid climate most homes are 
overheated and homeowners barely notice the bill by some 
estimates closing the stations would double the consumer cost of 
electricity 
the debate on nuclear energy dominated politics here for nearly 
a decade it was partly responsible for the ouster of the social 
democrats in 1976 after 44 unbroken years in power 
the issue is still so contentious that the three nonsocialist 
opposition parties failed to unite in a coalition last month to 
replace the social democrats who quit over economic policy the 
social democrats returned to office by default 
the 1980 referendum was called a few months after the nuclear 
accident at three mile island in the united states reinforcement 
came in 1986 when the explosion at the chernobyl plant in the 
soviet union sent a cloud of contamination over central sweden 
but despite lessened fears today the antinuclear lobby is 
still strong dozens of blackclad women gathered outside prime 
minister ingvar carlssons office friday carrying pictures of 
children over the slogan innocents in a radioactive world 
we think nuclear power is dangerous that sweden and all other 
countries should abstain from it as soon as possible said 
christer skaneberg a legislator for the environment party 
the right signal would be for the government to close one 
reactor this year said lennart daleus arguing that sweden has a 
surplus of energy daleus led the antinuclear campaign in the 
referendum 
the government has been debating how to replace nuclear power 
the other half of swedens power is hydroelectric but the 
environmentally conscious swedes also passed legislation forbidding 
the exploitation of the remaining pristine rivers of northern 
sweden 
concerns of global warming which scientists believe is caused 
by high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere prompted other 
regulations to reduce emissions oilfueled stations which in the 
1970s supplied 40 percent of the electricity today are used as 
peakhour supplements

in the streets tax protesters burn margaret 
thatchers effigy and in the inner sanctums of her nervous 
conservative party there is talk of trying to dump her this autumn 
in the latest blow the conservatives have suffered their most 
spectacular byelection defeat in 50 years losing the 
traditionally staunch tory district of midstaffordshire to the 
opposition labor party by a landslide 
even after fridays humiliation mrs thatchers closest 
supporters are convinced she will ultimately triumph but the 
thatcherite freemarket revolution has hit its roughest patch since 
she swept to power in 1979 
mrs thatcher has weathered tough spells before but this time 
things look dangerously different for the prime minister who has 
dominated britain through the 1980s and challenged every 
institution from the welfare state through lawyers monopolies to 
the labor unions 
what began as a blip in inflation in the spring of 1988 has 
burgeoned into a crisis undermining the core of her political 
success the sense she gave millions of britons even those who 
did not like her that they were better off with her 
thatcher aides argue that the byelection defeat was largely a 
traditional midterm protest but it is an ominous protest in which 
a tory majority of 14654 became a labor majority of 9449 a 
swing of 214 percent 
there was never a widespread acceptance of her enterprise 
culture robert skidelsky professor of international studies at 
warwick university said in an interview 
but she was accepted as a very strong leader someone who had 
got the economy under control and brought a tremendous increase in 
living standards in real terms suddenly all that has started 
to come unstuck and her strongest claim to rule is undermined 
in the past 20 months a doubling of interest rates in an 
attempt to curb inflation has sent the cost of home loans and other 
credit soaring 
hardesthit are millions of new homeowners small businesses and 
skilled bluecollar workers people who symbolize thatcherism 
itself 
meanwhile inflation just 33 percent two years ago remains 
above 7 percent 
in the beginning i thought her ideas were brilliant said 
sheila jackson who lives with her husband a 230aweek 
plasterer and two children on a public housing estate in weymouth 
southern england 
we were going to buy our house this year now thats on hold 
because of the interest payments you feel youre getting 
nowhere with her im ashamed to say i voted for her 
this sudden loss of spending power is worsened by a property tax 
reform that was supposed to be thatcherisms master stroke but is 
looking like a serious political miscalculation 
by changing the system from graded levies on property to a 
straight head tax on every adult mrs thatcher thought she could 
show voters that tories run local government more cheaply than the 
labor socialists 
instead the socalled poll tax is costing the average household 
about onethird more 1107 from april 1 
demonstrators have fought running battles with police and 
invaded town halls all over england the conservatives have sunk to 
their lowest ratings for nearly two decades 21 points behind labor 
the 64yearold prime minister faces a fundamental quandary she 
has built her prestige on a refusal to shirk unpopular measures for 
the sake of popularity to back down is simply not in her nature 
but unless she relents on the tax she will alienate voters as 
well as members of her own party who fear for their seats in the 
next election 
many britons have long regarded europes first woman prime 
minister as dogmatic bossy and extreme surveys marking her 10th 
anniversary in power last may showed majorities still oppose some 
key tenets of her mission to demolish socialism such as selling 
off stateowned industries and reforming the national health 
education and legal systems 
but until now the grocers daughter from grantham central 
england could demonstrate that whatever the intelligentsia 
thought she was in touch with ordinary people tough on crime 
patriotic enough to wage war for an obscure colony like the 
falkland islands strong enough to face down powerful trade unions 
the new tax has made even her staunchest supporters wonder 
it was a blunder putting at risk for the first time mrs 
thatchers claim to be the authentic voice of middle england 
peregrine worsthorne commented in londons rightwing sunday 
telegraph 
no one is writing off mrs thatchers chances of leading the 
conservatives to an unprecedented fourth successive victory at the 
next election which must be held by mid1992 
i am very happy in the business i do very happy indeed she 
said recently 
last november however she faced a challenger for the first 
time at the annual election of party leader although she won 
handsomely there is now at least a possibility her critics will 
try again this year if she loses she automatically ceases to be 
prime minister 
the idea that mrs margaret thatcher may no longer be prime 
minister by the autumn must now be taken seriously said the 
respected weekly the economist 
the favorite as successor is michael heseltine 57 a 
charismatic former defense secretary who projects himself as the 
tory who will usher in a kinder gentler postthatcherite age 
thatcher aides argue that inflation and interest rates will 
inevitably fall by years end if only because the government must 
create a preelection recovery but even then mrs thatcher seems 
in for a much tougher ride 
she is in some ways a victim of her own successes 
many britons have forgotten or never knew life without her when 
britain was plagued by strikes inflation touched 26 percent and 
the top income tax rate was 83 percent 
now more than twothirds of britons own their homes compared 
with 50 percent in 1979 stock holders have trebled to 9 million 
largely through sales of stateowned enterprises including british 
airways the national phone company and british gas 
the average britons earnings now 388 a week have risen by 26 
percent in real terms since 1979 according to official figures

an east german newspaper on saturday reported 
the discovery of mass graves of thousands of people who died at a 
former soviet prison camp set up after world war ii it said many 
were innocent civilians 
the dead included nazi war prisoners such as members of the 
paramilitary ss nazi party officials and soldiers in hitlers 
army berliner zeitung reported 
but among the victims were many innocent people and 
children it reported the youngest victim was 12 years old it 
quoted a surviving inmate as saying there was no word on how the 
victims died 
a local historian discovered the remains this month at the camp 
which was in fuenfeichen 80 miles north of east berlin it was run 
by the dreaded nkvd state security force a forerunner of the 
soviet kgb according to the report 
berliner zeitung quoted west german estimates that 65000 men 
women and children died in red army imprisonment at the end of 
world war ii it likened the stalinist terror to nazi death 
camps 
the report accompanied by a graphic photograph of a skeleton 
would have been impossible until the peaceful revolt that toppled 
east germanys hardline communist regime in october and set the 
country on course for democracy 
east germany formed out of sovietoccupied germany after the 
fall of hitlers third reich was a particularly staunch soviet 
ally for decades but now is dealing publicly with its past this 
includes reports on brutality in the postwar period when the 
soviet bloc was in the iron grip of kremlin chief josef stalin 
berliner zeitung noted that many german communists and 
socialists were also killed in soviet camps 
nearby residents and farmers knew about fuenfeichen but kept 
silent until now the paper said 
the camp was in operation from april 1945 until october 1948 
many inmates were taken to the soviet union when the red army 
closed the camp and were never heard from again the report said 
it said one prisoner who died had just been released from a nazi 
camp and was arrested by the soviets because he resisted the 
expropriation of his home

wheelwright high school may be tucked in 
a remote corner of rural eastern kentucky but these days its 
students are trading information and greetings with counterparts 
everywhere from homer alaska to bogota and london 
but these modernday penpals are communicating by computer not 
paper and pen 
kisha cotton 17 wrote about growing up in a rural appalachian 
hollow and her first encounter with racism at a beauty pagent the 
essay was posted on a computer bulletin board and read by students 
across the world miss cotton who is black was astonished at some 
of the responses 
some of the kids said they never met a black person or got a 
letter from one said miss cotton some of the kids didnt know 
black kids went to school with white kids 
the experience will help her handle racism when she leaves home 
for college next fall she said 
the computer conferences some carefully structured around a 
single subject others more loosely organized to allow students to 
communicate on various topics are organized by the breadnet 
computer network based at middlebury college in vermont schools 
use their own computers to link up with the central computer at 
middlebury 
a core group of about 60 schools is taking part in the general 
program while other schools are taking part in singletopic 
conferences said hugh coyle administrative director of 
middleburys bread loaf school of english 
students at wheelwright high are amoung about 70 groups around 
the world currently involved in a conference on environmental 
issues called world class said william w wright jr 
breadnet director 
it does bring some of the kids alive it engages them and 
sparks active learning said wright using technology this way 
has engaged students in a way that video does not 
the participants here shared some of the messages received from 
other countries some students in toronto canada facetiously 
noted that its hard to imagine that inside our freezing igloos 
we find space for a computer they added that they were taking 
part in the environmental exchange to make the world a better and 
cleaner place 
while the canadians cited concerns about acid rain a group of 
geography students from the united arab emirates sent in 
information about the land and history of the middle east and the 
environmental problems raised by rapid population growth and 
pollution generated by the oil industry 
conferences run several weeks and follow a structured format 
students read magazine articles and work in groups to pose 
questions for experts or answer queries from other students the 
teams also use the network to research a specific topic such as 
depletion of the earths ozone layer 
they send facts we dont know about and we send facts they 
dont know about said haley caudill 18 gathered with what we 
have it really helps with a better understanding 
sen albert gore dtenn will be an online guest monday 
and tuesday to respond to students questions on the environment 
said wright 
breadnet was created in 1984 as part of a summer graduate 
program for rural high school teachers at middlebury besides 
letting students interact by computer the network enables rural 
teachers to stay abreast of changes in the their profession and 
serves as a support group after they return home said wright 
wheelwright teacher carol stumbo whose journalism class is 
working on breadnet described the students enthusiasm as 
contagious 
they have managed to get the entire school involved to some 
degree she said 
having them hooked up is very important because you can do two 
things ms stumbo said you can give them a sense of where 
theyre from and you can broaden them 
principal lonnie slone called the computer conferences one of 
the greatest things to happen at the school 
when you live in floyd county at the head of left beaver you 
might feel a bit isolated sloan said but with this system 
youre in a community inspired by environmental issues discussed 
on breadnet wheelwright students organized an essay contest and a 
cleanup project on beaver creek which runs in front of the school 
they persuaded the city council in this town of 850 people to 
proclaim april 22 as earth day 
early next month breadnet will launch a writing conference 
addressing racial stereotypes called across ethnic lines 
students in about 30 classrooms from moscow idaho to lima peru 
will take part 
wheelwright high school students still busy on their 
environmental project wont be participating in the ethnic 
project but just by participating in breadnet they have helped 
weaken their own stereotype of eastern kentucky as a region of 
illiterate hillbillies said slone 
they realize theyre just like all other students all over the 
world said slone

of working americans 
the democrats must find common ground as the party of those

jackson told the annual convention of the democratic leadership 
council that all factions of the party must come together he said 
that was possible because democrats are increasingly united on such 
issues as choice in abortion fighting crime and drugs and 
government aid to those in need 
were talking about mainstream values and thats a wider 
stream than many thought jackson said if its morally right 
it cant be politically wrong for long he also told the group 
however that civil rights do not represent a privilege 
jackson said that in the past democrats have questioned whether 
they could win as the party of inclusion he said some 
progressives wanted to start a third party following ronald 
reagans victory and the republican capture of the senate a decade 
ago 
meanwhile democrats argued that the party would benefit by 
excluding or attacking socalled special interest 
we contended that we had to stay and build a rainbow 
coalition jackson said make our party bigger and stronger 
he said registration drives brought in a bumper crop of new voters 
who helped the party regain control of the senate in 1986 
the mainstream is becoming a mighty river uniting many 
streams jackson said 
earlier virginia gov l douglas wilder told the group that all 
democrats must strongly support the partys presidential nominee in 
1992 
the meeting of the leadership council formed by conservative 
and moderate democrats to counter the partys purported leftward 
drift occurs as the partys governing democratic national 
committee continues its spring meeting in indianapolis 
wilder the nations first black elected governor told the 
council those who lose our primaries must reject the temptation 
to cling to a sense of personal injury and defeat they must unite 
behind the partys candidate 
texas sen lloyd bentsen a potential candidate in 1992 was 
warmly received by the 900 people at the dlc conference friday as 
he led attacks on the republican administration 
speakers accused president bush of timidity in foreign policy 
and hypocrisy on taxes bentsen said the presidents proposed 
budget contains 20 million in cryptotaxes disguised as user 
fees surcharges and other levies he called bushs repeated 
nonewtaxes stance as pure bushlips 
asked about 1992 he said he is not planning a run for the 
presidency the 69yearold senator was the democratic nominee for 
vice president in 1988 
democratic chairman ron brown divided his time friday between 
new orleans and indianapolis and denied the scheduling conflict 
between the dlc and the dnc was a sign of party division 
he also denied his disagreement with bentsen over sen daniel 
patrick moynihans proposed cut in social security payroll taxes 
showed a lack of party unity 
brown called friday for the party to endorse the moynihan plan 
bentsen said a rollback of last years social security tax increase 
might be in order but that moynihans cut at 50 billion would 
be too costly 
just because we dont have every i dotted and every t 
crossed doesnt mean we are not unified brown said were 
having an open and honest discussion about very complicated 
matters 
house majority leader richard gephardt of missouri chided bush 
for failing to react strongly to changes in central america 
eastern europe and the soviet union 
our president refuses to risk not even one percentage point of 
his 82 percent popularity polls to ask us to do what needs to be 
done gephardt told the council

the hatchings of two healthy california 
condors late last week and the possibility of eight to 10 chicks in 
all this breeding season could accelerate the program to return the 
endangered species to the wild a zoo official said 
a 58ounce bird named kareya from the karok indian word 
meaning creator of all things emerged at 430 am friday the 
first of the vulturelike chicks to hatch at the los angeles zoo 
said spokeswoman cindy richardson its gender wont be known for 
about three months 
kareyas hatching came only a little more than 24 hours after 
the second chick of the 1990 breeding season honsi was hatched 
early thursday at the san diego wild animal park 
it was less than two years ago that the first california condor 
chick was hatched after being bred in captivity a chick named 
molloko was hatched at san diego on april 29 1988 amid national 
fanfare 
the latest hatchings nudged the total population of the species 
to 35 all in the two zoos there were only 27 known california 
condors when all were taken into captivity for breeding in 1987 
scientists are trying to breed enough of the birds which can 
have a wingspan of nearly 10 feet to begin returning some to their 
natural habitat 
wildlife officials had planned on releasing the first of the 
condors sometime between 1993 and 1995 but michael wallace 
curator for birds at the los angeles zoo said the captive breeding 
program has achieved such success that the first birds could be 
released in the los padres national forest next year 
officials hope to establish a wild flock there while they keep a 
healthy captive flock he said other release areas could include 
the grand canyon or northern california 
two eggs are under incubation in los angeles and four in san 
diego making for a possible record breeding season wallace said 
the incubation period for condor eggs is about two months 
under the captive breeding program four chicks were hatched 
last year in addition to the one hatched in 1988 the condors 
breeding season runs from january through april in 1984 eight 
eggs were taken from the wild and hatched 
were hoping for between eight to 10 youngsters this year 
wallace said 
kareya like honsi appeared healthy and hungry zoo officials 
said 
its had its first feeding of minced mice wallace said

headquarters in podujevo surrounded saturday by at least 40 
policemen in battle gear he said police carrying submachine guns

as word of lawsuits against nutrisystem inc 
spreads the telephones at a law firm here handling the case are 
getting a workout 
hundreds of calls have been logged from dieters complaining of 
gallbladder problems or seeking information after shedding pounds 
under the nutrisystem regime of specialty prepackaged foods 
this phone stays on my ear constantly said attorney robert 
fiore who is representing some of the 19 women who filed separate 
suits last week weve received calls from all over the united 
states and canada were just trying to deal with the influx now 
the company defends its program as safe and says the gallbladder 
problems are coincidental 
although fiore said he was unprepared for the response some 
experts in diet and nutrition say theyve spent years studying the 
perils of obesity and rapid weight loss both of which can affect 
the gallbladder and blood pressure 
but they say the popular nutrisystem program should not singled 
out it can provide several hundred more calories a day above some 
liquid diets the focus of several studies on gallbladder problems 
as a nation we are grossly overweight and that is a problem in 
itself said miami dietitian joyce julien but often these 
extremely lowcalorie diets can lead to an increase in gallstones 
and hypertension i think these suits are just the tip of the 
iceberg 
presently there are no direct federal regulations on the 5 
billion a year commercial diet industry on monday however a 
congressional committee will hold the first of a series of hearings 
on those promising a quick path to slim bodies 
among those scheduled to testify before the committee on small 
business are federal trade commission chairman janet steiger 
several physicians and former followers of extremely lowcalorie 
diets some under 1000 calories a day 
its a wideopen field right now said d ann murphy a 
staff member of the us house subcommittee on regulation business 
opportunities and energy the public is so interested in quick 
loss that theres tremendous opportunity for abuse 
nutrisystem has nearly 1600 weightloss centers in all 50 
states canada the united kingdom and australia it offers a 
1000 to 1500calorieaday meal program and can cost several 
hundred dollars to enroll depending on weightloss goals and 
special promotions offered 
the dade circuit court suits against nutrisystem claim the 
companys weightloss program caused gallstones and led to surgical 
removal of the organ which produces and stores bile used in 
digestion 
the company one of the nations most heavily marketed diet 
programs said the suits are without merit it claimed the risk of 
gallbladder disease among the obese can be reduced by prudent 
dieting 
theres been many studies to show that overweight people have 
a higher incidence of gallbladder problems said nutrisystem 
spokesman james kemper millard at the companys willow grove pa 
headquarters we just want the facts out we dont want this to 
be another martians have landed story 
the company is privately held and does not release financial 
reports 
millard said nutrisystems encourages about a twopoundaweek 
weight loss 
the american medical association does not set a standard or 
limit for weight reduction the 60000member american dietetic 
association recommends rapid weightloss programs only for those 
more than 30 percent overweight 
the consensus is that there appears to be a link between rapid 
weight loss and gallbladder problems but it dosent necessarily 
have to be a diet by a company it could be something the person 
goes on themselves said dr georgia andrianopoulos an assistant 
professor at the university of illinois obesity treatment center 
nancy wellman president of the american dietetic association 
said some of the reported gallbladder problems could be from people 
who cut back on established diets such as nutrisystem 
we are a country where most problems can be solved in a 
halfhour tv show said wellman too many people opt for the 
quick solution to lose weight without worrying about the 
consequences

the deep south is wringing itself out 
after a week of flooding turned entire towns into muddy lakes where 
buildings poked up like knotty tree stumps but the toll of 
shattered lives is mounting 
about 6000 people lost their homes or had property damage in 
alabama federal officials estimated saturday hundreds more had to 
seek shelter in georgia and the florida panhandle where swirling 
floodwaters kept emergency crews on alert through the weekend 
florida gov bob martinez toured the floodravaged farming town 
of caryville on saturday he promised housetohouse damage 
assessments portable toilets drinking water and food 
emergency management officials said flooding did more than 100 
million in damage in alabama and high water there and in georgia 
was blamed for 15 deaths mostly people whose cars sank on 
submerged roads 
searchers in south alabama continued to look saturday for army 
spec mary helen garrison 21 missing since march 18 her car was 
found submerged in a ditch tuesday 
the southeastern alabama town of elba which lies along the 
banks of the pea river was hit hardest by the flooding the town 
was submerged under about 12 feet of brown trashfilled water when 
its earthen levee collapsed early march 17 after 16 inches of rain 
fell in two days 
nearly half of elbas 4400 residents had to be evacuated and 
most could not begin returning to homes and businesses for three 
days legal records turned into soggy mush as water reached the 
second floor of the coffee county courthouse 
a lifetime of hard work for some disappeared into the raging 
floodwaters alabama gov guy hunt said saturday in his weekly 
radio address a lot of our people have never witnessed such 
devastation from flood before 
raging floodwaters also washed out dozens of roads and bridges 
in southern alabama 
volunteers in geneva located downstream from elba saved that 
citys levee only by working feverishly in a human chain pitching 
sandbags for two days 
the flooding reached into western alabama where waters rose to 
the ceiling inside brewton city hall and in the central part of 
the state coffins bobbed to the surface from shallow graves when a 
cemetery flooded in selma and about 160 animals had to be taken to 
higher ground when the montgomery humane society flooded 
president bush declared elba and the rest of coffee county a 
disaster area wednesday making residents eligible for lowinterest 
loans and grants to cover uninsured losses on friday 25 alabama 
counties were added to the declaration 
youre talking about damage that would take years and years 
and years to repair said robert crowder commission chairman in 
houston county 
country singer hank williams jr pledged receipts from an april 
1 concert in birmingham to the relief effort hunt said officials 
in charleston sc which is still recovering six months after a 
battering from hurricane hugo also offered aid 
while most of the water receded from elba florida panhandle 
residents to the south were fording floodcovered streets hoping 
to find their homes intact 
it just kind of stuns you a little bit said lamar fortune 
of caryville fla the lumber worker had to wade through 2 feet of 
brown water late in the week to get home after the choctawhatchee 
river expanded out of its banks 
in georgia where four died in floodrelated traffic accidents 
macon residents were urged to boil drinking water after the 
ocmulgee river surged into a sewage treatment plant raw sewage 
poured directly into the chattahoochee river in atlanta and 
columbus because of flooded treatment facilities 
but the flooding seemed especially cruel in alabama where 
unending waves of severe weather have killed 35 people since 
midnovember including at least 11 in the past week twenty people 
died when a tornado rampaged through huntsville in north alabama in 
november and five died in a christmas cold snap that included 
windchill factors of 40 degrees below zero 
violent weather is nothing new to the south which has regular 
brushes with tornadoes hurricanes cropkilling freezes and 
flooding but to have such a cluster of wicked weather is unusual 
said paul pettit a national weather service meterologist in 
montgomery 
and were really not out of the flood season march april and 
may are the prime time for severe weather in alabama said pettit

gov mario cuomo expanded new yorks 
shield law on saturday to protect the news media from having to 
surrender to the courts most information collected by reporters and 
television crews 
enactment of the bill is particularly appropriate this year as 
we celebrate the bicentennial of the first amendment cuomo said 
in signing the legislation since 1735 when peter zenger was 
acquitted of libel charges new york has led the way in the 
protection of freedom of the press 
cuomo a democrat who is expected to seek election this year to 
a third term announced his action just before speaking at a 
meeting of the new york state society of newspaper editors 
while new yorks shield law adopted in 1970 had protected 
information gathered on a confidential basis from sources recent 
state court rulings had said there was no such protection for 
information gathered without a promise of confidentiality 
under the expanded law unpublished information or that supplied 
without a pledge of confidentiality doesnt have to be given up by 
news organizations in most circumstances a court could still order 
the information divulged if it determined the material was critical 
to a case and not obtainable from any alternative source 
the bill strikes an appropriate balance between the principle 
of a free press embodied in the first amendment and a defendants 
right to a fair trial said cuomo 
the legislation was passed 475 on wednesday by the 
republicancontrolled state senate in january the 
democratcontrolled assembly had approved it 11911 
the legislation gives new york one of the strictest protections 
for journalists of any state in the nation according to lawyers 
for several news organizations 
a similar bill failed to pass the state senate by two votes in 
the waning hours of the legislative session last year 
as was the case in 1989 the opposition to the legislation this 
year was led by state sen emanuel gold 
i dont think theres a newspaper in the world that doesnt 
preach in favor of good citizenship said gold a new york city 
democrat it seems in some situations the newspapers cant be 
bothered by the requirements of good citizenship 
cuomo noted that approval of the legislation was pushed by the 
new york publishers association the new york state broadcasters 
association capital citiesabc cbs nbc the associated press and 
the gannett co

the chairman of a house panel studying the 
health of the nations 17 trillion pension system praised a labor 
department proposal designed to crack down on fraud and abuse in 
the system 
rep tom lantos dcalif who is chairman of the house 
government operations employment and housing subcommittee called 
labor secretary elizabeth doles plan prompt and inclusive 
in the past members of congress have criticized the way the 
labor department policed the nations pension system and suggested 
that fraud and abuse could rival the savings and loan crisis 
the labor departments proposal outlined last week in a letter 
to lantos panel increases fines for fraudulent transactions and 
makes it easier for employees to bring lawsuits against pension 
fund trustees who mismanage assets it also provides rewards for 
people who inform the government of fund violations 
some of the changes stemmed from recommendations from acting 
labor department inspector general raymond maria who has been 
feuding with the agency over the way it investigates pension fraud 
they went twice as far as we thought they would lisa 
phillips an aide to lantos subcommittee said friday 
phillips predicted some lawmakers would try to go farther by 
adding provisions to provide greater protection of pension payments 
when companies terminate plans to capture their surplus assets 
labor department spokeswoman johanna schneider said the agency 
would have to review further changes before taking a position 
under the departments plan employees who win suits against 
trustees who mismanaged pension plans would have their legal fees 
paid by the trustees personally rather than through pension assets 
in addition the plan lets mrs dole pay a bounty to 
informers of as much as 10 percent of any fines collected by the 
government for pension violations penalties for illegal 
transactions would increase to 10 percent of the amount of the 
transaction fines are now 5 percent of the transaction 
the agencys plan also implements new audit procedures that 
require accountants to do a full audit of pension plans on their 
own rather than relying on the statements of state examiners 
mrs dole already has asked congress to add 100 enforcement 
officers to the departments pension and welfare benefits 
administration 
the labor proposal does not include marias recommendation that 
the inspector generals office be allowed to pursue criminal 
investigations of pension and welfare fund violations maria wanted 
congress to in effect overturn a justice department ruling that 
prohibited inspectors general from conducting criminal 
investigations 
phillips said the house subcommittee was not likely to go 
against the labor department on the issue because lawmakers 
considered it a turf war between the justice department and 
inspectors general 
maria had known he was not going to be named to the post 
permanently president bush last week nominated julian de la rosa 
executive secretary of the st louis police board as his 
replacement

serenaded by auld lang syne 
the last indian soldiers withdrew from this northeastern port city 
saturday after a deadlocked 2yearold jungle war against tamil 
guerrillas 
sri lankas navy band played and its honor guard unsheathed 
swords as the 2000 indian soldiers the last of an estimated 
125000 marched aboard the troop carrier magar which left for 
madras in southern india 
the departure was a week ahead of the pullout deadline 
you have made a great sacrifice there is no doubt about 
that sri lankan defense minister ranjan wijeratne told the 
troops 
at least 1115 indian troops died fighting the liberation tigers 
of tamil eelam the largest tamil militant group fighting sri 
lankas sinhalesedominated government for an independent homeland 
about 10000 sri lankans have died in the insurgency which 
started in 1983 
as the troop carrier chugged out into the bay tamil tigers 
patrolled trincomalees streets along with sri lankan soldiers and 
police 
india which also has a large tamil minority sent soldiers into 
sri lanka in july 1987 to help enforce a treaty that granted the 
tamil minority limited autonomy in the northeast if they put down 
their weapons 
the tigers refused to do so and began battling the indian 
soldiers 
president ranasinghe premadasa of sri lanka reached an agreement 
with the tamil tigers last summer and asked india to withdraw its 
troops by july 27 1989 the second anniversary of the peace accord 
india stalled on the request saying a rapid withdrawal could 
lead to a bloodbath but in his election campaign last fall 
indias new prime minister vp singh promised to withdraw the 
troops a deadline of march 31 was set 
the sun a leading sri lankan newspaper said the withdrawal 
signals the end of a chapter that is historic as much as 
traumatic to this nation and its people for most people in this 
country the ultimate withdrawal of the indian troops is a joyous 
scent 
many indian newspapers criticized the military operation 
accusing their government of fighting somebody elses dirty 
war others called it a military disaster because india did not 
succeed in disarming the tamil separatists 
the tigers now control the area indian soldiers once occupied a 
senior leader of the guerrilla organization contacted by 
telephone said the tigers had no immediate comment on the pullout 
the leader who spoke on condition of anonymity was reached in the 
tigerheld town of jaffna 
the soldiers morale is high we dont think we have lost a 
war were just obeying orders said an indian commando on the 
trincomalee dock pushing back his red beret to wipe sweat from his 
forehead 
in addition to the indiantamil violence the july 1987 accord 
also sparked a backlash by ultranationalist sinhalese who felt the 
tamils had been given too many concessions they began a violent 
campaign that has left at least 6000 people dead since 1987 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people the predominantly buddhist sinhalese make up 75 
percent of the population tamils claim they suffer discrimination 
india became involved in the conflict because of the sympathies 
of its own politically powerful tamil population most indian 
tamils live in the southern state of tamil nadu which is separated 
from sri lanka by a stretch of sea 20 miles wide

campaign rivalries were played out in 
poster wars before sundays parliamentary election some 
observations on the last few days of the campaign and related 
events 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
party militants vented their emotions in the poster war 
rivals competed in papering over each others ads and some wags 
livened up placards they found too staid 
one wit looking ahead to the day after the elections couldnt 
resist a poster by the hungarian democratic forum a centrist party 
with a strong following to the placard boasting today the mdf 
is tomorrow he added but the day after youre yesterday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one of the few controversies of the campaign centered around 
another forum poster that critics said awakened thoughts of 
violence the poster showed the back of the head of a bullnecked 
soviet officer with the russian phrase comrades its all over 
with a fullscale pullout of red army troops in progress and a 
general diminishing of soviet influence in hungarys internal 
affairs democratic forum officials said the message was meant to 
signal the end of an era but numerous hungarians including 
socialist party chairman rezsoe nyers a reformed communist said 
the phrase and imagery bring forth associations of lining an enemy 
up against the wall and shooting him in the back of the head 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most communist images red stars lenin statues and hammers and 
sickles have been removed from view across hungary over the past 
few months but a plea to save at least some of the communist 
legacy came from an unexpected quarter 
the league of young democrats the first opposition party to 
openly challenge communist rule wants a park created for all the 
displaced lenin statues given that the founder of bolshevism is 
almost always shown pointing ahead into the communist future the 
park would have scores of lenin statutes their fingers pointing 
accusingly at each other

for at least one public figure sundays elections are even more 
historic than is generally thought interim president matyas 
szueroes considered them the first truly democratic vote in 1100 
years 
in hungarys 1100year history in central europe these 
elections will be unique in a sense szueroes said saturday in 
his election message this will be our first true opportunity to 
decide vote and choose freely 
szueroes apparently was alluding to contraints on voters even 
during the period of parliamentary democracy that began in 1848 and 
ended during world war ii

vice president guillermo ford of panama said 
saturday his new government is moving quickly to stifle the 
laundering of drug profits through panamas banks 
at a joint news conference with attorney general dick 
thornburgh ford declared were partners in a joint venture we 
are committed to this battle 
ford who last week lobbied congress for a 500 million aid 
package declared that the united states is not imposing anything 
on us we are cooperating on the bank issue 
already he noted the new government has enacted a law which 
imposes stiffer fines for failure to report major cash transactions 
than those faced by us banks the penalties range from 100000 
to 1 million 
ford and thornburgh met for about 30 minutes in the attorney 
generals office good friends can discuss everything in 30 
minutes ford said 
thornburgh said the most important thing we did was exchange 
phone numbers were going to be working together on drug 
trafficking and money laundering and we pledged to make available 
a number of key people to one another 
ford said were not telling the world that we are no longer 
going to be a financial center but we are going to be a decent 
honest financial center 
on thursday the house banking committee moving with unusual 
speed approved 480 a bill that would authorize the treasury 
department to revoke the charters of us banks caught laundering 
drug money bank officers could be banned from the profession for 
life 
the bill also reaches out to savings and loans credit unions 
and even statechartered banks whose federal insurance could be 
revoked 
the measure reflected congressional disappointment in the 
justice departments recent settlement of a money laundering case 
in tampa fla earlier this year 
in that instance two units of the bank of commerce and credit 
international pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy 
involving among others panamas gen manuel noriega now awaiting 
trial in miami on drug charges 
bcci agreed to forfeit 14 million in deposits and 1 million in 
interest while federal prosecutors hailed it as the largest 
criminal penalty ever imposed against a bank congressional critics 
said it wasnt enough when measured against bccis assets of more 
than 20 billion 
the institution is based in luxembourg and has offices in 73

officials said saturday they feared thousands 
of jews could be left stranded in the soviet union after the 
national soviet airline decided to stop selling tickets to emigres 
moving to israel via budapest 
the decision by aeroflot the soviet carrier followed a move by 
hungarys malev airline to suspend flights of soviet jews to israel 
due to threats of attacks by arab radicals 
we refuse to believe that the soviet union is subject to 
giving in to any type of terrorism said gad ben ari spokesman 
for the quasigovernmental jewish agency the agency is partially 
responsible for the immigration and absorption of jewish immigrants 
we really cant understand the decision and are checking to 
find out the meaning of it he said if true then it is 
definitely going to significantly damage the process of immigration 
to israel 
the majority of the thousands of soviet jews expected to 
immigrate to israel this month were scheduled to travel via 
budapest 
other smaller transit points are still open but practically 
speaking the jews are stuck said ben ari 
israeli officials said charter flights could be found to replace 
the malev flights from budapest to israel but this will not help 
if the emigres are unable to reach budapest to begin with 
hungarian officials said they cut the malev flights after 
threats from arab extremists earlier this month the proiranian 
lebanese group islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
threatened to attack any airline involved in the transport of 
soviet jews to israel 
soviet television said friday that aeroflot would not sell 
tickets to emigrants traveling to budapest from moscow leningrad 
or kiev the television said aeroflot would still transport 
businessmen and tourists 
an arabic newspaper reported friday that soviet and israeli 
officials have been visiting cyprus and greece to discuss setting 
up a maritime line to bring soviet jews to israel 
the londonbased al hayat newspaper quoted unnamed greek and 
arab sources as saying the ships could sail between the black sea 
port of odessa and the israeli port of haifa 
officials in cyprus and greece could not be reached for comment 
and under new censorship regulations israeli officials are barred 
from commenting on routes taken by new immigrants 
the soviet union has been under strong pressure from arab states 
to limit the number of jews immigrating to israel 
arab states fear that soviet immigrants will be sent to live in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip strengthening israels hold 
on the disputed territories israel says it has no policy of 
directing soviet jews to the occupied lands home to almost 17 
million palestinians 
plo chairman yasser arafat repeated his call to end soviet 
jewish immigration to israel in a statement friday 
for what reason do they come to my country instead of choosing 
canada a country still underpopulated or australia or latin 
america or the scandinavian countries or the united states 
arafat said on moroccan television 
israeli government statistics show that 16700 soviet jews 
immigrated to israel from jan 1 1989 to feb 1 1990 of those 
about 200 moved into the occupied territories about 750000 soviet 
jewish immigrants are expected in israel this decade due to eased 
exit policies in the soviet union and tighter us entrance 
requirements

the ailing 77yearold honecker and his wife margot moved 
friday from their tworoom apartment in a parish home outside east 
berlin to a betterequipped government residence about 50 miles

protesters gathered outside the new residence and created a 
dangerous situation government spokesman andreas bauer said 
west german television showed scores of irate residents 
surrounding the official motorcade as it carried the couple away 
some thumped on the roof of the honeckers car and made obscene

art lovers saw empty spaces on the walls saturday 
as the gardner museum reopened two rooms hardest hit by last weeks 
multimilliondollar art theft that has left curators worried about 
protecting works to valuable even to be insured 
the fbi has circulated composite sketches of the two thieves 
two international auction houses have posted a 1 million reward 
for information leading to the return of the works and the museum 
has received tips on their whereabouts 
the fbi has asked museum officials not to comment on the 
investigation for fear of slowing it a museum spokesman said but 
curators elsewhere are not optimistic sometimes they say art not 
recovered soon after being stolen doesnt resurface for years 
police tell us the word is out on the street that you can get 
money for art and antiquities said constance lowenthal 
executive director of the international foundation for art research 
in new york museum trustees are thinking what if this happened 
to us 
wearing police uniforms two men talked their way into the 
isabella stewart gardner museum early on march 18 and made off with 
11 paintings and prints by such artists as rembrandt degas and 
vermeer they also swiped an ancient chinese vase and a gilded 
eagle from a flagpole 
the locations where the stolen paintings were mounted will not 
be filled because of restrictions in mrs gardners will about 
changing artwork said museum spokesman barry wanger he said the 
rooms have such a profusion of artwork however that the empty 
spaces are not startling 
people visiting the museum for the first time probably wont 
notice so much he said 
considered too wellknown to be sold on to a legitimate 
collector the haul from mrs gardners collection has been 
estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars 
investigators offer several theories on why the treasures were 
stolen 
a private collector with a penchant for the priceless might have 
commissioned the theft a sort of dr no scenario that curators 
say is mostly the stuff of spy novels the lesserknown works might 
be sold on the black market and resurface in respectable galleries 
in a few years 
or most likely the thieves might ransom the treasures either 
for the reward or for insurance money though gardner officials 
revealed this week that the works were not insured for theft 
what is worrisome is that jumbo art heists seem to be increasing 
in both scale and frequency as art prices soar on the legal market 
the loss in just a few recent thefts is staggering 
oct 27 1985 five armed men steal nine impressionist 
paintings by painters such as monet renoir and berthe morisot from 
the marmottan museum in paris one of the paintings impression 
sunrise is the work that gave impressionism its name the take 
125 million at 1985 prices 
may 21 1986 thieves steal 18 paintings including vermeers 
lady writing a letter with her maid from russborough house in 
blessington ireland the take 40 million 
feb 8 1988 burglars break through a skylight into the 
colnaghi art gallery in new york city and steal 27 old master 
paintings and drawings the take 6 million 
security consultants say museums are lagging in efforts to 
prevent art theft guards hired to protect multimilliondollar 
paintings often are paid little more than minimum wage and given 
scant training 
in addition only a handful of police or federal agents across 
the country are trained to investigate art heists and 
international laws make it easy to transport works across national 
borders 
theres no duty on art lowenthal said you couldnt just 
bring 20 million in cash into the country but you could bring in 
a painting worth that much 
the biggest problem in the long run lowenthal said is that as 
more priceless works are stolen and art prices grow ever higher 
museums wont be able to replace the art they lose 
museums just cant afford to replace expensive works 
lowenthal said you can always get another warhol print you 
cant replace a vermeer

advisers to president mikhail s gorbachev are 
working on a package of drastic reforms to convert the stagnant 
centrally controlled soviet economy into a market system an 
informed source said saturday 
but they are concerned the measures could cause widespread 
unemployment and force the government to institute a sweeping 
welfare program in a country where until recently unemployment did 
not officially exist 
the main problem is how to guarantee employment and take care 
of the needy said the source who is part of the team developing 
the new proposals it all has to be worked out very carefully 
despite the note of caution the source gave no indication 
gorbachev has backed off his determination to press for radical 
measures to wrest the already sick economy from its downward slide 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
transition to a market economy might lead to a sharp increase in 
unemployment which last year reached 27 percent in some areas of 
the country he indicated the reform could make it necessary to 
initiate a widespread welfare system 
the source provided the first independent confirmation of a 
published report that a drastic 17point economic reform program 
is being forged following gorbachevs ascension to a new stronger 
presidency the report was circulated last week by the soviet 
interfax news agency an affiliate of radio moscow 
the package designed by a team of economists includes a reform 
of prices now set by state planners without regard to costs among 
other things this has led to some farmers feeding their animals 
bread which is cheaper than grain any lifting of price controls 
is expected to bring quick dramatic inflation 
the source said economists working on the plan were encouraged 
by the example of poland which decided to adopt a market system as 
quickly as possible to shorten the inevitably painful transition 
period soviet leaders have preferred to be slower and more 
cautious 
polands solidarityled government last year lifted price 
controls over a sixmonth period which led to enormous price 
increases but there are signs the initial chaotic reaction is 
abating 
inflation in poland dropped from a monthly rate of 60 percent to 
70 percent in january to a projected 6 percent in march onceempty 
stores have been stocked and the polish zloty has been made 
convertible thanks to a western aid program 
look in poland it worked the source said there are 
dangers of course and we have to be careful but we dont have 
any other choice 
one such danger is unemployment in poland the number of 
workers out of jobs jumped to 150000 and might reach 400000 as 
inefficient enterprises are closed polish experts say 
in the soviet union efforts to streamline bloated factory 
payrolls are leaving millions of people unemployed last october 
the communist party daily pravda said joblessness which officially 
didnt exist during the doctrinaire communist period reached 276 
percent in azerbaijan it was 20 percent or higher in the central 
asian republics of tadzhikistan and uzbekistan pravda said 
according to interfax the package of proposed bills and 
executive orders includes selling many governmentowned factories 
through stock sales to individuals and foreigners and making the 
ruble convertible on world currency exchanges 
immediately after his inauguration this month gorbachev pledged 
drastic economic reform western diplomats speculated he needed the 
security and powers of the fiveyear term as president to risk the 
upheaval that might accompany the measures 
interfax quoted experts as saying the public is unprepared for 
the changes contemplated 
there can be no doubt that transition to a market economy is 
our top priority said v belkin an academy of sciences 
economist what worries me is that it provides for an 
overnight introduction of the market the way they did in poland 
the model of that country may not work here because public opinion 
is not prepared to accept it 
belkin warned that serious social problems could result 
v mayevski of the academys institute of economics also warned 
of the social ramifications of the planned economic steps 
a sharp increase in prices cannot be ruled out as happened in 
poland and there may be rampant unemployment because the 
structure of production in this country is inadequate he said 
in the long run that scenario will lead to economic progress 
but before that considerable sacrifice will have to be made

an apparition of the virgin mary in yugoslavia 
that has drawn millions of believers foretold the collapse of 
communism in eastern europe say participants at conference on 
visions of the mother of jesus 
it just seems too coincidental to have her appear and then all 
of a sudden the communist regime starts falling apart said 
robert lacher 54 of wexford 
the twoday eastern regional conference on visions of the virgin 
mary started saturday at duquesne university the conference is 
focusing on the increased number of reported messages and what 
believers see as their tie to communisms collapse sponsors said 
the recent spate of visions of mary and apparitions defined as 
the apparent touching and talking with the virgin started in 1981 
in the yugoslavian city of medjugorje when a group of six 
youngsters heard her message said john okeefe of the our lady of 
peace ministries in pittsburgh 
since then more than 16 million people have traveled to the 
city said the rev kenneth j roberts of florissant mo 
another apparition reported was by a 12yearold girl and her 
mother in hrushiw ukraine on april 26 1987 one year to the hour 
after the chernobyl nuclear accident in the ukraine a soviet 
republic another reported message was to a housewife in na ju 
south korea sponsors said 
the roman catholic church is investigating all three 
apparitions the church has officially recognized previously 
reported messages from the virgin mary but they approved them only 
after the visions had stopped roberts said 
in fact catholic priets and nuns are the most skeptical of 
these current apparitions he said 
roberts claims he had a vision during march 1988 on one of his 
many visits to medjugorje he first saw the pulsating sun then a 
mighty wind blew him over from a kneeling position while he was 
inside the church 
i was changed from a doubter to a believer roberts said 
lacher said such visions may indeed take place but the fact 
that the catholic church hasnt yet recognized most of them keeps 
him from being a true believer he said he attended saturdays 
conference to learn more and perhaps erase some of his doubt 
i think something is happening lacher added what is 
happening is good its bringing a lot of people to prayer 
the convention center in downtown pittsburgh was filled with 
those who journeyed from across the country and canada the center 
was decorated with statues of the virgin mary and soft soothing 
music was piped in over the speaker system before mass and the 
program 
the more than 5500 attending the conference had to stand in a 
line stretching about a quarter of a mile in freezing temperatures

in their first encounter since ending a 12year rift 
in december the presidents of egypt and syria met in libya on 
saturday and called for arab unity the libyan news agency jana 
reported 
the leaders joined sudans president and libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi in marking the 20th anniversary of the expulsion of 
british forces from libya jana reported 
syrian president hafez assad told reporters that without unity 
i believe there will be no happy life for arabs said the news 
agency report monitored in rome 
it quoted egypts president hosni mubarak as saying arabs need 
unity to withstand the challenges of the us and european economic 
blocs 
the report did not say what the two discussed during their 
meeting 
assad broke ties with egypt in january 1977 after the egyptian 
president at the time anwar sadat made a dramatic visit to 
jerusalem the visit was the opening move in two years of 
negotiations that led to the egyptianisraeli peace agreement most 
other arab countries cut ties with egypt when it signed the treaty 
with israel in 1979 and the feud had been a major obstacle to arab 
cooperation 
but links have been restored since a 1987 arab summit decided to 
let egypt back into the arab fold libya long allied with syria in 
a hardline radical front has also been patching up its 
differences with egypt 
jana said gadhafi welcomed assad mubarak and sudanese leader 
omar hassan elbashir at the ceremony in tobruk on the 
mediterranean coast in eastern libya gadhafi expressed a feeling 
of happiness delight and pride in our brothers the report said 
gadhafi said arab countries had to overcome differences of the 
past and unite in the face of dangers threatening the arab world 
what i have been saying for 20 years is now a fact he said 
all arabs now feel that unity has become a necessity if we 
quarreled yesterday we make it up today all differences are blown 
away on the wind 
the 1970 british pullout from tobruks eladem air base took 
place the year after gadhafi overthrew the monarchy in a military 
coup and established a republic 
gadhafi renamed the base after egypts late president gamal 
abdel nasser

former vice president walter mondale 
said saturday he expects no cheating in hungarys national 
elections and had heard of no irregularities beyond what could be 
expected in a us campaign 
i got up this morning and somebody said theyve been tearing 
down campaign signs said the minnesota democrat i said 
what are you talking about that could be minneapolis 
mondale was vice president under jimmy carter from 1980 to 1984 
and the unsuccessful democratic candidate in the 1984 presidential 
election 
he and jan carnogursky the deputy premier of czechoslovakia 
are among the 65member international delegation in hungary to 
observe voting sunday in hungarys first free national election in 
43 years 
carnogursky said his country which in june holds its first free 
election in more than four decades could learn from the hungarian 
process 
we expect nothing unusual to disturb the democratic process 
sunday carnogursky said 
mondale said a dark streak in precommunist hungarian 
politics antisemitism and ethnic intolerance showed up in some 
campaigning 
there has been some language used by some politicans that some 
consider signals of religious and racial intolerance mondale 
said 
he refused to go into details saying only that politicians of 
leading parties admit its around but they do not think its 
going to be a basic determinant 
all the party leaders we talked to are clearly trying to avoid 
that historic mistake that cursed not only hungarian politics but 
eastern european politics for so long said mondale 
sponsors of the delegations visit are the national democratic 
institute and the national republican institute organizations of 
the us political parties 
delegation members plan to tour polling stations and talk to 
voters on sunday as part of the monitoring process the two 
institutes have sponsored similar delegations to observe elections 
in haiti nicaragua panama the philippines and elsewhere and 
plan to send missions to other soviet bloc countries planning 
elections 
both us parties sent delegations to hungary during the 
campaign to instruct the countrys fledgling political parties in 
the art of electioneering unknown in hungary since 1947 
while the monthlong official campaign featured tv advertising 
debates and posters plastered across towns and villages it lacked 
mailing lists and other supersophisticated techniques of us 
presidential or congressional contests

president bushs national security adviser 
brent scowcroft on saturday warned that any soviet use of force or 
intimidation in lithuania would be counterproductive to 
ussoviet relations 
scowcroft said the bush administration would take appropriate 
measures in response to what it considered excessive soviet 
pressure or an increase in tensions in the baltic republic 
he did not elaborate but said military action was not a likely 
option 
we would not ignore it however he warned theyre under 
no doubt about how we feel 
bush spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at camp 
david md was receiving periodic telephone reports from white 
house aides as soviet military vehicles rolled through the streets 
of vilnius a day after expelling two us diplomats 
were watching it carefully white house spokesman bill 
harlow said 
scowcroft made his comments in a telephone interview when asked 
to explain bushs remark friday that any soviet attempt to coerce 
or intimidate or forcibly intervene against the lithuanian people 
is bound to backfire that is inevitable 
scowcroft said such actions would be counterproductive for the 
soviets because it could affect the relationship our 
relationship 
scowcroft said bushs comment could be read as a slight 
escalation of the rhetoric as the soviets have escalated their 
action 
while the soviets have indicated they consider it their 
internal matter none of our business scowcroft said it has 
to be our business because it could affect the relationship 
between washington and moscow 
in an interview saturday on cnns newsmaker saturday 
lithuanian consul general ancietas simutis said lithuanians were 
seeking moral support from the united states 
we dont expect that the united states will go to war on 
behalf of lithuania simutis said and we are against any 
violence in or by lithuanians or russians or anybody we believe in 
democratic procedures 
rep tom lantos dcalif said the united states must make 
clear to soviet president mikhail gorbachev the consequences of its 
actions in lithuania 
what the bush administration owes gorbachev and the american 
people is candor lantos said on the cnn program we must lay 
out for gorbachev now what the consequences would be of military 
action we have to tell mr gorbachev that kicking out american 
diplomats kicking out the press of the western world is not the 
way to move towards peaceful negotiations i very much hope that 
mr gorbachevs intelligence and statesmanship will prevail and he 
will turn back from this military intimidation that we have seen 
during the last 24 hours 
one us official said that while the administration was 
concerned about developments it appeared that it was not at all 
a crisis situation on saturday 
another official also speaking on condition of anonymity said 
it appeared the soviets might not take any sudden action but if 
they did increase the pressure on secessionist lithuania they 
would do so gradually 
the official said it did not appear there would be some 
cataclysmic thing like martial law 
bush did not have any national security advisers with him for 
the weekend but top national security council officials were at 
work at the white house 
harlow said he knew of no phone calls by bush to soviet or other 
foreign leaders regarding the lithuanian situation 
the state department on friday protested the expulsion of two 
us diplomats douglas wake and jon purnell from lithuania 
the lithuania matter was raised in a meeting between deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and soviet ambassador yuri 
dubinin in washington on friday officials said 
in addition officials from the us embassy in moscow were 
talking to their foreign ministry all the time to underscore 
us concerns state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty said 
saturday 
were still monitoring the situation were still concerned 
she said 
she said she could release no additional update on the status of 
the two diplomats expelled from the baltic republican on friday 
but a us embassy spokesman in moscow said saturday they would 
comply with the order to leave although he could not say whether 
they had done so yet 
meanwhile in tokyo the head of the official soviet news 
agency tass said today he believes a state of emergency might be 
declared in lithuania although it was unclear what that would mean 
tass has reported that soviet embassies would review foreigners 
visa applications to travel to lithuania to keep out people 
inclined to engage in illegal activities 
in washington members of the lithuanianamerican community 
pressed ahead despite snowy weather for an evening vigil to show 
solidarity with the lithuanians 
they called on bush to recognize lithuanias independence which 
the president has declined to do even though the united states 
never officially recognized the soviet unions forced annexation of 
lithuania in 1940 
his statements on friday were a little bit better said 
jonas alsenas of the lithuanianamerican group 
alsenas applauded bushs statement that the united states 
supports lithuanias right to selfdetermination but criticized 
the us stance on the new lithuanian government 
even though they dont recognize the forcible incorporation of 
lithuania they still wont recognize this democratically elected 
government alsenas said 
the weather hampered plans for the hastily called saturday vigil 
at the lincoln memorial but organizers still looked for a few 
hundred lithuanian residents of the united states saying some had 
come from around the country

an american follower of the hindu path 
of bliss cult who was attacked by anticult villagers and then 
held in solitary confinement nearly two months left for home 
saturday 
patricia munday suffered a deep gash on her forehead jan 26 
when she was attacked near the headquarters of the secretive ananda 
marg sect in purulia a village in west bengal 
the local communist government of west bengal has long accused 
the hindu cult of using black magic 
the followers of ananda marg which means path of bliss 
deny they practice black magic but acknowledge using human skulls 
in their meditation and ritual dances the secretive group claims 
4500 followers around the world 
in ordinary circumstances i would have certainly stayed and 
fought my case but after seven weeks of virtual incarceration 
constant harassment and humiliation i cannot bear these mental 
tortures any longer ms munday was quoted as saying in a 
statement issued by ananda marg 
the statement said ms munday continued to suffer from 
headaches insomnia occasional amnesia and numbness in her arms 
and legs after her detention by state police 
ms munday who comes from waitsfield vt left new delhi on 
saturday said ananda marg member susan andrews it was not known 
when she would arrive back in vermont 
ms munday 39 was allowed to leave india after the countrys 
supreme court ruled that west bengal police could no longer detain 
her 
the police had confined ms munday to one room in a nursing home 
and barred all visitors after she tried to lodge a complaint 
against her attackers 
membership in the group is not a crime and ms munday was never 
charged 
ms munday was a member of a united nations high commissioner 
for refugees team that won the 1981 nobel peace prize for helping 
refugees in somalia she originally planned to stay in india and 
challenge the west bengal governments authority to detain her her 
lawyers and ms andrews said 
but it was just dragging on for six seven weeks said ms 
andrews of toronto she was just going stir crazy she just 
said i cant hang out any longer 
us embassy consular officers had been in contact with ms 
munday but did not accompany her to the airport an embassy 
spokesman said ms munday made her own travel plans 
ananda marg has long aroused the suspicions of west bengal 
officials and rural villagers it was founded in the early 1950s by 
prabhat ranjan sarkar an accountant who worked for the government 
railroad system in bihar a state adjoining west bengal 
in 1971 sarkar was imprisoned and charged with aiding and 
abetting the murders of six exfollowers of ananda marg he was 
convicted and spent seven years in prison before his conviction was 
overturned 
ananda marg is very much misunderstood ms andrews said 
some people are even saying that they kill people and use their 
skulls 
she acknowledged as witnesses have reported that cult members 
use human skulls in their meditation but said this was intended as 
a way of showing that all of the attractions of the flesh are 
pared down we have to fix our minds on an internal truth 
little information is available on the groups activities 
because members are bound by an oath of secrecy the group has said 
it strives to create a social economic and spiritual order that 
will replace both capitalism and communism and rid society of 
sectarianism and parochialism

the democratic party on saturday endorsed a 
proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan to cut social security 
payroll taxes as party leaders grope for ways to steal popularity 
from president bush 
in a session marred by a controversy over supposedly racist and 
antisemitic campaign tactics by rep gus savage dill democrats 
also agreed on rules and schedules for the 1992 presidential 
campaign season 
a resolution at the spring meeting of the democratic national 
committee urged congress to support the proposal forwarded several 
weeks ago by moynihan dny the resolution is nonbinding and 
democratic leaders in congress have opposed such a cut as 
irresponsible when congress is trying to cut the deficit 
adopting a more aggressive pose toward the republican 
administration democratic party chairman ronald h brown dubbed 
the gop the party of debt and taxes for years the democrats 
have labored uncomfortably under republican attacks calling them 
the tax and spend party 
brown expressed relief over getting the rules process behind 
us with what he called the most peaceful accord in the past 
20 years 
but the chairmans pleasure at getting the rules debate out of 
the way and getting the party on record in support of the moynihan 
proposal was tempered by the controversy involving savage savage 
was accused of verbally attacking whites and jews during his recent 
primary campaign 
we abhor and oppose racism and antisemitism in any form 
brown told a news conference 
i dont care to get into attacking gus savage as an individual 
although hes chosen to attack me on a couple of occasions said 
brown savage recently referred to the party chairman who also is 
black as ron beige 
brown later issued a new stronger statement saying that 
racism and antisemitism is disgusting in any context i 
intend to contact congressman savage and let him know in no 
uncertain terms that the chairman of the party and the party itself 
abhors and condemns his remarks 
while the party officials were meeting in indianapolis 
democratic elected officials were getting together in new orleans 
for a meeting of the democratic leadership council 
at the party meeting in new orleans a succession of speakers 
mncluding sens lloyd bentsen dtex and sam nunn dga gov l 
douglas wilder of virginia and house majority leader richard 
gephardt outlined their view of the partys agenda for the decade 
jesse l jackson gave a speech at the gathering in which he 
adhered to the new mainstream tone of the party 
the democrats must find common ground as the party of those 
who live on their paychecks said jackson who has twice sought 
the democratic presidential nomination 
jackson said democrats are increasingly united on such issues as 
choice in abortion fighting crime and drugs and government aid to 
those in need 
were talking about mainstream values and thats a wider 
stream than many thought jackson said 
in additional to the payroll tax cut which the democrats were 
portraying as a boon to the middle class the party was also 
pushing education and the environment as issues that can be used 
against bush 
the new party rules adopted in indianapolis had few major 
changes from those that governed the campaign for the 1988 
democratic presidential nomination 
most significant were provisions requiring states to use 
proportional representation to allocate delegates chosen in 
caucuses or primaries the party also could strip of a state of up 
to 25 percent of its delegation for failure to comply with rules 
the proportional representation rule bars states from holding 
primaries in which national convention delegates are elected 
directly rather than allocated among the presidential candidates on 
the basis of the percentage of the vote their receive in individual 
congressional districts 
the new rules also allow states to hold primaries or caucuses 
starting the first tuesday in march in 1988 the starting date was 
the second tuesday in march 
the traditional exemptions were preserved for iowa new 
hampshire and maine 
the party also solidified the rule requiring that a candidate 
receive at least 15 percent of the popular vote in order to qualify 
for delegates states were barred from raising that percentage

the safety board this week released the transcript of a cockpit 
voice recording in which the tower spoke with pilots of the 
beechcraft the eastern plane and a continental flight that landed 
just ahead of the small plane 
in the transcript the first sign of trouble appears to be 
registered by the first officer of the eastern flight who says 
oh followed by an expletive and then oooooh 
three seconds later the recording registers the sound of 
impact 
god bless the first officer says 
two minutes further into the transcript the pilot is quoted as 
saying the smaller plane had no lights 
he had no lights said the first officer 
i didnt see him till he was right there said the pilot

intermediate stop in new york the epps air service beechcraft was 
on a short flight from nearby peachtree airport 
faa spokesman roger meyers reached in atlanta noted that the 
agency had said in january that the runway should have been clear 
before the eastern plane was given permission to land 
a report from the safety board said radar showed the distance 
between the eastern jetliner and the beechcraft was 12 miles at 
the time that the smaller plane crossed the threshhold of the 
runway faa regulations call for a distance of 25 miles until the 
tower begins to guide the planes visually 
at that point separation is up to the air controllers

concerning the separation of the planes were followed

under way since the revolution that ended the communists monopoly 
on power

power and installed former dissident vaclav havel as president

deserting the former ruling party en masse ever since the

former secret police agents have denounced 
the leader of east germanys social democratic party but he denied 
their charges that he was a regular police collaborator a west 
germany news magazine said saturday 
meanwhile west german chancellor helmut kohl said a united 
germany should put the past behind and live in peace with poland 
its eastern neighbor 
the allegations about social democratic chairman ibrahim boehme 
mirrored similar allegations against lothar de maiziere leader of 
east germanys christian democratic union der spiegel reported 
de maiziere who is slated to become east germanys first 
noncommunist premier also has denied the allegations der spiegel 
said it had no proof of secret police links of either politician 
only claims by former agents

while acting as an informer for the stasi the oncefeared east 
german secret police that ruthlessly suppressed any dissent the 
magazine said 
boehmes social democrats finished second to the cdu in the 
march 18 elections the first free balloting in east german history 
east germans have been obsessed with the stasi since their 
popular revolution overthrew hardline communist leaders they 
stormed its east berlin headquarters in january and forced the 
government to dismantle the agency

friendship with its polish neighbors the west german chancellor 
told a meeting of his christian democratic union party

awarded to poland after the collapse of nazi germany the territory 
comprises onethird of presentday poland which has sought a peace 
treaty with both german states before unification 
millions of germans were expelled from poland after world war 
ii and they form a conservative force in west german politics 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said she believes kohl 
personally remains opposed to signing a formal treaty guaranteeing 
polands western border der spiegel reported 
i have heard helmut say no i wont guarantee anything i 
dont recognize the current borders der spiegel quoted mrs 
thatcher as saying in its latest issue 
at the same time she said she accepts that a united germany 
will become the most powerful country in europe 
we just have to get used to the idea that there will be a 
country in europe in the future that will be more powerful than all 
the others she said in the interview which der spiegel provided 
in advance to other news media before publication monday 
mrs thatcher has been wary of hasty moves toward unification by

a little bit of everything snowstorms thunderstorms tornadoes 
on march 24 1912 residents of kansas city began to dig out

the poor the humble and the 
devout flocked by the thousands saturday to honor the memory of 
roman catholic archbishop oscar a romero on the 10th anniversary 
of his assassination 
more than 1000 people jammed the unfinished downtown cathedral 
in san salvador and several thousand more listened to the mass 
piped through loudspeakers to the plaza and streets outside 
a 20block march commemorating romero preceded the religious 
service it was led by 16 bishops including roger mahoney of los 
angeles leo mattieson of amarillo texas and nicolas dantonio 
of new orleans la 
romero was slain march 24 1980 as he said mass at a hospital 
chapel although the christian democratic government of 198489 
compiled evidence implicating extreme rightists no one has been 
arrested or charged in the murder 
no highranking official from president alfredo cristianis 
conservative administration or his republican nationalist alliance 
were present the late former president jose napoleon duarte a 
christian democrat accused arena founder roberto daubuisson of 
having ordered romeros assassination 
cardinal agostino casaroli the vatican secretary of state sent 
a message that said pope john paul ii joins the service in spirit 
and raises a prayer that the sacrifice of that pastor become a new 
call to reconciliation and forgiveness the message was read at 
the mass 
el salvadors decadeold civil war which began engulfing this 
nation about the time romero was killed continues unabated the 
death toll surpassed 72000 late last year when leftist rebels 
launched a monthlong offensive 
the metropolitan cathedral which has been under construction 
for 30 years and has been closed for worship since october was 
reopened for the commemoration 
the facade was festooned with huge banners quoting scripture 
one citing john 1015 read i give my life for my flock 
the service is to be the last public religious homage to romero 
in decades because he will be formally proposed for beatification 
the first step toward sainthood in coming weeks church doctrine 
prohibits public homage to candidates for sainthood 
local church officials and many in the vatican say prospects are 
good for romeros eventual sainthood but they say the process will 
take up to 30 years archbishop thomas becket of canterbury was 
murdered at the altar in 1170 and later canonized 
on saturday marchers carrying white flags palm fronds studded 
with paper flowers and portraits of romero chanted saint pastor 
and prophet monsignor romero lives in the hearts of the people 
most marchers were peasants in sandals with worn or mended 
clothing but many city dwellers also joined the procession and 
attended the mass 
some marchers carried portraits of six jesuit priests allegedly 
murdered by army troops on nov 16 
romero and the slain jesuits exercised what in modern theology 
has come to be called the preferential option for the poor 
they lived humbly and condemned exploitation inequality and 
oppression 
many rightists called them subversives 
catalina rivera a 62yearold peasant woman who had traveled 
four hours by bus from la libertad province to listen to the mass 
said monsignor romero helped us all by announcing the truth 
that is why they killed him because the truth hurts those who 
dont want to hear it 
el salvador suffered from a terrible wave of repression in 1980 
and later years when rightist death squads and government troops 
kidnapped tortured and executed hundreds of suspected leftists 
every month 
in his last homily the day before he was killed romero issued 
an impassioned appeal to soldiers to disobey orders to torture and 
murder 
in the name of god in the name of this suffering people whose 
cries rise to heaven more loudly each day i implore you i beg 
you i order you in the name of god stop the repression he said 
for being the voice of those without voice he was violently 
silenced said san salvador archbishop arturo rivera damas 
romeros successor in saturdays homily

the nuclear regulatory commission has upgraded 
its investigation into a power outage that shut down one reactor 
last week at georgia power cos nuclear plant vogtle 
nrc spokesman ken clark said the decision to upgrade the 
investigation from an augmented inspection to an incident 
investigation made friday night in washington was made because 
of safety and regulatory concerns 
a site emergency was declared at the waynesboro plant tuesday 
when a truck backed into a utility pole knocking out electricity 
only one of the plants two nuclear reactors unit 2 was in 
operation and automatically shut down 
no one was evacuated and no radioactive materials escaped but 
the reactor has yet to be restarted 
this came up because the nrc management believes it is 
necessary because of the safety significance and potential 
regulatory questions raised by the emergency clark said of the 
decision 
among other things the investigation is to determine why it 
took utility officials an hour to notify emergency authorities of 
the problem the plant is supposed to notify the surrounding 
counties and state officials of any incidents within 15 minutes 
but burke county was not notified for 45 minutes and the state 
for an hour said georgia emergency management agency spokesman 
harry heath 
georgia power spokesman john thrasher said we plan to 
cooperate fully but refused further comment 
the company agreed not to restart unit 1 until the investigation 
is complete 
the plants other reactor unit 2 was shut down for refueling 
at the time of the outage its cooling system was without power for 
36 minutes because a backup diesel generator didnt start 
immediately the generator was started manually

the splintered rebel movement in afghanistan 
has produced its share of factions in congress over how to allocate 
us dollars for groups fighting the sovietbacked government 
as rep charles wilson dtexas jokingly put it the only way 
to get everyone back under the same tent is to bring the red army 
back 
at issue is not only how the cia spends 600 million a year in 
taxpayer money on covert operations against the government headed 
by najibullah but also whether to continue that level of aid 
the united states began supplying weapons to afghan rebels after 
the soviet union sent troops into afghanistan in late 1979 
although soviet troops pulled out of afghanistan last year 
najibullah remains in power 
the dispute has focused in particular on the amount of aid being 
received by gulbaddin hekmatyar the leader of one of seven rebel 
factions in addition to complaints that the aid is being 
distributed unfairly is one that hekmatyar is a soviet agent 
the question of where hekmatyars allegiances lie was raised by 
reports written by a group of staffers working out of the office of 
rep bill mccollum rfla 
evidence suggests hekmatyar and his key commanders work for 
the ussr to a certain degree according to a report prepared by 
the house task force on terrorism and unconventional warfare 
hekmatyar is definitely devoted to fighting the us and has 
cooperated with iran and other radical muslims to that end the 
paper said the task force is part of the house republican research 
committee of which mccollum is a member 
the report said hekmatyar was a member of the communist party in 
his youth and has maintained close contacts with the soviets 
hekmatyar recently joined with afghan defense minister shahnawaz 
tanai who waged an unsuccessful coup attempt march 6 against 
najibullah whose regime receives an estimated 300 million in 
weapons a month from the soviet union 
rep don ritter rpa also says there is a growing 
discontent in congress with the cias reliance on pakistans 
interservices intelligence to deliver aid ritter complained that 
the pakistanis have unfairly favored hekmatyars over the other 
rebel groups 
wilson a staunch supporter of the rebels said he is unprepared 
to defend hekmatyar but considers it absolutely false to 
suggest he is a kgb plant 
im absolutely 100 percent satisfied with the job the cia is 
doing said wilson a member of the house intelligence committee 
robert peck the state departments former top analyst on 
afghanistan said hekmatyar may be a problem but there was no 
evidence of his being a soviet agent 
donald j morrissey the republican task forces legislative 
director said the papers did not necessarily represent the views 
of the task force members but were intended to encourage debate 
indeed they have in a period when us policy is in flux 
rep porter goss rfla a task force member with expertise in 
the intelligence field said he viewed the report as a 
speculative document that wasnt quite as persuasive as the 
authors probably intended 
but goss said the paper underscored the feeling on capitol hill 
that lawmakers are trying to come to grips with what to do 
about afghanistan 
rep stephen solarz dny chairman of a house subcommittee on 
asia has suggested conducting the debate in public rather than in 
private ritter may call for a cutoff in aid until he is assured 
pakistan is giving money to the right people 
wilson who has visited afghanistan and is considered one of the 
most knowledgeable lawmakers on the issue advocated keep doing 
what we are doing 
there is a lot of impatience in congress he said adding it 
is going to be difficult to keep aid levels at their current 
amount 
but ultimately wilson said the usbacked rebels should 
prevail and gain control of their country he said

stasys lozoraitis jr is fluent in half a 
dozen languages russian is not one of them though he confesses a 
desperate need to know it still it is a question of 
principle he says 
lozoraitis is the man in charge of the musty 40room mansion on 
16th street a mile from the soviet embassy which serves as the 
legation of free lithuania as it has for nearly 70 years but for 
the last 50 of those years lithuania was not free 
two sundays ago the building was filled as the lithuanian 
legislature pondered a declaration of independence from the soviet 
union whose troops overran the nation in 1940 i think all the 
500 washington lithuanians came said lozoraitis little 
children holding balloons men and women bringing whiskey bottles 
cookies or just smiles poles though not yet those from their 
embassy down the block estonians latvians armenians 
americans 
and then the news arrived sent via a fax machine that 
lithuanias new president vytautus landsbergis had smuggled home 
after visiting lozoraitis a old school chum in washington last 
summer 
the vote was for freedom cried lozoraitis with that the 
celebration began 
another message arrived saturday the legislature had formally 
declared that its power would fall symbolically to the washington 
legation and lozoraitis if the soviets crush the new government 
a similar role was occupied for 45 years by lozoraitis father 
until his death at age 88 five years ago just days before the 
soviet troops arrived in 1940 free lithuanias last foreign 
minister had sent this message to his embassies if catastrophe 
strikes please consider stasys lozoraitis chief of our nations 
diplomatic corps 
the elder lozaraitis using gold reserves transferred from 
lithuania to sweden as the soviets moved in ran not only the 
washington legation and four us consulates but diplomatic 
outpostsinexile in the vatican great britain canada and 
venezuela according to his son it has been the only diplomatic 
service in history to hold to its mission for more than a half 
century after its country was conquered 
for 50 years said stasys lozoraitis jr we have carried 
on working living dying it is such a pity my father isnt here 
to see all our efforts come to such a conclusion 
throughout the legation are symbols of hope above the fireplace 
in the great hall hangs a painting of a white knight the national 
symbol a mural of the 600yearold nations 1918 declaration of 
independence adorns the front hall on a whiteskirted table in the 
grand salon an old photograph depicts lozoraitss bearded 
grandfather a politician and philosopher with the grandfather 
of landsbergis 
lozoraitis who declines to give his age had just entered his 
teens when his father a former foreign minister was sent off to 
italy ahead of the invading soviet tanks 
in italy the son helped his father with diplomatic reports he 
says he was 15 when he decoded his first cipher but resisted 
diplomacy as a career he wanted to fight and he did as a member 
of an underground group which rescued jews and american prisoners 
of war 
as far as my family was concerned i was absolutely 
irresponsible he recently told the washington post we would 
put these people in cars and drive them to catholic monasteries or 
convents or the vatican i was arrested once by the germans but 
through friends my father saved me 
his exploits during the war also took him back into the baltic 
states and he acknowledges that he has since visited lithuania 
more than once though not officially i would not go to the 
soviet embassy to ask for a visa to my own country he said 
before taking over for his father in washington the son was a 
journalist for vision an international economics magazine and 
learned several languages along the way but not russian it is a 
question of principle and i am sorry because i need it very 
much he said 
in a recent interview with the macneillehrer news hour 
lozoraitis expressed the belief that soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev will hold true to his pledge not to use force against the 
new lithuanian government 
we are not threatening the political position of gorbachev 
he said if he lets us go his stature as a political figure will 
only increase and he will remain in history 
but saturday the soviet foreign ministry ordered foreign 
diplomats out of lithuania and a military convoy rumbled through 
the vilnius the capital and lozoraitis was left to pray that he 
will not have to take the symbolic torch of power a nervous 
legislature was prepared to bestow upon him 
the state department for years has tiptoed around the 
legations status the united states has never recognized the 
forcible incorporation of estonia latvia and lithuania into the 
soviet union and throughout the cold war has called upon moscow to 
release its captive nations on the other hand it has not 
accredited the diplomatic corpsinexile headed by lozoriatis nor 
has it recognized the new government

west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher saturday signed an agreement that abolishes 
the visa requirement between his country and hungary 
he also presented a merit award to foreign minister gyula horn 
apparently for hungarys decision to open its borders last year to 
east germans seeking a better life in the west the exodus of east 
germans sparked the peaceful revolution that led to east germanys 
first free elections last weekend 
hungarians were to go to the polls sunday for their first free 
multiparty elections in 43 years of communist rule 
visafree travel between west germany a member of nato and 
hungary a member of the sovietled warsaw pact goes into effect 
may 1 
genscher and horn also signed three other bilateral agreements 
on education and management training for hungarians 
it remains unforgotten that hungary was the first to cut the 
iron curtain genscher told horn after the signing ceremony 
hungary began dismantling the barbed wire barriers along its 
western border with austria in may the open border was used by 
thousands of east germans fed up with 40 years of hardline 
communist rule to flee to west germany via austria 
as hungary stood valiantly by our side in a difficult hour of 
our history we will not leave hungary in the lurch on her way to 
democracy and a market economy genscher said 
addressing a concern that has dominated the hungarian election 
campaign the past few days genscher also said he hoped the rights 
of minorities including those of the ethnic hungarians in romania 
would be respected 
hungarians feel a sense of kinship for the estimated 17 million 
ethnic hungarians in transylvania an area that belonged to hungary 
for centuries before being ceded to romania after world war i

an agreement to disband the contra 
rebels was in doubt saturday because the outgoing sandinista 
government had not signed the pact and because of renewed fighting 
the accord signed friday in tegucigalpa honduras by 
representatives of the usbacked rebels and the new government 
calls for a truce and immediate disbanding of the contras the 
process would be completed before presidentelect violeta barrios 
de chamorro takes office april 25 for a sixyear term 
however no delegates from the sandinista government took part 
in talks that led to the pact or signed the accord 
also there has been renewed fighting in the past week between 
sandinista and contra forces and one rebel commander said his 
fighters will not lay down their arms until the sandinista army 
does 
the latest clash occurred friday when about 100 rebels ambushed 
two army vehicles in the area around jinotega a town about 100 
miles northeast of managua the defense ministry said 12 soldiers 
died and eight were wounded four contras were killed the ministry 
said 
medical sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said in a 
telephone interview that the attack occurred about the time the 
accord was being announced in tegucigalpa 
president daniel ortega has repeatedly said the contras must 
disband before mrs chamorros inauguration if there is to be a 
peaceful transfer of power 
after learning of the accord ortega told a rally of youth 
supporters in managua late friday that the weapons are now in the 
hands of the people 
ortega quoted saturday by the sandinista newspaper barricada 
did not elaborate but his remark seemed to be a reference to 
recent reports that the sandinista army had distributed hundreds of 
weapons among supporters in the provinces there have also been 
reports that the sandinista army will not yield control to the new 
government 
the party newspaper voiced concern in an editorial saying 
there is still worry over the plans that the contras have been 
preparing to launch a great offensive it said infiltrations 
from honduras continue and that weapons are being hidden 
the editorial also pointed out that contra military chief israel 
galeano cornejo known as commander franklyn had not signed the 
pact for disbanding the rebels 
he took part in the seven hours of talks but his deputy oscar 
sovalbarro signed the accord antonio lacayo mrs chamorros 
representative signed for the incoming leadership of the united 
national opposition the document was witnessed by cardinal miguel 
obando y bravo the roman catholic archbishop of managua 
sovalbarro later told reporters about 12000 rebel fighters and 
their families living in honduran jungle camps planned to start 
demobilizing over the weekend 
the accord also calls for observers from the united nations and 
the organization of american states to supervise the disbanding and 
resettlement of the rebels and their families 
mrs chamorros landslide victory in elections feb 25 ended a 
decade of leftist sandinista rule that was marked by close military 
cooperation with cuba and the soviet union 
shortly before the accord was reached rebel commander osvaldo 
galeano cornejo accused the sandinista army of repressing the 
peasants in his area in southern nicaragua he said his forces 
will not demobilize until the sandinista army does the same 
if we demobilize now we would be leaving all these peasants 
without protection galeano cornejo 22 the brother of israel 
galeano cornejo told the associated press in an interview early 
friday 
about 4000 contras are believed to be stationed in nicaragua in 
a northsouth corridor from the honduran border to costa rica 
under the accord they will move into security zones supervised by 
obando y bravo and the united nations

an amtrak train arriving from new orleans hit a 
bumper at the end of a track at union station on saturday 
derailing cars and injuring at least 30 people authorities said 
the city of new orleans train no 53 struck the bumping 
block at the end of the track apparently throwing quite a few 
people who were standing waiting to get off said amtrak 
spokesman john jacobsen 
trains normally would stop short of the bumper 
eight of the 10 cars derailed jacobsen said in a telephone 
interview from washington dc 
he said the train was supposed to be traveling at about 3 mph in 
the station but police patrolman john lecompte said there were 
reports that the train came in too fast 
jacobsen said the railroad was still investigating and hadnt 
determined whether the accident was caused by human error or 
mechanical failure 
he said no damage to the train or the station was immediately 
visible 
it wasnt a serious accident from a railroad point of view 
jacobsen said but when you are standing up its just like 
standing on an escalator if it stops fast you fall down people 
get thrown somebody elses suitcase hits them in the head 
the train was carrying 254 passengers when it pulled into the 
station just before noon jacobsen said 
at least 30 people were taken to at least six hospitals most 
complaining of muscle back or neck pains hospital spokesmen said 
late in the afternoon many were still being evaluated in emergency 
rooms but it appeared most would be treated and released the 
spokesmen said

the head of the latvian peoples front 
said saturday the first act of the republics new parliament will 
be a vote on independence 
dainis ivans president of the latvian peoples front said the 
vote could come within six weeks provided the proindependence 
group has enough support in parliament 
the front and other independence supporters won more than a 50 
percent majority in the first round of elections for latvias new 
parliament earlier this month ivans said they need to win only six 
more of the 35 remaining races to have the twothirds majority 
needed for an independence vote 
ivans was in vilnius to meet with leaders of the popular fronts 
of lithuania and estonia to coordinate the baltic republics 
campaigns for independence 
independence supporters took control of lithuanias parliament 
in recent elections and the republic declared itself independent 
on march 11 after five decades of kremlin rule 
lithuania is in a confrontation with the kremlin over its 
declaration of indpendence and demands for talks on the issue 
soviet tanks rolled through vilnius saturday in a show of force 
however ivans said at a news conference late saturday night 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev promised the latvians 
last week that he will begin negotiations with them on independence 
ivans said the kremlin and latvia have agreed to set up 
committees to deal with the details of separation including 
politcal economic and ecological issues 
ivans said the new latvian parliament will hold its first 
session by early may and among its first acts will be to recognize 
lithuanian independence 
he said increasing kremlin pressure on lithuania could prompt 
latvian and estonian independence activists to speed their moves 
toward independence as a way to support lithuania

an environmental group is asking voters to 
ban the sale of canned tuna caught with huge drift nets that also 
trap dolphins and other marine life 
the united community action network in portland filed an 
initiative petition with the multnomah county elections division on 
friday seeking to declare the county the worlds first tuna free 
zone 
initiative backers must collect 14148 valid signatures over six 
months to put the measure on the november general election or a 
special election ballot 
when we talk to people at the door they have a lot of 
sympathy for this issue said tom okeefe director of the 
7monthold conservation group oregon has always been on the

regulates the use of the huge nets still allows a quota of 20500 
dolphin deaths a year

animal does this kind of thing said county supervisor madge

legislators who favor abortion rights 
decided saturday not to press a threat to force a house of 
delegates vote on abortion measures killed in committee the night 
before 
also saturday 98 people were arrested in nearby pasadena for 
massing their bodies before the doors of a suburban abortion clinic 
to block women from entering anne arundel county police said 
abortionrights forces decided against trying to force their 
bill to the house floor because of opposition from the democratic 
leadership said delegate samuel rosenberg a baltimore democrat 
and abortionrights leader 
forcing the bill out of committee would have been an 
extraordinary procedure and it would set a precedent that many 
people dont want to set rosenberg said he insisted however 
that the bill had the votes to pass in the house 
the decision was the final chapter in a 10day abortion debate 
in the maryland general assembly that produced a lot of drama but 
no legislation 
while the abortion clinic demonstration by project rescue 
coincided with the close of debate by lawmakers in annapolis group 
spokeswoman dee silverman said the demonstration had been planned 
several months ago 
the demonstrators were arrested under a new law signed into 
effect in july and aimed at just such demonstrations which 
prohibits interference with entrance or departure from a medical 
facility 
the failed maryland compromise was approved by the state senate 
to end an eightday filibuster on abortion 
the unusual arrangement would have required the legislature to 
pass two measures one permitting unrestricted access to abortions 
during the early stages of pregnancy the other restricting 
abortion to cases of rape incest or dire threat to the mother 
complicated referendum procedures would have dumped the matter in 
the laps of the voters in november 
antiabortion forces are looking to legislation in idaho and the 
us territory of guam for a vehicle to challenge the us supreme 
courts landmark 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized abortion 
guam enacted the nations strictest abortion law but a federal 
judge temporarily blocked it after a classaction lawsuit friday 
in idaho where the most restrictive abortion measure passed by 
any state legislature was approved thursday the focus of the 
debate shifted to the economic ramifications 
abortionrights interests in california michigan wisconsin 
rhode island and north carolina have threatened to boycott idaho 
potatoes unless gov cecil andrus vetoes the bill andrus opposes 
abortion but has not said what he will do 
the idaho legislature voted to ban abortion except in cases of 
nonstatutory rape reported within seven days incest if the victim 
is younger than 18 severe fetal deformity or threat to the 
mothers life or health 
some idaho legislators were surprised by the threatened potato 
boycott 
oh my lord said state rep steve antone one of nine 
potato growers in the legislature who all voted for abortion 
restrictions it would be a tremendous blow to the state he 
added that the possibility of a boycott didnt occur to us at the 
time 
but state sen mark ricks who cochaired the abortion hearings 
said a potato boycott would not have much effect this year because 
potatoes are in short supply and prices at alltime highs 
barbara labadie republican cochair of the michigan womens 
political caucus said she usually serves her family potatoes three 
or four times a week but now she said well just switch to 
rice and noodles

scores of canoes carrying antinuclear 
demonstrators entered a restricted area at the kings bay naval 
submarine base on saturday to protest deployment of the first 
submarine to carry trident ii missiles 
the protesters agreed to leave the area peacefully and police 
and coast guard officials reported no arrests 
the demonstration was organized by the greenpeace environmental 
group and two other organizations a greenpeace ship the 60foot 
ketch mondcivitano took part 
about 75 people gathered for the protest in anticipation of the 
upcoming departure of the uss tennessee which will carry 24 
trident ii missiles said greenpeace spokeswoman shannon fagan 
each trident ii missile carries eight warheads 
lt cmdr patricia mcmillan public affairs officer for kings 
bay said the protest had no effect on the operations of the 
base 
the navy is committed to protecting the rights of groups to 
conduct peaceful nonintrusive protests she said reading from a 
statement however freedom of speech and freedom of navigation 
do not equate to freedom to obstruct or endanger the legitimate 
activities of the us government through dangerous actions by 
protesters 
ms fagan said there was concern that the submarine had already 
gone to sea because neither the boats that entered the security 
zone nor greenpeace officials flying over the base could spot the 
sub in the bay

nelson mandela said saturday 
the countrys black farm laborers are being exploited and called on 
rural towns to end segregated public facilities 
no white farmer has yet gone to prison for the murder of one 
of their workers nor will that happen for as long as farmers 
continue to enjoy the protection of local police and magistrates 
the antiapartheid leader said at an african national congress 
rally in nelspruit 
he cited the case of a white farmer who was recently fined only 
34 after his black worker died as a result of a beating 
mandela said the white towns in eastern transvaal province 
where he spoke were deeply racist and should immediately end 
segregation of recreational areas and other public facilities 
the government announced friday it intends to allow statefunded 
schools to become multiracial by january if 90 percent of the 
parents at a particular school favor the move 
president fw de klerk has been pushing a series of racial 
reforms he has called for ending the apartheid system of racial 
segregation and for holding talks on allowing the black majority an 
equal political role with whites 
de klerk has also said the law allowing municipalities to 
segregate public facilities would be repealed this year 
in february the president released mandela who had been in 
prison since 1962 on a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the white government 
mandela vice president of the anc has been campaigning 
virtually nonstop since then for an end to apartheid 
at saturdays rally he called for an end to the land tenancy 
system that allows farmers to require the entire families of black 
laborers to work he condemned the lack of legal protection for 
farm workers and said they should be allowed full trade union 
rights 
mandela also demanded an inquiry into reports that mozambican 
guerrillas have bases inside south africa 
president joaquim chissano of mozambique has said he accepts de 
klerks assurances that the south african government no longer 
supports the mozambique national resistance guerrillas 
but mozambican government officials believe the guerrillas still 
receive support from across the border and south african newspaper 
reports have recently cited new evidence of such backing 
mandela called on de klerk to appoint a commission to 
investigate 
in soweto the largest black township outside johannesburg 
police fired tear gas saturday to disperse thousands of protestors 
marching toward municipal offices to demand better services they 
also demanded that the town council resign 
journalists said some protesters pelted riot police with stones 
during a 10minute battle but no one was reported injured

for nearly four hours in the predawn 
dark lithuanian legislators joked nervously and prepared for the 
worst as soviet tanks headed toward the capitol then rolled on by 
without firing a shot 
while the city slept early saturday 98 members of parliament 
watched and traded macabre jokes as paratroopers armed with 
automatic weapons 59 armored vehicles and 50 trucks clanked toward 
the building 
from midnight until nearly 400 am they did not know if 
lithuanias attempt to declare its independence from the soviet 
union would end in blood 13 days after it began 
despite soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs promise he would 
not use force the psychological warfare escalated during the week 
with ultimatums demands that lithuanians disarm and shows of 
military force 
we were almost sure they would not use force said 
legislator audres butkavicius 
but as the hours wore on saturday morning after lithuanian 
police alerted the parliament to the column of armor 45 miles from 
vilnius the jokes tended toward lines such as remember 
allende and remember czechoslovakia said legislator valdas 
katkus 
the references were to the marxist president of chile who died 
in a 1973 coup and the 1968 sovietled invasion that ended 
czechoslovakias prague spring reforms 
we decided we were equal forces since the first report put 
the number of vehicles in the column at 98 the same number of 
deputies still in the parliament chamber after midnight said 
legislator juozas karvelis 
some people were nervous especially when they noticed that 
the communist party leaders were not among us karvelis said 
we decided they knew something and we didnt 
karvelis was joking but his quip displayed an element of doubt 
about the status of lithuanian communist leaders most of those 
elected in the republics recent parliamentary elections broke with 
moscow to support lithuanian independence 
the comminist party leader algirdas brazauskas said he left 
the session friday evening and slept right through the excitement 
as the lawmakers who remained smiled and joked they prepared 
for the worst 
their concern was heightened because two soviet ultimatums 
expired on saturday one threatening forcible capture of lithuanian 
deserters from the soviet army and the other ordering a halt to the 
organization of a lithuanian border guard 
at 225 am the parliaments press office sent an urgent 
message to international news media saying the tanks were just 18 
kilometers away 
please help spread the news it pleaded 
by that time lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis had 
suggested adoption of a resolution stating that in the event of 
soviet aggression government power would be delegated to the man 
who has served as lithuanias diplomatic representative in 
washington for years stasys lozoraitis 
deputies rangled over the wording finally prompting an 
exasperated landsbergis to warn that the soviet troops could arrive 
before they acted 
at 243 am the legislators adopted the resolution less than 
an hour later about 30 deputies raced from the building building 
to lean over a railing 100 yards away and watch the armor rumble 
past a seemingly endless row of headlights in the dark 
at that point they still did not know if the force would veer 
off the highway to take over the city 
butkavicius said he found a soldier from the neighboring 
sympathetic republic of latvia who told him the unit was heading 
for the siaures miestelis army base in north vilnius 
karvelis said there was still enough concern that 10 lawmakers 
spent what remained of the night in the parliament building with 
landsbergis in case the army came to arrest him 
we are not afraid prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said 
at 400 am but we dont know what they want and we dont know 
what will happen next 
it was not just lithuanias fate that seemed uncertain saturday 
morning said legislator volodya yarmolenko 
if the situation is destabilized here it will be destabilized 
throughout the soviet union he said

president mikhail s gorbachev on saturday named 
his key communist party aides to a new presidential advisory 
council in a move to transfer political power from the party to the 
government 
the top advisers foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
alexander n yakovlev as well as the chiefs of the military and 
secret police are among five members of the partys ruling 
politburo selected for the presidential council 
the official tass news agency said gorbachev also picked two 
wellknown writers an economist and two parliamentarians to serve 
on the council 
although gorbachev assumed the position of president more than a 
year ago real power remained with the party 
the party has been controlled by its central committee of a few 
hundred of the party elite the top leaders in the moscowbased 
politburo and gorbachev himself as general secretary 
however the party has been under attack from many quarters for 
its handling of the economy and other matters earlier this year 
it renounced its 70year monopoly on power 
by presidential decree the new council will be housed in the 
kremlin where gorbachev also will have his presidential office 
new constitutional amendments establishing a strong presidency 
provide for the presidents appointment of a presidential council 
to be responsible for implementing the major lines of domestic 
and foreign policy and ensuring the security of the country 
the prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov is the only exofficio 
member of the council there is no fixed number of appointees nor 
any requirement that council members meet as a group 
but the council offers gorbachev a mechanism for bringing his 
chosen aides and advisers into the government instead of relying 
on their positions in the party leadership to give them regular 
access to him 
in addition to ryzhkov shevardnadze and yakovlev the panel 
will be composed of yuri d maslyukov head of the state planning 
committee which controls the centrally planned economy vladimir 
a kryuchkov chairman of the kgb gen dmitri t yazov the 
minister of defense albert kauls and venyamin yarin of the 
congress of peoples deputies writers valentin rasputin and 
chingiz aitmatov of kirghizia and economist stanislav s shatalin 
kauls runs the adazhi agricultural production firm in riga 
latvia that has been cited as a model for moving from a centrally 
planned to a market economy yarin is a worker at a steelmaking 
complex in nizhni tagil in the ural mountains

the soviet union is entitled to pursue 
deserters from its army but should not act against the independence 
movement in luthuania vice president dan quayle said saturday 
what is happening is a very subtle display of force that in 
fact is trying to intimidate the people of lithuania not to go 
ahead with their independence quayle told reporters in arizona 
en route to a vacation in hawaii 
the united states is squarely on the side of lithuania and 
has never recognized the agreement between two evil men hitler 
and stalin that made lithuania part of the soviet union quayle 
said 
since lithuania declared its independence from the soviet union 
on march 11 soviet leaders have warned lithuania to return and 
friday a military adviser to soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
said they would try to round up deserters in lithuania after a 
deadline passed for them to return 
while the soviet union should not threaten lithuania if the 
soviet union is applying disciplinary measures to people in their 
own military thats a different situation quayle said 
i do not know what kinds of contractual agreement a member of 
the soviet army has when he or she signs up quayle said but 
there is a certain element of discipline that is absolutely 
imperative in any armed force 
quayle also drew a distinction between turmoil in the caucasus 
region where quayle said soviet military intervention was 
justified to prevent ethnic violence and the situation in 
lithuania which he described as an independence movement 
the caucasus battle was a civil disorder where the soviet 
union had the responsibility to keep law and order the vice 
president said 
lithuania is an entirely different situation this is not one 
group fighting against another group on an ethnic basis quayle 
added 
he declined to say what counter measures the united states might 
take but felt sympathy for gorbachev in the situation 
this will be a test to see if new thinking is going to 
continue in the soviet union or whether there will be a relapse to 
the old way of thinking he said

the capitals halfdozen timekeepers worked 
furiously saturday to set 2500 public clocks an hour ahead but 
the industry minister thinks its time europe did away with the 
daylightsavings ritual 
france and the 11 other nations of the european community added 
one hour to their clocks at 2 am sunday to take advantage of an 
extra hour of evening sunlight through the summer 
industry minister roger faroux however wants to end the 
practice citing a recent ministry report showing the benefits are 
nil and that nearly half the population dislikes the change 
the french like less and less being told what hour to get up 
and what hour to sleep faroux was quoted as saying in saturdays 
editions of the newspaper le parisien its rude to impose 
changes on citizens in their private lives 
france went to daylightsavings time in 1976 along with belgium 
the netherlands luxembourg and spain as an energysavings measure 
to deal with the oil crisis 
the european community has coordinated the practice among 
members so that their clocks get turned forward the last sunday of 
march the agreement expires next year however and faroux wants 
france to lobby the ec to keep clocks on one 24hour cycle all year 
long 
faroux says the amount of energy saved by daylightsavings time 
is negligible now that france is powered mostly by nuclear energy 
last october he asked the national assembly to open an 
investigation into the benefits of the extra hour 
a survey conducted during the investigation showed 44 percent of 
french citizens oppose daylightsavings time and 57 percent feel it 
has not improved their quality of life 
an end to the twiceannual change could find favor with paris 
six official clockkeepers they make a twoday 435mile circuit 
twice a year to reset hands and bells and keep the capitals 2500 
clocks on the hour 
the parisians are really picky about time said chief 
clockkeeper marc bintz one pendulum badly set can set off a 
miniscandal in a neighborhood

a group of 23 western nations said 
saturday it will open its arms wider to membership by eastern 
europes fledgling democracies 
however some officials reminded wouldbe members of the groups 
stringent standards for protecting human rights 
delegates at the twoday meeting of the council of europe 
reached broad agreement that the soviet union and its former east 
european satellites are genuinely interested in building 
democracies despite shaky foundations 
soviet deputy foreign minister yuri kashlev described the 
meeting as very satisfying 
the message was that the council of europe opens its doors to 
the soviet union and eastern europe he said 
the meeting was billed as the widest alleuropean forum since 
world war ii most of the 23 members of the council which is based 
in strasbourg france were represented by foreign ministers 
founded in 1949 the group is the oldest postwar organization 
striving for european unity it has been overshadowed however by 
the better known european community 
the kremlin once ridiculed the council as a propaganda tool for 
the capitalist west and its north atlantic treaty organization 
even though the united states is not a council member 
but now moscow sees the group as a possible cornerstone for 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs vision of a common european 
home that might eventually replace nato and the sovietled warsaw 
pact 
irish foreign minister gerard collins chairman of the european 
community ministers council welcomed closer cooperation with the 
east he said such collaboration would not slow the process of 
creating a single ec market after 1992 
its indubitable that the community will continue to be the 
motor behind economic cooperation and development he said 
earlier catherine lalumiere the council of europes 
secretarygeneral told a news conference all countries of 
central and eastern europe affirmed they have pluralistic 
democracies and respect for human rights as principle goals 
we want to give them assistance to realize those objectives 
she said 
but several western delegates including william waldegrave 
east european expert for britains foreign ministry and spanish 
foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez said the council 
should strictly maintain its defense of human rights when 
considering new members 
after four decades of totalitarian rule some eastern european 
nations are seeking help in creating new penal codes and 
overhauling once token parliaments 
hungary poland yugoslavia and the soviet union already hold 
what officials call special guest status in the council of 
europe bulgaria east germany and czecholovakia have applied for 
similar status

dr wangs genius helped spark the hightech revolution and 
his vision helped guide it sen edward m kennedy said in a 
statement in addition his commitment to social justice made him 
a pioneer in employee relations as well 
he was quiet humble brilliant decisive caring a great 
man a oneofakind person said paul guzzi a wang spokesman 
sometimes called his righthand man i think all of us who have 
been associated with him know he was a great man 
wang felt strongly enough about his company to fire his own 
eldest son frederick as chief operating officer and president 
after huge losses were posted in the late 1980s 
the growth of wang laboratories accelerated in 1964 after wang 
introduced a desktop calculator he steered his company around the 
plunge of the calculator market by focusing on the development of 
office computers 
looking at the results of the company over a long period of 
time clearly you have a visionary there said tobey choate 
vice president of information technology consulting at arthur d 
little inc 
because of the companys growth wang moved it northwest of 
boston to lowell in 1976 the move helped revitalize the declining 
manufacturing city 
a leader in word processing equipment in the 1970s wang 
laboratories stumbled in the 1980s analysts criticized the company 
for sticking with its proprietary systems instead of moving quickly 
into ibmcompatible machines in recent years its sales of 
minicomputers have been hurt by competition from powerful personal 
computers and workstations 
harsh retrenching and the sale of nonstrategic assets has cut 
the companys bank debt from 575 million last summer to under 100 
million with more cuts to come guzzi said 
the cutbacks have trimmed the companys worldwide work force 
from 28000 to about 22500 said ed pignone another wang 
spokesman 
frederick wang who became company president in 1986 at age 36 
stepped down in august after a weekend of discussions with his 
father who had remained chief executive officer 
in december the company announced it would offer new products 
compatible with industrywide standards 
guzzi said richard w miller a former general electric 
executive who succeeded frederick wang is in charge of the company 
and will continue with the planned strategies the board of 
directors plans to meet wednesday to review candidates for chief 
executive officer guzzi said 
choate the technology consultant said the loss of the 
companys founder could hurt morale at a crucial time 
clearly he was the spiritual leader at the company choate 
said take away peoples spiritual leader and you take the wind 
out of their sails 
wangs success enabled him to be a philanthropist he supported 
education and the arts including development of the wang center 
for the performing arts in boston 
i think its a terrible loss he was an exceptional man and 
someone i looked up to personally said josiah spaulding who 
heads the center 
wangs gift of 35 million to the center in 1983 propelled the 
theater from a terrible financial position and deteriorating image 
to a success spaulding said 
a native of shanghai wang was a schoolteachers son who came to 
the united states in 1945 he received a doctorate in physics from 
harvard university in 1948 
a small man who favored bow ties wang shied from publicity 
declining interviews and keeping public appearances to a minimum 
he was very private and in many ways led a very private 
life guzzi said 
wang is survived by his wife lorraine two sons frederick who 
remained with the company working on special projects and 
courtney a wang vice president and a daughter juliette a 
student 
funeral arrangements are pending

thousands of people lined the streets 
saturday to mourn a presidential candidate allegedly slain by drug 
traffickers opposition parties suspended their campaigns and 
demanded postponement of the may election 
bernardo jaramillo was shot pointblank thursday at bogotas 
airport police blamed drug traffickers 
drug traffickers killed the governing partys presidential 
hopeful luis carlos galan in august sparking a bloody war 
between the government and drug lords 
the right to life has disappeared completely the 
conservative party candidate rodrigo lloreda told reporters late 
friday at a news conference the government is not even providing 
that minimum guarantee 
the conservative party the countrys main opposition joined 
jaramillos patriotic union and other leftist parties late friday 
in suspending their campaigns 
they demanded that president virgilio barco postpone the may 27 
presidential election and provide additional security for 
candidates the communique from the opposition parties did not 
suggest a new date for elections 
barco of the governing liberal party did not respond to the 
demands the partys leader in the house of representatives 
norberto morales said the election should take place on the date 
prescribed by law 
jaramillos body was carried from the capitol building to 
bogotas main cemetery saturday in a symbolic funeral he will be 
buried sunday in his hometown of manizales 120 miles northwest of 
bogota 
radio reports said some 20000 people many of them crying and 
waving white handkerchiefs lined the streets 
several small explosions intended to cause panic occurred during 
the ceremony but authorities controlled the situation using riot 
police and armored cars said police spokesman luis enrique avila 
no injuries were reported 
the liberal party put off its saturday convention until after 
jaramillos burial 
the governing party is expected to ratify as its candidate cesar 
gaviria who won a march 11 primary by law barco cannot run for 
reelection 
colombias intellegence police said their investigations had 
shown that the leader of the medellin cocaine cartel pablo 
escobar ordered jaramillo killed escobar denied the charge in a 
letter friday to the patriotic union 
diego montana president of the patriotic union repeated his 
suggestion that the government was indirectly responsible for 
jaramillos death 
i dont know how a government that permits the elimination of 
the opposition can call itself liberal he said during a joint 
news conference with lloreda 
disturbances broke out thursday almost immediately after 
jaramillos death one soldier was killed by a sniper and six 
police officers were wounded before the street fighting was 
controlled early friday avila said 
the government has repeatedly denied the patriotic unions 
accusations that military forces have carried out an extermination 
campaign against the party assassins have killed 1044 of its 
members in the last four years 
police investigations have held that most of the assassinations 
were perpetrated by hitmen working for drug traffickers 
the communique from the opposition parties said foreign 
observors should oversee the electoral process in colombia the 
document was also signed by the communist party the socialist 
workers party and the april 19 movement a former guerrilla group 
that laid down its arms earlier this month

in the worst of times when joseph 
hazelwoods name was splashed in headlines and the lawsuits rolled 
in like the tide the exxon valdez skipper remembers identifying 
with the persecuted hero of a classic novel 
the book was les miserables he said and it seemed like 
i was jean valjean with a hundred inspectors chasing me around in 
the sewers of paris 
later in an anchorage courtroom he remembered a line he had 
read about the justice system being a meat grinder a sausage 
grinder you go into it in one form and you come out something 
else 
i went in there reasonably starryeyed that justice would be 
done he said if anything im more cynical now 
hazelwood who had just been acquitted of three major charges 
and convicted of a lowlevel misdemeanor in the nations worst oil 
spill reflected friday on the year that changed his life in his 
first interview since his trial began two months ago 
later in the day he was sentenced to pay 50000 restitution 
and spend 1000 hours helping clean up the oiled beaches of prince 
william sound 
he was asked in the interview how he felt about all the wildlife 
killed as the result of his oil spill 
it was a terrible tragedy he said theres no getting 
around it it will affect me as it will affect everybody for a 
long time 
the 43yearold skipper talked of his past and future after 
being acquitted of criminal mischief reckless endangerment and 
operating a vessel while intoxicated he was convicted of negligent 
discharge of oil 
his lawyers stood by as he spoke blocking detailed comments 
about the events of march 24 1989 when his ship went aground in 
prince william sound spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
civil suits remain to be faced 
hazelwood remembered his feelings when the tanker hit a charted 
reef 
it was just like a big punch in the gut like the winds 
knocked out of you but theres no recovering he said 
soon there were headlines alleging he was drunk while in 
command an issue that stings hazelwood even though jurors 
rejected it noting that bloodalcohol tests on the captain werent 
done until more than 10 hours after the grounding 
i resented it yeah he said the dragging in of my 
private life into a public arena alcohol didnt have anything 
to do with this its the biggest red herring it made for nice 
splashy headlines if i was an ax murderer ashore would that have 
made this a splashier grounding 
the tall balding hazelwood clad in a red and white rugby shirt 
and tan corduroy slacks in the hotel room interview described 
himself as a reasonably normal anonymous person before the 
grounding 
im joe schmo a boat driver basically and you get thrust 
into this limelight catapulted into this starring role i wasnt 
equipped for it 
maybe he said zsa zsa gabor could handle it or oliver north 
but not joe hazelwood 
who was joe hazelwood he was born in hawkinsville ga his 
father was a marine corps aviator and commercial 747 pilot an 
older sister and one brother became lawyers another brother 
conducts the battle creek mich symphony 
the family moved to long island when hazelwood was a teenager 
and he still lives there in huntington ny his wife suzanne is 
a former nurse and they have a 14yearold daughter alison 
the call of the sea came early 
there was a romance to the sea when i started out he said 
recalling how he signed up at 14 to sail on fishing boats 
i wanted to see what was over the horizon and i found out 
he said 
now in the world of high tech computerized tankers its 
developed into a pretty sterile atmosphere 
its not the captain lashed to the wheel or errol flynn flying 
through the rigging he said its pretty low key that was the 
biggest problem with the trial other than pretrial publicity 
educating the jury on how ships operate 
to accomplish that hazelwood turned to an old school chum 
michael chalos who was his classmate at the new york university 
maritime academy at fort schuyler ny 
chalos a jovial outgoing lawyer put together the defense 
team and hazelwood quiet and reflective grew as close as 
brothers asked what sustained him during the trial hazelwood 
said mostly it was michael and his effervescent personality 
hazelwood said he will be paying court costs for a long time 
his retirement savings and contributions from friends went into the 
defense he said exxon offered no financial help 
for weeks at the trial he sat and watched his former shipmates 
testify against him how did that feel 
theyre shipmates and friends they were just telling the 
truth he said im sure they didnt want to submarine me do 
me any harm 
he credited them with showing jurors what a topnotch crew had 
manned the exxon valdez saying they showed themselves to be 
professionals 
hazelwood even declines to fault the captains who took the stand 
for the prosecution and called him reckless that was their 
opinion he said 
but he insisted that the procedure of a captain leaving the 
ships bridge in the hands of other officers is not unusual 
its standard operating procedure 
once about 17 years ago he sailed as a junior officer on a 
freighter from new york to south africa 
the captain said to me can you find south africa i said 
yes sir he said call me when we get there hazelwood 
recalled 
does he think he was a scapegoat 
i always thought scapegoat was kind of a strong word he 
said i was a convenient lightning rod for a lot of agendas 
using me served their purposes well to deflect the limelight a 
year ago many people were outraged and you had corporations 
entities these nameless faceless organizations 
everyone wanted this person to relate to another human being 
not an office building they wanted a person to vent their 
frustrations on and unfortunately it was me 
now with the trial behind him hazelwood dreams again of the 
sea 
id like to sail as the master of something again he said 
but is unsure whether he wants to fight for his old job with exxon 
i dont know he said im ambivalent about them 
asked to talk about his immediate future hazelwood seemed 
perplexed he hasnt had times to make plans 
where would he like to be a year from now 
at sea he said going somewhere and coming from 
somewhere

lithuanias president likened his 
baltic republic to an occupied land on saturday and said a convoy 
of soviet tanks that rumbled through the capital had heightened 
fears of a clash with moscow 
nervous lithuanian lawmakers voted to transfer their power to 
foreign soil if they were assaulted or arrested and polls opened 
for multiparty elections to local governing councils 
young lithuanians who deserted the soviet army when their 
republic declared independence took refuge at a hospital saturday 
night hoping a pair of policemen and a few red cross signs would 
protect them from arrest by soviet authorities lithuanian 
officials recommended they seek refuge in churches 
in moscow the soviet foreign ministry ordered foreign 
diplomats including two americans out of lithuania and said 
foreign journalists would be barred from traveling to the republic 
there was no mention of foreign journalists already in lithuania 
meaning no news blackout was imposed 
in washington president bushs national security adviser brent 
scowcroft warned that any soviet use of force or intimidation in 
lithuania would be counterproductive to ussoviet relations 
about 100 soviet military vehicles containing at least 1000 
paratroopers armed with automatic weapons rumbled along the main 
highway through the heart of vilnius without stopping early 
saturday official lithuanian sources said 
there were at least 22 tanks and armored personnel carriers and 
dozens of green military trucks the parliaments information 
department quoted witnesses as saying there were 59 tanks and 50 
other vehicles no incidents were reported 
the convoy passed within about 100 yards of lithuanias 
parliament building lawmakers called the maneuvers another soviet 
attempt to rattle their nerves in the sofar peaceful campaign for 
independence 
since lithuania declared independence from moscow on march 11 
soviet leaders have repeatedly warned the republic to return to the 
soviet union president mikhail s gorbachev has called the move 
illegal but said he would not use force against the republic of 38 
million people 
in referring to saturdays maneuver lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis told the supreme council legislature we 
felt we were really in an occupied country an alien power sent 
forces and we dont know why 
tension is rising with this demonstration of military force 
with this frightening of people with soviet soldiers 
at a saturday night news conference deputy prime minister 
kazimieras motieka warned that political officers in the soviet 
military were telling soldiers they may have to act to prevent a 
coup detat he charged they were trying to prepare troops for 
attacking the democratically elected government of lithuania 
in tokyo leonid kravchenko head of the official soviet news 
agency tass said a state of emergency may be declared he did not 
elaborate but such a declaration by gorbachev would give the newly 
strengthened president greater authority to reassert soviet power 
in lithuania 
meanwhile lawmakers passed a resolution that would transfer 
power to the senior diplomat of independent lithuania in washington 
in case the soviets prevent them from freely conducting government 
business 
lithuania along with its baltic neighbors latvia and estonia 
enjoyed independence between the two world wars but was forcibly 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 as part of a secret nazisoviet 
pact 
vilnius was quiet saturday after the military column rumbled 
through at 4 am a time apparently calculated to avoid 
confrontations a parliament spokesman said he saw the column enter 
a military base at siaures miestelis on the north side of the 
capital where it stayed 
were not afraid but we dont know what they want and we 
dont know what they will do in the next few hours lithuanian 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene told reporters at the 
legislature 
many lithuanians shrugged off the latest show of soviet force 
we were prepared and the marching of tanks is nothing for us 
said arune taunyte a graphics designer 
we were afraid for 50 years but not now said rimas 
cequolis a 56yearold violinist 
there were no reports of soviet authorities moving in saturday 
to arrest the estimated 900 deserters from the soviet military 
gorbachevs deadline for their voluntary return to their posts 
we cannot physically protect each young man where he is 
hiding landsbergis told the parliament he suggested the young 
men avoid the homes of acquaintances and instead seek sanctuary in 
churches a traditional shelter for fugitives 
at least 28 deserters took refuge in a shelter organized by the 
lithuanian government at the new vilnius psychiatric hospital 
dormitory 
we expect that nobody would dare to attack the red cross 
said one of deserter there 20yearold darius baceulis 
if troops do come after them 19yearold arunas vazinskas said 
life would still be better in prison than in the army 
many deserters have complained they were beaten or harassed by 
comrades angry about their republics drive for independence 
gorbachev has also demanded that lithuania stop signing up 
volunteer forces and had sought a response from landsbergis by 
saturday 
landsbergis in a telegram to moscow on saturday said the 
volunteers would not replace soviet kgb border guards and uniformed 
police as gorbachev had suggested 
vremya a soviet news program said saturday night that 
interior ministry authorities have seized 5500 weapons in 
lithuania gorbachev had demanded lithuanians turn in their 
firearms 
the seized weapons included 873 guns that military auxiliary 
units in kaunus refused to surrender voluntarily the soviet 
program said only the intervention of military units enabled 
authorities to confiscate the weapons and 516000 rounds of 
ammunition it said there was no indication of violence in the 
arms seizure 
romas gudaitis a lithuanian representative to the national 
parliament in moscow said soviet authorities had rejected a

romania appealed to hungary on 
saturday to avoid exacerbating ethnic tension in transylvania 
where clashes between ethnic hungarians and romanians have killed 
at least seven people 
premier petre roman of romania made the plea during a 90minute 
meeting with hungarys ambassador pal szuts 
we hope the hungarian government will help us and not make the 
situation there more difficult by pronouncements which give the 
romanians in transylvania the feeling they are in danger a 
government statement obtained by the associated press quoted roman 
as saying 
the hungarian envoy had asked for the meeting because of 
mounting tension between the two warsaw pact allies over the rights 
of the 2 millionstrong minority of ethnic hungarians in 
transylvania in addition to the seven deaths about 300 people 
have been wounded in the clashes over the past week in the town of 
tirgu mures 
interim president ion iliescu of romania also appealed for calm 
he rejected complaints that his government had not acted firmly 
enough to prevent violence he said democratic methods are needed 
to solve ethnic conflicts 
romanians in transylvania fear that a campaign by ethnic 
hungarians for education in their own language is a veiled push for 
autonomy or even union with hungary hungarians deny those 
assertions 
hungary ruled transylvania for hundreds of years before 1920 
when the victorious allied powers of world war i transferred it to 
romania in return for help during the war 
romania and hungary traded recriminations this week after the 
clashes in tirgu mures 
the picturesque town about 160 miles north of bucharest was 
reported calm saturday the daily adevarul said members of both 
ethnic groups planned to demonstrate together sunday to show they 
could cooperate 
about 400 people gathered around the city hall building where 
officials of romanias postrevolutionary government met with 
representatives of the two communities to defuse the crisis 
a cordon of tanks and troops kept the crowd clear of the 
building as the demonstrators chanted down with iliescu they 
blame iliescu who took over leadership in december after the 
ouster of communist dicatator nicolae ceausescu for not doing 
enough to prevent ethnic strife 
late thursday the two sides approved a new county and municipal 
leadership composed of 13 romanians and eight ethnic hungarians 
in a related development press reports said saturday that the 
russian minority in the eastern province of dobrogea was demanding 
that instruction in regional schools be in russian 
ethnic russians who number about 100000 and refer to 
themselves as lipoveni also want a seminary for russian 
orthodox priests and free travel to the soviet union the libera 
daily said

to the subtle attempts to modify them 
the ceremony took place the same day the puyallup tribe in

our women ran with their children and were killed 
we must soothe their bones revive their spirits and save 
their nation 
it was the second gathering in a month as tribal officials 
attempt to focus attention on the issue 
indian leaders met in south dakota last month to discuss 
strategy after a controversial gathering in salt lake city last 
january by local government officials meeting as part of the 
national coalition on federal indian policy worried about tribal 
influences 
that meeting was sponsored by the wisconsin association of 
counties 
the menominee tribe of wisconsin is battling the county 
association over timber and fishing rights 
there are things happening that make my heart feel heavy 
said paul iron cloud former president of the oglala sioux from the 
pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota 
i feel that for the survival of our people we are going to 
have to come together iron cloud said it is a very historical 
event 
duncan was critical of a utah legislative task force set up to 
look into allegations that nonindians living on the uteouray 
reservation in uintah and duchesne counties are the victims of 
civil rights violations nonindians also complain about a sliding 
10 percent tribal severance tax on oil and gas taken from indian 
lands 
nonindians who live on our lands need to recognize our laws 
just like we recognize theirs when we leave the reservation he 
said we are fighting for a way of life all were asking is to 
leave our treaties alone

the puyallup tribe signed away its claim to 
much of its traditional land saturday in exchange for cash 
promises of jobs and education and a chunk of tacomas industrial 
waterfront 
this is one of the most important events in our tribes 
history said tribe chairman henry john at a packed downtown 
ceremony 
john said he did not expect the 162 million land claims 
settlement to solve all problems that have divided the indian and 
white communities over the past century but he said it gives a 
framework for resolving future disagreements 
under the agreement the secondlargest native land settlement 
in us history the puyallups are abandoning their claim to 20000 
acres at the mouth of the puyallup river the land now forms the 
port of tacoma and most of the citys industrial land 
it once was part of the tribes reservation but most was lost 
to white settlers in the late 1800s and early 1900s 
in return the tribe will receive a package that includes 900 
acres up to 20000 cash for each of the tribes 1500 members 
and trusts that promise a future of jobs education and security 
the only bigger native land settlement in the united states was the 
alaska native claims act 
the signing ceremony which included speeches by dignitaries and 
colorfully costumed dancers performing to tribal drums took place 
after the tribes attorneys appeared in us district court an hour 
earlier to ask for dismissal of a landclaims lawsuit filed in the 
early 1980s 
john bell attorney for the tribe told us judge john 
coughenour that of all the features in the agreement approved by 
tribe members in 1988 the most important was the tribes 
recognition by the larger community 
the tribe and its rights have gained a measure of respect 
he said 
sen daniel inouye dhawaii and chairman of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs said that while many of the injustices 
against indians will never be undone the puyallup agreement is a 
model for settling similar disputes 
people in tacoma have demonstrated there is an alternative 
to endless court battles over tribal claims he said 
inouye who made a dozen visits to tacoma to help in 
negotiations said he was approached by rep norm dicks dwash 
in 1987 to help resolve the dispute after a 1986 tribal vote 
rejected a proposed settlement he said he found bitterness on both 
sides but felt it was an opportunity to show negotiation could 
work 
both sides would have to put their necks on the line he 
said 
while some tribal members will undoubtedly squander their share 
of the payoff the majority will act responsibly because they 
know their brothers and sisters in indian country will be 
watching inouye said 
dicks said the cooperation built into the agreement benefits not 
only the tribe but also landholders in tacoma bypassed by 
development because indian claims clouded land titles 
the terms of this settlement will make the puyallup tribe a 
major economic force in our community he said 
eight to ten indian protesters appeared outside the courthouse 
and the downtown hotel where the signing ceremony took place with 
signs that read poor still poor puyallup tribe never gave 
us nothing and no delays pay today 
the protesters said they feared they would not get their 
individual payments the tribe has said it will probably be at 
least 60 days before the payments are made 
of the 162 million 51 million goes for dredging blair 
waterway on the industrial waterfront and improving roads in the 
area including some that lead to 240 waterfront acres deeded to 
the tribe 
other major elements of the settlement include 
24 million to provide the onetime payments to tribe members 
22 million in a permanent trust fund for social health and 
welfare needs of the tribe 
37 million as total value of the 900 acres the tribe will 
receive 
35 million for job training for 265 puyallups and jobs 
promised for 115 tribe members in pierce county privatesector 
businesses 
115 million for economic development 
10 million for fisheries enhancement 
contributors to the settlement include the federal government 
washington state private businesses and nearby municipalities

the tenth anniversary of the assassination of a noted salvadoran 
priest 
park police estimated 10000 people joined the demonstation 
police spokesman sgt jp farrell said 83 protesters were arrested 
and charged with demonstrating without a permit 
the group marched peacefully waved banners and called for a 
halt to us military aid to el salvador as a light steady snow

the march commemorated the assasination 10 years ago of 
archbishop oscar arnulfo romero who was gunned down in the pulpit 
of the salvadoran church where he frequently criticized rightwing 
death squads linked with the countrys military

speeches over a loudspeaker across the street from the white house 
meanwhile in san francisco an estimated 5000 people marched 
in a chilly fog from jefferson square park to the plaza in front of 
city hall 
protesters there carried signs remembering romero but many 
others advocated a nuclear freeze saving the environment or ending 
the death penalty 
scott harding a member of the san francisco committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador said the many causes 
expressed were appropriate on the anniversary of romeros death 
he was a very outspoken proponent of the need for peace and 
he addressed the same causes of the war in el salvador poverty 
and oppression harding said 
though evidence implicating extreme rightists involvement in 
the assassination was compiled by the 198489 christian democratic 
government no one was charged in the murder 
stop the bombing stop the war us out of el salvador the 
protesters in washington chanted as some of their number blocked 
the white house gates and were arrested

the administrations 1990 farm bill proposal 
for food aid to needy countries has been sent to congress 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said friday 
the united states has a long history of generous food aid and 
we intend to have that tradition continue yeutter said 
three food aid programs are most likely to be considered during 
the farm bill debate he said those include the food for peace or 
pl 480 program which provides up to 8 million metric tons of 
commodities to developing countries each year 
others are the food for progress program which authorizes both 
credit sales and donations to help developing countries establish 
privatesector economies and section 416b which authorizes 
additional donations of surplus commodities owned by the 
agriculture department 
yeutter said the proposals include a change in food for peace 
title i operations to allow direct grants at the discretion of the 
president for countries that meet the poverty criteria established 
by the world bank for civil works preference currently those with 
per capita incomes of 545 a year or less 
this would permit greater participation in foodaid grant 
programs by the poor countries particularly by the impoverished 
subsaharan african nations he said 
as it is now title i of food for peace authorizes longterm 
credit sales but includes no grant authority 
also yeutter said multiyear agreements with food for peace 
countries should be standardized currently various sections of 
the program have inconsistent authorities for multiyear 
agreements

the government is considering installation of 
concrete posts along heavily traveled sections of the usmexico 
border to deter illegal crossings and drug trafficking officials 
said friday 
verne jervis a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization 
service said commissioner gene mcnary was considering the concrete 
barriers in areas where there is heavy drivethrough traffic such 
as around ports of entry 
we have no final details jervis said its just something 
were considering at this point 
jervis said it was not known how many miles of the 
2000milelong border would be affected or how much the plan would 
cost he described the posts as similar to those in front of the 
white house 
mcnary who took over as ins commissioner late last year helped 
shelve a controversial proposal by his predecessor alan nelson to 
dig a 4mile drainage ditch in southern california to discourage 
illegal border crossings from mexico 
mcnary said then that he wanted to secure the border in a 
humane way and that repairing fences might be an alternative 
he disclosed the idea for the concrete posts at a hearing of the 
house appropriations subcommittee on commerce state justice and 
the judiciary on wednesday he said the barriers could be used to 
deter drug trafficking and to mark sections of the border 
the drainage ditch proposal was opposed by hispanic 
organizations and the mexican government opponents on both sides 
of the border likened it to the berlin wall and several mexican 
congressmen called it an unfriendly gesture 
the border patrol had contended that the ditch 8 feet deep and 
14 feet wide would make it harder for drivers to smuggle drugs and 
for illegal aliens to cross the desert near san diego 
mcnarys comments on securing the border with concrete posts 
come as illegal immigration along the southwestern border has begun 
to climb again after a threeyear decline 
according to ins figures apprehensions of illegal aliens 
considered the best indicator of illegal immigration were up in 
each of the past 10 months compared with the same months a year 
ago 
jervis said the surge in arrests began in may 1989 and has 
continued through at least february during the 10month period 
apprehensions totaled 801937 that represented a 299 percent 
increase from 617317 apprehensions during the same period a year 
ago 
apprehensions of illegal aliens began falling off in fiscal 
1987 the first year after congress passed the immigration reform 
and control act of 1986 which made employers subject to criminal 
and civil sanctions for knowingly hiring undocumented workers

the department of health and human services on 
friday proposed new regulations putting the burden on the states to 
ensure that the mentally ill and mentally retarded get appropriate 
care in nursing homes 
the proposal would implement a law passed by congress in 1987 
requiring states to set up programs to screen nursing home 
applicants and find more appropriate placements for mentally ill 
and mentally retarded applicants who do not need nursing facility 
care 
another proposed regulation would require nursing homes to meet 
new training and competency standards for nurse aides 
the screening requirement took effect jan 1 1989 although no 
regulations were in place the health care financing administration 
notified state medicaid directors at the time that compliance was 
required and provided preliminary guidance to the states 
failure of a nursing home to meet the terms of the screening 
requirement could result in its termination from the medicaid 
program 
the proposed rule outlines the specific details of the 
preadmission screening programs and requires an annual review of 
current nursing home residents with mental illness and retardation 
in the annual reviews nursing homes are to identify mentally 
ill and retarded patients who need active treatment for those 
conditions 
if a patient requires active treatment and has been in a nursing 
home less than 30 months and doesnt need nursing facility care 
the state must arrange for active treatment of the patient in a 
setting that more appropriately meets his needs 
nursing home residents who have been in a home for more than 30 
months but do not need nursing care may opt to stay there and the 
state must provide or arrange for active treatment under the rule 
nursing homes have been concerned about the screening 
requirement and many said last year that mentally ill and retarded 
patients would be turned out of nursing homes into the streets 
linda keegan a spokeswoman for the american health care 
association said that we didnt see a lot of problems with the 
preadmission screening but we dont know to what extent that was 
because of the flexibility states have had because detailed 
regulations arent yet in place 
under the proposal concerning training of nurse aides states 
must establish registries of nurse aides who meet training and 
competency requirements including any findings that a nurse aide 
has abused or neglected patients or stolen property 
both sets of rules were published in the federal register and 
each will have a 60day comment period before final rules are 
issued

the energy department plans to restart a 
savannah river nuclear weapons reactor this year without bringing 
it into compliance with the nations main water pollution law two 
environmental groups said friday 
the natural resources defense council and the energy research 
foundation which contend the reactor is not needed made the 
allegation in a letter to energy secretary james d watkins 
the groups notified the department that they would sue if 
watkins carried out his plan to restart the k reactor at 
savannah river before completing work on a cooling tower the 
tower scheduled for completion in 1992 would bring the facility 
into compliance with the federal water pollution control act of 
1972 
catherine kaliniak a department spokeswoman said doe was in 
compliance with the clean water act under a consent order issued by 
south carolina 
during the construction of the cooling tower k reactor can 
be restarted and operated under the consent order issued by the 
state she said 
the savannah river production site near aiken sc along the 
banks of the savannah river is the nations only source of 
tritium a gas needed in nuclear warheads all three reactors there 
have been closed for nearly two years for safety reasons 
watkins recently said he expected the k reactor to be back 
in production by the end of this year although he cautioned that 
the timing is not firm the two other reactors to be restarted in 
1991 circulate their heated water through manmade lakes before it 
reaches the river system 
the environmental groups contend that untreated water from the 
k reactor at temperatures of up to 180 degrees interferes 
with fish migration and causes other environmental damage the 
reactor began operating in 1954 
without the cooling tower this reactor will dump scalding 
water directly into natural streams and damage valuable wetlands 
said frances hart chairwoman of the energy research foundation a 
public interest group in columbia sc 
in their letter to watkins the environmental groups said the 
water pollution control act provides an alternative to building the 
cooling tower it says the president may exempt any federal 
facility from the law if he believes it is necessary to protect 
paramount national interests 
president bush has made no such determination 
dan reicher an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said such an exemption would be inappropriate because two 
other reactors at savannah river could be restarted to meet the 
tritium requirements without violating the water pollution law

a hollywood studio representative and nbctv 
exchanged verbal brickbats friday over a network program dealing 
with a new hollywood where small producers are likely to get 
sqashed by large sometimes foreign conglomerates 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america said he was outraged over nbcs the new hollywood 
broadcast wednesday night 
valenti said nbc criticized the hollywood trend toward 
conglomerates pushing out the little guys and international 
ownership and investment but failed to disclose nbcs efforts in 
washington to wrest back control of its programs from hollywood 
producers 
tom brokaw who anchored the program called valentis attack an 
insult to his journalistic integrity 
valenti in a letter to nbc president robert wright demanded a 
opportunity in television prime time to present a rebuttal to 
nbcs lack of disclosure 
nbc spokesman joe rutledge said valentis demand was idiotic 
that means no 
hollywood producers including the major studios that make up 
the mpaa have been involved in oftenacrimonious negotiations for 
seven years over 1970 federal rules that prevent abc nbc and cbs 
from having a financial interest in the programs they broadcast or 
from selling those programs in the lucrative us rerun market 
the television industry is being pressured by congress and the 
federal communications commission to resolve their differences 
valenti speaking at a news conference here said nbc should 
have placed a disclaimer on the brokaw program noting nbcs 
interest in the socalled financial interest and syndication talks 
the program he said was the clearest and most visible 
example of how a network abuses its vast power 
the fcc last week began a study of the financial interest and 
syndication rules but said it would hold up the process for 90 
days to give the studios and networks a final opportunity to work 
out their differences without government intervention 
if enough bias can be created in washington i think that 
might have an influence on the way the fcc or congress decides 
the issue valenti said 
nowhere did the show in its criticism of conglomerates 
reveal that nbc itself is owned by a huge conglomerate general 
electric he wrote in the letter to the network 
valenti emphasized that he was not questioning brokaws 
integrity 
i dont think tom brokaw had a bias i trust tom brokaw 
valenti told reporters 
he said his quarrel with nbc was its failure to disclose that it 
was in a political struggle and a regulatory struggle with the 
studios it was criticizing 
any suggestion that the new hollywood was an instrument of 
ge or nbc corporate policy is wrong outrageous and personally 
insulting brokaw said in a statement the documentary was 
conceived produced an edited solely by nbc news 
wright in a written response to valenti echoed brokaws words 
your assertion that i would direct nbc news to compromise its 
journalistic integrity to further nbcs or ges business interests 
is appalling and an insult to tom brokaw and his colleagues he 
wrote 
there are enough real issues to debate without making up 
scurrilous accusations wright said we are serious about 
achieving a reasonable solution to the financial interest and 
syndication rules lets get on with it 
rutledge said the program acknowleded that vertical 
integration is taking place and that foreign media conglomerates 
are buying up hollywood at a rapid pace 
mr valenti is a lobbyist for those foreign companies 
rutledge said he would no doubt prefer that the activities of 
his foreign clients were less visibly reported on

two senators urged transportation secretary 
samuel skinner on friday to move quickly to require random alcohol 
testing of airline pilots and other transportation workers 
there is no excuse for pilots drinking and flying sen 
ernest hollings dsc and john danforth rmo said in a letter 
to skinner citing the march 8 arrest of a northwest airlines 
cockpit crew 
the senators sponsored legislation passed by the senate that 
would require random alcohol tests but the bill has been bottled 
up in the house public works committee 
we urge you to exercise the full extent of your authority to 
ensure that an incident such as that which occurred march 8th on 
northwest airlines never happens again the senators wrote 
the transportation department is reviewing comments it solicited 
from november through march 9 on alcohol testing before proposing a 
specific program said hal paris a transportation department 
spokesman 
the department issued rules last november for testing 
transportation workers for drugs 
skinner said last year that a lot more thought needs to go 
into the idea of extending random drug testing to alcohol 
rep jim oberstar dminn who chairs the house public works 
subcommittee on aviation says random alcohol testing is unfair to 
workers because of the mistakes that can occur 
the threeman northwest crew flew a boeing 727 with 91 
passengers from fargo nd to minneapolis on march 8 while 
legally intoxicated investigators say 
capt norman prouse 51 of conyers ga first officer robert 
kirchner 35 of highland ranch colo and second officer joseph 
balzer 34 of antioch tenn were fired by the airline and charged 
by federal and state officials with operating an aircraft while 
under the influence of alcohol 
tests taken after the arrests showed they had bloodalcohol 
levels ranging from 006 percent to 012 percent investigators 
say federal regulations prohibit pilots from flying if they have 
alcohol levels higher than 004 percent the legal limit for 
driving a vehicle is 010 in most states

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said friday that recent reforms in south africa failed 
to make substantial changes 
his comments differed from observations made thursday by 
secretary of state james a baker iii and other us officials 
following meetings in cape town with president fw de klerk and 
black nationalists 
shevardnadze met with de klerk in namibia this week during 
ceremonies marking the nations independence from 75 years of south 
african rule 
he flew to harare late thursday on the fourth stop of a 
sixnation african tour it is the first trip to the area by a 
soviet foreign minister 
the soviets long supplied weapons to black nationalist 
guerrillas fighting the south african government moscow has no 
formal diplomatic relations with south africa having severed 
contact 34 years ago because of south africas apartheid policies 
of racial separation and white dominance 
shevardnadze told diplomats and government officials friday in 
harare that de klerk reforms including release of african 
national congress leader nelson mandela and legalizing the anc and 
other antiapartheid groups are not irreversible steps toward 
ending apartheid 
no one should have either the reason for euphoria or hope that 
the situation inside south africa has changed substantially 
shevardnadze said 
he said moscow supported peaceful solutions to south africas 
racial conflict and that there was a clear indication toward 
dialogue 
but in the meantime the changes that have taken place so far 
have not yet become irreversible 
he earlier told reporters de klerks reforms opened a new era 
for peace in southern africa 
baker after meeting with de klerk on thursday in cape town 
said the president told him the reform process was irreversible 
a us official accompanying baker said the secretary had 
doubted the governments commitment but thursdays meeting changed 
his mind 
on the first visit there by an us secretary of state in 12 
years baker also met with foreign minister pik botha and a 
delegation of officials from the anc and other antiapartheid 
groups 
the anc is to hold preliminary talks with de klerk on april 11 
as a possible step toward formal negotiations on rewriting the 
constitution to give the black majority national voting rights 
shevardnadze met for nearly an hour friday with president robert 
mugabe at the provincial town of kadoma 87 miles southwest of 
harare a soviet embassy spokesman said

the red cross says 338 million 
donated for relief after the oct 17 san francisco earthquake will 
be distributed in northern california not used for disasters 
elsewhere 
the 338 million which will go to private and public programs 
in seven counties is what remains of the 553 million donated to 
the red cross specifically as relief for the temblor which killed 
67 people and caused 7 billion in damage 
the nonprofit international relief organization planned to use 
much of the remaining money for disasters elsewhere but the red 
cross changed its mind after criticism from san francisco mayor art 
agnos and others who said the money contributed for earthquake 
relief should be spent in northern california 
the city and county of san francisco will receive the largest 
single allocation 54 million to help finance two centers for 
homeless people displaced when the earthquake ruined 700 
inexpensive hotel rooms the red cross announced thursday 
so far the red cross has spent over 13 million on direct 
relief and expects to spend an additional 94 million for 
outstanding bills and continuing aid to earthquake victims 
agnos who had sought up to 79 million to help the citys 
homeless praised the red cross 
as a mayor i know the feeling of being on the receiving end 
of a barrage of criticism agnos said i am grateful they 
listened to our ideas on how to help those affected by the 
earthquake 
a 10member red cross committee which reviewed 80 requests from 
public and private organizations seeking a total of 78 million 
granted 37 of the requests and will consider an additional 20 said

a new un report painted a bleak picture friday 
of the worlds 42 poorest countries becoming poorer with economic 
growth rates lagging behind the population explosion 
it blamed domestic policy failures and lack of international 
help and urged enormous endeavors to reverse the decline 
the secretariat of the united nations conference on trade and 
development which released the report called for a relief program 
that would double development assistance and eliminate bilateral 
debt 
average annual growth of the countries gross domestic product 
was 23 percent during 198088 compared to a 72 percent target 
set by a special un conference in 1981 according to the 250page 
report 
agricultural production affected in some countries by drought 
or floods grew by 2 percent annually half the targeted growth at 
the same time the population increased by 24 percent every year 
to a present estimated total of 440 million 
this would reach 882 million by the year 2015 if present 
demographic trends continue for the third world as a whole the 
population increase is expected to total 65 percent the next 25 
years to about 48 billion the report said 
the 42 countries surveyed were afghanistan bangladesh benin 
bhutan botswana burkina faso burundi cape verde central 
african republic chad comoros north yemen south yemen 
djibouti equatorial guinea ethiopia gambia guinea 
guineabissau haiti kiribati laos lesotho malawi maldives 
mali mauritania mozambique burma nepal niger ruanda samoa 
sao tome and principe sierra leone somalia sudan togo tuvalu 
uganda tanzania and vanuatu 
their share of world exports declined to 03 percent in 1988 
down from 14 percent in 1960 total outstanding debt doubled from 
1982 to 1988 to 69 billion 
a prime factor was the declining trend in world prices for 
primary commodities that still make up about twothirds of their 
total exports the report noted 
but it also said domestic policies had been an important 
factor in restricting export development 
the report said rising demand for food water land firewood 
and other natural resources had further aggravated an already 
precarious ecological balance in many of the countries 
it said a new class of displaced persons have emerged in these 
countries in the 1980s environmental refugees 
growing human pressure on the natural environment has either 
rendered ecosystems more vulnerable or triggered off a 
selfreinforcing process of natural degradation or both as a 
result more people are affected by natural catastrophes such as 
landslides cyclones earthquakes and flood than before 
domestic economic adjustment programs failed to get enough 
outside financial support and achieved at most limited 
success the report said lack of financial resources also forced 
cutbacks on spending for social services 
it said the causes of the generally dismal performance are to 
a very large extent related to domestic policy shortcomings coupled 
with insufficient and inadequate international support 
a special un conference is to deal with the situation in the 
least developed countries in paris next september and consider 
possible action

an appeals court friday rebuffed 
attempts by john e list accused of killing his family 18 years 
ago to move his trial and sequester the jury because of the 
notoriety his case has drawn 
the threejudge panel of the appellate division also denied 
lists attorneys request for more peremptory challenges in 
choosing a jury lawyers use the challenges to dismiss potential 
jurors during selection 
the lawyer elijah l miller jr repeatedly has asked the trial 
judge for a change of venue from nearby elizabeth and a sequestered 
jury 
superior judge william le wertheimer refused the requests in 
january and again this week when the jury of 12 and four alternates 
was chosen 
miller and union county prosecutors made further arguments on 
the issues in the chambers here of appellate judge william a 
dreier judges nicholas scalera and william dannunzio participated 
by conference call 
wertheimer ended jury selection on the second day wednesday 
after miller used up all 20 challenges allowed under state rules 
the judge declined to allow him any more despite having the 
discretion to do so 
since the beginning miller strenuously has argued that 
extensive publicity given the case guarantees that list wont 
receive a fair trial 
during jury selection a number of prospective panelists said 
they had read or seen news accounts of the case when the bodies of 
lists family were discovered in december 1971 and since lists 
arrest in june the arrest followed a tip to a nationally 
television anticrime show that featured his case 
some prospective jurors even said they remembered seeing that 
broadcast

accounts were dismissed others were let on the panel after they 
assured the judge and attorneys that they could remain impartial

the case of three northwest airlines pilots 
accused of flying a passenger jet while intoxicated has been the 
source of jokes by some television comedians and airline passengers 
for northwest pilots its a bad joke 
what pilots arent laughing at are remarks such as one by 
television talk show host pat sajak we had sleet and hail in los 
angeles last night either that or a northwest airlines cockpit 
crew was having frozen margaritas 
pilots tell of embarking passengers poking their heads into the 
cockpit recently and jokingly asking do you mind if i smell your 
breath 
you hear an awful lot of comments in the cockpit before a 
flight said one northwest pilot who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
you are supposed to have the door open and greet the people 
he said there are days now when you want to close the door and 
not deal with them 
rich saikel of the air line pilots association said the union 
has been flooded with calls from upset pilots besieged by passenger 
comments the union believes that some of the remarks border on 
accusations which they say could ruin careers 
in my opinion if it is a clearcut accusation i would ask a 
law enforcement agency to detain the passenger to ascertain the 
basis for their comment and the crew member needs to be tested to 
prove their innocence saikel said 
the jokes have been building since march 9 the day after the 
cockpit crew of a northwest flight carrying 91 passengers from 
fargo nd to the twin cities was placed under citizens arrest 
on suspicion of flying while intoxicated 
the three allegedly had been drinking heavily in a bar in 
moorhead the night before bloodalcohol tests after they landed in 
the twin cities showed that all three exceeded the legal limit of 
04 percent officials have said 
the three who were fired by northwest and had their pilot 
licenses revoked by the federal aviation administration were 
charged thursday by federal and state officials with operating an 
aircraft while under the influence of alcohol 
the charges were filed by the us attorneys office in 
minneapolis and by north dakota officials against capt norman 
prouse of conyers ga first officer robert kirchner of highland 
ranch colo and second officer joseph balzer of antioch tenn 
saikel said the incident has hurt innocent people i have been 
flying commercial airlines around this world for 13 years but 
there has not been a widespread problem but the question has been 
raised in the publics mind of the integrity of the flight crews 
in the meantime the oneliners continue in the air and on the 
airwaves on the tonight show guest host jay leno made this 
observation about the northwest crew they wouldnt have got 
caught but a group of passengers saw them riding around and around 
on the baggage carousel

former exxon valdez skipper joseph 
hazelwood will face hearings to determine if he should continue 
holding his maritime masters license coast guard commandant paul 
yost said friday 
i think there will be a procedure against the license of that 
master yost said at a news conference at which he also evaluated 
environmental damage to prince william sound site of the nations 
worst oil spill a year ago 
the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker ripped its hull open on a 
reef on march 24 1989 hazelwood was charged last year with a 
felony criminal mischief and three misdemeanors but was 
convicted thursday on only one count negligent discharge of oil 
yost said hazelwood faces suspension revocation or renewal of 
his license exxon fired him shortly after the disaster 
although yost blamed human error for the spill he appeared to 
partially absolve hazelwood of responsibility 
a fully qualified third mate ran the vessel aground he said 
it was clear from the trial and from other evidence that human 
error caused the grounding yost said no matter what technological 
changes are introduced or what new laws are enacted the coast 
guard cannot guarantee that similar groundings will not happen 
again he said 
weve got to be very careful we dont have a spasm response 
to the spill he said 
yost denied claims that the coast guards system of tracking 
vessels had failed before the spill 
the system was never designed to track tankers outside the 
valdez arm he said bligh reef which the tanker struck is 
near the end of the arm but outside the normal shipping channels 
the exxon valdez was outside the outbound channel to avoid floating 
ice 
however yost said the coast guard would install a new radar 
system that will be better able to track tankers especially in bad 
weather 
the new radar probably will reach to bligh reef although the 
area never has been considered difficult to navigate he said 
congress is considering legislation that would allow the coast 
guard to conduct more detailed background investigations of 
prospective ship captains and mates yost said 
federal privacy statutes had kept the coast guard from delving 
sufficiently into the histories of merchant marine officers in the 
past he said 
drug and alcohol abuse by applicants would be a major factor 
considered in the licensing process he said 
one of the accusations against hazelwood was that he was 
intoxicated while in command of the vessel jurors did not buy that 
argument however because blood alcohol tests were not conducted 
until 10 hours after the accident

a lawsuit over a drugladen plane leased to 
federal agents and linked to the contras was settled out of court 
friday sparing us attorney general dick thornburgh a trip to 
wichita to testify 
i approved the settlement this afternoon and the case is 
over us district judge patrick kelly said a week after 
ordering thornburgh to appear in court april 2 to explain why the 
government abandoned an earlier settlement 
kelly said friday that his approval of the settlement between 
government attorneys and the plaintiffs makes moot the issue of 
thornburghs appearance 
a spokesman for the justice department in washington michael 
robinson confirmed the settlement but had no other comment 
the case involved a twinengine beech king air ditched in the 
caribbean sea on jan 3 1983 the pilot convicted smuggler 
michael toliver later testified that he flew arms to nicaraguas 
contra rebels and illegal drugs back to the united states several 
times under the supervision of federal agents 
the judge canceled a civil trial over the planes loss set for 
january after being told in november that the case had been 
settled through mediation then last week richard montague an 
assistant us attorney general from washington told kelly that 
justice department officials had never approved that settlement 
montague said the case should go to trial 
kelly then ordered thornburgh to appear and straighten out the 
lawsuits status 
the judge said at the time that he also was frustrated with the 
governments response to tolivers disclosures and that he thought 
the case involved criminal conduct by the united states 
montague objected saying toliver was the only witness making 
such statements and that his credibility was questionable 
he also said the insurance case had nothing to do with those 
statements and that the question of whether a criminal 
investigation was warranted was up to the attorney general not the 
judge 
toliver serving a marijuana smuggling sentence in north 
carolina was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony 
he testified in kellys court in 1987 that he made two trips to 
honduras and colombia the previous year with arms for the contras 
and returned to the united states with loads of cocaine and 
marijuana he said he landed at homestead air force base fla 
with one drug load and that he worked as an informant and contract 
employee under federal supervision 
toliver testified that he wasnt working for the government when 
he crashed the plane he said he had disconnected a us customs 
service homing device aboard the plane and took off in another 
direction with a load of marijuana he ditched the craft off grand 
cayman island when he ran out of fuel trying to avoid storms 
the lawsuit was filed by midland national bank of newton kan 
which said it had a 198000 lien on the plane 
the defendants included the planes owner walter conlogue who 
said his company american aircraft co of newton leased the 
aircraft to us customs agents to help in an undercover 
investigation 
puritan insurance co of stamford conn refused to pay a claim 
on the planes 225000 insurance policy saying conlogue lied 
about the planes use conlogue said he was warned that if he did 
not do so innocent people would suffer and be killed 
the insurance company was both a plaintiff and a defendant in 
the lawsuit the government was also a defendant 
the judge was so alarmed by tolivers statements in 1987 that he 
ordered transcripts sent to the fbi cia and to thenpresident 
reagan

joseph hazelwood faltered in the difficult 
task of skippering the exxon valdez but the greatest blame for the 
nations worst oil spill rests elsewhere two professional mariners 
said friday 
and as long as ships laden with oil continue to ply coastal 
shipping lanes for a fuelhungry public accidents are possible 
they said 
an alaska jury acquitted hazelwood on thursday of charges of 
being drunk recklessness and criminal mischief in connection with 
the nearly 11 million gallon spill in prince william sound one year 
ago saturday he was convicted of negligently discharging oil a 
misdemeanor 
im glad that hazelwood got released from that burden said 
olaf meyer 82 of san pedro whose 54year maritime career 
included shepherding tankers in alaska for standard oil and working 
as a los angeles port pilot 
meyer said that although hazelwood erred in leaving the bridge 
while the ship was out of its normal shipping channel to avoid 
floating ice he did not deserve conviction on criminal charges 
meyer said exxon shouldnt necessarily reverse its decision to 
fire hazelwood his decision to leave the bridge and questions 
about his sobriety are justification for keeping him from a 
captains post meyer said 
prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to prove that hazelwood was 
drunk at the time of the accident he underwent an 
alcoholrehabilitation program in 1985 after two drunkendriving 
convictions 
exxon already gave him a lot of latitude meyer said 
carl mccormick 38 a los angeles harbor pilot and vice 
president of the los angeles port pilots local 68 was stronger in 
his defense of hazelwood and critical of the oil industrys role in 
such accidents 
hazelwood was being judged before the facts came out 
mccormick said he made a poor judgment decision by leaving the 
bridge when he did but you have to look beyond why someone who 
makes thousands of sound decisions makes one bad one 
we think that is due to crew cutbacks and the extreme number 
of hours and extreme pressure put on people forced to work beyond 
safe limits 
mccormick who said hazelwood was unfairly fired and deserves 
his job back called exxon the guilty party in the spill the 
company has called the spill an accident and denied any culpability 
the public is unaware of the stress faced by those responsible 
for guiding vessels that can be as long as three football fields 
said mccormick who has worked for several oil companies 
sixteenhour days increasingly heavy paperwork and burdensome 
technology take a heavy toll he said 
you look at hazelwood and think there but for the grace of 
god goes me or any other tanker captain its not a situation 
nobody else has been in he happened to be the unlucky one

a taiwanese fish broker who admitted arranging to 
smuggle 500 tons of illegally caught salmon into this country was 
sentenced friday to nearly six years in prison 
patrick lee 42 whose arrest july 18 was part of a dual action 
on the high seas and outside a major seattle bank also was ordered 
by us district judge carolyn r dimmick to pay 66000 in 
restitution but the judge said that amount might be reduced by the 
amounts five others are ordered to pay when they are sentenced 
no further fine will be imposed because he is unable to pay 
it the judge said 
lee apologized for the mistake i have committed and promised 
to work for greater wildlife protection measures by the taiwanese 
government he could have faced as much as 30 years in prison and 
1 million in fines 
us fishermen have complained that taiwanese and others are 
overfishing salmon by catching them in driftnets supposedly set 
for other species such as squid 
the case was based on the lacey act which bars the importing of 
illegally caught fish or wildlife the judge ruled that a taiwanese 
administrative ban on salmon fishing by taiwanese vessels 
constituted a foreign law making the fish contraband under us 
law 
defense attorney mark mestel said he would appeal that ruling 
which resulted in lee pleading guilty to conspiracy smuggling and 
moneylaundering 
mr lee could not have been prosecuted in taiwan because the 
regulation applied only to the vessel operator and skipper he told 
dimmick the fish broker could not be punished 
however assistant us attorney robert chadwell said lee knew 
he was violating us law during the sixmonth sting that led 
to his arrest 
the sting which involved agents from the national marine 
fisheries service coast guard and customs service began in march 
1989 after lee offered to sell a us seafood processor large 
quantities of salmon caught in driftnets used by taiwanese vessels 
to catch squid 
lee who had been in business about two years subsequently 
agreed to sell an undercover agent 500 metric tons of salmon for 
13 million 
the trap was sprung july 18 as two taiwanese squid fishing boats 
delivered salmon to a refrigerator ship chartered by two undercover 
agents in the middle of the pacific ocean three of lees 
associates were arrested on the us vessel and lee and two others 
were arrested after examining 13 million in a bank safe deposit 
box in seattle and leaving with 330000 
the 66000 lee was ordered to repay represented money one of 
his associates had accepted as an advance payment 
lee was sentenced to 70 months for money laundering and 60 
months each for conspiracy and smuggling all three to be served 
concurrently counting time served and good time in prison he 
could be released in less than 4 years said mestel

a retired dominican republic general has jumped 
bond and returned to his homeland rather than face trial here for 
his role in an alleged bribery scheme to free seized drug planes 
federal officials said friday 
joaquin pou 55 was indicted and arrested in november along 
with the former chairman of floridas democratic party alfredo 
duran and pous aide jose guasch 
pou and the others were charged with violating the federal 
foreign corrupt practices act freed on 50000 bond pou failed to 
report as required on feb 21 and was declared a fugitive 
according to court documents released friday 
pous attorney jeffrey swartz told the associated press he had 
flown to santo domingo to persuade his client to return 
i told him that while i could make no guarantees i felt 
certain that he would be acquitted and that he should certainly 
return to miami swartz said saying he felt hopeful pou would 
return 
he also noted that even if convicted his client would only 
serve 2 to three years in prison 
pou reportedly went on television on his homeland to explain why 
he refused to submit to a us trial 
when pou was first arraigned he had to surrender all travel 
documents and sign a waiver agreeing not to fight extradition back 
to the united states 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said 
she could not comment on pous case but said it was the 
departments policy to pursue all extradition cases 
also on friday robert gurin a miami airplane recovery 
specialist named in the original federal complaint but never 
indicted pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the same act 
sentencing was set for may 23 
gurin has cooperated with federal investigators according to 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to affidavits filed in the case the government 
investigated gurin because of allegations he had bribed 
highranking military officials in the dominican republic and other 
caribbean countries to recover drug planes 
the government used an informant to pose as an agent for the 
owner of a plane seized by the dominican military gurin allegedly 
told the informant that duran would channel the money to dominican 
generals through his escrow account the affidavit said 
between february and october the informant met with gurin pou 
guasch and duran to iron out details of the bribery scheme the 
affidavit said most of the meetings were taperecorded or 
videotaped by fbi and customs officials 
duran who headed the state democratic party from 1976 to 1980 
has denied the allegations and has accused us attorney dexter 
lehtinen a former republican state senator of political 
motivations in the case 
lehtinens office has denied that charge saying the case was 
presented to and approved by a federal grand jury

dare foods ltd said friday it has 
recalled a uspackaged brand of animal crackers sold only in 
canada because an 11yearold girl found part of a metal blade in 
a box of the cookies 
dare school bus animal cookies were being removed from store 
shelves across canada said gary macleod vice president of sales 
for dare of kitchener ontario 
weve contacted our warehouses and asked them to isolate 
shipments and have asked our sales representatives to pull the 
product from the stores macleod said customers can return the 
cookies to stores for refunds he added the girl was not injured 
and no other problems have been reported he said macleod said 
dare receives the cookies fully packaged from dairy state foods 
inc of milwaukee and distributes them to stores in every canadian 
province the cookies are made exclusively for dare and sold only 
in canada 
he said he could not estimate how many boxes of crackers were in 
distribution but expected it would take about 10 days to clear the 
product from the market 
federal health and welfare spokesman doreen moore said officials 
suspect the piece of blade could have accidently gotten into the 
box during packaging before the crackers were shipped to canada 
it might have been from the blade of a utility knife used to 
open a box macleod said 
the box did not appear to have been tampered with but ms moore 
said officials have not ruled out sabotage 
denise shaughnessy said her 11yearold daughter crystalann 
discovered the metal piece in the box of cookies while walking home 
from school 
she just took it out and put it into her pocket not 
realizing how dangerous it could have been and kept eating she

the first week of jury selection in the fraud 
trial of imelda marcos and adnan khashoggi ended friday with the 
judge having chosen 45 potential jurors 
the prospective jurors selected from a pool of 150 will be 
considered for the final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates to 
be chosen tuesday when the trial resumes in federal court 
mrs marcos 60 is charged in the alleged illegal transfer of 
more than 160 million from the manila government and defrauding 
banking institutions of 165 million more 
her husband former philippine president ferdinand marcos was 
named in the original october 1988 indictment but died in hawaii on 
sept 28 
khashoggi a saudi financier once described as the worlds 
richest man is accused of helping the marcoses conceal a series of 
new york real estate deals allegedly financed in part with money 
stolen from the philippines treasury 
in an interview with khashoggi broadcast friday on abcs 
2020 barbara walters said he told her that he never dealt 
directly with the marcoses but rather with an aide to mrs marcos 
walters said khashoggi told her the real estate deal was a 
straight business swap ownership of new york city buildings for 
shares of an oil mining project in the sudan 
he said the deal made sense because it would have provided the 
philippines with a source of oil it needs to import 
judge john f keenan told defense lawyers friday to follow court 
rules that allow them to discuss only what has been revealed in 
court prosecutors had complained thursday that mrs marcos 
lawyer gerald spence was talking too much to the press 
lawyers are supposed to conduct themselves under the rules if 
they dont sanctions will be imposed keenan said ive never 
been one to back off from a fight

the 23nation council of europe met in 
special session friday and discussed ways to help eastern europes 
fledgling democracies 
diplomats from seven east european countries also are attending 
the meeting billed the biggest alleuropean forum since world war 
ii but the twoday session will be fully open to them only on 
saturday 
on friday the officials also discussed ways of raising the 
institutions profile and the possibility of forging closer links 
with the united states and canada 
a working paper presented on friday suggested the council could 
in time become a transatlantic watchdog for human rights set out 
by the conference on security and cooperation in europe in the 1977 
helsinki accords 
the idea to meet east bloc perestroika with a new look for the 
council of europe the oldest postwar organization working for 
european unity was advanced by secretarygeneral catherine 
lalumiere and the chairman portuguese foreign minister joao de 
deus pinheiro 
the council founded in 1949 has been largely overshadowed by 
the more influential european community a separate 12nation 
organization which began as the european common market but 
expanded from its trading bloc status 
with the rush toward democracy in eastern europe and toward 
german unification ms lalumiere says the council has gained 
stature as the only european organization flexible enough to adapt 
quickly 
most delegates said it was ridiculous to create a new code and 
control mechanism because one already exists she told a news 
conference after the first day of meetings 
the councils 1950 human rights convention already protects 
individual europeans with a sophisticated commission and court 
mechanism and its proponents argue it could be easily extended to 
cover eastern europe and north america 
hungary poland yugoslavia and the soviet union have already 
acquired what council officials call special guest status and 
bulgaria east germany and czechoslovakia have applied hungary 
poland and yugoslavia also requested full membership 
romania has made no applications and will not attend the lisbon 
meeting for east european countries the council of europe 
constitutes the symbol of democratic values from which they have 
been cut off for 40 years deus pinheiro told delegates friday 
they need vital support to help build their democracies 
the working paper friday also proposed possible association 
status to the council for the united states and canada 
us and canadian officials have participated to some extent in 
the councils work but have focussed more on the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe that organization includes 
north america and all european countries except albania as the 
major eastwest forum 
in east europe the council has already sent experts to help 
hungary organize local elections and could help eastern europe 
revamp oppressive penal codes and overhaul previously rubberstamp 
parliaments 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany told the 
meeting official contacts should begin to forge closer links with 
north america 
we need the united states and canada in the csce conference 
on security and cooperation in europe and we want them in the 
council of europe said genscher 
he said more north american involvement would be welcomed also 
by moscow which once regarded the strasbourgbased council as a 
mouthpiece for the capitalist west and its north atlantic treaty 
organization military alliance 
the soviet union sees the council as a possible foundation for 
president mikhail s gorbachevs vision of a common european home 
that could eventually replace the nato and the warsaw pact with 
transatlantic security forum

trained to believe that general recessions are 
inevitable many economists have searched diligently over the past 
two years for supporting evidence 
occasionally they think they find that evidence and they make a 
quick grab for it but then just as a youngster opens his squeezed 
fist and finds he didnt catch the grasshopper they discover they 
have nothing 
month by month bit by bit the evidence seems to be presented 
lagging car sales lower stock prices weak retail sales lowered 
investor confidence home starts off then the opposite occurs the 
numbers reverse themselves no trend there 
its been that way for two years now but rather than being 
discouraged some searchers are more convinced than ever that the 
beast is out there ready to pounce its been seven long 
years they say it has to come 
in fact some of them are convinced it must come recessions are 
not all bad these theorists say recessions might even be 
necessary to kill off excesses of demand or expectations or 
borrowing they are corrective 
the theorists are correct about the seven years measured 
nationally no recession has occurred in that time national 
figures they say are the only evidence thats the way they were 
trained thats the way they believe 
national statistics dont lie they say and you tend to agree 
in spite of lapses corrections revisions and adjustments united 
states economic figures are usually conceded to be the worlds most 
accurate 
no they may not lie but some critics contend the economic 
numbers hide the facts at least from those who read them in a 
certain way from those who by habit look for certain evidence and 
ignore other evidence 
the habitual way of proving recession is to examine the national 
readings for gross national product which is the total output of 
goods and services if the gnp shrinks for two successive quarters 
you have a recession 
by that definition there has been no recession since the fall of 
1982 
but what about regional recessions or economic shrinkages that 
affected some of the country but not all of it or industrywide 
recessions that didnt spread to the general economy by that 
measure there have been lots of them 
in that time period farm states have had a recession 
simultaneously mining and manufacturing states were down too 
several states had deep recessions due to oil pricing real estate 
has been off in several areas 
at one point sindlinger amp co an economics researcher told 
clients that more than 30 states could be considered in recession 
but this important recession never showed up in the national 
numbers coastal booms offset it 
those who work in specific industries can relate their recession 
woes among these industries farming mining homebuilding 
defense automobiles remember the oil patch problems and the rust 
belt 
right now there is a recession in the securities industry more 
than half the brokerage houses on the new york stock exchange lost 
money in the fourth quarter of 1989 savings and loans are in bad 
shape new england banks too 
to say there has been no recession in seven years is to ignore 
the evidence of regional and industry recessions this is the 
contention of those who support the rolling readjustment or 
traveling recession theory 
they say that for reasons not fully understood perhaps it has 
something to do with a better understanding of economics at the 
federal reserve the nation has had its recession here and there a 
bit at a time piecemeal 
the beast they say might have changed its habits rather than 
crashing out of the jungle with a leap and a roar it stalks the 
edges of the economy nibbling here and there getting its way that 
way and covering its tracks

its official peanut butter now has been 
sticking to the roofs of our mouths for a century 
chunky or creamy eaten plain or with jelly bananas mayonnaise 
or marshmallows peanut butter has stood the test of time and 
that doesnt just mean a long day in a hot school lunch box 
this month peanut butter enthusiasts are celebrating the 100th 
anniversary of the creation of the ideal family food cheap 
filling and nutritious despite the high fat content that 
celebrities also love 
for starters theres elvis presley his favorite sandwich was 
peanut butter and bananas grilled in butter according to 
biographer albert goldman presley and his cronies once flew to 
colorado just to pick up a batch of gourmet peanut butter 
sandwiches 
tennis player chris evert was said to eat peanut butter on 
wholegrain bread as a lastminute snack before matches 
conservative columnist george will says he eats a peanut 
butterandsweetpickle sandwich a family tradition twice a week 
former president ford is among the 50000 members of the adult 
peanut butter lovers fan club and retired sen barry goldwater 
once used peanut butter for shaving cream while on a camping trip 
peanut butter in short is an american classic and a 1 
billion industry 
still its origins remain something of a mystery 
the atlantabased peanut advisory board knows that a st louis 
doctor is responsible for peanut butters debut in march 1890 and 
that patents for peanut grinding machines were issued several years 
later but it doesnt have a name for the man who first ground 
peanuts into paste and spread them on a slice of bread 
nobody thought it was a big deal back then said suzanne 
corbett a culinary historian in st louis who says shes close to 
solving the case they decided it was greattasting and cheap 
but the emphasis was on commercialism not invention 
according to the peanut advisory board the st louis doctor 
created peanut butter as a nutritious protein substitute for his 
elderly patients whose teeth were so poor they could not eat meat 
the doctor who made his peanut butter with a kitchen 
handgrinder then went for mass marketing george a bayle jr 
owner of a food products company packaged and sold the spread for 
6 cents a pound 
bayle peanut butter cans from the 1910s bear the inscription 
a sandwich a day keeps your children at play 
since december corbett has been poring over the bayle company 
files which are scattered over the st louis area and has been in 
contact with a woman in her 70s who worked for the bayle company 
shes narrowed the possibilities down to four men and is working 
on the supposition that the inventor of peanut butter worked for a 
sanitarium near bayles factory 
its sort of like peeling wallpaper off an old room corbett 
said you keep going down and down and down i feel like im 
right there 
corbett is certain the credit should not go to dr john harvey 
kellogg of battle creek mich a surgeon who patented the first 
peanut butter grinder kellogg made peanut butter around the same 
time in his search for a vegetarian food for patients at his 
sanitarium 
according to kellogg co archives kellogg and his brother wk 
kellogg famous for his cereal company bought 10 pounds of 
peanuts roasted them in the oven put the nuts in a pillow case to 
remove the hulls weeded out the husks and then put the remaining 
material through grain rollers to make peanut butter 
wk kellogg the business manager of the sanitarium opened 
sanitas nut co and supplied foods like peanut butter to the 
sanitarium and local grocery stores but after a while john 
kellogg changed the formula and decided to steam the peanuts 
instead 
it tasted terrible corbett said so they said to heck 
with that lets concentrate on cereal 
peanut butter was a big seller at the 1904 worlds fair in st 
louis but didnt really take off until much later in the 1920s 
the process of stabilization was discovered allowing it to be 
stored without refrigeration 
the biggest boost may have come during world war ii the 
government fed peanut butter to gis who then came home started 
the baby boom and fed the stuff to their kids 
peanut butter was a regionalized industry until 1955 when 
procter amp gamble co bought big top peanut butter and reintroduced 
it as jif the no 1 seller and best foods bought skippy 
more peanut fun facts 
peanuts primarily grown in eight southern states are the 
nations 12th largest cash crop theyre a 500 millionayear crop 
in georgia which produces nearly half the nations supply 
it takes 548 peanuts to make a 12ounce jar and an acre of 
peanuts will yield 30000 peanut butter sandwiches 
about half the 4 billionpound annual crop is devoted to the 
production of peanut butter and the other half is almost equally 
split between salted nuts candy and peanut oil 
ninety percent of a jar of peanut butter must be peanuts but 
it also may contain salt sweeteners and hydrogenated vegetable oil 
as a stabilizer 
george washington carver discovered the peanut plant also could 
be used in shaving cream ink paint explosives shampoo pet 
litter fire logs lipstick and soap 
americans are expected to eat 800 million pounds of peanut 
butter this year more than double the 350 million pounds consumed 
in 1960 according to the peanut board thats an average of 33 
pounds per person 
although its portrayed as a kids food adults actually 
consume 55 percent 
not everyone loves peanut butter of course in fact theres 
even a word for the phobia of getting peanut butter stuck to the 
roof of the mouth arachibrityraphobia 
the search for peanut butters inventor continues coming up 
with a name may not mean much for sales but corbett is convinced 
it is important research 
food history is something we can all relate to corbett 
said food transports one back in time combine the smells and 
the taste and its an instant flashback

wall street has shown it is capable of defying 
the gravitational pull of the sliding tokyo stock market 
challenging notions of global interdependence 
but many securities strategists say it is foolish to conclude 
the two largest stock markets are going separate ways 
the securities boom of the 1980s gave rise to the view that the 
world has become one big 24hour trading floor with buying and 
selling moving seamlessly each day from the far east to western 
europe to the united states insomniac traders are linked around 
the globe by telephone and computer 
the most powerful and scary example of this globalization 
occurred in the october 1987 market collapse as panic selling 
reverberated from continent to continent 
but in the past month or so tidal waves sweeping the tokyo 
market have turned into ripples or less by the time they 
reached new york naysayers of globalization said the socalled 
inextricable links were unraveling 
some strategists even argued that tokyos malaise is new yorks 
health tonic they argue that japanese investors panicky about 
further weakening of stocks in their own country have been selling 
them and buying us shares instead 
some of the trading sessions last week seemed to reflect this 
theory on monday for example wall street dropped initially but 
shrugged off the thirdbiggest daily drop in tokyos key nikkei 
stock average the dow jones average of 30 industrials finished the 
day higher 
on tuesday after another steep dive in tokyo the new york 
market finished only mildly lower 
on thursday when the tokyo market sank to the lowest close 
since christmas eve of 1988 wall street sold off as well but the 
drop was by no means catastrophic some strategists said it was a 
technical correction 
i think weve delinked ourselves from tokyo said larry 
wachtel an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc theyre 
two different markets now 
nonetheless wachtel and others believe that could change if 
japanese investors were forced to sell their us stocks to raise 
cash for obligations at home 
if the declines in the japanese markets become too severe 
thats when all of the markets around the world will be 
negatively impacted said hugh johnson senior vice president of 
first albany corp in albany ny at some point theyre going 
to look like theyve recoupled 
the tight connections between the japanese and us economies 
mean their markets wont go separate ways indefinitely some 
observers believe 
the resilience wall street has been showing in the face of 
tokyos travails springs largely from foreign institutional 
investors mainly japanese and european who have moved chunks of 
capital out of the tokyo market and into new york 
a major reason for the decline in japan has been the weakening 
yen which makes stocks there worth less and increases inflation 
the bank of japan raised its key discount rate by one percentage 
point tuesday to 525 percent the fourth in a series of increases 
intended mainly to fight inflation but it didnt do much to help 
the faltering japanese currency 
against that background foreign investors have been seeking 
comfort in our financial markets johnson said 
thats why even negative economic news in the united states 
like government reports last week on rising inflation and an 
intractable trade deficit havent perturbed wall street too much 
the dollar is relatively strong at the moment and the economic 
grass for now seems to be greener on the american side

american teachers are scrambling for effective 
ways to interpret the democratic reforms in eastern europe for 
students who think of the red scare as a bad skin rash 
that is like a whole different world to them said linda 
hillestad a geography teacher at brookings middle school in south 
dakota some are impressed and excited its really neat they 
say but i dont know if they see that its going to have any 
effect on their future 
ms hillestad said a weekly filmstrip called news currents 
keeps students up to date with events in eastern europe africa and 
other parts of the world 
judy butler social studies and international education 
specialist for the arkansas department of education in little rock 
said students appear too nonchalant about the move toward democracy 
in the soviet bloc she points to her own 15yearold son as an 
example 
for him its just the nightly news said ms butler hes 
probably more aware of current events than most people because of 
his mother its like oh thats interesting but he doesnt race 
to the television like we do i dont see that voraciousness 
i still dont think they have a full grasp of what it means 
for people my age that grew up with the red scare its things 
weve talked about for years but its like hard to face 
ms butler said arkansas had two japanese internment camps 
during world war ii yet the kids dont understand why there is 
fear with reunification of germany 
part of the reason for american students indifference is their 
lack of knowledge about geography and social studies a recent 
study by the congressionally mandated national assessment of 
educational progress said that while 85 percent of high school 
seniors recognized the soviet union on a world map only 37 percent 
could find southeast asia the best score on the entire test was 59 
percent 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers bemoaned the indifference and ignorance of american 
students whose future is now freer of the constant menace of war 
between two superpowers 
in a newspaper column shanker wrote about an honors history 
class that was discussing the plight of satellite countries 
struggling to free themselves from soviet domination one student 
asked if this talk of satellites had anything to do with 
satellite dishes shanker said 
leslie jean roche of wheaton high school in a maryland suburb 
searches for creative ways to teach 
for example last halloween before the berlin wall fell ms 
roche dressed as an eastern bloc buster complete with a green 
dollar sign painted on one cheek and a symbol representing a ballot 
box on the other cheek 
this provoked discussion she said i asked the students 
to interpret me based on what was going on i asked them if the 
issues motivating the changes that were just beginning to occur 
were economic or political 
they were quite capable of understanding what was going on it 
interested them more than the jacksonian democracy that we were 
studying 
ms roche said she cried about the berlin wall because its 
such a vivid part of my memory i remember the bomb drills i got 
the students to hide under their desks and asked them what they 
were worried about to describe their emotions 
not only the students but the teachers are in the proces of 
learning she said 
ms hillestad acknowledged that im not focusing on this as i 
should because i need to feel like i know a little about it so 
i need to do a lot more reading i would think that a lot of 
teachers would be uncomfortable with it other than world history 
i dont have a real strong background in that part of the world 
nancy nemchik librarian at the kenmore middle school in 
landover md said many of the teachers had to go back and do 
some work to determine where those countries were located in 
eastern europe because it wasnt part of the curriculum 
a number of states are beefing up their studies in history 
geography and social studies ms butler said arkansas elementary 
schools focus mainly on general skills that include location of 
places in the world the role of leaders necessary laws and 
responsibilities that go with the law middle school children learn 
more about current events 
global studies are required in high school and teachers are 
encouraged to focus on themes like values culture conflicts 
world hunger and population problems 
for us to be a basically agricultural state global studies 
has really caught on real well said ms butler 
other teachers point to the heavy curricular requirements either 
on the state or local level as roadblocks to teachers who want to 
deviate some to teach about the current events any delays could 
put teachers behind schedule 
keith crawley social studies specialist with the arizona 
department of education said the state began about two years ago 
what is called essential skills for all students but he 
admitted most teachers are struggling with the concept to 
select turning points in history to study in depth 
its difficult because people in history are used to a 
chronological sequence the teachers have to come to grips with the 
idea that events dont come about unless other things come to bear 
but were excited in arizona becasue of the new framework he 
said

eight members of congress are trying to prove 
this year that you can go home again as governor 
potomac fever rarely goes into remission but among those 
politicians who have had enough of capitol hill an increasingly 
popular career path leads to places like little rock tallahassee 
hartford and montgomery 
seven members of congress won governorships from 1982 to 1989 
about a third of those who tried those odds are hardly comparable 
to the 98 percent return rate for members of congress who seek 
reelection but the higher risk hasnt discouraged a crop of eight 
new gubernatorial aspirants this year 
you can do more in an afternoon as governor than you can in a 
career in congress said one gubernatorial hopeful republican 
rep john rowland of connecticut attributing the quip to former 
delaware gov pete du pont 
it is theme sounded often among those hoping to return home 
many say they want to take on greater challenges test their 
executive skills set their own agendas and leave their marks on 
education drug abuse budgets the business climate and the 
environment 
ive spent the last seven years pushing and pulling trying to 
get the federal government to deal with its deficit its a very 
difficult process said democratic rep bruce morrison another 
connecticut gubernatorial hopeful the federal government has 
lost its capacity to really be the source of solutions to many 
problems 
larry sabato a university of virginia political scientist who 
wrote a book about the american governorship calls congress an 
increasingly depressing place to work 
the budget deficit is a permanent excuse for inaction 
democrats and many republicans are frustrated the money isnt 
there to do what they want to do and the will to raise taxes isnt 
there sabato said 
in contrast he said the states have both the resources and 
the will to innovate being in a state capitol is much more 
invigorating than it was 25 years ago 
the desire to head home to the statehouse may run even deeper in 
congress than what is apparent on the surface 
for everyone that runs for governor out of congress there is 
generally a substantial number greater than that who are thinking 
about it particularly in the offyears said rep joseph 
brennan a maine democrat who is trying to reclaim his old job as 
governor many people here if they had a choice would prefer to 
be the chief executive of a state 
members of congress cite career advancement and personal 
fulfullment as primary reasons to return to the statehouse but 
they also see the move as a chance to escape the pressures they 
face in congress from constant travel continuous fundraising and 
little time for family 
the pace and the back and forth and the commitments are a 
hardship on any family but its even worse on a young family 
said rowland who has children aged 5 3 and 1 who live in 
connecticut 
roots are another element of the pull towards home rowland for 
instance said his family has lived in connecticut for 150 years 
democratic rep ronnie flippo hoping to become governor of 
alabama tells home state audiences he cant get used to a place 
that serves their tea hot and their green beans cold 
other members of congress running for governor this year are 
republican sen pete wilson of california and reps bill nelson 
dfla tommy robinson rark and wes watkins dokla 
at least two more members are eyeing other state jobs as 
potential stepping stones 
republican sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire is retiring 
from the senate and considering a run for a 100ayear job in the 
parttime state senate while he awaits a shot at the governorship 
that wont be until his friend republican gov judd gregg decides 
to retire which might not be until 1996 
rep michael dewine rohio considered a gubernatorial bid this 
year and opted to try for lieutenant governor on a ticket with 
former cleveland mayor george voinovich 
dewine whose family moved back to ohio last year would take a 
pay cut from 96600 to 51000 if the gop ticket wins the 
tradeoff he said is a greater opportunity to get things done 
hell also have a statewide organization to activate when its his 
turn to run for governor or senator

international investors have many motivations 
for backing us government bonds sometimes single factors such 
as the sheer size of the huge american market are enough to steer 
money into the united states 
yield or the return on a bond is among the first 
considerations for globally minded investors in deciding where to 
put their funds inflation rates rank high because no one wants to 
watch the worth of a fixedincome investment eroded by rising 
prices currency values also are crucial 
its more of a stew of events rather than one main course that 
we can sink our teeth into said robert brusca an economist at 
nikko securities co international inc 
the relative importance of the reasons to favor one countrys 
bonds over anothers are constantly adjusted depending on world 
economic and political events 
when the us bond market benefited this past week from a modest 
flight to quality investors were focusing on the dollars 
recent strenth and the outlook for further appreciation especially 
against the japanese yen 
a profound slump on the tokyo stock exchange has chipped away 
value of the once rockhard yen the failure of the yen to regain 
any ground against the dollar despite a one percentage point 
interest rate increase by the bank of japan last tuesday reinforced 
the pessimistic attitude toward the yen 
people are adverse to buying yendenominated bonds because the 
currency is dropping said economist elliott platt of donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp the interest rates might 
appear attractive but receiving returns in depreciated yen is not 
brusca said japans stock market dwarfs its bond market the 
opposite of the us situation the vast sums pulled out of stocks 
cannot be absorbed fully by the japanese bond market 
when the stock market goes bad thats a real problem he 
said money seems to be migrating out of tokyo 
platt said japanese are buying bonds denominated in dollars or 
west german marks 
west german bonds are in favor because unification with east 
germany is expected to bolster the mark it is anticipated that 
ultimately german unity will contributed to faster economic 
activity there leading to higher interest rates the risk that 
rapid growth will spur inflation has curbed some of the enthusiasm 
for markbased investments 
the us bond market by far the worlds biggest historically 
has been a haven for investors looking for stability and lower 
risk its size creates the ability to absorb funds without a hiccup 
that could unsettle prices 
investors wanting to play their investment decisions close to 
their chests often prefer the anonymity that a large market 
affords theres less chance of noticing a large influx of cash 
into the united states than into italy for example 
the us bond market is estimated to be twice the size of the 
next biggest market according to the report how big is the world 
bond market by salomon brothers inc the top five bond markets 
in terms of 1988 capitalization were the united states 45 
trillion japan 22 trillion west germany 7535 billion 
italy 53 billion and britain 34 billion 
william brachfeld an executive vice president at aiwa 
securities inc said a country like japan with a giant trade 
surplus has more capital that the country itself can handle the 
capital represents the money flowing into japan to pay for the 
countrys exports of merchandise and services 
all those funds are not needed in japan they have to be 
invested abroad brachfeld said a considerable portion of 
funds come here because they almost have to come here theres 
almost no place else to put them

as a hectic week of pessimism and repeated plunges 
shaved more than 69 percent off the main index on the tokyo stock 
exchange the message to traders was clear every bubble must burst 
over the past few years the stock market in this country has 
been a repetition of share prices going up because of buying and 
buying because of share prices going up said an editorial in the 
nihon keizai shimbun an influential economic journal 
as excessive priceearnings ratios indicate share prices have 
been detached from actual industrial conditions and the bubble has 
grown larger and larger but every bubble must burst the 
editorial said friday that time has come 
the nikkei stock average closed the week friday at 3037216 
points down a combined 27731 points during the three previous 
trading days 
after closing for a national holiday wednesday the market on 
thursday fell below the psychological 30000point barrier the 
225issue nikkei index closed thursday at 2984334 its lowest 
finish since 2974128 on dec 24 1988 
that put the nikkei which rose 875687 points in 1989 down 
907293 points or 23 percent for the year 
but by weeks end there were buyers in the market on thursday 
the nikkei had been down by nearly 1900 points at one time but 
rebounded to finish only 963 points below the previous close on 
friday the market rose 52882 points or 177 percent 
the bottom is almost here said kenji maeshiro a stock 
analyst with yamaichi securities co 
the weeks plunges prompted finance minister ryutaro hashimoto 
to lament that his ministry was monitoring the markets with 
anguish both he and bank of japan governor yasushi mieno agreed 
that the stock and currency markets were driving each other down 
seeking to avert inflation and stabilize the financial markets 
mieno on tuesday announced a longawaited hike in japans discount 
rate boosting it by 1 percentage point to 525 percent 
mieno said results from the increase should not be expected to 
appear immediately the increase failed to stop the rise of the 
dollar which gained 287 yen over the last six trading days 
although fridays rebound in the nikkei hinted at confidence 
returning to the market the ministry of international trade and 
industry began action to assess the effects of the losses so far 
miti decided to launch a nationwide survey to gauge the impact 
on companies investment in equipment and facilities profits and 
prices of imported raw materials said a ministry official 
the ministry action came as mazda a leading automaker 
reportedly decided to scale back sales targets for a new luxury car 
because of fears the bearish market and weak yen might spill over 
and dampen consumer extravagance in general 
as far as i know this is the first such survey by miti 
said the official requesting anonymity but this does not mean 
we think the situation very serious we worry rather that our 
moves might accelerate the public anxiety and worsen their economic 
prospects for the future so we are trying not to make a fuss about 
it 
after fridays rally some traders also expressed confidence in 
a recovery pointing out that investors may seek the buy 
opportunites created by major falls 
the market is slowly but gradually recovering helped by 
relative stability in the currency and bond markets said akira 
shimoda an equity analyst with yamaichi securities 
he said the market would be helped by the finance ministrys 
approval thursday of a measure that allows japans four major 
brokerage houses to handle more than 30 percent of the purchase 
orders of any particular stock in a month 
japans four major securities firms nomura securitiies daiwa 
securities nikko securities and yamaichi securities had asked 
the finance ministry to ease the restriction a rule intended to 
curb insider trading 
the four securities firms account for about half of the markets 
total trading volume a market analyst said 
securities companies meanwhile have decided not to underwrite 
new stock bond and warrant issues so that available funds instead 
would go toward bolstering prices of existing stocks 
at least nine companies recently canceled plans to issue new 
stock shares because of concern over the fluctuations in stock 
prices and the nikkeis sharp declines 
nevertheless concern remained that money that had been flowing 
into stocks could still be diverted elsewhere because of the 
markets perceived instability

the 25th floor of the south tower of the 
luxurious world financial center is empty save for a few boxes so 
are the 26th 27th and 28th floors 
in the booming mid1980s merrill lynch amp co expected to fill 
the space easily the nations largest securities firm booked two 
full towers in the ultramodern complex in lower manhattan that 
opened in 1986 using conservative estimates of employment growth 
then merrill scaled back to one tower plus about half the 
second after the 1987 stock market crash even that was too much 
and now the firm plans to sublet nine floors including the four 
undeveloped ones 
on wall street and broad street and greenwich street and 
battery place a securities industry recession has created an 
officespace glut in the worlds premier financial district 
vacancy rates are soaring in the maze of silver office towers 
and aging stone monoliths where stock trading began almost 200 
years ago under a buttonwood tree property brokers compare the 
slump to the mid1970s when new york teetered on bankruptcy 
were still headed south said robert fr ballard an 
executive vice president with the real estate firm cushman amp 
wakefield who has worked in the wall street building market since 
1959 we havent bottomed out yet 
manhattan real estate brokers say the vacancy rate in the 
downtown financial district is approaching 20 percent vs 8 
percent to 12 percent in 1985 during the securities industry boom 
put another way the 14 million square feet of available office 
space downtown equals three empty buildings each as big as a 
110story world trade center tower 
the glut is expected to worsen because hundreds of thousands of 
square feet to be abandoned by firms such as merrill shearson 
lehman hutton inc salomon inc and collapsed drexel burnham 
lambert inc havent been tallied yet 
unprecedented growth in stock trading and investment banking 
gave rise to handoverfist hiring and expansion by wall street 
firms in the 1980s 
average daily trading volume on the new york stock exchange shot 
up from 322 million shares in 1979 to 189 million shares in 1987 
while employment in in new yorks securities and commodities 
industries grew from 74000 to 163000 
during that period wall street firms set ambitious expansion 
plans tied to the seemingly limitless possibilities of another 
boom building world headquarters seemed logical to accomodate 
technological advances that required more space for more computers 
for more trading into the 21st century 
many of the financial firms dont indulge in what we call 
intelligent strategic planning regarding their space needs said 
joel wechsler a managing director of the real estate firm edward 
s gordon amp co theyre getting a little more sophisticated in 
that area now 
stock market volume securities underwriting mergers and 
takeovers and other financial businesses are down sharply since 
the crash the securities industry has lost more than 40000 jobs 
the vacancy rates are directly related to the shrinkage in the 
financial services industry said anthony m saytanides edward 
s gordons chief operating officer 
ballard put it less gently the developers built too much 
space the tenants rented too much space the market took a 
nosedive 
during the decline several projects were abandoned and other 
overly ambitious ones have cost firms hundreds of millions of 
dollars salomon took a 150 million accounting charge against 
earnings after dropping out of a major project two firms that 
named buildings for themselves ef hutton amp co and thomson 
mckinnon securities inc are history 
shearson the no 2 brokerage behind merrill spent 450 million 
to build a 39story office tower known as shearson lehman hutton 
plaza the firm plans to fill the building which opened late last 
year but also is firing up to 5000 workers this year which could 
lead to more unused space 
workers in reduced shearson departments say they can roam floors 
almost undisturbed the firms new tower is adorned with a 
parthenonlike frieze and some wags say it too could wind up a 
monument to a golden age 
there may be some discussion in hindsight whether it was the 
most effective use of the firms money at the time a shearson 
official privately conceded adding that it is evaluating space 
needs as part of an overhaul 
merrill decided to move in the early 80s when its headcount 
was growing by 13 percent annually it booked the world financial 
center space anticipating only half that growth but since the 
crash merrill has slashed its work force back to a 1980 level 
more cuts are planned 
the firm took a 470 million charge against earnings last 
quarter for its restructuring 220 million to cover real estate 
commitments nearly all of that in new york 
the growth has certainly gone in the other direction 
merrill spokesman fred yager said our fixed costs have been 
reduced considerably and one of our biggest fixed costs is real 
estate 
for the real estate market the gluts the thing while modern 
office spaces such as the world financial center and world trade 
center complexes are almost fully occupied older buildings are 
bearing the brunt as firms move out 
the average asking rent downtown is falling but not in 
proportion to available space brokers say topline offices still 
command around 35 per square foot among the highest in the 
country some prices for older buildings though have fallen into 
the single digits just like in the 1970s 
brokers estimate the downtown vacancy rate will climb well above 
20 percent once a rash of moves some across new york waterways to 
cheaper brooklyn or new jersey are completed in the mid70s 
the rate was about 25 percent brokers said 
among the untallied moves the securities industry automation 
corps move to new quarters abandoning 200000 square feet 
salomons shift to 7 world trade center leaving 500000 square 
feet behind the consolidation by merrill and shearson and about 
15 million square feet by drexel 
during its junkbond driven heyday drexel planned to build new 
headquarters downtown the firm wisely scrapped the project after 
settling securities fraud charges with the government last april 
and trimming 4000 employees by selling its retail brokerage 
operations 
unwisely in retrospect drexel last fall extended the lease on 
its main broad street offices until 2004 six weeks ago drexels 
parent entered bankruptcy proceedings listing more than 470 
million in domestic lease commitments outstanding 
some brokers say the market has even further to fall because at 
least one sure sign of desperation has yet to take hold 
during the 70s a lot of the older buildings were turned into 
apartments ballard said that hasnt happened yet and if that 
hasnt happened we havent hit bottom

joseph hazelwoods future seemed less murky 
after a jury acquitted the skipper of serious charges stemming from 
the alaska oil spill but lawyers say the verdict may dump more 
trouble onto his exboss exxon corp 
i guess the jurors thought it was exxons fault and decided 
not make the captain the goat said melvin belli a celebrity 
attorney famous for winning multimilliondollar judgments who 
represents 500 clients suing exxon 
it wont hurt my case at all he said in a telephone 
interview after the hazelwood verdict was announced this past week 
it might help my case they let the captain off now lets get 
the people who are really responsible 
the captain of the exxon valdez tanker that hit a reef a year 
ago and spewed oil into prince william sound was convicted of only 
a simple misdemeanor count of negligence for his role in the 
nations worst oil spill he was sentenced to help clean up the 
mess and pay 50000 in restitution 
jurors at a trial in anchorage alaska said there wasnt enough 
evidence to convict him on the more substantial counts of criminal 
mischief reckless endangerment and operating a vessel while drunk 
the verdict stunned much of the nation including attorneys who 
said the lynchmob atmosphere created by the oil spill had made 
convictions seem a foregone conclusion 
exxon which fired hazelwood after the disaster said it was 
pleased his ordeal was over and that the verdict suggested the 
grounding was an accident hazelwood even said he would try to 
renegotiate his old job back 
but specialists in corporate liability law said hazelwoods 
conviction on the negligence charge might be bad news for exxon 
because it could be used by the hundreds of plaintiffs suing the 
company for civil damages as solid evidence that the company 
through one of its employees was to blame 
some also suggested that the jurys failure to convict on the 
more serious charges didnt mean they wouldnt be raised again in 
civil litigation in which the rules of evidence are much less 
stringent than in criminal proceedings 
exxon gets very little benefit out of this said david 
leebron a professor of corporate liability law at columbia 
university law school 
exxon would be responsible for the negligence of its 
employees he said they might have been hoping that the 
employee did something so unpredictable it would get them out of 
liability so in this case the jury finding of negligence hurts 
them 
belli whose clients range from alaskan boatbuilders to japanese 
canneries hurt by a postspill fishing ban around the alaskan 
coast said the verdict only strengthened his legal arsenal he 
predicted exxon would attempt to settle most of the lawsuits 
the damages arent measured in millions he said theyre 
in billions 
daniel d polsby a professor of law at northwestern university 
in chicago speculated that the hazelwood verdict would shift the 
focus of litigation away from who was responsible now he said 
the question is going to be who has got a right to complain 
that could mean many years of tangled lawsuits and questions 
over who was hurt financially by the spill and what will be 
required to clean it up exxon already has spent about 2 billion 
in a cleanup but its future liability is undetermined 
some lawyers suggested exxon also faces the tricky problem of 
whether to rehire hazelwood he was dismissed for violating company 
policy after postspill tests revealed he had been legally drunk 
but the jury said the evidence wasnt there to back that up 
andrew kramer chairman of the labor section at the law firm 
jones day reavis amp pogue said if exxon rehired hazelwood it 
might undermine the companys contention that the skipper acted 
irresponsibly 
on the other hand kramer said exxon executives might reason 
that if we dont rehire him he is a potential witness against 
us 
in other business and economic news this past week 
southland corp the nations largest convenience store 
operator agreed to sell control to a japanese company because of 
crushing debt burdens stemming from a junkbondfinanced buyout 
the deal announced by the founder of the 7eleven chain was one of 
the most dramatic examples of credit crises faced by us companies 
that have relied heavily on junk financing 
president bushs savings amp loan bailout plan hit a potentially 
crippling snag when a judge prevented a government takeover of an 
ailing chicago thrift on grounds that federal regulators in charge 
of the bailout were appointed unconstitutionally an appeals court 
temporarily blocked the order and bush moved to blunt it as well by 
nominating a new thriftoffice director to be confirmed by the 
senate 
japans mighty financial markets plunged bolstering the view 
that what goes up must come down but the decline had a limited 
impact on us stock prices reviving the question of whether the 
globalization of securities trading is as important as earlier 
believed

like arturo di modicas renegade bull statue 
wall streets latest bull market may soon be driven away at least 
for a while 
after a vigorous runup recently the market rally stalled this 
past tuesday as traders fretted about corporate earnings at home 
and interest rates in japan stocks recovered on friday boosted by 
strong bond prices and a mild rebound on the troubled tokyo stock 
market 
strategists expect the firstquarter earnings of many us 
companies due early next month to show worsethanexpected 
results that would depress the value of american stocks 
the earnings reports will look pretty horrendous said larry 
wachtel an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
in addition as the first quarter approaches its end this coming 
week many institutional investors could sell to take profits to 
put on their books 
rumblings from the far east could heighten the markets 
skittishness 
for the past month or so steep declines in the tokyo stock 
market have failed to shake up wall street at least not too much 
the familiar domino effect from one market to the other seems to 
have been put on hold 
but the effect could come roaring back some experts believe if 
the tokyo market falls so severely that japanese investors are 
forced to sell their us stocks to raise cash for obligations at 
home

analyst at smith barney harris upham amp co thats where the 
selling pressure could come in

markets recent rally

favorable longterm prospects of the us economy at a time when 
the world political and economic landscape is changing fast

out the bull even more vehemently

the new york stock exchange in middecember after standing there 
less than a day di modica its sculptor said he was donating

not far from wall street in view of the federal bankruptcy court 
the city told di modica he could sell the threeton statue to a 
company which could then donate it to new york

what strategists call consolidation

frank cappiello a principal of mccullough andrews amp cappiello

an ambitious multimedia effort aimed at 
hispanics gets underway monday enabling advertisers to reach the

creators of the service say 90 percent of the 10 million in 
annual ad time and space has been sold media analysts and 
competitors said the service could draw renewed attention to the 
spanishlanguage market 
some media and advertising executives have argued that us 
advertisers are missing a profitable opportunity by failing to 
spend more on reaching the 20 millionplus hispanics in the united 
states in their native language 
we frankly welcome this competition because we want to make 
spanish print media better known and accepted said alberto abdo 
a marketing executive with miamibased america publishing group a 
leading spanishlanguage publisher with 16 magazines sold in the 
united states 
the new multimedia service will reach an estimated 500000 
hispanic magazine readers and nearly 90 percent of hispanic homes 
with television says its developer whittle communications of 
knoxville tenn 
starting later this spring advertisers will also be mentioned 
when operators answer calls to a tollfree telephone service for 
hispanics seeking information on topics ranging from recipes to 
immigration the operator will answer calls by saying the hotline 
service is brought to you by 
among the sponsors who are paying 500000 a year under twoyear 
contracts for a basic package that includes television and 
telephone time and space in the magazine are american airlines 
procter amp gamble american telephone amp telegraph and kinney shoes 
the conerstone of the service is the magazine la familia de hoy 
published every other month it is distributed free to 10500 
medical waiting rooms and beauty parlors in hispanic neigborhoods 
in 45 markets 
whittle executives said the magazine will offer information that 
can help hispanics live better in the united states 
that is a big break from other spanishlanguage magazines 
circulated here that often rely mainly on gossip entertainment 
and fashion said editor patricia duarte 
the marchapril issue has stories on recognizing when your 
children may be abusing drugs and what to do about it handling 
finances cooking tips relating to your spouse and staying 
healthy it also has a profile of president bushs daughterinlaw 
colomba bush who is from mexico 
whittle is also producing twominute informational programs that 
will run 31 times a week on the spanishlanguage television network 
univision which reaches 64 million spanishspeaking households in 
the united states 
each program will identify the sponsor at the start and finish 
and include a commercial of 30 to 45 seconds many of the programs 
will be drawn from subjects covered in the magazine 
a typical program starts with an introduction by former 
univision network news anchor teresa rodriguez after the 
commercial an expert may discuss a topic often leaving a number 
or address for more information 
in one program a physician offers health tips for pregnant 
women in another ms rodriguez toured a museum designed for 
children 
f ashley shomaker who is overseesing the project for whittle 
said advertisers are also being mentioned at other times of the day 
on the univision network to draw attention to upcoming shows 
advertisers will also be rotated regularly on the telephone 
announcement 
richard hamilton an advertising executive with darcy masius 
benton amp bowles in new york said marketers are starting to pay 
more attention to the hispanic market because it is growing rapidly 
in size per capita income and willingness to buy recognized brands 
he said they are turning to spanishlanguage media because 
research indicates many hispanics prefer communications in 
spanish to english 
but america publishings abdo said that while hispanics make up 
nearly 10 percent of the us population advertisers spend less 
than 1 percent of their ad budgets in spanishlanguage media 
they spend mostly on tv the amounts dedicated to print are 
very low he said 
nonetheless he said ad pages at his companys magazines are up 
36 percent this year from a year ago he credited more aggressive 
marketing and greater awareness among advertisers of the markets

winnebago industries inc reported 
friday that its losses more than doubled in the second quarter of 
its fiscal year and disclosed problems arranging credit with banks 
and financial institutions 
the 53 million loss in the quarter ended feb 24 reflected a 
weak market for motor homes losses from a new division that makes 
trucks for delivery businesses and continued losses from its 
cyclesat subsidiary that delivers commercials to television 
stations by satellite 
frank rolfes who follows winnebago for the minneapolis 
securities firm of dain bosworth said the results were in line 
with his projections which are very negative 
theyre not doing very well down there he said it 
doesnt appear to be getting better 
on wall street the report appeared to be shrugged off as the 
new york stock exchangelisted winnebago ended the day unchanged at 
525 a share 
john k hanson the founder and chairman of the forest city 
manufacturer said recent negotiations with the companys banks and 
financial institutions failed to achieve acceptable credit 
terms 
as a result winnebago has reduced its outstanding shortterm 
borrowing through the liquidation of the companys marketable 
securities portfolio and sale of winnebago acceptance corporations 
dealer receivables hanson said 
winnebago acceptance corp provides financing to buyers of its 
motor homes and recreational vehicles its receivables are the loan 
agreements it holds 
spokeswoman sheila davis said the company had sold its entire 
securities portfolio 
the company did not release its securities losses or put a value 
on the securities sold but ms davis said that at the end of its 
first fiscal quarter winnebago had 306 million in cash and 
securities 
rolfes said he did not believe the company was in danger of 
collapse because it has little longterm debt but added theyve 
got to do something to turn things around 
in its annual report the company listed total shortterm debt 
of about 57 million and longterm debt of 64 million as of aug 
26 1989 
rolfes said winnebago had been losing money on its securities 
portfolio for years and may have decided it was putting that 
investment to better use by buying down its shortterm debt to 
reduce interest expenses 
the 53 million loss in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
came to 21 cents a share and compared with a loss of almost 26 
million or 10 cents a share in the same period a year earlier 
revenue for the period fell almost 25 percent to 806 million from 
1071 million 
the results for the quarter were caused by losses in rv 
operations due to lower motor home sales volume substantial 
inventive and promotion costs a shift in product mix to lower 
priced motor homes and continuing losses by winnebago subsidiary 
cyclesat startup costs for the commercial vehicle division and 
losses in financial investments hanson said 
for the first half of the fiscal year winnebago reported a loss 
of nearly 10 million or 40 cents a share compared with a profit 
of 63 million or 25 cents a share in the same period a year 
earlier revenue fell by 32 percent to 1596 million from 2351 
million

marathon petroleum co will make southeastern 
michigan a test market for a gasoline intended to help meet demands 
for reduced air pollution from autos the company said friday 
marathon will start selling its amaraclean gasolines monday 
in three unleaded grades at 161 stations in eight southeastern 
michigan counties 
if the gasolines sell in the detroit area marathon will start 
marketing them sometime next year in other cities such as 
cleveland st louis cincinnati and akron ohio the company said 
the introduction of cleaner gasolines has followed a proposal by 
president bush last june 5 that would have required selling 
millions of cars that run on fuels other than gasoline such as 
natural gas or methanol 
william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
confirmed last month the bush administration was telling senate 
leaders that reformulated gasolines might be an acceptable 
alternative 
the compromise cleanair bill being debated in the senate this 
week would require reformulated cleanerburning gasolines in the 
countrys smoggiest cities by 1995 said charles gray head of the 
epas ann arbor testing laboratory 
atlantic richfield co already is selling reformulated gasoline 
in california in denver conoco and shamrock sell gasoline blended 
to reduce carbon monoxide emissions 
amoco isnt marketing a reformulated gasoline yet but that is 
a major consideration among the alternate fuels that are being 
looked at said spokesman neil geary in chicago 
geary said oil companies are experimenting with various fuels 
he said amoco expects within a month to begin test marketing 
compressed natural gas at four denver locations 
white said motorists probably wont notice any difference in 
price or performance with the amaraclean gasolines 
but the gasoline will evaporate less easily in hot weather 
cutting down on a major cause of smog 
the fuels are a step toward reduced volatility levels the epa 
proposes to require for all gasolines by 1992 gray said 
the fuel is also formulated to burn more completely and 
cancercausing chemicals normally used to boost octane have been 
eliminated marathon said the blends cut hydrocarbon emissions 
about 20 percent and carbon monoxide 14 percent
