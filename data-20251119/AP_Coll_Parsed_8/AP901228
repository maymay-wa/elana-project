the government says it plans to end its 
26yearold monopoly on television allowing two private channels 
to operate alongside the two existing official channels 
the new channels which should begin operating in the summer of 
1992 will still be closely regulated government spokesman luis 
marques mendes said thursday 
the government will control the length of airtime reserved for 
news educational shows and other programming marques mendes said 
the centerright government of prime minister anibal cavaco 
silva on thursday said prospective broadcasters will have three 
months from jan 2 to present their plans and two will be chosen in 
june or july 
a reform of the portuguese constitution in july 1989 allowed the 
government to end the monopoly of the staterun radiotelevisao

initial enthusiasm for the project among portuguese and foreign 
businessmen has been dampened by recent studies casting doubt on 
the local advertizing markets capacity to support four channels

the ink was barely dry on the first official 
1990 census results when the numbers came under attack from state 
and local officials fearful of losing political clout and federal 
dollars 
i think this thing was destined to fail from day one said 
mayor jimmy kemp of meridian miss a longtime critic of how the 
headcount was run 
he was far from the only mayor to complain that the census 
overlooks many of the nations poor living in big cities 
the census numbers determine how many representatives each state 
sends to congress and how many federal aid dollars states and 
localities receive 
if the numbers are skewed some states will get more than their 
share of money and power while others will be shortchanged 
michael darby undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs 
said thursday he was confident the count was full fair and 
accurate he said an analysis due next summer is designed to 
checkthe accuracy 
certainly theres no valid basis for making a judgment about 
an undercount or overcount at this point said darby who 
oversees the census bureau 
the bureau said wednesday that it counted 2487 million people 
in the united states as of april 1 up nearly 10 percent from a 
decade ago sun belt states such as california arizona and florida 
were the big gainers population grew at a far slower pace in the 
industrial northern states and the farm belt 
new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy president of the national 
league of cities said the numbers seemed to confirm the fears of 
many city officials that significant numbers of people in their 
communities were uncounted 
he said the figures put a substantial burden on the census 
bureau and the secretary of commerce to prove the count was 
accurate or adjust it to account for uncounted people 
we have not seen anything that would convince us that there 
has been a complete count in texas said john bender a spokesman 
for the state comptrollers office we are certain there was an 
undercount in 1980 that cost the state at the very least 30 
million a year in federal funds during the 1980s and it appears 
that theres been an undercount again in 1990 
we will assume they missed people in the state said ken 
jones an analyst with the vermont office of policy research and 
coordination 
if we feel that the number missed in vermont is consistent 
with the number missed throughout the country then we are 
comfortable with that he said if we feel that the rural areas 
were undercounted more than the urban areas then we will take 
action 
but california officials praised the census figures which 
showed the states population grew 26 percent in the 1980s 
the count released this week was significantly higher than the 
preliminary figures and more in line with our own estimates 
said linda gage of the california finance department we are 
surprised and delighted 
rep tom sawyer dohio chairman of the house census 
subcommittee noted the overall population count was 47 million 
people below the census bureaus october estimate of 2534 million 
were saying the apparent discrepancy is cause for concern 
sawyer said 
but rep thomas ridge of pennsylvania senior republican on the 
census subcommittee said failure to confirm the october projection 
is not legitimate grounds for criticizing the enumeration process 
itself 
the census bureau said it counted 2496 million americans that 
figure includes nearly 1 million americans living abroad who 
werent counted in 1980 and who werent included in the october 
estimate 
more than 6000 local governments including the nations 51 
largest cities filed challenges to preliminary figures released 
earlier by the census bureau the resolution of those local 
challenges will help determine the final totals 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher has until july 15 to decide 
whether to add people that the local officials say were not 
counted

could us forces in the persian gulf go to 
war 10 minutes from now or on jan 15 or shortly after jan 15 
or not until feb 15 
all are prospective strike dates raised by us officials in 
recent days as conflicting signals emerge from the administration 
on whether and when the nation is ready and able to go to war 
president bush himself now says theres been enough talk about 
the preparedness of us forces 
ive said all i want to say about readiness he told 
reporters thursday during a oneday trip back to washington from 
his vacation retreat at camp david md 
i think it would be very useful if from the president and 
others there were fewer comments about readiness 
then he proceeded to talk about readiness 
bush sought to dispel reports stemming originally from public 
statements by the deputy us commander in the gulf region that 
american forces will not be ready for offensive action until 
midfebruary a month after the jan 15 deadline set by the united 
nations for iraqs withdrawal from occupied kuwait 
i feel that the situation is exactly where i was told it was 
going to be at this time the president said dont believe 
those reports youre reading he said of accounts that his 
military advisers are warning against launching an attack before 
midfebruary 
bush said he is very comfortable with what his aides have 
told him about the preparedness of the american force now at 
300000 and growing to 430000 one aide speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the president would not be deterred from launching 
a strike if necessary even if all us troops and equipment are 
not in place 
bush said he absolutely stood by his comment last saturday 
that us and allied forces could respond vigorously on 10 
minutes notice if provoked by iraq 
he said his top military advisers defense secretary dick 
cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
did not try to change his mind on that point when they briefed 
him monday on their trip to the gulf region 
on the other hand the president called too provocative a 
question as to whether he would have any hesitation in going to war 
on jan 15 and he never directly denied news reports quoting us 
officials saying the troops will not be sufficiently ready for 
offensive action until weeks after the jan 15 deadline 
bushs comments came in the wake of a jumble of conflicting 
statements from senior us officials 
last wednesday army lt gen calvin waller second in command 
of us forces in operation desert shield told reporters bush 
should wait until midfebruary if he wants to attack because the 
troops would not be ready until then 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater then said waller 
meant the troops might not be as ready as theyd like to be 
for all the contingencies 
the pentagon said cheney was not displeased by wallers 
comments some pentagon officials said us air power would be 
fully prepared for a strike even if ground troops were not 
then cheney himself said that soon after jan 15 the us 
forces would be in a position to take military action in 
conjunction with our allies 
bush entered the readiness fray on saturday stating that he 
could launch an attack in 10 minutes 
the varying statements caused speculation that the 
administration was deliberately trying to put iraqs saddam hussein 
off balance fitzwater told reporters that it never hurts to 
build in a little uncertainty about what our intentions are as it 
relates to jan 15 
administration officials have stressed that jan 15 is not a 
strike date but merely an authorization date 
asked what message he wanted saddam to get on the readiness 
issue bush said thursday we are going to fully implement the 
united nations resolutions which include one authorizing use of 
force 
a senior administration official said meantime it has been 
decided not to talk about readiness any more 
asked for an indication of which of the various statements 
represented the real administration position the official said 
only i would take the presidents comments most seriously 
as to bushs statement that he could go to war in 10 minutes 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said his is 
the last word

this was the year the cold war ended and nato 
and the warsaw pact signed the most sweeping armsreduction treaty 
in history 
the phrase new world order gained currency in america as 
well as europe east germany was merged into west germany without a 
flicker of friction nations at odds for 45 years were 
contemplating new arrangements to promote peace and prosperity 
so much had the volatile world changed that for a while it 
seemed the biggest worry in some state department offices and 
washington think tanks was whether new uses could be found for nato 
now that ussoviet tensions had nearly evaporated and military 
alliances seemed obsolete 
as distrust dissolved president bush offered up to 1 billion 
in food credits to the soviet union and other incentives for 
mikhail s gorbachev to weather dislocations and to keep trying to 
establish a freemarket economy 
superpower cooperation raised hope meanwhile of ending wars in 
afghanistan angola and cambodia arms sales around the world even 
dipped a bit 
but as 1991 draws near the world is not necessarily a safer 
place 
gorbachev is trying to hold on to the 15 soviet republics by 
taking on new powers that his old friend and ally eduard a 
shevardnadze denounced as a step toward dictatorship 
shevardnadze resigned as foreign minister shattering a smooth 
relationship with secretary of state james a baker iii that had 
promoted reconciliation between washington and moscow 
gorbachev pledged that his foreign policy would be maintained 
but that is bound to be harder to do after the resignation of one 
of its chief architects and amid grumbling in some segments of the 
military that the soviets gave in too easily to german unification 
and to independence in eastern and central europe 
unrest in the republics poses an even bigger danger to world 
peace 
some of the rebellious nationalities are reviving the hateful 
chauvinism that the central government in moscow had managed to 
suppress disorder could provoke a heavyhanded response from 
gorbachev he may not be able to cope with separatists on several 
fronts at once and that could lead to a splintering of the soviet 
union and the destabilization of europe 
in the persian gulf the threat of war made the whole world 
anxious 
there is no sign of a diplomatic solution even with the approach 
of the jan 15 deadline set by the un security council for iraq 
to withdraw its forces from kuwait 
and president bush threatens to go to war unles all the troops 
are not out by then 
we havent blinked so far brent scowcroft his national 
security adviser said last week were not blinking now and we 
will not blink 
not to be outdone in bravado bush said of iraqi leader saddam 
hussein if we get into an armed situation hes going to get his 
ass kicked 
saddam meanwhile threatened to attack israel and to use all 
his resources including chemical weapons 
perhaps the tough talk on both sides was simply bluster 
designed to achieve political objectives for bush that would be 
the liberation of kuwait and the restoration of the ousted royal 
family for saddam that would be at least a piece of kuwait and 
the mobilizing of international pressure against israel 
on the other severely troubled front maybe gorbachev will be 
able to get through the winter with his reconstruction program 
intact and his drive toward democracy only slightly impeded by the 
authoritarian measures he has taken 
in the meantime though the promise 1990 held out for peace 
seems more fragile with the approach of the new year 
 
editors note barry schweid head of the associated press 
state department staff has reported on diplomacy for 17 years

the freeze that hit much of the nation before 
christmas ravaged fruit and vegetable crops in california but 
agriculture department analysts are holding to their 1991 food 
price forecast 
ralph parlett jr of the departments economic research service 
said thursday however that it was too soon to predict accurately 
what impact the freeze will have 
parlett said fruit and vegetable prices will go up a little 
more next year than has been predicted overall he is sticking 
with the agencys forecast that food prices will rise an average of 
2 percent to 5 percent in 1991 
this year according to usda calculations consumer food prices 
rose about 6 percent compared with a 58 percent gain in 1989 
that is the sharpest backtoback increase since an 86 percent 
jump in 1980 and a rise of 78 percent in 1981 
parletts comments in a telephone interview followed a report 
by the governments joint agricultural weather facility that crop 
damage from the cold wave during the week of dec 1622 was mostly 
confined to fruit and vegetables in california 
the severe cold in california caused extensive damage to the 
citrus and vegetable crops the report said but arizona and 
texas crops escaped serious freeze damage it added 
rain and snow over the eastern third of the nation provided 
moisture to growing crops and delayed late harvest of corn and 
soybeans the report said lack of moisture in florida resulted 
in continued use of irrigation in fruit groves 
the weather facility is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments weekly reports show the general effects of weather on 
crops but do not foretell actual losses or production estimates 
while the low temperatures in california damaged the citrus 
crop the report said damaged fruit can be processed but will be 
limited by processing capacity 
in southern texas growers in the rio grande valley reported 
little damage to growing crops from cold weather the report 
said however there was some minor damage to spinach and beet 
crops in the san antonio winter garden area 
parlett said it appeared losses in california were mainly to 
navel oranges a valuable fruit for the fresh market valencias he 
said come along later but still may have been badly hurt by the 
cold 
we have a big crop of oranges in florida and when we get 
into the valencia season im sure a lot of the florida valencias 
will be attracted away from the juice market and end up in the 
fresh market he said 
as for vegetables parlett said lettuce prices dont need much 
cold weather to trigger sharp increases other vegetables also may 
react 
this will be temporary he said theyll come back pretty 
quick as growers plant new vegetable crops but its going to 
have some effect 
in usdas first 1991 food price forecast a month ago retail 
prices of fruits and vegetables as a group were projected to rise 1 
percent to 4 percent in 1991 compared with gains of 75 percent in 
1990 85 percent in 1989 and 76 percent in 1988 
parlett without being more specific said the outlook for the 
fruit and vegetable price index now will be a little more than 
was forecast 
the report by the weather facility said the condition of winter 
wheat planted for the 1991 harvest was varied 
snow provided limited cover and moisture to kansas wheat it 
said some wheat fields in southcentral areas of kansas had 
serious army worm damage 
the wheat crop was said to be in mostly good to excellent 
condition in illinois snow helped provide insulation from the 
cold in montana and oklahoma 
showers early in the week slowed the last of the corn harvest 
in michigan the report said the soybean harvests in south 
carolina and georgia were almost complete texas soybean harvest 
was almost complete with yields poor to average 
the 1990 cotton harvest was virtually complete in arizona 
the report said but late harvesting continued in southern 
california the texas cotton harvest was said to be 97 percent 
completed nine percentage points ahead of normal 
pastures and livestock across the nation were reported in good 
to fair condition as the holidays approached 
hay supplies were adequate in north dakota and adequate to 
surplus in west virginia the report said range conditions in 
the southern twothirds of california were poor to very poor and 
poor to good in the northern third 
winter pastures in texas continued to provide adequate grazing 
despite a lack of moisture the report said

president bush says soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev sent him a private message containing friendly words of 
greeting but he and aides are mum about the details 
it was just one more in whats become a series of exchanges 
with the president of the soviet union bush told reporters after 
soviet ambassador alexander bessmertnykh handdelivered the message 
thursday 
there were some very friendly words of greeting from president 
gorbachev he said giving no details and i had a chance to 
ask the ambassador to give him our best wishes for a happy new 
year 
bush said he and the soviet envoy discussed some of the 
problems in the soviet union a nation engulfed in a political 
turmoil that resulted last week in the resignation of gorbachevs 
longtime close ally foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
a senior administration official characterized the letter as a 
private message and would not describe it further except to say 
it is not going to change the course of human history 
the communication came as gorbachev is struggling to keep his 
clout and to reconcile volatile conflicts between reformers and 
conservatives within the soviet union at the same time the 
country is suffering severe economic problems with shortages and 
food distribution problems 
they are having difficulties economic difficulties 
principally bush said thursday difficulties in sorting out 
this new federation 
he said those problems were to be expected with gorbachevs 
efforts to transform his nation from a totalitarian state to a more 
open marketoriented country 
the main thing is theres a determination to keep going down 
this path of reform he said and thats very important 
the president said he believes the soviets can sort that all 
out themselves 
us officials are closely monitoring the tumultuous political 
situation in the soviet union especially as to how it might affect 
ussoviet cooperation in the persian gulf and on pending arms 
control agreements 
the administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said gorbachev still appears pretty resourceful and 
so far has succeeded in balancing the opposing forces of reformers 
and conservatives

navel orange prices could double nationwide 
because of the deep freeze that devastated much of californias 
citrus crop an industry official says 
farmers meanwhile braced for a second arctic blast that 
threatened to destroy surviving crops and the trees themselves 
the navel orange crop in the san joaquin valley the states 
main growing region was virtually wiped out in the siege of 
freezing temperatures that started dec 21 
a number of vegetable crops were also damaged including 
artichokes avocados broccoli cauliflower and celery and the 
cold affected the states flower crop forcing people working on 
the tournament of roses parade in pasadena to use substitute 
decorations 
joel nelsen manager of california citrus mutual a growers 
organization estimated 15000 workers in the states 70 citrus 
packing houses plus an undetermined number of harvest workers 
will lose their jobs 
preliminary estimates put the loss at 286 million to 288 
million for valley orange growers in californias worst freeze 
since 1913 agriculture officials in tulare kern and fresno 
counties reported 
as a result navel oranges will be scarce and more expensive in 
supermarkets nationwide industry officials said thursday 
prices could double because of the severe damage in the 
central valley said claire peters spokeswoman for sunkist 
growers inc a marketing cooperative of about 6000 california and 
arizona growers 
the fruit will be well tested so the quality should be fine 
but there wont be as much and it will be more expensive she 
said 
most of the countrys eating oranges are grown in the west 
while florida produces most juice oranges californias central 
valley produces about half of the wests navel orange crop 
citrus farmers in some southern california pockets escaped with 
less damage because temperatures remained a few critical degrees 
higher said bob perkins manager of the riverside county farm 
bureau 
as one farmer here said they will make money on somebody 
elses misfortune the price of remaining fruit will rise because 
of damage in the central valley perkins said thursday 
national weather service forecasters predicted a second yukon 
express cold air mass could send the mercury plummeting again by 
weeks end threatening remaining crops and the trees themselves 
severe cold can damage the tender fruitwood the ends of the 
twigs where fruit grows and endanger next years crop perkins 
said 
there was a midweek respite from the cold los angeles and san 
diego reached 64 degrees by midday thursday while san francisco 
reported 49 degrees fresno in the central valley had a midday 
high thursday of 50 
but forecasters said nights would remain chilly dipping into 
the low 20s in some valley locations even before the second arctic 
blast arrives 
last weekend temperatures throughout the san joaquin valley 
citrus region dipped below 20 navel oranges begin to sustain 
damage if the temperature stays below about 26 degrees for at least 
four hours 
state farm fire and casualty co urged homeowners to be wary of 
the next cold blitz and insulate pipes the company said 15000 
homes it insures in northern california were damaged by water from 
burst pipes during the past week

the bloodbath began 25 years ago in 
the waning days of what the late president sukarno said would be a 
year of living dangerously 
from sumatra to bali there were nights of horror in city slums 
and jungle clearings a rampage in the name of anticommunism that 
left hundreds of thousands dead following an unsuccessful coup in 
september 1965 
indonesia is still dealing with the carnage and shows no real 
willingness to bury the past much leftover business remains from 
the turbulent period 
the government recently started screening about 15 million 
former communists or sympathizers to dcide whether they will be 
allowed to vote in the 1992 general election 
four former palace guards were executed earlier this year for 
their part in the aborted coup which was blamed on chinese 
influence at least six more prisoners await the firing squad 
diplomatic relations with china suspended since 1967 were 
restored only four months ago still to be settled is the issue of 
more than 300000 chinese made stateless when they were unable 
to renew their passports or leave indonesia when relations were 
frozen 
two books about the aborted coup were banned this year one of 
them the united stats and the overthrow of sukarno by peter 
dale scott of the university of california berkeley alleged that 
president suharto helped instigate the uprising 
the memory of that brutal chapter still haunts the countrys 
leaders who are anxious to ensure that the next transfer of power 
is peaceful suharto 69 is halfway through his fifth fiveyear 
term diplomats and other analysts assume he will continue for 
another term if his health remains good 
no conclusive account of the coup attempt that can be verified 
independently has been issued a government white paper with an 
official version was completed in the 1970s but never released 
what is known is that it started on sept 30 1965 with an 
uprising by a group of middlerank army officers the government 
says they were backed by the chineseinfluenced indonesian 
communist party then the worlds thirdlargest claiming 20 
million followers 
they struck first by murdering six leading generals but were 
unable to seize power the coup was put down within 36 hours by 
troops led by then maj gen suharto whom the plotters 
inexplicably left off their hit list 
as head of the strategic reserve command he was more important 
than most of the generals who were killed 
there was popular resentment at the slaying of the generals and 
moslem anger at a power grab by infidels but the country remained 
calm at first for several weeks a semblance of order was 
maintained 
then something snapped by late october the official antara news 
agency was reporting massacres in central and east java religious 
and racial tensions exploded with ethnic chinese singled out for 
the settling of old scores the moslem majority had long envied the 
chinese for their wealth and questioned their patriotism 
as months of frenzy passed the purge of anyone labeled a 
communist came to be considered a national obligation not murder 
officials announced in 1975 that from 450000 to 500000 people 
were killed tens of thousands were injured 
an estimated 600000 suspects were detained without charge 
among them some of the countrys best known writers poets 
educators journalists film directors and intellectuals the last 
detainees were released in 1979 
when calm was restored in march 1966 sukarno relinquished 
executive power to suharto and the army a situation that prevails 
25 years later 
sukarnos downfall and outlawing of the indonesian communist 
party led to a reversal of a leftist prochina foreign policy and 
adoption of a prowestern course 
suharto halted a costly twoyear war with neighboring malaysia 
that had divided the armed forces jakarta helped found the 
anticommunist association of southeast asian nations 
the catchy acronyms and slogans that spiced sukarnos oratory 
ended when he went into virtual house arrest until his death in 
1970 among the best known slogans thanks to a novel by cj koch 
and movie based on it was sukarnos forecast that 1965 would be a 
year of living dangerously 
once hailed for his vision of a unified nation free of dutch 
colonial rule his economic policies left the country near 
bankruptcy by the time he died 
only the second president in 45 years of independence suharto 
has brought stability and economic progress to the country of 180 
million at the expense of political freedom a tradeoff most 
indonesians appear to accept 
he has largely succeeded in ending most of the regional 
religious and political factionalism that wracked the country 
during its first 20 years and threatened to tear apart the 
13677island archipelago 
the countrys economic policies praised by the international 
monetary fund and the world bank are bearing fruit last years 
growth rate was 74 percent 
but indonesia must find jobs for a work force that grows by 25 
million people each year per capita gross national product was 
only 500 last year

subscribers to a nationwide computer 
network contend the owners are taking a byte out of the first 
amendment by censoring the networks electronic bulletin board 
messages 
but officials for the prodigy network which provides consumer 
and information services to several hundred thousand subscribers 
maintain they have the same right as newspaper and broadcast 
executives to set boundaries on the exercise of free 
expression 
an electronic communications law expert agreed saying the 
challenge for prodigy is enforcing standards tough enough to avoid 
lawsuits sparked by bulletin board content 
they should be able to forbid whatever they forbade in 
their subscriber agreement dallas attorney benjamin wright said 
thursday 
but subscriber indignation has been flowing for weeks into the 
electronic bulletin board prodigy sets aside for complaints 
censorship is the most unamerican communist thing in the 
prodigy service wrote subscriber chris hanke who did not say 
where he lives if a member finds anything offensive on the 
bulletin boards this service should ask them if they still want to 
be a member of this service 
subscriber john gillis likened the services editors to old 
ladies afraid of mice that drew a oneword retort from ray 
bandel one of the badly outnumbered subscribers who support 
prodigys standards bull 
prodigy which carries such items as stock quotes advertising 
and horoscopes considers itself a family service company 
spokeswoman martha griffin said it is jointly owned by sears and 
ibm corp 
when you send something into a public bulletin board on a 
family service then you expect to write within the boundaries of 
the rules that are stated she said from her white plains ny 
office 
when they join prodigy subscribers agree to refrain from 
sending messages that contain profanity or obscenity threaten or 
insult might offend those doing business through prodigy or are 
otherwise objectionable 
messages rejected by prodigy editors included one seeking the 
least painful way to commit suicide and another accusing somebody 
of being an embezzler said geoffrey moore who directs market 
programs and communications for prodigy 
the constitution bestows no rights on readers to have their 
views published in someone elses private medium moore wrote in 
a dec 16 essay in the new york times what the constitution does 
give readers is the right to become publishers themselves 
but some subscribers contend the service is heavyhanded and 
goes beyond its own standards daniel hunter wrote that prodigy has 
rejected his messages to the arts club bulletin board because they 
made reference to the marquis de sade and contained a historical 
discussion of mass murders plagues etc 
if anything our editors do err on the side of conservatism 
ms griffin said there are other bulletin board services where 
people can express more extreme views if they wish 
she also said prodigy does not interfere with private messages 
sent directly from one subscriber to another the only way we 
would see those messages is if the receiver complained about their 
content she said 
wright said the real issue for prodigy and other computer 
networks is the extent to which a videotext service provider has 
an obligation to look at whats getting on the bulletin boards 
he noted that soldier of fortune magazine recently was 
successfully sued by the family of a man slain by a killerforhire 
who had advertised in the magazine 
the law found that the magazine had a duty to screen the 
information it published he said 
prodigy may not have as great a duty wright said that would 
depend on whether a judge or jury found it to be more like a 
newspaper or magazine which have a greater duty to monitor content 
than entities not in that business 
where they would stand in terms of liability is unclear he 
said there are few if any statutes or lawsuits as precedent

president bushs acceptance of a tax increase 
was reason enough for a panel of conservatives to mark him down in 
midterm grades and one of them suggests the president might flunk 
out at reelection time 
the conservative heritage foundation lined up seven figures from 
the right to grade bush his cabinet and top aides for the 
sophomore slump report card they gave vice president dan 
quayle better marks than bush 
the critique released thursday is to be published in policy 
review the foundations quarterly magazine a year ago in a 
similar exercise bush got grades ranging from b to d this 
time one rater gave him an f and three said d in judging 
his domestic policy performance 
the budget deal and tax increase were their common complaint 
martin anderson a white house adviser to ronald reagan who now 
is a senior fellow at the hoover institution said bush rated a b 
minus overall and could have made a if he hadnt flunked on 
the budget and economic policy 
at the other end of the scale edward h crane president of the 
libertarian cato institute gave bush an f 
george bush will go down as one of the worst presidents in 
american history crane wrote the republicans were the 
antitax party and now they are the dumb party 
james c miller iii a reagan budget director now chairman of 
citizens for a sound economy said d because of bushs 
incredible blunder on taxes 
his credibility has suffered a mortal blow said miller 
can he promise anything in the 1992 campaign without evoking 
giggles from the audience 
burton yale pines senior vice president of the heritage 
foundation who has suggested that conservative republicans may 
challenge bush in the 1992 presidential primaries also gave him a 
d on domestic affairs 
at best he is reactive pines said at worse he risks 
being a herbert hooverwilliam howard taft oneterm president 
most of the conservative graders ranked bush higher on foreign 
policy and his handling of the middle east crisis while reserving 
final judgment pending the outcome of the confrontation with iraq 
crane didnt agree contending that bush blundered by sending 
troops to the middle east and with his dangerous and costly 
vision of a new world order involving us military and economic 
involvement abroad he stuck with his f 
bushs foreign policy has unraveled like a cheap russian 
sweater crane said 
the conservative panel gave quayle four as and two bs 
praising his loyalty to conservative tenets as well as to bush and 
saying hed tried to talk the president out of the budget and tax 
deal but crane said dplus with points off for loyalty 
the vice president has proven to be a loyal team player which 
would be okay were it not for the fact that hes playing on the 
bush administration team crane said 
the conservatives gave white house chief of staff john h sununu 
low grades pines marked him f for meekly surrendering to and 
becoming an eager captive of washingtons permanent 
establishment 
gary l bauer another reagan adviser now president of the 
family research council made it a c but with a warning 
against sununus pit bull mode 
unless he drops his simon legree attitude toward conservative 
republican congressmen he will become a liability to the 
president bauer said 
when president bush takes aim at his own foot sununu brings 
in the heavy artillery complained amy moritz of the national 
center for public policy research she said sununu should take aim 
at the left not at his old friends she graded him d 
among other items on the conservative report card 
jack kemp secretary of housing and urban development got the 
highest cabinet grades including five as crane dissented 
awarding kemp a d for not resigning to rescue the republican 
party from george bush 
back on taxes and the budget pines called budget director 
richard g darman the milli vanilli of the bush white house and 
said he lip syncs what are actually the economic policies of the 
carter administration pines gave darman an f 
anderson wouldnt even give darman a grade saying the budget 
director should be expelled

the food and drug administration will begin 
weekly tests of raw milk around the nation to determine if it 
contains certain antibiotics the agency said 
the fda said thursday that 250 locations across the country will 
be chosen for testing of raw milk samples the inspections will be 
conducted each week in five of the sites selected randomly 
the samples will be tested for the presence of eight sulfa drugs 
and three tetracycline drugs the fda said that when residues are 
found the states will be told and the agency will help track down 
the source 
as newer analytical methods become available milk will be 
monitored for additional drugs the fda said in a statement 
the system will add another layer of protection for consumers 
rep ted weiss dny attacked the plan as inadequate 
testing five milk samples per week means that each processing 
location in fdas program will be visited only once a year he 
said in a statement fdas attempt to describe this as a 
nationwide program is ludicrous to even call it a modest proposal 
is a wild exaggeration 
weiss who is chairman of the house government operations 
subcommittee on human resources conducted hearings earlier this 
year on the fdas milktesting methods 
antibiotics are often used by veterinarians to treat infections 
in dairy cattle testing is conducted to determine if residues from 
the drugs are present in the milk

chances of coastal flooding will increase when 
a rare alignment of the sun moon and earth will produce higher and 
lower tides than usual from sunday through wednesday government 
forecasters say 
a similar astronomical arrangement dec 1 through dec 4 caused 
local flooding on the coast of the gulf of maine making this the 
second round of unusual tides this month 
forecasters from the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said thursday they expect the turnoftheyear tides 
to be more pronounced on the west coast than the east coast 
the weather service forecast no major storms on either coast 
but onshore winds are possible on the new england coast tuesday and 
the midatlantic coast tuesday and wednesday 
the extra tidal displacement should amount to less than a foot 
higher at high tide or lower at low tide the forecasts said but 
that could be enough to make a difference in some places 
heavy rain snow or onshore winds could bring localized 
flooding noaa said extremely low tides could expose mariners to 
lowwater hazards but could reduce the threat of flooding during a 
storm 
people living and working in coastal areas were urged to consult 
tide tables and to be alert to weather forecasts

president mikhail s gorbachev having won his 
battle for wider powers from the soviet congress faces a new 
crisis as the russian federation plans to cut its contribution to 
the national budget by more than 80 percent 
meanwhile russian president boris n yeltsin a chief rival of 
gorbachev suffered his own setback when his capitalistminded 
finance minister quit over the slow pace of reform 
the congress of peoples deputies wrapped up its latest session 
on thursday by approving gorbachevs nominee for the vice 
presidency gennady i yanayev after narrowly rejecting the 
obscure burea5bat in a vote earlier in the day 
yanayev 53 was the only candidate for vice president a post 
created as part of the reorganized federal government hierarchy 
that was adopted by legislators wednesday and which further 
centralizes control under gorbachev 
during the stormy 10day session the congress endorsed 
gorbachevs draft of a treaty to hold together the crumbling union 
and approved his proposals for national referendums on whether to 
allow private ownership of land and whether to preserve the union 
beyond the victory however looms a serious dispute between 
russia and the central government that threatens the nations 
solvency 
gorbachev told the congress thursday that russian lawmakers have 
agreed to provide only 374 billion toward the national budget for 
next year 190 billion or about 83 percent less than the 
republics contribution this year 
the vast republic comprises twothirds of the soviet unions 
territory and half the countrys population 
the russians want to keep the money for themselves saying they 
do not recive enough in return to justify their contribution to 
the national budget 
if other republics follow russias lead and cut their 
contributions to the 400 billion national budget he said the 
result would be a collapse not only of the economy but of the 
union 
all the people will be on the street he said in a second 
speech later referring to the possibility of massive civil unrest 
what are we supposed to do disband our military entirely and 
stop all fundamental scientific research thats not serious 
gorbachev told lawmakers 
the 59yearold soviet president urged the russian parliament to 
suspend its decision 
he also asked the national congress to pass a resolution calling 
for a series of actions to resolve the budget dispute including 
creation of a national economic stabilization fund higher taxes 
and higher prices 
the budget issue is the latest to face gorbachev as he grapples 
with a crumbling economy independenceminded republics and ethnic 
unrest all 15 soviet republics have declared some form of 
sovereignty 
yeltsin faces problems of his own 
boris fyodorov russias 33yearold finance minister who led 
efforts to create a market economy in the republic resigned 
wednesday in frustration over stalled progress on his plan 
he said in an interview published thursday with rossiiskaya 
gazeta the official newspaper of the russian supreme soviet 
legislature that russian lawmakers have been unwilling to take 
necessary but unpopular measures such as lifting artificial price 
controls and allowing private ownership 
the impact of fyodorovs resignation could not immediately be 
gauged but it was certain to raise questions by fledgling 
investors and entrepreneurs in the largest of the soviet unions 15 
republics 
fyodorov told the newspaper that decisions such as forming 
private companies setting up a stock market and bringing russian 
accounting practices in line with international norms get bogged 
down in the depths of the apparatus of the russian council of 
ministers for months on end 
on nov 1 the russian federation began a program to switch from 
a centrally planned command economy to a free market within 500 
days russian lawmakers said they wanted to move faster than the 
national government but their policies often conflict and create 
confusion rather than reform 
fyodorov is credited with helping draft russias version of the 
500day plan and was a member of the joint russiansoviet committee 
that tried to merge the governments divergent plans 
a devotee of british economic policies under former prime 
minister magaret thatcher fyodorov holds a doctorate in economics 
from the moscow institute of finance he has worked for the huge 
soviet economic planning agency gosplan and the prestigious 
institute for economics and international relations

state officials have moved to make massachusetts 
safer for plants animals and people with laws ordering protection 
of wildlife habitat and a drastic reduction in automobile air 
pollution 
the measures were signed thursday by gov michael dukakis who 
leaves office next week 
the wildlife measure provides protection to more than 200 
threatened species of plants animals and invertebrates by 
controlling the alteration of wetlands and other areas where the 
wildlife reside 
this is the most important environmental legislation for 
wildlife ever passed in the commonwealth said christopher leahy 
the massachusetts audubon societys conservation director 
he said the legislation was controversial because it could limit 
what some private landowners can do on their property 
but its crucial to be able to truly protect things he 
said 
the new law also establishes a process for listing species as 
endangered threatened or of special concern and prohibits the 
taking or selling of those that make the list 
also thursday dukakis signed a clean air bill that goes beyond 
new federal requirements in restricting auto emissions 
the measure is based on standards recently adopted in 
california and supporters say it makes massachusetts only the 
second state to establish pollution controls stricter than the 
federal governments 
we hope to create a domino effect said jenny carter of the 
massachusetts public interest research group 
massachusetts air quality failed to meet federal health 
standards on at least 40 days over the past three summers this 
law will help reverse that trend carter said 
the law orders automobile manufacturers to cut smogcausing 
hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions from 50 percent to 75 
percent beyond what is required by the federal clean air act 
the law calls for the new emission standards to be phased in 
beginning in 1993 
manufacturers can meet the standards using any technology they 
wish but carter said she expects most manufacturers would refine 
catalytic converters to reduce more emissions 
she estimated the measure would cost consumers an extra 170 
when they buy a new car

a flight surgeon stationed in saudi arabia 
against his will has been ordered to end a 28day hunger strike 
his lawyer says 
attorney richard prinz said capt david wiggins called him 
wednesday and read a written order instructing the physician to 
eat 
the order indicated wiggins 28 was being required to eat 
because he is too weak to perform his duties and that combat 
might be necessary immediately prinz told the temple daily 
telegram in a story published thursday 
prinz would not say if wiggins would disobey the order but said 
if youve been covering the story i think you know what the 
answer is wiggins wife patty said thursday her husband told 
prinz he would refuse the order 
wiggins who is 5foot10 weighed 167 pounds when he began his 
hunger strike on nov 30 and had lost about 21 pounds on a diet of 
vitamins and water when he was sent to saudi arabia on dec 17 as 
part of operation desert shield he stopped eating after a federal

responsibility for wounding three palestinians in a roadside ambush 
says it will launch more attacks on arabs an israeli journalist 
reported today 
in the occupied lands meanwhile palestinians observed a 
general strike called to protest the mass immigration of soviet 
jews and the increasing settlement of jews in israelioccupied land 
in east jerusalem 
roni shaked a reporter for the yedioth ahronoth daily 
newspaper said an anonymous telephone caller told him an hour 
after the shooting thursday night that this is the first activity 
of the group and there are going to be more actions and much 
worse than this 
the caller claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of 
a group calling itself the zionist avengers 
relatives of the victims and some liberal israelis claim the 
rightwing government maintains a lax attitude toward jewish 
militants and encourages violence against arabs 
the shooting attack came a day after three jewish settlers were 
freed after serving less than seven years of a life term for 
killing three palestinians in a shooting spree and maiming two west 
bank mayors with car bombs they were greeted as heroes by fellow 
settlers 
defense minister moshe arens condemned thursdays shooting as a 
criminal act and said the assailants would be most severely 
punished avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak 
shamir called the attack shocking 
one of the victims 30yearold faisal amer was in serious but 
stable condition after being shot several times in the chest leg 
and abdomen said ruth mekel a spokeswoman for jerusalems 
hadassah hospital 
amers 34yearold sister ibtissam was in stable condition 
after being shot in the hand her 9monthold daughter who was hit 
by shrapnel in the hips was also stable mrs mekel said 
amer a physician from the west bank town of hebron was driving 
his sister and niece home late thursday when his car was flagged 
down by a man in army uniform on the main highway between bethlehem 
and hebron israel army radio said 
amer slowed down the car and the man in uniform started shooting 
with a submachine gun the report said 
ibtissam amer said the assailant told her that you will both 
die and god will not protect you 
the army said no soldiers were involved in the incident 
we shot at an arab car tonight and i hope people were killed 
in the attack shaked quoted the caller as saying 
the caller told shaked who is wellknown for his coverage of 
the occupied territories that the shooting was a warning to the 
government to do more to protect jews similar calls were made to

chinese officials today approved the death 
penalty for some drug and pornography cases and they replaced the 
security chief who failed to quell last years prodemocracy 
movement 
wang fang the 70yearold public security minister in charge of 
the police submitted his resignation before todays meeting of the 
standing committee of chinas legislature the official xinhua news 
agency reported 
he was replaced with tao siju 55 who was vice minister of 
public security since 1988 taos ascendancy was predicted after he 
accompanied communist premier li peng on a tour of four asian 
countries earlier this month 
the report gave no reason for the departure of wang who served 
in the post since 1987 
but as early as last year chinese sources said wang was expected 
to step down in disgrace for his failure to keep last years 
prodemocracy marches by beijing college students from escalating 
into a nationwide mass movement 
police were ordered to block the initial student marches but 
failed sometimes offering only token resistance some uniformed 
police flashed vforvictory signs to show support 
the government finally called the army into beijings tiananmen 
square on june 4 1989 causing hundreds of deaths 
the 135member standing committee which concluded a nineday 
session today meets between annual sessions of the full 
2700delegate national peoples congress 
xinhua said the new drug law approved by the committee specifies 
sentences ranging from 15 years in prison to the death sentence for 
ringleaders of drug smuggling gangs and those linked to 
international rings it also calls for sentences of seven years to 
life for possession of 22 pounds of opium or 175 ounces of 
heroin 
drug abuse in china while still far below western levels has 
increased in recent years along with income levels a growing 
problem is the shipment of drugs from southeast asia through china 
to hong kong 
the committee mandated life imprisonment or execution for 
serious cases of producing or selling pornographic materials 
but xinhua did not say what would constitute a serious case 
theresolution is aimed at safeguarding social order and 
promoting advanced socialist culture xinhua said 
china already allows judges to hand down the death penalty for 
virtually any crime if they deem the circumstances serious enough 
and hundreds are executed annually based on media reports alone 
official totals are never released 
also today zheng tuobin 66 minister of foreign economic 
relations and trade since 1985 resigned and was replaced by his 
vice minister li lanqing xinhua said no reason was given 
western diplomats however said they were told earlier in the 
year that zheng was ill he was not believed to be in political 
trouble 
the diplomats described his successor li 58 as a pragmatist 
who worked in the auto industry and has experience in administering 
state loans and foreign investment he speaks english and russian

the father of a braindamaged patient 
at the hospital where nancy cruzan died this week wants to move his 
daughter to another state and remove her feeding tube 
im not going to let my kid stay like that pete busalacchi 
said of his 20yearold daughter christine who has been in a 
persistent vegetative state since a 1987 car accident in st louis 
if she knows whats going on its pure torture if she doesnt 
its not worth going on 
busalacchi 43 of st charles declined to say what other 
facilities or states he was considering it might happen real 
soon he said 
ms cruzan died at the missouri rehabilitation center early 
wednesday 12 days after a judge ruled that her parents had 
convincing evidence that she would want to die and allowed doctors 
to remove her feeding tube she had been in a persistent vegetative 
state since a 1983 car crash 
busalacchi said he wants to move his daughter to a state with 
less strict regulations because he does not have the evidence 
required to meet the missouri law and also hopes to avoid the 
publicity that surrounded the cruzan case 
while ms cruzan starved and dehydrated antieuthanasia 
protesters held a vigil outside the southwestern missouri state 
hospital nineteen protesters were arrested when they tried to 
enter her room the protesters said they feared the case would turn 
the rehabilitation center into a mecca for people seeking 
euthanasia for family members 
ms cruzans parents legal battle led to the first us supreme 
court ruling in a righttodie case the court said states can 
require clear and convincing evidence that the patient would 
want to die 
busalacchi has not taken his daughters case to court 
he said several doctors have told him his daughter is not likely 
to recover but that some hospital staff members said she has shown 
improvement 
administrator don lamkins said the center would not try to 
prevent busalacchi from moving his daughter

two argentine nationals and two local jewelry 
dealers have been convicted of laundering 350 million in colombian 
drug profits through jewelry markets 
it was the biggest moneylaundering case ever tried in this 
country prosecutors said 
raul vivas 38 of argentina and jewelry dealers nazareth and 
vahe andonian of los angeles each were convicted wednesday of 25 
felony counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to 
launder money 
juan carlos seresi also from argentina was convicted of 20 
felony money laundering counts and a conspiracy count 
each money laundering count carries a maximum 20year prison 
term the conspiracy count carries a maximum prison term of five 
years 
federal court jurors said they were unable to reach verdicts on 
narcotics conspiracy counts against the four defendants the panel 
also failed to reach verdicts on 27 counts against ruben saini 
another argentine accused of helping to destroy evidence 
us district judge william keller ordered jurors thursday to 
resume deliberations on those counts 
federal prosecutors claimed vivas created a laundering operation 
dubbed la mina or the mine that was based on a triangular 
trade of drugs gold and cash by colombian drug traders 
though the amount cited by prosecutors in the trial was 350 
million in the past investigators have said the amount laundered 
by la mina could total 1 billion in los angeles and other 
cities including new york and miami 
the network used drug profits to buy gold through jewelers for 
colombian cocaine traffickers prosecutors said officials of wells 
fargo bank in los angeles told federal officials the andonians who 
operated andonian brothers jewelry in los angeles had deposited 
25 million in cash during a threemonth period 
earlier this month the jury acquitted four jewelry company 
employees charged with playing lesser roles in the organization

an ultraorthodox rabbi considered to be a 
political kingmaker has enraged religious and secular israelis by 
saying the holocaust was gods punishment for sins such as 
violating the sabbath and eating pork 
not for a long time has any single remark caused such an 
emotional reaction said razi barkai host of a radio talk show 
that was flooded with hundreds of calls thursday over the remarks 
of rabbi eliezer schach 
barkai said calls ran about 3to2 against the 97yearold 
rabbi who said another disaster may befall jews for violating 
traditional religious tenets 
the last time he brought destruction it was the holocaust 
because of the sins the almighty may bring another holocaust upon 
us and it may already be tomorrow schach told jewish seminary 
students earlier this week 
about 6 million jews died in the nazi genocide during world war 
ii and tens of thousands of survivors live in israel five percent 
of israels jewish residents are ultraorthodox while 70 percent 
define themselves as secular 
rabbi schach today is one of the most powerful men in israeli 
politics and each one of his words creates a lot of noise said 
sociologist menachem friedman an expert on religious communities 
earlier this year schach helped prime minister yitzhak shamir 
form a government by ordering his followers to join shamirs 
coalition the support of two factions loyal to schach gave shamir 
60 votes in the 120member parliament shamir also had a promise of 
support from the twoseat ultrarightist moledet faction which 
stayed outside the coalition 
in exchange for the support of another ultraorthodox faction 
agudat israel the government party asked for a series of reform 
laws including a ban on sexually suggestive ads and sale of pork 
forbidden by jewish dietary laws 
the knesset or parliament earlier this month outlawed outdoor 
advertising that features scantily clad people it is expected to 
take up some of the other proposals soon 
the proposed laws have angered many secular israelis who claim 
the ultraorthodox minority carries too much influence 
schachs comments on the holocaust was simply repeating a theme 
common in the bible of divine retribution against the jewish 
people for straying from the path of their religious law 
but on another level many took his remarks to mean that the 
jews somehow were to blame for the nazis behavior 
the almighty keeps a balance sheet of the world and when the 
sins become too many he brings destruction we dont know how long 
his patience holds out sometimes 20 years sometimes 10 and 
sometimes only a year schach said 
schachs chief rival brooklynbased rabbi menachem schneersohn 
told supporters thursday the jews who died in the holocaust were 
pure and holy 
heaven forbid someone should say that the jews sinned in some 
way and god settled accounts with them and imposed on them the most 
terrible sentence of the past generation said schneersohn the 
politically influential leader of the hasidic habad movement 
some of schachs sharpest critics were holocaust survivors 
menahem russak a survivor of the auschwitz concentration camp 
and a former commander of the israeli police unit investigating 
nazi war crimes said schach shamed and humiliated millions of 
holocaust victims 
his voice shaking russak told listeners that schach not only 
exonerated the nazi murderers but turned them into messengers of 
god who were sent to punish the people of israel for not observing 
the torah 
but another caller an ultraorthodox woman who lost relatives 
in the holocaust defended the rabbi 
with al the pain i have i can understand his words we 
believe in the link between sin and punishment said the woman 
who did not give her name 
friedman said schachs views reflect ultraorthodox thinking 
prevalent since the 1950s 
but secular israelis only began listening after the 
ultraorthodox left their selfchosen isolation and entered israeli 
politics in the 1980s friedman said 
the secular public tends to stereotype ultraorthodox jews like 
schach as throwbacks to the jews ghetto years who never embraced 
the zionist cause for one thing they speak yiddish the language 
of the ghetto in europe rather than hebrew

president corazon aquino said today 
her government would meet conditions set by a swiss court for the 
return of 350 million deposited in switzerland by the late 
president ferdinand marcos 
in a decision made public thursday the swiss supreme court 
ruled the money must be returned as soon as a competent philippine 
criminal court has issued a legally binding verdict in a case 
against marcos and his wife imelda 
the money has been frozen in several swiss banks since march 
1986 
the order set a oneyear deadline for the philippine government 
to complete legal proceedings it said that if no verdict is 
returned within that period swiss banks would end their seizure of 
the assets 
the decision of switzerlands federal supreme court should be 
hailed as a victory for the filipino people mrs aquino said in 
a statement for our part we are confident that we will be able 
to fulfill the conditions within the time frame available 
neither marcos who died in september 1989 nor his widow 
imelda has ever been charged with a criminal offense in the 
philippines because the government feared they would demand their 
right to return from exile and face trial 
but david castro chairman of the presidential commission on 
good government said the government did not have to file criminal 
charges against the marcoses to meet the terms of the swiss order 
castro said a guilty verdict in civil suits for embezzlement 
against the marcoses handed down by an antigraft court would 
satisfy the swiss supreme court requirement 
castro said the philippine supreme court has ruled in the past 
that a civil suit whose penalty is forfeiture of assets was penal 
in nature as in a criminal case 
he said the governments swiss lawyers assured him that this 
formula would satisfy the swiss supreme court the government has 
filed 35 civil cases against the marcoses and their close 
associates in the antigraft court 
in bern however justice ministry spokesman joerg kistler said 
the swiss government has no reason to doubt that the philippines 
will open criminal proceedings in the case 
he said it was clear that criminal proceedings have to be 
conducted and that the accused will have to be granted all the 
rights of defense provided for by the federal constitution and the 
european human rights convention 
marcos and his family fled to hawaii after a popular revolt 
toppled his 20year rule and swept mrs aquino to the presidency 
mrs aquino banned the return of the marcos family citing security 
threats 
the aquino government claims marcos and his associates embezzled 
up to 10 billion but has offered little evidence to substantiate 
that figure 
in the four years since marcos ouster the government has 
managed to retrieve only 400 million mostly from marcos 
associates 
castro said the government expects to find more of marcos 
hidden wealth after it obtains seized bank records which under 
the swiss supreme court ruling can be handed over to the philippine 
government

millions of dollars in federal funds provided 
to the states to fight the war against drugs are going unspent the 
office of national drug control policy says 
states have been spending just twothirds of their federal 
grants aimed at fighting drugs over the last four years the white 
house agency said thursday 
the situation is most striking for law enforcement grants where 
states have spent only 40 percent of the federal money they have 
received said bruce carnes director of planning budget and 
administration for the drug policy office 
i think whats bringing the spending level down is the law 
enforcement grant because there were such enormous increases in 
that in the last two years said carnes who released the figures 
as his office issued a report on block grants given to states over 
the past few years 
antidrug block grants issued by the justice department dropped 
from 178 million in the 1987 fiscal year to a low of 56 million 
in 1988 they jumped back to 119 million in 1989 before zooming to 
395 million in fiscal 1990 which ended sept 30 they climb to 
423 million this year 
theres going to be a huge wave of money carnes said it 
started to descend on them in 89 and 90 and its going to keep 
going up this year 
carnes said states spent 82 percent of their drug treatment and 
prevention grants 46 percent of their drug education grants and 40 
percent of their law enforcement grants 
overall the three block grant programs sent 5 billion to the 
states from october 1986 through june 1990 
only 34 billion or 68 percent of that amount was distributed 
during that time by state and territorial governments to antidrug 
programs the figures show 
obviously id like to see it higher but im not prepared to 
say theyre not doing their jobs carnes said 
among the states topranked arizona spent 834 percent of the 
777 million it received second was nevada spending 79 percent 
of 267 million followed by the us territories which spent 77 
percent of 633 million 
trailing the list puerto rico spent only 342 percent of the 
317 million it received hawaii spent 52 percent of 274 million 
and wyoming 55 percent of 141 million 
hawaii attorney general warren price said county prosecutors and 
police departments in the state use county funds for antidrug 
efforts and later seek reimbursement from the federal grants he 
said this sets up a time lag that makes it look as if the federal 
funds arent being spent quickly 
the drug policy office said in the report that it opposes giving 
such grants directly to cities on grounds that doing so would place 
too heavy a paperwork and administrative burden on the federal 
government 
instead of speeding up the process the time required at the 
federal level to review thousands of applications from local 
governments would almost certainly slow it down it said in the 
report 
states are closer to the problem than federal administrators 
and can more quickly react to changes in local requirements it 
added 
governors oppose giving the money directly to cities but mayors 
complain that the states fail to send the money to the places that 
need it the most 
former new york city police commissioner patrick v murphy said 
mayors believe that while recreational users in the suburbs may be 
driving the drug problem the most severe crisis is elsewhere 
the worst problems the murder and violence among the kids 
who get into the traffic and the delays for treatment for 
lowincome people who dont have health insurance are in the 
cities said murphy who directs the us conference of mayors 
police policy board

ports friday for the gulf aboard 17 ships including the aircraft 
carriers america and theodore roosevelt from the norfolk naval base 
in virginia three aircraft carriers are already in the middle 
east the deployment of so many us warships to one part of the 
world is unprecedented since the vietnam war 
 
the pentagon was reportedly planning inoculations for troops 
against biological warfare the new york times reported friday that 
the inoculations could begin within a matter of weeks army lt 
col steve roy a spokesman for the department of defense refused 
to comment on the report which quoted unidentified administration

the pentagon said today it plans to begin 
vaccinating us troops in the persian gulf against possible germ 
warfare 
the vaccinations are part of a plan to protect us troops 
against the possibility that iraqi president saddam hussein may use 
chemical or biological weapons if war breaks out 
we are committed to providing maximum protection for our 
troops including protection against chemical and biological 
weapons said a brief pentagon statement 
we expect to begin a program of inoculations soon it said 
the statement did not provide further details and a spokeswoman 
said more may be available later in the day 
the new york times reported in its friday editions that senior 
administration officials recommended the inoculations as part of a 
broader plan that also includes the use of masks and other 
protective garments 
cia director william webster said recently that iraq has a large 
stockpile of biological weapons saddam has repeatedly denied it 
iraq used chemical weapons against some rebellious kurds in its 
own country and against iran during its war with that country 
as a result us troops in the gulf have been given protective 
clothing and have undergone training on how to protect themselves 
against an attack of poison gas 
the times said it was unclear how many troops might be 
vaccinated 
the administration plans to deploy more than 400000 troops in 
the region and all are expected to be in place within several 
weeks 
the times said the inoculations could begin in a matter of 
weeks 
biological weapons are based on living agents like viruses and 
bacteria and they cause diseases such as typhoid and cholera

president ramsewak shankar and his 
cabinet have presented their resignations to parliament which is 
expected to name a new president and vice president by saturday 
as the countrys elected parliamentarians somberly sat in 
silence thursday night vice president henck arron handed the 
resignations to national assembly president jaggernath lachmon 
arron said the cabinet had already resigned 
the armed forces of this nation in northern south america 
overthrew shankar without bloodshed on monday and urged the 
parliament to elect new chief executives and hold national 
elections within 100 days 
lachman asked shankar and arron to remain in office until their 
resignations were formally accepted which is expected saturday 
despite domestic and international condemnation of the military 
overthrow 
cmdr ivan graanoogst the acting army chief claimed on 
thursday that the militarys overthrow of shankar allowed by the 
constitution he denied the takeover was a military coup 
the new chief executive will appoint a cabinet and set a date 
for national elections to be held within three months military 
leaders said 
guido grooscors venezuelas ambassador to the organization of 
american states whose members include suriname called the 
takeover a severe violation of the principles of the oas 
charter 
the 13nation caribbean community known as caricom issued a 
statement by its chairman jamaican prime minister michael manley 
expressing dismay and outrage and demanding full restoration of 
democracy in the former dutch colony of 400000 people 
manley said otherwise caricom members may reconsider the 
future relationship with suriname and the caribbean community 
suriname does not belong to caricom 
the first public criticism at home was contained in an editorial 
published thursday by the daily newspaper de ware tyd 
reduced to its essentials the army has simply imposed its 
will on the government the newspaper said 
the council of labor union federations which represents 
organized labor in suriname issued a statement rejecting the 
armys interpretation of the constitution approved approved by a 
plebiscite in 1987 the council noted that its objection was in 
spite of its displeasure with the shankar government 
graanoogst became acting army chief saturday after military 
strongman desi bouterse resigned in a dispute with shankar 
bouterse as chairman of the fivecommander military authority 
remains the most powerful figure in the country 
bouterse came to power after a 1980 military coup deposed arron 
then president bouterse headed a military dictatorship that ruled 
the georgiasized nation until parliamentary elections were held in 
1987 
shankars threeparty coalition the front for democracy and 
development won by a landslide the assembly elected him in 1988 
to a fiveyear term as president 
shankars overthrow coincided with growing popular discontent 
with his governments inability to revive the economy beset by 
high inflation and unemployment the government has a monthly trade 
deficit of 10 million 
the economic decline began during bouterses rule major factors 
included a fall in prices for bauxite the countrys main export 
and guerrilla attacks that disrupted bauxite and aluminum 
production 
the netherlands suspended the development aid in 1982 after the 
massacre of 15 opposition leaders while in military detention

a state law providing for a fouryear 
sentence for firsttime crack users and probation for firsttime 
users of powdered cocaine is racially biased and thus 
unconstitutional a judge has ruled 
hennepin county district judge pamela alexander ruled thursday 
that state sentencing guidelines are flawed saying there is no 
logical reason why people convicted for possession crack should be 
treated any differently from those convicted of possessing any 
other form of cocaine 
assistant hennepin county attorney chuck sweetland said if the 
ruling issued thursday is upheld it could affect 100 cases in his 
county alone it will be appealed to the state supreme court he 
said 
if this isnt reversed it is going to make it impossible to 
prosecute the vast majority of urban crack cases sweetland said 
attorneys for five suspects who challenged the crack law said 92 
percent of people arrested on charges of possession of crack in 
1988 were black while 85 percent of people arrested on charges of 
possessing powdered cocaine were white crack is cocaine in the 
form of highly purified pebblelike nuggets that can be smoked 
cocaine is cocaine the judge said in her ruling so 
regardless of the form that its in it should be treated the same 
and all persons charged under that should be treated the same 
regardless of whether theyre black white pink or purple 
under the statute which took effect aug 1 1989 the 
recommended punishment for a first offender convicted of crack 
possession is a fouryear prison term but possession of cocaine 
calls for only probation 
state rep randy kelly one of the legislators who drafted the 
tougher sentencing for crack said he was stunned by the judges 
ruling 
we never ever considered that it was going to be applied 
unequally to people of color or whatever kelly said our major 
concerns were its potency its absolutely devastating influence on 
people its cheapness and its attractiveness in terms o selling to 
children those were the concerns 
alexanders ruling is binding only in hennepin county unless it 
is affirmed by an appellate court according to james e konen 
head of the criminal division for the ramsey county attorneys 
office 
until the high court rules no convicted user will be freed but 
sweetland said about 15 suspects awaiting trial in hennepin county 
could get out of jail immediately 
a supreme court decision is not expected for several months

the state of pennsylvania would assume some 
control over philadelphias spending under a new plan to rescue the 
city from bankruptcy 
the proposal outlined thursday by city treasurer benjamin 
blakney calls for creation of an oversight authority that would 
borrow money to cover a 2295 million shortfall in the fiscal year 
ending june 30 
the city would be required to provide assurances that the 
means are in hand to prevent deficits in the future he said 
blakney presented the plan during testimony before the city 
councils new select committee on fiscal stability and 
intergovernmental cooperation 
the committees chairman councilman john f street said the 
authority would be granted additional powers if philadelphia proved 
unable to balance its budget after the deficit was eliminated 
details of an oversight body would be determined by the state 
legislature which convenes next week but wont get down to 
business until the last week of january 
in the weeks ahead we will be urging all involved parties to 
support the creation of a new authority that can provide and 
control the borrowing capacity of the city blakney said 
mayor w wilson goode city controller jonathan a saidel and 
other democratic leaders have urged creation of an oversight entity 
whose powers would be triggered if the city failed to pass 
realistically balanced budgets 
a consortium of banks in loan negotiations with the city last 
week put forth a recovery plan that would create an independent 
board with lineitem veto power over city spending 
in recent weeks the city has sought to sell up to 300 million 
in shortterm notes to local banks and two pension boards to keep 
essential bills paid through winter 
banks have trimmed the request to 150 million which would 
allow the city to meet its payroll but not pay all its debts to 
suppliers and service providers while a longterm solution to the 
citys fiscal ills is worked out 
goode said wednesday that the city would not be able to pay 
employees a full salary after next week

prime minister chandra shekhar today 
opened talks with a sikh leader aimed at ending a 7yearold 
secessionist conflict in punjab that has claimed thousands of 
lives 
the talks were the most serious attempt at discussing the 
dispute since a peace accord between the sikhs and the government 
collapsed in 1986 
the meeting follows a conference two days ago by three rival 
sikh political groups that authorized a sikh leader simranjit 
singh mann to meet the prime minister to negotiate 
selfdetermination for the wealthy northern state 
mann a former police officer who was accused of plotting the 
1984 assassination of prime minister indira gandhi said he would 
try to broaden the talks to include outlawed militant 
organizations 
we want to involve the militants they are the ones who are 
laying down their lives mann said reached by telephone before 
meeting the prime minister 
mann told journalists before entering the prime ministers 
residence that he had come with the mandate for securing the right 
of selfdetermination for the people of punjab 
on thursday the fivemember panthic committee controlling the 
most powerful extremist groups issued a statement that it would 
consider talks with the government if a venue and agenda could be 
agreed the group is said to control the most powerful extremist 
groups 
the statement reportedly suggested talks in geneva or the united 
nations 
it said pakistan should act as an observer in the talks 
pakistan supports the sikhs political claims but denies 
allegations by india that it also provides aid and shelter to the 
militants 
the prime minister has ruled out independence for punjab but he 
says hes willing to negotiate constitutional amendments to 
overcome sikh grievances 
mann declined to predict the results of the talks or say how 
long they will last he also refused to say if he would consider a 
moratorium on violence while the talks were under way 
mann served five years in prison on sedition charges and was to 
stand trial for conspiracy in mrs gandhis murder when he was 
elected to parliament in 1989 charges against him were dropped by 
the government of rajiv gandhi mrs gandhis son and he was 
released from jail 
punjab has been under federal rule since 1987 when a campaign 
of assassination and intimidation intensified against hindus and 
sikh moderates 
unofficial accounts say the militants have killed more than

salman rushdie the novelist condemned 
to death by iran for allegedly blaspheming islam believes a time 
for healing will enable him to emerge from hiding according to 
an interview released today 
his comments to the united news of india were among a series of 
attempts this week aimed at ending his isolation rushdie on monday 
affirmed his belief in islam and said he would not support a 
paperback printing or further translations of his novel the 
satanic verses 
however a religious leader in iran responded by saying the 
nation would not lift the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis call to 
kill rushdie for his novel which they said blasphemes islam 
in a guest editorial today in the times of london and the new 
york times rushie said he regretted the renewed threats from 
tehran and cannot help wondering why the british government seems 
no longer to feel any need to respond to such threats 
the indian news agency quoted rushdie as saying gradually 
good will can replace ill will there is a feeling that enough has 
been done to me 
most moslems are not violent or bloodthirsty though moslems 
throughout the world now know me by name relatively few moslems 
know what sort of person i am and they could be willing to listen 
to me he was quoted as saying 
rushdie a british national who was born in india went into 
hiding in britain in february 1989 after the death call 
he has emerged in recent weeks for a television interview in 
london and has showed up unannounced at a london bookshop to 
autograph copies of his newest book haroun and the sea of 
stories 
in the interview with united news of india rushdie was quoted 
as saying i dont think i can call myself a good moslem but i 
am moslem and i believe in the oneness of god and the central 
tenets of the prophets teaching 
while many moslems in britain have denounced rushdie he 
asserted that there is a silent majority which feels the matter 
must be brought to an end united news said 
rushdie noted haroun and the sea of stories had been 
wellreceived in his native india adding perhaps the change that 
enables him to come out of hiding can start in india 
theres something new to talk about that is the process of 
healing and its particularly important to talk to indian moslems 
thats where i came from and if that is where it began it can 
be one of the palces where the ending can come from he was 
quoted as saying 
predominantly hindu india where tensions with the moslem 
minority periodically erupt into deadly riots was one of the first 
nations to ban the satanic verses 
within a few weeks at least 19 people were killed as riots over 
the book started in rushdies hometown of bombay and 
indiangoverned kashmir and spread to neighboring pakistan

a surge in the number of soviet jews 
immigrating to israel in december will give the jewish state its 
highest monthly total of immigrants in its 42year history an 
israeli official said today 
the influx of 40000 jews this month 35000 of them from the 
soviet union is intensifying a major housing crisis said simha 
dinitz head of the quasigovernmental jewish agency dinitz urged 
the government to take over construction to resolve the crisis 
the pace of immigration has accelerated in recent weeks because 
of increasing uncertainty in the soviet union and better 
transportation arrangements by israel dinitz told a news 
conference 
december will be a record month in the history of immigration 
in israel said dinitz whose agency assists the israeli 
government in transporting and resettling immigrants 
the government expects more than 200000 immigrants this year 
about 90 percent of them soviets the total will be second only to 
1949 when more than 239000 immigrants arrived in the new state 
soviets have been pouring into israel since spring 1989 when 
president mikhail s gorbachevs government eased its policy on 
exit permits 
dinitz said that discussions with newly arrived soviets showed 
that the question of lack of stability the disintegration of the 
soviet system is the thing that worries them most 
in addition he said israel has improved its transport 
arrangements via budapest bucharest and warsaw 
he said the housing crisis was created because the construction 
planned by the government had not been carried out 
dinitz said for example that government budgeted for 45000 
new housing units this year but that only 27000 had been started 
not one of the 15000 planned prefabricated homes has been erected 
he said and only 950 of 30000 mobile homes have been moved into 
place 
he predicted a difficult situation for the next 10 to 12 
months and urged the government should take over construction 
dinitz said he did not believe the newcomers would have to be 
housed in tents as some israeli officials have said instead he 
said israel will have to make use of every available space in 
hotels collective farms army camps and public buildings 
he said israel estimates there are 3 million to 35 million jews 
in the soviet union about 1 million higher than soviet estimates 
and that as many as 22 million could come to israel 
he said more than 200000 have arrived over the past two years 
and that 1 million more already have israeli invitations to 
immigrate 
we are already working on the second million dinitz said 
i think easily another million is in the pipeline provided no 
catastrophe happens 
israel has a total population of 456 million people including 
37 million jews and 840000 israeli arabs the people and 
descendants of the people who stayed within israels boundaries 
when the state was founded in 1948

by any measure 1990 was a terrible year for 
mayor marion barry it began with his videotaped arrest in a drug 
sting and saw him convicted of cocaine possession and defeated for 
a lesser office and in the end his wife moved out on him 
barry once one of the nations most prominent and promising 
black politicians is set to leave office on jan 2 unemployed and 
with a sixmonth jail sentence hanging over his head 
but the former civil rights worker who has relished the 
underdogs role in a 30year career in the public eye insists his 
chin is up even after being forced to abandon plans to run for a 
fourth fouryear term and suffering a humiliating defeat in his 
bid instead for a city council seat 
some people would be sad other people would be disappointed 
sort of downcast barry said in an interview i feel 
relieved some people would feel regret but thats not here with 
me maybe it ought to be but its not 
but detractors and supporters alike cant help but wonder at the 
promising future once held by a man who left behind the bleak 
poverty of his boyhood in itta bena miss to become a foot 
soldier in the civil rights movement and later the unrivaled star 
of washingtons local politics 
he had his life together beautifully at one time but hes 
blown it and he blew it in this last term said max berry a 
former barry supporter who directed the mayors 1986 reelection 
effort he did a lot of good things in those first seven years 
that no one will remember and hes the reason that his own life is 
in disarray 
longtime supporter calvin rolark a local community activist 
said barry is a success story because he showed what true black 
leadership can be about 
at the same time he showed the effect of drugs on 
individuals no matter how strong people are rolark said i 
think the history of marion barry will show that you can go from a 
law maker to a law breaker 
dissident black roman catholic priest george stallings described 
barrys legal travails as a national tragedy but insisted that 
the mayor should be remembered for his wide range of 
accomplishments particularly the development of a minority 
contracting procedure that generates more than 600 million 
annually for businesses owned by africanamericans hispanics and 
other groups 
on that front marion barry took the city to a new level and 
that was a great example to other municipalities stallings said 
he was a very strong leader and that should not be forgotten 
either 
barry was both relaxed and reflective as he prepared to leave 
the job he has held for a dozen years but he demonstrated none of 
the braggadocio that used to be his trademark the mayor who has 
admitted to alcoholism addiction to prescription drugs and 
occasional cocaine use credits his recovery program with taking 
the blunt edges off his personality 
this isnt like death barry said of his departure from the 
local political scene ive gotten ready for this and i look 
back and say someones going to take over i wont have that 
awesome responsibility anymore and in some ways that is nice i 
have more perspective now 
barry stressed his contributions to the city including his 
minority contracting plan a downtown development boom senior 
citizen and youth programs and the order he initially brought to 
the citys chaotic financial books but he admits that in recalling 
his career many will think first of his legal troubles 
i believe that in time my personal situation will evaporate 
from peoples minds and they will finally get around to the good 
things i did here barry said but thats what people will 
remember for awhile and you cant stop that 
the mayor also said he can cope with the prospect of spending 
time in prison if he fails in the appeal of his cocaine possession 
conviction and subsequent sixmonth sentence 
if it happens it happens ill do the six months and move 
on barry said quietly not that i like the prospects of it but 
ive learned that i cant change that and i may have to do it 
come out and start again 
how did barrys downfall begin berry his former campaign 
director says i think that he partied a lot drank too much got 
on the dope and did too many crony deals really just fell in with 
the wrong people 
maybe in the future if he stays clean he will learn to pick 
his friends better berry said 
sharon pratt dixons landslide victory in the race to succeed 
barry was seen as a stunning repudiation of the mayor whose love 
for the trappings of power contrasted sharply with dixons pledge 
for a simple nononsense government 
and as dixon prepares to tackle problems that include a massive 
municipal budget deficit record murder rate and other woes barry 
turns his attention from those difficulties to the problem of 
finding a job 
im not anxious about the future im not panicky about it 
said barry who has no firm plans beyond a handful of speaking 
engagements one thing is for sure i wont be sitting on the 
sidelines like a little mayor commenting on everything the new 
administration does 
barrys wife effi moved out of their home with son christopher 
last month after sitting in her husbands trial all summer and 
listening to a lurid string of tales that detailed his alleged drug 
use and womanizing 
this whole thing has been hard on all of us hard on me hard 
on her and hard on christopher barry said but she and i are 
friends and we have an understanding well work something out 
despite the mayors recent setbacks those who have known him 
over the years believe the strengths that have marked his career 
a sharp mind combined with disarming charm may lead to good 
things in the future 
im very sad about this because of what he has done to 
himself and by extension to the city berry said but you 
know something about him makes me want to like him even now even 
though i know hes a scoundrel

keating five sen donald w riegle jr is 
asking the treasury department to study the condition of the 
insurance industry warning that the nation cannot afford to ignore 
the development of problems similar to the savings and loan 
debacle 
riegle dmich who chairs the senate banking committee asked 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady to have his aides examine 
whether insurance companies have made too many risky investments in 
commercial real estate and other slumping sectors 
he asked the department to look into whether state guaranty 
funds are adequate to protect customers from insurance company 
defaults and to estimate the risk to the economy of a major 
insurance company failure 
he also sought to determine whether consumers can get enough 
information to identify highrisk insurance companies and to 
recommend whether federal regulation of insurance is needed 
i believe that the recent history of the savings and loan and 
commercial banking industries makes clear that the federal 
government cannot afford to ignore serious problems in any industry 
that lies close to the heart of the american economy riegle 
wrote in a letter dated dec 20 and released thursday 
he asked that the treasury department report back by sept 1 a 
treasury spokeswoman said the department was considering the 
request 
on dec 10 sen howard m metzenbaum dohio began a series of 
hearings examining whether state regulation of insurance has been 
adequate he chairs the senate judiciary subcommittee on antitrust 
monopolies and business rights 
riegle is one of five senators being probed by the senate ethics 
committee for intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf 
of charles h keating jr former head of the failed lincoln 
savings and loan 
riegle who like the other senators has denied any wrongdoing 
received 78250 in contribution funds from keating and his 
associates he later returned the money

the bush administration today charged iraq 
with blocking progress on setting up talks to deal with its 
annexation of kuwait 
joseph c wilson iv the senior us diplomat in baghdad did 
not discuss the situation for a second day in a row with iraqi 
foreign ministry officials mark dillen a state department 
spokesman said 
wilson had been in almost daily contact with deputy foreign 
minister nizar hamdoon or other iraqi officials 
iraq continues to block any progress toward setting dates for 
an exchange of visits dillen said 
he referred to the stalled proposal by president bush for iraq 
to send foreign minister tariq aziz here and then for secretary of 
state james a baker iii to go to baghdad to see president saddam 
hussein 
the cutoff for a baker trip to iraq is jan 3 that is 12 days 
before the deadline the un security council set last month for 
iraq to withdraw from kuwait or to risk a military clash with the 
united states and its allies 
iraq had invited baker to visit jan 12 but he refused saying 
it was too close to the deadline for withdrawal 
baker is on vacation in houston and is expected to return to 
washington jan 1 he has meetings scheduled with bush on jan 2 
and jan 4 officials said 
meanwhile mohamed sadiq almashat the iraqi ambassador to 
washington did not return to his post today after consultations in 
baghdad other iraqi ambassadors had been called home as well 
us and iraqi officials said mashat was expected in washington 
this weekend or early next week

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge plunged in november the fifth consecutive monthly drop and 
analysts said it signaled increased joblessness and a slump 
extending until late next year 
the basic message is theres no light down there in the tunnel 
that we can see said economist robert g dederick of northern 
trust co in chicago the recession is clearly in place and 
clearly has further to go he said 
fridays announcement of the november decline of 12 percent in 
the commerce departments index of leading indicators was the 
latest in a spate of gloomy news about economic conditions last 
month 
unemployment jumped to a threeyear high of 59 percent new 
orders to factories for big ticket durable goods such as 
automobiles and appliances plunged 105 percent matching the worst 
decline on record consumer spending and income growth was 
virtually flat and construction of singlefamily homes fell to the 
lowest level since 1982 
analysts said the latest drop in the leading index designed to 
forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance offered 
almost no hope that the economy will revive soon 
less than three weeks ago most private analysts believed the 
economy having entered a recession in the fourth quarter of this 
year would begin to grow again next spring 
the november decline in the leading index followed a 13 percent 
drop in october the steepest since the month after the october 
1987 stock market crash 
the decline left the index at 1397 percent of its 1982 base of 
100 down 44 percent from its 1462 peak in june it has been the 
worst multiplemonth retreat by the index since 1981 at the start 
of the last recession 
the november indicators leave no doubt that a serious and 
lengthy recession is under way said economist william k 
macreynolds of the us chamber of commerce this is good 
evidence that the current recession will last at least through the 
third quarter of 1991 longer than could have been foreseen just 
weeks ago 
it means a continuous drop in jobs throughout most of next 
year and a rise in the unemployment rate to about 75 percent he 
said thats a loss of more than a million jobs from where we are 
now 
top administration officials including president bush have 
been reluctant to label the slump as a recession but on thursday 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the joint economic 
committee said we will in fact have a recession and warned 
the unemployment rate could go as high as 8 percent 
however analyst samuel kahan of fuji securities inc the 
nations economic prospects may not be as bleak if the persian gulf 
crisis is resolved early in the year 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait sent oil prices soaring and the 
confidence of american consumers plummeting that in turn has 
caused sharp pullback by businesses he said 
if the war is settled we might get a boost in consumer 
confidence which could turn the whole thing around rather 
quickly he said 
in november eight of the 11 forwardlooking components of the 
commerce departments index fell 
pulling it down were a jump in new claims for unemployment 
benefits and declines in new orders to factories for consumer 
goods prices of raw materials the backlog of unfilled orders at 
factories new orders for business investment equipment the length 
of the average workweek the inflationadjusted money supply and 
building permits 
the only positive contributors were an increase in stock prices 
a slowing in business delivery times and a slight improvement in 
consumer confidence

less than three weeks from a un deadline for iraq to leave 
kuwait or face possible attack the us navy began beefing up its 
forces in the persian gulf and 16000 sailors and marines had 
orders today to leave for the region 
a day earlier president bush dismissed reports that the united 
states is still weeks away from being ready to mount a full 
military strike officials were quoted today as saying bush favors 
a quick war to save american lives 
because such a conflict could involve the use of biological 
weapons the pentagon said today it plans to inoculate american 
troops against them 
such weapons could be launched at the usled forces by 
missiles and for the second time this week iraq test fired a 
surfacetosurface missile today 
the us central command in saudi arabia reported that the 
missle was fired away from multinational forces so that it landed 
within iraq 
the firing appeared to be part of an additional testing or 
training mission said air force lt casey mahon a central 
command spokesman 
military analysts also said today that thousands of iraqis have 
been trained for suicide attacks on usled multinational forces 
if war breaks out 
in other developments 
president bush today ordered forgiveness of egypts 7 billion 
in military debts as a reward for its cooperation with the us 
efforts against iraq bush cited us national security interests 
and said the action was necessary for the success of desert 
shield the code name for the us gulf forces 
the bush administration today charged iraq with blocking 
progress on setting up talks on the gulf crisis the dispute over 
dates has prevented secretary of state james a baker iii from 
meeting with iraqs saddam hussein 
the 16000 sailors and marines were scheduled to begin leaving 
us ports for the gulf today aboard 17 ships including the 
aircraft carriers america and theodore roosevelt from the norfolk 
naval base in virginia 
navy officials said it should be a twoweek voyage meaning the 
ships would arrive before the jan 15 un deadline aircraft 
carriers on station in the middle east region are the uss saratoga 
in the eastern mediterranean the uss midway in the arabian sea and 
the uss john f kennedy in the red sea 
the deployment of such a large number of us warships to one 
part of the world is unprecedented since the vietnam war 
more than 400000 us troops are expected to be deployed by 
midfebruary as well as about 100000 from other nations iraq 
which invaded kuwait aug 2 has more than 500000 troops in 
southern iraq and in kuwait 
the new york times reported today that inoculations of soliders 
against biological weapons could begin within a matter of 
weeks a pentagon statement released today confirmed the account 
we are committed to providing maximum protection for our 
troops including protection against chemical and biological 
weapons the statement said it did not say when the vaccinations 
would begin 
saddam has denied having biological weapons based on viruses 
and bacteria that can spread diseases such as typhoid and cholera 
iraq has used chemical weapons against its kurdish population and 
against iran 
lt gen calvin waller said last week he did not believe the 
united states was prepared for a full attack on jan 15 several 
media reports says that view has wide support among the military 
but bush said thursday dont believe those reports youre 
reading and noted he was very comfortable with us firepower 
on hand in the region 
he also said there had been no progress on settling a 
disagreement over dates for a proposed meeting between saddam and 
baker the iraqis have insisted on jan 12 talks but bush said 
there would be no compromise on the us position of talks no 
later than jan 3 
should negotiations fail bush favors a quick attack according 
to senior government officials quoted in todays los angeles times

the soviet union is expected to dramatically 
reduce economic aid to cuba in january and some legislators say a 
reevaluation of political ties with the longtime ally may be next 
cuban leader fidel castro has scoffed at president mikhail s 
gorbachevs 5yearold reform campaign and some soviet deputies 
say he continues to foment insurgencies around the world while 
ignoring the needs of his people 
some members of parliament are fed up with the export of 
revolution if they cubans continue the socalled old course 
well let them continue but foreign aid wont be as it was 
before said nikolai v neyland a member of the supreme soviets 
foreign affairs committee 
officially the kremlin is sticking by castro politically but 
castros steadfast refusal of soviettype reforms may play a role 
when the national supreme soviet legislature considers a foreign 
aid bill 
western experts estimate soviet economic aid to cuba at 5 
billion a year and military aid at about 15 billion soviet 
reformers say this is a luxury the country cannot afford when it 
cant feed its own people and cuts are expected in trade talks 
beginning next month 
the foreign aid bill proposed by gorbachev envisions a 75 
percent cut in gratuitous foreign economic aid apparently 
affecting all soviet allies 
it would accompany a new policy starting jan 1 requiring 
allies to pay convertible currency at world prices for most trade 
with the soviet union that would end a practice of giving aid in 
the form of favorable trade terms to countries such as cuba 
vietnam north korea and ethiopia 
in other changes the soviets also are pushing for a thaw in 
uscuban relations a 31year antagonism that nearly led to 
nuclear war over the 1962 cuban missile crisis 
gorbachev preaching new thinking in foreign affairs said 
during a visit to cuba in 1989 that he rejected castros support 
for communist revolutions in countries such as el salvador angola 
and nicaragua 
still the official reason given for the cutback in aid is 
economic 
we have given up the state monopoly on foreign trade given 
enterprises the right of access to the international market given 
up ideologicalridden approaches which used to lead to waste of 
resources in relations with some countries gorbachev told the 
parliament last week 
the huge russian republic with 90 percent of the countrys 
exportable energy is seeking more say over some foreign policy 
questions and could lead the way in asking hard questions about 
ties with cuba 
we dont want to interfere in the internal affairs of cuba 
cubans must decide for themselves said yevgeny kozholkhin 
chairman of the russian legislatures committee on foreign 
relations 
but as we come to any consideration about aid we should 
just consider what kind of regime we have before us 
at some point we must consider human rights he said 
a hint of anticuban sentiment in the national legislature 
emerged in october when legislator olzhas suleimenov took the 
floor and criticized cuba as a totalitarian state 
in november an expose in the reformist daily komsomolskaya 
pravda reported that castro has 32 houses a personal security 
force of 9700 and five children by his present wife that 
would shock many cubans who have been told only that castro was 
divorced 35 years ago 
the report prompted the communist party daily pravda to run a 
response by cubas ambassador to the soviet union jose ramon 
balaguer cabrera calling the report lies 
since the fall of hardline governments in east europe last 
year cubas favored status among soviet allies has come under 
bolder attack commentators have questioned the value of the 
kremlins commitment to a country they say has offered little in 
return 
how many more years is the soviet government going to take 
away the rations of povertystricken peasants in order to 
underwrite and maintain the inefficient militarized economy of 
this faroff overseas state asked a commentator in the labor 
newspaper rabochaya tribuna last month 
andrei kortunov a staff researcher at the soviet institute of 
the usa and canada has estimated that more than one quarter of 
the 12 billion annual soviet foreign aid budget in 1989 went to 
cuba 
vyacheslav krestyaninov an editor of latin america a soviet 
monthly said the new policy would shift the basis of cubansoviet 
relations from a political to economic footing 
but he said decades of soviet adoration of castro would not die 
so quickly 
i wouldnt call it a split krestyaninov said its like a 
new agreement in a family its still a family

states playing at cypress point and not being aware of the 
sensitivity of the issue that revolves around it monterrey

secretary david beckwith stating quayle was unaware of the 
controversy surrounding the cypress point golf course he has been 
assured the club does not discriminate and has never had a policy 
of discrimination 
however the statement said the vice president is unwilling 
to leave any impression that he condones any form of 
discrimination he has therefore canceled his round of golf 
today quayle is a member of the burning tree country club 
outside washington which has an allmale membership 
he was returning to his skiing vacation in colorado before 
returning to washington on saturday quayle will leave saturday 
night for a new years visit to the troops in the persian gulf

tournament his chief of staff bill kristol said in a telephone 
interview it proves hes not spending time reading the golf 
pages 
an official who answered the telephone at the clubs hotel 
where quayle was staying said the staff had been instructed not to 
try to contact quayles party

people get so profoundly moved that they do peculiar things 
smith was conditionally discharged by magistrate ronald bartle

would have to pay 950 
i met her in amsterdam about three months ago her name is

hafr albatin saudi arabia ap the front line arrayed 
against iraq is a polyglot arabislamic force whose role in the 
northern saudi desert may be merely symbolic 
as the united nations jan 15 deadline approaches for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait or face possible force its still not clear 
what part the arabs would play in a potentially bloody offensive 
more than 100000 saudis egyptians syrians vengeful kuwaitis 
and others have joined to confront iraqi leader saddam hussein a 
fellow arab since he invaded kuwait on aug 2 
forces from pakistan morocco bangladesh niger and senegal 
have planted their flags on saudi soil some contingents are little 
more than token forces 
behind them are about 350000 american british and french 
troops with the firepower needed to hammer the iraqis 
if peace doesnt arrive and if were ordered by our supreme 
commanders we can teach saddam a lesson hell never forget 
boasted lt gen khalid bin sultan the saudi prince who commands 
the 145000member arabislamic force 
those are big ifs 
the arab alliance is like an orchestra all the players have 
instruments but some play different notes not all of them will 
sound charge if the usled multinational force is ordered 
into kuwait 
the kuwaitis of course want their country back but they wont 
fight in iraq 
the saudis will fight with the united states and its allies if 
invited by kuwait the egyptians say they will do what the saudis 
do 
the syrians and others have said only that their role here is 
defensive and to stop aggression 
its clear that there are varying levels of commitment in 
terms of willingness to use offensive military action to achieve 
our objective defense secretary dick cheney acknowledged 
recently 
it is also uncertain what the arab response would be if saddam 
carried out his threat to launch a missile attack on israel it 
would be difficult for the syrians and the saudis to fight saddam 
if he gets into a shootout with the arabs main enemy 
the arab states who have the most at stake the ones that 
really count are the saudis and the egyptians cheney noted 
the saudis have a 75000member army and air force the 
egyptians have pledged 40000 troops including two armored 
divisions 
the egyptians and syrians who have sent an armored division 
with their 20000member contingent bring combat experience to the 
saudi desert both have fought the israelis and the syrians have 
been in action in lebanon 
the usequipped egyptians also trained with american troops in 
a 1988 exercise 
but some analysts say the biggest contribution of the 
arabislamic force is is symbolic arabs are standing up to saddam 
muting criticism of having western forces in a land that houses 
islams holiest shrines 
the arab alliance is a useful show of political solidarity 
said ian kemp a military analyst with janes defense weekly 
but if it comes to an offensive operation i dont think 
theyll play anything but a marginal role the americans and the 
british will play the lead 
some expect a force of kuwaitis and saudis to spearhead the 
usbritish effort as a political gesture 
this will allow the arabislamic forces to say they were the 
ones who liberated kuwait city said tony banks political editor 
for janes 
but when it comes to the real thing the americans and the 
british will bear the brunt of it 
by agreement no offensive can be launched from saudi soil 
without the consent of king fahd and president bush 
in the defensive configuration prince khalid shares command of 
the 28nation force with us gen h norman schwarzkopf 
if theres any blood shed i can assure you saudi forces will 
be the first to spill it the saudi prince stressed recently 
if anyone touches my land you will see vicious soldiers who will 
do their job well 
the saudi army untested in combat lives well television 
antennas sprout from their tents rugs cover the sand and wool 
blankets adorn their bunks 
egyptian commandos in contrast eat raw rats to prove they can 
live in the desert syrians drill with sovietmade t60 tanks 
us special forces train with many of the arab forces they 
teach techniques such as mineclearing setting up fire zones and 
calling in air strikes 
among the arab forces are the remnants of kuwaits shattered 
army they work with their salvaged tanks and practice karate a 
dubious asset against iraqi armor and chemical weapons 
they call themselves the martyr brigade and they talk tough 
we ask to be in the front we must have revenge said a tank 
commander who gave his name only as ali because his family is still 
in kuwait 
by dying ill feel im doing something

a trolley car was struck by another trolley this 
morning as it unloaded commuters in a station on the edge of boston 
common injuring 31 people at least one critically officials 
said 
i just screamed out everybody hang on and get down were 
going to hit said steve depaulo a passenger on the moving 
train it just seemed like seconds later we smashed into the 
trolley in front of us people just went flying everywhere he 
said he thought his train was moving rather fast as it entered the 
station 
the collision between two outbound green line trains occurred at 
around 645 am at underground arlington station the green line 
is one of four subway lines operated by massachusetts bay 
transportation authority 
the accident came less than 2 weeks after more than 250 people 
were injured at nearby back bay station when an amtrak train struck 
a commuter train it also occurred about 2 hours before a new york 
city subway fire killed a passenger and injured at least 100 from 
smoke inhalation 
john fasana of emergency medical services put the number of 
injured in the boston accident at least 31 describing the injuries 
as typical injuries expected from a lowimpact collision 
two of them suffered what i would consider to be serious 
injuries he said the rest of them were walking woundedtype 
injuries 
ernest jones a passenger on the stationary trolley said one 
minute he was reading his newspaper the next they were hit and he 
saw at least four people bleeding from head injuries 
i was looking at the lady across from me next thing i knew 
the lights went out and she was on the floor he said i saw 
one man in the back on the floor on his back crying obviously in 
agony hurt 
transit authority officials said each of the onecar trains was 
carrying about 40 people with the capacity for 60 they said 
ridership was light because of the holidays this week after the 
accident riders were bused between stations on each side of the 
accident site 
gov michael s dukakis made the green line wellknown during 
the 1988 presidential campaign because he commuted on the line from 
his home in brookline to the massachusetts statehouse 
at the time of the accident the area was experiencing its first 
snowstorm of the season but officials said they doubted that 
weather played a role in the underground collision 
that will be part of the investigation but it does not appear 
to be weather related said nancy sterling gleason a transit 
authority spokeswoman 
many of the injured were carried from the station on stretchers 
one person was admitted and listed in critical condition at the 
new england medical center said cheryl paris a hospital 
spokeswoman other hospitals had not determined whether any of the 
injured they were treating would have to be admitted 
mayor raymond flynn who was on the scene shortly after the 
collision said he wasnt ready to believe reports of another rail 
crash so soon after the back bay collision which remains under 
investigation 
you think its just some sort of joke at first that there was 
another train accident flynn said but we arrived here and saw 
the situation 
thomas glynn transit authority general manager said despite 
the fact that there have been two rail crashes in less than three 
weeks i think in the end people are going to realize that 
overall our record is good 
glynn said operators of both trains were sent for drug and 
alcohol tests

thousands of iraqis are being trained to 
conduct attacks against usled forces if war breaks out and 
asian military analysts said friday some were being prepared for 
possible suicide missions 
in another defense move iraqi media reported friday that 
paramilitary militias in the kurdish region have been reactivated 
to shore up the countrys northern border with turkey 
the asian military analysts speaking in baghdad on condition of 
anonymity said iraq has been training army commandos and 
volunteers from the popular army for special operations against the 
400000strong allied forces in saudi arabia 
the analysts said the training includes preparations for 
possible sea and airborne missions that they characterized as 
suicidal 
a day earlier a senior iraqi baath party official was quoted as 
saying that thousands of volunteers had completed courses at a 
military camp in najaf iraq he said they receieved special 
training on weapons and commando tactics 
abdulrahim abdulqadder told iraqs governmentrun 
aljouhouriya newspaper that since the persian gulf crisis began in 
august 138700 volunteers have been trained in special operations 
at the camp 90 miles south of baghdad 
the najaf camp is ideal in training combatants who symbolize 
heroism and discipline he told the newspaper 
the asian analysts said the volunteers were probably receiving 
training in commando missions to be launched behind the lines of 
the multinational forces 
more than half of iraqs 1 millionstrong army is deployed in 
southern part of the country and in kuwait the un security 
council has said iraq must withdraw from kuwait by jan 15 or face 
possible attack by usled forces 
the popular army was set up by the ruling arab baath socialist 
party as an ideological counterweight to the iraqi army officials 
in baghdad say it numbers 8 million but diplomatic sources place 
its strength at closer to 850000 and say the soliders are mostly 
poor combatants 
meanwhile iraqi interior minister samir mouhamad abdulwahab 
urged local chieftans in the kurdish region to take part in plans 
to confront the challenges imposed on iraq news reports from 
baghdad said friday 
the chieftains were appointed as commanders of the 
progovernment paramilitary forces formed during the 198088 war 
with iran to combat the kurdish rebellion in northern iraq 
the units known as national defense brigades were defunct 
after the ceasefire went into effect in the iraniraq war and the 
government had crushed the kurdish rebellion 
the analysts said the reactivation of the militia of about 
300000 men was intended to beef up iraqs defenses against turkey 
iraqs northern neighbor 
iraqi president saddam hussein last week accused turkey of 
deploying troops and warplanes on the border and said iraq had to 
increase its military strength in the area to counter the buildup

for an afternoon childrens show about a vacation gone wrong will 
travel to los angeles next month to sign a contract with steven 
spielberg

200page story book for an episode of the show tiny toon 
adventures it is produced by spielberg whose movies include 
jaws close encounters of the third kind raiders of the 
lost ark and et 
it was a miracle our idea was ever accepted said miss 
crosby they told us the studio usually returns unsolicited 
material without even opening it 
studio officials said someone at warner bros which syndicates 
the show mistakenly opened the manuscript package liked it and 
passed it on the manuscript passed from desk to important desk 
impressing all readers until it arrived in front of spielberg 
he liked what he saw 
warner bros lawyers were said to have advised against pursuing 
the script they said it would create a precedent and that the 
studio would be swamped with scripts from school children 
but steven wanted it and you dont say no to steven 
spielberg said jean maccurdy vice president and general manager 
of warner bros animation 
spielberg sent ms maccurdy and barbara brogliatti senior vice 
president of publicity and promotion to waynesboro on dec 13 to 
meet with the students and make an offer 
they proposed paying us 250 for the episode which we will 
split three ways and to fly us and our parents to los angeles for 
four days miss carter said 
the girls and their parents leave jan 18 for los angeles while 
there they will tour universal studios magic mountain warner 
bros studios and attend a news conference and story meeting with 
spielberg 
miss carter said the idea for the story book a series of 
drawings and captions detailing the action of an episode came to 
her at school one day she began drawing characters and laying out 
a story line the story eventually was titled buster and babs go 
hawaiian 
the characters buster and babs take a free hawaiian vacation 
which turns out to be a nightmare of lost luggage inoperable 
rental cars bad hotels and a cruise that ends up in a shipwreck 
the two other girls contributed story ideas and artwork the 
episode is expected to air next fall on tiny toons adventures 
which is seen on the fox network

an electrical fire spread choking smoke through 
a subway tunnel today killing a commuter and injuring more than 
140 officials said terrified passengers screamed and prayed out 
loud 
transit authority spokeswoman caren gardner said the death 
occurred after a weatherrelated fire broke out on the electrified 
third rail in the subway tunnel underneath downtown brooklyn 
we really thought we were gone that we wouldnt see new 
years said gertrude hoyte a 51yearold brooklyn resident who 
was on her way to work in manhattan 
she described how smoke filled the subway cars causing people 
to panic and several to vomit into their newspapers 
people were screaming were going to die said passenger 
dana sullivan 28 of west islip others were praying out loud she 
said 
the accident occurred about 910 am in the tunnel used by the 
no 2 and no 3 subway lines going through downtown brooklyn and 
then under the east river toward manhattan 
authorities said 145 people were injured all apparently from 
smoke inhalation so many were taken to hospitals 132 in all 
that city buses had to be used 
the identity of the dead man described as a subway rider was 
not released 
medical staff at long island college hospital managed to revive 
a woman whom authorities at the scene had believed to be dead but 
her condition remained grave hospital officials said 
the prognosis does not look favorable for her dr neil 
flomenbaum chairman of emergency medicine at the hospital said 
this afternoon 
it was one of two serious transit accidents this morning in 
boston more than 30 people were injured when a trolley car slammed 
into the rear of a stopped car in an underground station near 
boston common 
authorities in new york estimated that there were 300 to 400 
people aboard the train most severely affected by the smoke 
naomi smallswatson 23 of brooklyn said she was sitting in the 
first car of the train when she heard a popping noise and then a 
whoosh 
then there was another big boom and people started 
panicking she said 
at that point the subway tunnel began filling with smoke so 
much that passengers could not see anything outside the train she 
said 
a lot of people passed out she said 
witnesses said some passengers considered trying to open train 
doors but were convinced by fellow passengers that it would only 
worsen the smoke eventually the train was backed up to a station 
that was farther away from the fire and the passengers were able to 
leave the train 
the fire on the third rail apparently occurred when snow from 
streets above leaked into the subway system and onto wires on the 
tracks near the clark street station the last station in brooklyn 
before the train goes under the river gardner said she said its 
possible the snow grounded some heavyduty electrical cables 
against the third rail 
some 30 firefighting units responded in manhattan and brooklyn 
said department spokesman joe mcgee he said the smoke condition 
was heavier on the brooklyn side 
by late morning dozens of people were being treated or 
comforted in the lobbies of downtown brooklyn buildings some 
passengers sat wearily in the lobby of a crosslands bank as 
employees gave them cups of water others received oxygen from 
emergency personnel

a convicted cocaine dealer cheated 
undercover police in a drug deal and ended up with a lighter 
prison sentence 
ramon leon of grand rapids would have faced a mandatory 20 years 
in prison if he sold 8 ounces of cocaine to the police but the 
officers later discovered they bought only 78 ounces 
leon 28 was sentenced thursday to 13 to 20 years 
he shorted us kent county assistant prosecutor ellwyn 
bloemers said thats not unusual to have that happen to us when 
we buy 2 ounces it should be 56 grams but we come back with 49 
frequently hes very slick hes very polished 
bloemers said that on nov 22 1989 an officer weighed the 
eight cocainefilled bags on a scale kept in his cars trunk but 
may not have accounted for the weight of the bags police paid 
6800 for the drugs 
bloemers said he believes leon intentionally held back knowing 
an 8ounce deal could mean a 20year term 
state law says a dealer convicted of selling 225 grams or more 
of cocaine faces at least 20 years in prison dealers convicted of 
selling 50 to 224 grams face at least 10 years 
the only reason youre not covered by the 20year minimum term 
is that you cheated the officer in that transaction circuit 
judge donald johnston told leon before sentencing

the state broadcasting committee has canceled two 
episodes of one of the soviet unions most popular television 
programs because it disapproves of its political coverage the 
shows host said friday 
the episodes of vzglyad english for viewpoint were to 
include stories about outgoing foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze including a march interview in which he said he 
considered quitting to protest shootings by soviet troops in his 
native georgia said the host alexander lyubimov 
shevardnadze resigned on dec 21 saying he feared hardline 
communist force were pushing the soviet leadership into a 
dictatorship 
program officials said the cancellation was clearly politically 
motivated and that it indicated a return to state censorship 
the episodes were to have been broadcast friday night and jan 
4 on soviet tvs main channel said lyubimov who is also a 
lawmaker in the russian republics legislature 
he said that gostelradio the state committee for television and 
radio told us they dont like political issues broadcast on 
channel 1 and said the programs should be withheld until the 
situation is more clear 
he said gostelradios new chairman lawmaker leonid kravchenko 
told him that channel 1 should be a presidential channel serving 
the president and his policies his politics 
andrei shipilov head of the youth office at central television 
said the episodes were canceled for political reasons 
but lyubimov said vzglyad could not ignore shevardnadzes 
resignation and warning or the congress of peoples deputies vote 
to strengthen president mikhail s gorbachevs powers 
he said that when the weekly live news and entertainment program 
began in 1987 it was one of the first that broke the barriers of 
censorship on soviet tv 
we are worried about the coincidence between this event and 
the recent resignations of supporters of the liberal cause on 
gorbachevs team and the dramatic events at the congress of 
peoples deputies he said 
so far gorbachevs team comprises old players and we can 
hardly express even cautious optimism in regard to our future 
i think that this cancellation is another piece of gorbachev 
taking over 
lyubimov said friday nights program was scheduled to include 
interviews with shevardnadzes aides discussing his resignation 
vice president gennady i yanayev a long time communist party 
bureaucrat whose confirmation by the legislature thursday dismayed 
leading reformers had also been invited to appear he said 
the jan 4 broadcast was to include a 75minute documentary on 
shevardnadze videotaped by a crew who accompanied the foreign 
minister on an eightnation african tour in march lyubimov said 
the documentary included a very frank interview in which 
shevardnadze said he considered resigning over the bloody april 
1989 clash in tblisi georgia soviet troops shot and killed 19 
proindependence demonstrators 
the weekly vzglyad program includes a game show a 
historical section and american rock music in addition to the news 
segment lyubimov said the other segments would be broadcast as 
usual 
earlier this year the sunday night news program seven days 
was canceled after its popular host made remarks critical of the 
government 
two weeks ago authors television a group of late night 
news and commentary programs was also pulled off the air although 
it has not formally been canceled 
kravchenko former directorgeneral of the official tass news 
agency was appointed head of gostelradio last month as part of a 
shakeup of the state television monopoly 
the reorganization replaced the one central television station 
with four separate channels each was supposed to have creative and 
commercial independence 
the government newspaper izvestia said at the time channel 1 
would continue to carry the countrys principal news programs and 
remain an outlet for government information and cultural 
programming 
earlier this year the supreme soviet passed a new law on 
freedom of the press giving legal backbone to gorbachevs policy 
of glasnost or greater openness it also ended censorship except 
on matters of state security

recent storms through the pacific northwest are 
easing four years of drought in washington and oregon 
the snowy cold weather that barreled into the western united 
states a week before christmas has built up a substantial snow base 
in the cascade mountains that could fill reservoirs when it melts 
this spring agriculture officials said 
the yakima river basin was just barely getting by on 
irrigation water in the past few years said william weller a 
spokanebased water supply specialist for the us department of 
agriculture it appears this year they will be in real good 
shape 
but the weather has done little to alleviate californias 
equally long drought 
mostly we had frost said emil loe with the marketing 
division of the california department of food and agriculture if 
it did anything it made things worse because frost dries 
everything out a lot there really was no measurable impact on the 
drought from last weeks weather here 
temperatures plunging into the teens and 20s have wiped out 80 
percent of californias navel orange crop for a loss of nearly 288 
million in farming revenues the department reported navel oranges 
make up about half of the states total orange crop 
valencia oranges may also be affected but agricultural 
officials will not know the extent of damage until harvesting 
begins in march 
people in the industry say theyve never seen anything like 
this said tom mcnair agricultural statistician for the 
california agricultural statistics service in future years 
freezes will be compared to this one they will say its not as 
bad as 1990 
the state avocado producers report a loss of 20 percent of their 
crop and in imperial county on the mexico border cold weather 
will leave the lettuce celery broccoli and cauliflower crops a 
little brown around the edges but edible agricultural officials 
said 
the melting snow has helped restock the northwests 
muchdepleted water supply but barry norris engineer for the 
oregon water resources department said the state has yet to 
recover fully from its dry spell 
we need a good wet january and february too norris said 
we need a couple of better than average years to fill the 
reservoirs get the soil moisture back in good shape and get our 
river levels back up weve gone through a dry cycle 
in washington state things started to improve in november as 
days of rain pushed more than a dozen rivers past flood stage and 
forced thousands to flee their homes 
the winter precipitation is welcome as long as it stays in the 
highlands agricultural officials said 
its good news if we can get it to stay up there in the 
mountains and melt off slowly for summer use weller said but 
it was bad news for western washington when we had warm rains come 
on snow and it melted into floods in november

the great pigeon dropping debate here has 
been resolved with a decision to pay 67000 to remove the 
offending detritus from town buildings a solution that an opponent 
says is for the birds 
i think its crazy said david keenan who showed up for one 
of the many meetings on the subject attired in a pigeonbuster 
mock space suit 
removal of the waste from town hall and a school stirred 
passionate debate with keenans faction decrying the prospect of 
spending town money to do a job they said could be handled by 
volunteers 
tshirts were printed up with silhouettes of the ubiquitous 
pigeons surrounded by the familiar red circle with a diagonal slash 
drawn through it 
the town had set aside 125000 for the job but officials 
received bids lower than that the lowest bid failed to meet state 
specifications so the 66836 contract is going to the 
secondlowest bidder venture asbestos abatement of salem nh 
according to laurie benoit administratative assistant to the town 
manager 
everything is in place and we should have a signed contract by 
the end of next week she said friday 
its been a good process theres been a lot of public input 
and its been a good learning experience 
but keenan a real estate agent contractor and candidate for 
position of selectman was less sanguine 
he noted that amherst a small town that mixes yankee heritage 
with the intellectual circles from two private colleges and the 
state university is holding a special meeting to debate a 
resolution urging bush not to go to war in the persian gulf 
thats amherst said keenan one of the few republicans in 
town it cant clean up its own pigeon poop but were going to 
have a special town meeting to tell congress what to do 
the town of about 34000 has voted to oppose every war since 
1812 and suggested banning the nuclear bomb during the cold war it 
voted to declare the town a nuclearfree zone and to ban officials 
from investing town funds in companies doing business in south 
africa or companies that make nuclear weapons 
in the pigeon debate benoit said the volunteer approach 
suggested by keenan and fellow businessmen was impractical because 
it raised too many insurance and liability problems and ran afoul 
of state bidding laws 
there was no way we tried she said 
keenan said he still believes in the volunteer approach 
we would rather do things like that than keep raising our 
taxes he said

spurred by iraqi aggression persian gulf 
arab leaders say theyre ready to forge a new regional security 
structure with iran a country that they feared for years 
but some observers are skeptical that iran and its neighbors 
will ever overcome mutual suspicions and engage in meaningful 
cooperation to defend the oilrich region 
the gulf cooperation council saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates bahrain oman qatar and kuwait was formed in 1981 
primarily to counter the threat posed by irans islamic revolution 
and its stated aim of toppling the conservative gulf monarchies 
but iranian president hashemi rafsanjani began a process of 
rapprochement with the gulf states following the death of irans 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in june 1989 
saddam husseins aug 2 seizure of kuwait accelerated that 
process rafsanjanis foreign minister ali akbar velayati has 
been courting irans jittery neighbors since then 
saddams actions proved how vulnerable the gulf states were and 
underlined their dependence on the americans despite massive 
spending on hightech weaponry 
the leaders of the gcc states made clear during a fourday 
summit in doha that ended last tuesday that they now believe iran 
has to be part of longterm defense arrangements in the strategic 
region 
a summit communique expressed interest in developing special 
relations with tehran and urged it to settle differences with gcc 
states seriously and realistically 
kuwaits minister of state for foreign affairs sheik nasser 
mohammed alsabah stressed during a recent visit to tehran 
without the powerful presence of iran no regional security is 
possible or practical 
sheik nassers statement reflected how the political map of the 
region has been turned upside down by the invasion of kuwait 
producing alignments that only a couple of years ago would have 
been unthinkable 
iranianbacked terrorists for years waged a bombing campaign in 
kuwait and tried to assassinate the emir sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah in 1985 
the iranians plotted in 1981 to topple bahrains ruling family 
saudi arabia was a target for iranian subversion where it hurt 
most the annual hajj to mecca riyadh severed relations with 
tehran in april 1988 
most of the gcc states sided with iraq during the 198088 war 
with iran kuwait and saudi arabia gave an estimated 34 billion 
dollars to baghdad iran attacked their ships in retaliation 
since the 1988 ceasefire rafsanjani has tried to end irans 
isolation and rebuild bridges with his neighbors 
the indications are that saudi arabia and iran could soon 
restore relations a necessary step before the two biggest gulf 
states can join forces in a new security structure 
thats unlikely to happen until kuwait has been liberated and 
saddam humbled 
there will be other obstacles to overcome 
iran is likely to demand a preeminent position in any alliance 
that emerges something the gulf arabs are not expected to accept 
without argument 
diplomats said iran stands to gain the most from an alliance and 
cautioned that tehran was not expected to abandon its aim of 
regional domination 
iran has opposed the invasion of kuwait but it has also 
condemned the western military force brought into the gulf by the 
saudis 
the americans say they want to see a new security structure in 
the region which sits on twothirds of the worlds oil reserves 
saudi and other arab officials say that will involve sizeable 
us forces staying on for some time a factor likely to antagonize 
the iranians and other moslem fundamentalists 
irans radicals oppose any rapprochement with saudi arabia 
rafsanjani has largely outflanked them in a postkhomeini power 
struggle but they remain a thorn in his side 
tehrans radical kayhan daily on friday dismissed a regional 
defense accord as a mirage and warned that iran would be the 
only loser 
equals 
editors note aly mahmoud chief of the aps bahrain bureau 
has covered persian gulf affairs for more than a decade

pehlad singh a farmer in this small 
village in northern india is fighting a battle against an 
amusement park 
seven centuries ago singhs ancestors fought the moslem emperor 
balban when he tried and eventually succeeded to take over 
their area 
now singh and his fellow villagers want to stop roller coasters 
and lagoons from being built on their ancestral lands 
they say the park which is popularly called disneyland but 
has no connection with the real one in california will destroy 
their source of livelihood and ruin their culture 
the government wants to take our land and drive us out 
singh said we have warned them that rivers of blood will flow if 
they touch our land 
the confrontation began early this year when the government of 
the northern state of haryana announced plans to build indias 
first big amusement park on 28000 acres of land inhabited and 
farmed by 150000 people in 28 villages the government said the 
park would cost an estimated 555 million 
but the villagers mostly small farmers and cattle grazers said 
the government was trying to uproot them 
chief minister om prakash chautala haryanas highest elected 
official pushed the project through despite the peoples 
resistance 
even before disneyland chautalas name was synonymous with 
dynastic rule and corruption for many people 
villagers accused chautala of using the amusement park to push 
up land prices they said chautala and his friends had bought a lot 
of the surrounding land which would appreciate enormously once the 
amusement park was built 
haryanas tourism minister siri krishan hooda dismissed all 
these allegations as baseless 
the peoples fears were aggravated further last month when 
chautalas father devi lal became indias deputy prime minister 
and tourism minister 
chautala succeeded his father as haryanas chief minister last 
winter but was forced out of office by political infighting at the 
national level and the killings of at least 12 people when he ran 
for the state legislature but his father retains the political 
clout to expedite the disneyland project 
in december devi lal met the villagers and told them he would 
give the goahed for the project prime minister chandra shekhar 
who accompanied devi lal said he supported the project and wanted 
to see it through 
this is all nonsense said khem chand a 60yearold retired 
soldier who lives in one of the villages that would be supplanted 
by the amusement park instead of providing us education and 
basic health care the government is offering us amusement 
like many towns none of the 28 villages in this area 25 miles 
southwest of new delhi has sufficient drinking water the nearest 
hospital is several miles away and is usually filled to capacity 
the government is legally right but morally wrong said 
amrit singh a village headman they say they have no money to 
spare for village development but have enough for this useless 
project 
singhs lament and that of many others strikes at the heart 
of indias most pressing problem how to develop an overpopulated 
country of 880 million plagued by illiteracy and poverty without 
alienating the people 
the amusement park is not a need of the people said prem 
chowdhry a historian and a native of haryana its an example of 
development that leaves people out 
the haryana government doesnt agree it says it will pay the 
villagers 5555 an acre for their land and will employ them in the 
amusement park 
but the money offered by the government is several times lower 
than the market price india has a huge black market economy that 
pushes up the price of land enormously if the villagers sold their 
land to businessmen they could get between 27777 and 55555 an 
acre 
but the state government has frozen all land sales in the 
villages 
the villagers are also wary of the governments guarantee of 
employment they say the government seldom employs local people in 
tourist resorts two years ago the government held out a similar 
promise when it built a motel in damdama it hired four villagers 
but fired them within a week 
many villagers say they will not be able to put the money the 
government gives them to good use 
we have been farmers for generations and have never handled 
large sums of money said dhoom mahase a 42yearold farmer 
too much money will only destroy us

lithuanias secessionist parliament agreed friday 
to drop conditions on negotiations with the kremlin over lithuanian 
independence and called for a new round of talks the baltic 
government said 
the vote by the lithuanian supreme council was intended to 
restart talks with soviet officials that were bogged down over 
lithuanias demand for signing of a protocol on the starting 
goals and conditions of negotiations 
soviet officials had refused during preliminary talks to sign 
the protocol insisting the preliminary talks themselves 
represented negotiations 
the sides agreed last june to start negotiations after soviet 
officials said they would lift an economic embargo if lithuania 
suspended its march declaration of independence for 100 days 
counting toward the deadline would begin with the start of 
negotiations 
the parliament voted friday to allow the state delegation 
to begin negotiations with the ussr without a previously 
determined negotiations commencement protocol but without 
violating the sovereignty of the lithuania state according to 
lithuanian statement sent by telex 
lithuania president vytautas landsbergis in a speech to the 
parliament said he was ready to soften the demand for a 
protocol whose signing the lithuanian side had considered necessary 
for the start of negotiations the prolithuanian news agency 
baltfax reported 
the statement gave no date for the start of talks there was no 
immediate reaction from the kremlin 
during the preliminary talks in moscow last fall the soviet 
delegation was led by prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who 
suffered a heart attack last week it was unclear who would lead 
the soviet side in his place

watch your language some 10000 academics 
representing a veritable whos who of english and language 
professors were in town friday 
the president of the modern language association says the 
groups annual convention is bent on exploring the newest of 
methods and the oldest of texts 
i think this association really represents a great commitment 
to diversity of inquiry and freedom of thought said catharine 
stimpson president of the 32000member organization 
stimpson said much debate in academic circles today focuses on 
the trend on college campuses to teach and review literature beyond 
the traditional scope of western civilization new perspectives 
include those of minority feminist thirdworld and homosexual 
authors 
the trend has been criticized for forcing students into 
politically correct interpretations of written works and moving 
away from the study of classics 
but the purpose of studying literature is to learn about 
cultural values and that study shouldnt be limited to old methods 
and established texts said stimpson an english professor at 
rutgers university in new jersey 
there are lots of different perspectives some are richer than 
others and some are more comprehensive than others stimpson 
said historically you can look back at literature to see the way 
its shaped cultures ideas of what is beautiful what is true 
many professors and graduate students welcomed the move toward 
exploring more diverse literature some criticized more traditional 
presentations for giving the impression that authors must be white 
male european and dead to be worth studying 
these newer texts i think will show students that literature 
is still an openended enterprise said robert hamner a 
professor at hardinsimmons university in abilene texas a 
writer doesnt have to be dead to deal with serious issues 
hamner who specializes in caribbean literature has been 
teaching since 1968 he said while the movement toward diversity 
isnt new its finally gaining attention 
some students find it exciting theyre looking for something 
new and interesting hamner said i tell them to remember that 
these writers are not being touted because theyre minority 
artists they are just good authors 
but introducing a more diverse selection of literature isnt 
just a matter of choosing the authors and telling students to start 
reading said susan k harris who teaches at queens college city 
university of new york 
philosophically im all for it said harris who specializes 
in american literature and 19th century women authors but on a 
practical level im still struggling 
harris said professors encounter difficulty drawing critical and 
thematic connections between the newer texts and the classics 
i have found ways to talk about the new literature in artistic 
terms she said people critical of the new approach often feel 
its all come down to the fact that weve thrown out art in favor 
of diversity

the conservative government announced 
friday it intends to pardon nearly all the imprisoned leaders of 
the 196774 rightwing dictatorship 
the announcement to free seven of the eight former military 
leaders outraged socialists communists and other leftists 
thousands of whom were jailed or exiled during the dictatorship 
many politicians and other citizens were tortured 
andreas papandreou whose socialist government ruled from 1981 
to 1989 denounced the decision as an insult to those that fought 
and died for democracy in our country 
prime minister constantine mitsotakis proposed the pardon for 
humanitarian reasons after meeting with president constantine 
caramanlis justice minister athanassios kanellopoulos said the 
ministrys pardons committee will discuss it monday and approval 
was expected 
according to practice a pardon is proposed by the government 
and approved by the committee clearing the way for a presidential 
decree 
eight members of the junta are serving prison terms ranging from 
20 years to life imprisonment for their involvement in the military 
coup since their sentencing by a special court in 1975 they have 
refused to apply for pardons 
the only junta member left out of the proposed pardon was 
dimitris ioannides who engineered a failed 1974 coup in nearby 
cyprus a disaster that led to the partition of the mediterranean 
island and greeces return to civilian rule 
those serving life sentences include former col george 
papadopoulos 71 who led the april 1967 army coup in greece his 
brother constantine 69 and ioannides 67 a former brigadier who 
in turn overthrew papadopoulos they were originally sentenced to 
death for high treason 
the rest of those jailed are former military officers convicted 
of torture 
the military took over the government in 1967 following a period 
of political instability and papadopolous vowed at the time 
there is no possibility of democracy as practiced in the past 
ever returning to greece 
the junta was condemned in the west as clumsy and authoritarian 
its political opponents were tortured by the military police and 
exiled by the thousands to barren greek islands 
the united states distanced itself from the junta and 
temporarily banned arms sales to greece but thenvice president 
spiro agnew went to greece in 1971 in a visit seen a tacit approval 
of the regime 
the junta relinquished power after a student uprising in 
november 1973 and ioannides failed 1974 coup in cyprus aimed at 
uniting the island with greece 
the shortlived coup resulted in turkey invading the island

president mikhail s gorbachev won victory after 
victory at the congress of peoples deputies session that ended 
this week but he still may have come out a loser 
the 59yearold soviet president gained new constitutional 
powers streamlined the executive branch of government and pushed 
reluctant lawmakers into confirming his nominee for the new job of 
vice president 
but he came no closer to solving the key question of how to hold 
the 15 republics together a problem that burst onto the surface 
again thursday the final day of the congress in an angry rift 
with the russian federation over the national budget 
earlier in the 10day session foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadzes sudden resignation and dramatic warning that the 
country was moving toward dictatorship caused international concern 
over the fragility of gorbachevs democratic reforms 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkovs heart attack deprived gorbachev 
of a second faithful political ally at least temporarily 
and in choosing communist party apparatchik gennady i yanayev 
as vice president gorbachev missed an opportunity to pick a 
betterknown figure who might have stopped his slide in public 
opinion polls 
the more the president surrounds himself with littleknown 
politicians the lower his own rating will be reformist lawmaker 
and leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak told reporters 
the 2250member congress which usually meets twice a year is 
the countrys highest legislative body and must approve all 
constitutional amendments 
after a carefully orchestrated debate chairman anatoly 
lukyanov shut off the microphones of dissenters and refused to 
allow votes on their motions the lawmakers overwhelmingly 
approved gorbachevs reorganization of the executive branch 
gorbachev asked for and got a vertical line of authority 
from the presidency through the new cabinet of ministers to 
government officials at the regional city and village level 
in the past decisions by the ministries could be overturned by 
the supreme soviet the 542member standing legislature elected by 
the congress now the ministries answer directly to the president 
the streamlining coupled with the authority previously granted 
to issue presidential decrees gives gorbachev strong weapons to 
put down ethnic disputes enforce economic changes and impose other 
orders 
his only defeat was a vote against creating a supreme state 
inspectorate a new law enforcement agency to ensure compliance 
with his decrees but a presidential aide said gorbachev believes 
he can still establish the inspectorate by decree 
with his dual position as leader of the communist party and head 
of the restructured government the only thing now standing between 
gorbachev and authoritarian rule may be his personal commitment to 
democracy 
fear of that commitment wavering under pressure from hardliners 
appears to have been behind shevardnadzes warning 
my guess is that what he worried about was not so much a 
conscious effort that were going to establish a dictatorship 
but a slide into the use of authoritarian methods a western 
diplomat in moscow said friday 
for example if force is used in some of the republics now 
and that brings a reaction of the people you could get an 
escalating situation and a growing bloodbath 
short of using force it is unclear how much obedience gorbachev 
can expect from the republics no matter what legal authority he 
might have 
that uncertainty was underlined on the final day of the congress 
when the president demanded that lawmakers in russia the largest 
of the 15 republics reverse their stance on the national budget 
russias parliament recently asserted control over the lions 
share of taxes and other government revenues raised on its 
territory gorbachev told the congress that russian lawmakers had 
voted to cut the republics contribution to the 1991 national 
budget by about 80 percent 
as though giving a stern lesson to a lazy pupil gorbachev 
ticked off some major items in the national budget education 
health care scientific research defense and subsidies for heavy 
industry 
what are we supposed to do disband our military entirely and 
stop all fundamental science he said 
gorbachev said he was now unable to conclude a temporary 
agreement to maintain economic ties between the republics pending 
the completion of a new union treaty the fundamental document that 
formed the country in 1922 
if other republics follow russias suit he warned the result 
could be the collapse not only of the economy but of the 
union 
after gorbachevs impassioned speech the response from russian 
lawmakers was an unsettling silence 
the republics president boris n yeltsin was on a trip to the 
yakutsk region of siberia its parliament had recessed for the new 
years holiday 
when the russian lawmakers convene next month gorbachev will 
face a severe test of his moral and political authority and his 
new constitutional powers are unlikely to be much help 
equals

italys stateowned television decided friday not to 
air an interview with saddam hussein saying the broadcast might 
disturb the efforts for a peaceful solution to the persian gulf 
crisis 
the decision to squelch the broadcast indefinitely drew sharp 
protest from reporters the journalist who conducted the interview 
bruno vespa threatened to resign 
the directorgeneral of rai television gianni pasquarelli 
announced the move in a letter to vespa the highly regarded 
director of the nightly tg1 news broadcast 
italy is president of the european community and we must 
avoid in a moment of extreme delicacy any act that could 
contribute to disturb the efforts that are being made to find a 
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis said the letter read on 
the evening broadcast 
it did not say how the interview might have affected peace 
efforts 
vespa told viewers of friday nights tg1 program that he 
disagreed with the decision i expressed to the directorgeneral 
my surprise and my complete dissent he said 
a rai spokesman said he did not know if the italian government 
had asked the network to stop the broadcast the government funds 
rai and political parties have broad influence in its operation 
the iraqi leader has given numerous interviews to western 
television stations since his country invaded kuwait on aug 2 
vespa said that during the 1hour 40minute interview conducted 
several days ago saddam had harshly criticized the united states 
and seemed to rule out negotiations 
he added that saddam had implicitly admitted he would use 
chemical weapons in a war 
the editorial committee of the rai said it supported vespa in 
the dispute 
the invitation by pasquarelli to not transmit the interview 
appears like an act of selfcensorship that the editorial staff of 
tg1 can not consider acceptible in any way the committee said 
in a statement 
pasquarelli who belongs to the dominant christian democrat 
party became directorgeneral of rai earlier this year after 
serving as managing director of the state highway corporation he 
was previously a television journalist 
the christian democrats control appointments at rai1 the 
channel that broadcasts vespas program 
the secondbiggest party in the government the socialists have 
strong influence at rai2 another stateowned channel 
the communists italys biggest opposition party condemned the 
decision not to show the interview 
we have denounced for some time the new climate of censorial 
secrecy that is predominant at the rai said walter veltroni the 
partys spokesman

north carolina filed a lawsuit friday 
seeking 55 million from the operator of a dredge that broke loose 
from moorings and knocked out the only road link to hatteras 
island 
north american trailing co was negligent in the oct 26 
accident because the dredges captain failed to drop a second 
anchor during a storm the lawsuit said 
the accident stranded residents and tourists on the island the 
us district court suit filed in norfolk va seeks money to 
repair a damaged 370foot section of the herbert c bonner bridge 
we think they were negligent in making their decision to 
anchor where they did in light of weather forecasts said grayson 
kelly a spokesman for the state attorney generals office 
we think they were negligent in being unable to navigate under 
the bridge without striking the bridge which they were required to 
do under contract by the corps of engineers he said 
the us coast guard ruled dec 18 that the dredge captain 
william cliett may have been negligent in not dropping a second 
anchor to help keep the craft from slamming into the bridge 
there was no answer friday to repeated telephone calls to north 
american trailings offices 
the cost of repairing the bridge initially was estimated at 
about 3 million but was raised to 55 million kelly said the 
amount could go up again he said 
in testimony before the marine safety office in norfolk last 
month cliett said the vessel was anchored in its usual place 
before the accident he said weather conditions well beyond the 
conditions which had been forecast led to the accident 
officials estimated in midnovember that repairs which are 
under way would take until the end of january to complete but 
many of the islands 5000 residents said they expected bad winter 
weather to prolong repairs 
the state is spending 20000 a day on ferry service to hatteras 
island another cost the state hopes will be passed to north 
american trailing kelly said 
the coast guard said cliett chose to try to free the vessel 
rather than secure it with a second anchor 
under the circumstances it would have been prudent to use all 
means available and a second anchor may have added sufficient 
holding power to prevent the accident the coast guard said in 
a statement the masters failure to use the second anchor 
constitutes evidence of negligence on his part

iraq referred to its conquest of kuwait as 
a felicitous union in a letter circulated friday objecting to 
kuwaits ambassador being seated in the general assembly 
the letter from the iraqi un mission dated dec 20 but 
released friday expresses a reservation to the general assemblys 
credentials committee report in the case of kuwait 
iraq did not try to challenge kuwaits right to be seated 
it would have lost any such attempt in the general assembly by a 
humiliating margin nearly all the 158 other voting members would 
have backed kuwaits membership 
iraqs letter says the felicitous union produced by the merger 
of iraq and kuwait on 9 august 1990 has made iraq and kuwait once 
again a single state represented by a single delegation to the 
united nations 
accordingly the delegation of iraq enters a reservation with 
respect to the decision of the credentials committee to accept the 
credentials of the socalled delegation of kuwait to the united 
nations and wishes to have that reservation officially recorded 
baghdad announced aug 9 it had annexed kuwait as iraqs 19th 
province a week after invading the emirate 
the security council voted 150 that same day to declare the 
annexation null and void in international law in resolution 662

prominent members of the original 
leadership of romanias revolution spurned president ion iliescus 
invitation to attend a first anniversary celebration of the 
uprising friday and warned of a new dictatorship 
a spokeswoman at iliescus office said the celebration was going 
ahead as planned friday evening with most of those invited 
expected to attend 
eight founding members of the national salvation front which 
took power during the december 1989 revolution against communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu said they would boycott celebrations at 
iliescus offices in bucharests cotroceni palace 
in a letter they accused the front of having used them to 
lend legitimacy to the appearance of democracy as a democratic 
ornament for a masked new dictatorship 
the group includes popular revolutionary figures such as former 
dissidents doina cornea and ana blandiana intellectual gabriel 
andreescu and actor ion caramitru 
we are united in the feeling that we were used from the 
beginning said the letter a copy of which was made available to 
the associated press 
the front overwhelmingly won elections last may but the 
government it formed has come under increasing fire from opponents 
who claim many of its leaders are old regime holdovers and still 
harbor communist tendencies 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed on dec 25 1989 
last week iliescu sent invitations to all 71 members of the 
fronts original council hastily formed by former communists 
dissidents prominent intellectuals and others on dec 22 1989 
when ceausescu fled bucharest 
many members including the eight boycotters soon resigned and 
later became iliescus most vocal critics 
the letter from the eight said their attendance would have given 
the illusion of dialogue with the government which has proven 
impossible over the past year 
sources close to iliescu speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the invitation was an honest attempt at reconciliation at a 
difficult time for romania 
frequent sometimes violent antigovernment street protests have 
taken place since the may elections 
in midjune six people were killed when police and 
progovernment miners suppressed a 53day opposition rally in 
bucharest 
government economic reforms proposed in november that included 
raising prices on many basic goods have also led to popular 
protests among consuers 
on friday finance minister teodor stolojan presented to 
parliament a national budget for 1991 of 72 billion slightly 
higher than 1990s budget of 7 billion 
he said state investments in the economy would decrease from 
17 billion this year to 890 million in 1991 and would help slash 
a budget deficit that totaled 1 billion this year 
he said private savings here could help boost the economy 
there is enough money around for investments in the economy 
stolojan told parliament we do not need to allocate large sums 
from the budget 
he urged quick adoption of new tax and foreign investment laws 
he also said that romanias currency the leu is still far from 
convertibility the leu was devalued officially in november from 
20 to the dollar to 35 to the dollar its unofficial value on the 
parallel market usually exceeds 120 to the dollar

a woman convicted of inciting violence after 
she burned an american flag to protest the military buildup in the 
persian gulf was sentenced friday to one year in prison 
cheryl lessin of cleveland was taken to jail immediately after a 
judge imposed the sentence 
several of lessins supporters chanted stop the us war 
machine no matter what it takes as they left the justice center 
her lawyers said they will ask that lessin be freed pending 
appeal 
a jury in october convicted lessin 46 on a charge of inciting 
violence after she took part in an aug 10 protest against the 
presence of us troops in saudi arabia following iraqs invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 
the rally in downtown cleveland escalated into scuffling and 
yelling after lessin burned the flag 
two police officers testified that she ran through the crowd 
throwing punches and shouting obscenities lessin and other 
witnesses said at the trial that the protest was not a riot 
lessins lawyer christopher stanley asked the ohio supreme 
court to disqualify common pleas judge patricia cleary saying she 
was prejudiced but the high court rejected the request 
stanley said cleary should have instructed the jury that flag 
burning is a protected form of free speech he said prosecutors 
used a state law against inciting violence to prosecute lessin for 
burning the flag 
clearly said she applied the law correctly during the trial and 
in her jury instructions

a former secret police chief under the 
military regime was arrested friday for his alleged involvement in 
a financial scandal that has shaken the chilean army 
gen gustavo abarzua wa held incommunicado by judge marcos 
libedinsky who has five days to either charge or release him said 
abarzuas lawyer marcelo cibie 
two other generals patricio gualda and patricio varela were 
briefly detained and questioned by libedinsky but were not 
charged 
libedinsky was appointed two months ago to investigate an 
illegal savings and loan scam in which hundreds of soldiers lured 
by interest rates of up to 30 percent deposited their savings with 
army officers 
the bank called la cutufa after the name of a dog reportedly 
owned by one of its officers collapsed when the operators fell 
short on payments 
so far eight officers have been charged with breaking the 
banking law 
news coverage of his investigation has clearly upset former 
dictator gen augusto pinochet who turned over the government to 
elected president patricio aylwin in march after a 16year 
dictatorship 
pinochet put the army on alert for several hours dec 19 to 
protest the investigation the government sensitive to the 
militarys anger has tried to keep a lid on the affair 
but pinochet did order an internal army investigation of the 
bank and has given libedinsky a list of 150 officers and 
noncommissioned officers who were punished by the military as a 
result of the probe many were discharged 
abarzua was the last chief of the feared military intelligence 
agency known by its spanish initials cni which was disbanded 
shortly before pinochet stepped down 
abarzua gualda and varela were retired in october by pinochet 
who remains commander of the 60000man army

opposition parties called for immediate 
mass protests friday to force president mobutu sese seko from 
power they said mobutu is a dictator who has delayed a promised 
transition to democracy 
it was the first time mobutus opponents joined in a common 
front 
mobuto has ruled this central african state for 25 years he 
pledged in april to install a multiparty democracy within a year 
but modified this later to say he would permit only three political 
parties to contest 1991 elections 
the opposition emanded friday that mobutu resign and be 
replaced by a government of national unity to organize elections 
ending oneparty rule 
the zairean leader is also under pressure from the united states 
and other western governments 
us officials previously shrugged off accusations of human 
rights abuses in zaire to support mobutu as a bulwark against 
marxism in the region but congress ignored appeals from the bush 
administration and cut all aid to mobutus government following 
charges that zairean troops massacred from 50 to 150 students at 
the university of lubumbashi in a night raid last may 11 
mobutus government said one student was killed in what it first 
described as ethnic factional fighting later it blamed regional 
government officials for the attack and said they would be 
punished 
the opposition on friday asked an international inquiry into the 
incident mobutu refused such a request earlier from belgium the 
former colony power 
at least six people were killed this month in demonstrations 
against price increases government foes say soldiers shot the six 
officials deny it 
the opposition parties also complained friday of economic 
hardship and devaluation of zaires currency

way about 300 riders arrived at wounded knee at the conclusion of 
the 220mile trip 
the event they are commemorating occurred dec 29 1890 when 
us calvary troops killed hundreds of sioux men women and 
children at wounded knee the exact number is a point of 
contention the federal government says about 150 died the sioux 
say as many as 400 
among the riders on the pilgrimage to wounded knee was former 
american indian movement leader russell means who declared 
thursday that there is little left for the radical indian 
organization to accomplish because tribes have learned to speak for 
themselves 
theres no need for aim to be a vanguard means said in an 
interview at kyle about 20 miles northeast of wounded knee 
were still around and we still make statements but were no 
longer needed because the indian people have collectively risen up 
and said what they want to say independently 
means who helped lead a takeover of wounded knee in 1973 said 
his return to the site had him swelling with a tremendous amount 
of prideful emotion 
wounded knee proved to indian people that its all right to 
stand up and be an indian and that its even worth fighting for 
he said 
means helped organize an armed 71day occupation of wounded knee 
on the pine ridge indian reservation 17 years ago two men were 
killed and several others wounded in the action that divided the 
sioux nation 
resulting indictments against means and about 115 others were 
dismissed by a judge

the suez canal chief played down iraqs 
threat to block navigation in the international waterway in the 
event of war 
the suez chairman mohamed ezzat adel said his men can remove 
any obstacle in the strategic waterway that links the mediterranean 
with the red sea within 48 hours 
adel made the remarks in a statement scheduled for publication 
saturday in the state newspaper akhbar elyom the weekly said the 
comments were made in reaction to iraqi threats to block navigation 
in the canal 
he said it is hard for anything to block the canal because its 
navigation width is about 630 feet 
the canal was widened several times under successive development 
plans carried out after egypt and israel signed a peace treaty in 
1979 
adel also said the canal authority would lose about 43 million 
daily if war broke out in the persian gulf he said 36 percent of 
gulf trade with the outside world was passing through the canal 
before the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
since then he said the canal has been losing 29 percent of its 
income 
he said navigation safety is being supervised by high security 
authorities the reference could mean that the presidency and the 
egyptian intelligence service are overseeing security of the canal 
adel told egyptian new media three days ago that authorities are 
stepping up security in the canal 
canal sources first disclosed the heightened security to the 
associated press a week ago they said the aim was to prevent a 
possible iraqi attempt to scuttle a vessel in the waterway and 
block it 
sealing the 101milelong canal would greatly curtail the flow 
of troops and arms from atlantic and mediterranean points to the 
usdominated multinational force countering iraq

training mission said air force lt casey mahon a central 
command spokesman

christopher justice was accused of two crimes by 
a prosecutor setting fire to a house and using a racial slur to 
describe the inhabitants 
dont worry its just a bunch of niggers justice allegedly 
told neighbors after the fire 
district judge thomas shea agreed there was enough evidence to 
order justice to stand trial on the arson charge but he said the 
us constitution protected justices right to say whatever he 
wanted about his neighbors contrary to michigans law prohibiting 
ethnic intimidation 
the law which took effect april 1 1989 makes it a crime to 
threaten or harm persons or their property because of their race 
religion or ethnic background conviction carries a maximum penalty 
of two years in prison and allows a jury to award triple damages to 
a plaintiff 
at least 30 other states have similar laws 
sheas nov 28 quashing of the law applies only to his 
fivetownship jurisdiction about 20 miles west of detroit but 
prosecutor william delhey said hes afraid that eastern washtenaw 
county could become a haven of hatred 
we think judge shea was wrong and we want a determination of 
the constitutionality of the ethnic intimidation statute so it will 
be applied uniformly in the entire county delhey said 
justice 21 of superior township remains jailed in lieu of a 
500000 bond on the arson charge stemming from the nov 9 fire at 
the home of sherwin mcdonald a trial before circuit judge patrick 
conlin is scheduled march 18 justice faces up to 20 years 
imprisonment if convicted 
delheys office has asked conlin to reinstate the ethnic 
intimidation charge and he might rule by the end of january said 
david lady chief assistant prosecutor 
shea said the law was unconstitutional because it violated first 
amendment guarantees of free speech and was too vaguely worded the 
american civil liberties union agrees with him 
the laws too vague to be able to stand said howard simon 
michigan aclu director the appellate courts have got to come 
down with an interpretation 
justices attorney don ferris believes the law violates free 
speech but he also said prosecutors failed to prove justice was 
motivated by prejudice 
ferris said no evidence was introduced at justices preliminary 
hearing that indicated he knew the mcdonalds were black or 
threatened them before the fire the alleged racial statements were 
uttered after the fire and not to the mcdonalds but to neighbors 
who said justice was drunk the lawyer said 
the problem with the law is as judge shea ruled parts of it 
are not very properly defined ferris said the less clear the 
words are in a statute it gives prosecutors a lot more 
discretion in applying the law 
the author of michigans ethnic intimidation law predicted 
sheas ruling would be reversed 
its definitely constitutional state senelect david 
honigman said it doesnt regulate any kind of speech whatsoever 
it regulates conduct 
similar laws in other states have survived challenges on 
constitutional grounds honigman said 
the triple damages portion of the law has yet to be used 
honigman said the provision was meant to cripple organized hate 
groups 
we cant legislate good will he said but we can make ill 
will terribly costly 
mcdonald 29 a ford motor co engineer said sheas ruling 
added insult to the injury of having lost his home in the fire 
if this isnt ethnic intimidation nothing is said 
mcdonald who now lives with his wife and twin daughters in an 
apartment we always thought our girls would grow up in washtenaw 
county but if this is the type of judge that represents washtenaw 
county then maybe that wont be 
maybe well have to move back to detroit where its safe

the pentagon announced friday it plans to 
vaccinate troops in the persian gulf against possible germ warfare 
attacks by iraq and a 17ship carrier armada set sail to bring 
americas naval deployment in the region to a level unprecedented 
since the vietnam war 
the naval reinforcements scheduled to arrive in the gulf in 
about two weeks are carrying 16000 marines and sailors and 
include the carriers uss america and theodore roosevelt each with 
about 80 warplanes from the norfolk naval base in virginia 
they will join three other carriers in the area the uss 
saratoga in the eastern mediterranean the uss midway in the 
arabian sea and the uss kennedy in the red sea 
the fresh troops will bring the united states closer to its goal 
of having about 430000 in saudi arabia and nearby waters to 
confront iraq if it refuses to withdraw from kuwait by jan 15 
the deadline imposed by the united nations 
meanwhile the pentagon said it was preparing to inoculate 
troops against possible germ warfare by iraq 
we are committed to providing maximum protection for our 
troops including protection against chemical and biological 
weapons said a brief statement we expect to begin a program 
of inoculations soon it said but did not provide further 
detail 
the new york times which first reported the plan said the 
inoculations could begin in a matter of weeks it also said the 
united states doesnt yet have sufficient vaccines for all its 
troops in the gulf 
in london the british defense ministry said british troops 
taking part in operation desert shield also would receive 
inoculations the ministry said it was issuing gas masks to about 
british 21000 civilians in the area 
britain is contributing about 21000 troops to the antiiraq 
force 
in other developments friday iraq test fired a 
surfacetosurface missile for the second time this week the us 
central command in saudi arabia reported that the missle was fired 
away from multinational forces and that it landed within iraq 
military analysts also said that thousands of iraqis have been 
trained for suicide attacks on the usled forces if war breaks 
out 
cia director william webster has said in recent weeks that iraq 
has sizable stockpiles of biological weapons iraq denied the 
allegations 
biological weapons are basically germs viruses and bacteria 
that cause diseases such as cholera anthrax typhoid botulism 
they can be delivered by warheads on missiles by lowflying planes 
spreading the germs much like a crop duster or by contamination of 
water supplies 
unlike nuclear or even chemical arms biological weapons are 
easy to make because they rely on the kind of agents and equipment 
used in manufacturing pharmaceuticals and are readily available on 
world markets 
the us commerce department for example approved more than 20 
shipments of biological agents to the iraqi government according 
to a congressional staffer investigating the sales the us 
company which sold the agents believed they would be used for 
vaccinations said the official 
defenses against germ warfare include protective clothing 
masks and vaccines 
experts caution however that dozens of diseases can be 
converted into weapons making it hard to know against which to 
inoculate 
also it could take one month or longer to develop immunity to 
some of the diseases after being vaccinated said dr sanford 
kuvin vice chairman of the national foundation for infectious 
diseases 
one of the diseases iraq is believed to have in its arsenal is 
anthrax an easily transmittable and severely incapacitating 
illness 
the vaccine however is not commercially available because the 
only people who need it in this country are those handling imported 
raw hides and goat hair 
the vaccine is only made by michigans public health lab which 
is having trouble keeping up with the demands for gulf troops 
newsweek reported 
another disease iraqi president saddam hussein is known to have 
in his arsenal is botulism a form of stomach poisoning which is 
treatable with antibiotics but against which there is no vaccine 
the united states wasnt the only nation gearing up for a 
possible fight 
in london the government ordered the callup of 390 medical 
reservists for service in the gulf after getting too few 
volunteers the british are members of the antiiraq coalition 
and to prevent being stranded by war more than 250 soviet 
citizens left iraq friday and 1000 others were to be evacuated by 
jan 10 soviet deputy premier igor belousov met with officials in 
baghdad seeking to terminate numerous commercial contracts with 
iraq 
but japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu urged talks with iraq 
on averting war 
the state department said however that there hadnt been any 
progress in efforts to arrange a meeting between secretary of state 
james baker and saddam iraq wants jan 12 as the meeting date but 
baker says he wont go after jan 3 
for the second day in a row the senior us diplomat in 
baghdad joseph c wilson did not have any contact with the iraqi 
foreign ministry said mark dillen a state department spokesman

as world leaders debate saddam husseins 
nuclear potential the list of german companies alleged to have 
helped him advance iraqs atomic technology grows 
at least 100 german companies are suspected of helping iraq 
develop its unconventional weapons capability sources say german 
officials wont say how many of those are being investigated for 
suspected nuclear technology exports 
the news magazine der spiegel said this week that several 
dozen european companies were implicated and listed six german 
companies with some reported connection to iraqs weapons program 
i would not like to be george bush and going to bed tonight 
with the uncertainty over whether iraq has a nuclear bomb said 
kenneth timmerman editor of the parisbased middle east defense 
news 
spiegel and the specialized mcgrawhill publication 
nuclearfuel both alleged this week that german companies are 
suspected of supplying iraq with sophisticated technology to make 
weaponsgrade uranium 
the companies and individuals named in the reports deny any 
wrongdoing 
it is not clear how far along iraq might be toward making a 
nuclear bomb 
the british newspaper the sunday times reported earlier this 
month that iraq might be only a year away from the goal 
but a major source for its report german engineer bruno 
stemmler denied the papers time frame in an interview thursday 
he said based on a 1988 visit to iraq the country was at least 
five years from building a centrifuge that could make enriched 
uranium it would then take several more years before a series of 
centrifuges called cascades could come on line 
at least 1000 cascades are needed for bomb production 
spiegel predicted it would be eight to 10 years before iraq 
could build a bomb 
iraq is acquiring enrichment technology a german official 
said on condition of anonymity its not believed that iraq is 
now producing highly enriched uranium in significant quantities 
but he said without elaborating you cannot exclude that they 
are doing something on an experimental level 
the official with access to intelligence data said iraq could 
be from two to seven years away from an atomic weapon 
timmerman however who chronicled iraqs acquisition of poison 
gas in a book said friday that information hes received is so 
disturbing and the extent of delivery to iraq from germany and 
other places would appear so great that i would not feel safe 
saying that iraq does not have a bomb today 
nuclearfuel has cited a secret government report it obtained 
last fall from the economics ministry which monitors export 
regulations the report says german centrifuge design may have been 
provided to iraq by two engineers who formerly worked for a german 
centrifuge design company man technologien gmbh 
it quoted a source who attended a secret briefing on the report 
as saying economics minister helmut haussmann told us that 
centrifuge equipment sent to iraq was of german origin 
in addition officials have confirmed that customs officers last 
summer intercepted a german shipment of centrifuge parts at 
frankfurt airport bound for iraq 
the international atomic energy agency reviewed iraqs declared 
nuclear facilities in november under the terms of nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty of which iraq is one of 141 signatories 
the agency said it found nothing unexpected 
so far only one arrest has been reported in the scandal the 
director of a bonnbased weapons supplier remains under 
investigation for alleged export violations officials say 
companies in other countries including the united states 
britain switzerland and brazil have also been named in connection 
with suspected iraqi nuclear development 
as allegations mount against german companies so does 
frustration in washington 
we know what the germans are up to said a us senate 
source on condition of anonymity there is only an argument over 
how long it takes before he gets the bomb he referred to iraqs 
saddam 
german officials deny they are being lax but one source in 
bonns inner circle said have you seen the harbor in hamburg 
you just cant control every container 
germanys federalist justice system also makes it difficult to 
halt violations despite tough new export laws 
laws are drafted by the economics ministry enforced through the 
finance ministrys customs police who can turn the case over to 
local authorities for further investigation and potential charges 
lutz stavenhagen chancellor helmut kohls top intelligence 
adviser has suggested letting the countrys counterespionage unit 
investigate suspected export violations but the proposal is likely 
to meet with strong resistance in a country that remembers hitlers 
police state 
the latest allegations of german nuclear help to iraq follows 
last weeks announcement that the united states gave germany a list 
of 50 companies suspected of breaking the international embargo 
against iraq 
a government official said friday that of 87 companies under 
review 16 had been cleared and 10 were being further investigated 
for allegedly preparing to break the embargo the other cases are 
pending

reformist lawmakers on friday questioned the 
fairness of this weeks parliamentary election of vice president 
gennady yanayev alleging that ballots were incorrectly counted 
the interregional group of deputies which represents 229 
deputies in the congress of peoples deputies showed reporters 
what they said were seven ballots that were not submitted for 
tabulation at the thursday session that elected yanayev tass 
reported 
parliament officials charged with counting the votes had 
reported that only five ballots were not put into ballot boxes 
during the vote the official news agency said raising questions 
about other possible discrepancies 
the group founded by the late human rights activist andrei d 
sakharov also echoed accusations that approval of strong new 
presidential powers was dangerous 
the country is heading toward dictatorship where the key role 
is assigned to repressive bodies and violence could become the 
major means of solving internal political issues the group said 
in a statement 
yanayev was elected on the second ballot at the end of the 
stormy 10day session after deputies initially rejected his 
nomination by president mikhail s gorbachev 
on the first secret ballot deputies voted 1089583 for 
yanayev leaving him 31 votes short of the margin needed for 
confirmation parliament election officials recorded 107 
abstentions and invalidated 113 ballots for unspecified reasons 
yanayev needed a simple majority of 1120 votes out of the 2239 
registered members of the parliament 
the total number of deputies attending the session was lower 
than the number registered at least three delegations from 
secessionist republics were boycotting and an unknown number of 
other were absent for various reasons 
the parliament earlier this week approved nearly every 
constitutional amendment gorbachev wanted to reorganize the 
government under direct presidential control some lawmakers said 
that by rejecting his nominee the usually obedient parliament 
showed its deep dissatisfaction with yanayev in the potentially 
powerful and visible new job 
but gorbachev determined to win confirmation of the 53yearold 
career communist party official argued that he needed a man he 
could trust in the job and persuaded deputies to vote again 
on the second secret ballot deputies voted 1230563 for 
yanayev surpassing the 1120 votes needed for a simple majority 
the remaining ballots were not filled out or were declared 
invalid but the exact numbers were unavailable 
it was also unclear whether the same number of ballots in the 
first vote 1847 were distributed in the second vote if so 
that would have left just 54 abstentions or invalid ballots in the 
second vote down significantly from the 120 in the first vote 
after the first vote speakers had implored the deputies to vote 
during the second round and support gorbachev 
a political battle is going on and you cant get away from it 
you must choose said marshall sergei f akhromeyev a 
presidential adviser and former armed forces chief of staff 
meanwhile friday the dramatic resignation during the parliament 
of foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze continued to reverberate 
in the media 
the state committee for television and radio known as 
gostelradio canceled two episodes of vzglyad one of the 
soviet unions most popular television programs because it 
disapproves of its political coverage the shows host said 
alexander lyubimov said the shows were scheduled to include 
stories about shevardnadze including a frank interview in which he 
said he considered quitting as foreign minister to protest 
shootings by soviet troops in his native georgia shevardnadze 
resigned over another issue last week 
program officials saw the cancellation as a return tostate 
censorship clearly done for political reasons

albanias communist government legalized 
the first opposition newspaper on friday and announced greater 
independence for television and other news media the state news 
agency ata reported 
in a dispatch monitored in vienna ata said the council of 
ministers decided to allow the democratic party to publish a 
newspaper and to make directors of ata and of official television 
and radio responsible to the state indicating the communist party 
would have less direct control 
an official journalist reached by telephone in the capital of 
tirana said communistsponsored directors would probably keep their 
posts for the moment 
the ministers also decided to set up a commission to draft a 
news media law for approval by parliament after feb 10 elections 
ata said 
up to now there was no law regulating the media i understand 
this move to mean more independence from the party the 
journalist said speaking on condition of anonymity 
president ramiz alia has sped up political reform since student 
protests over dormitory conditions this month grew into demands for 
democracy in albania europes last holdout for hardline 
communism 
the communists in power since 1944 still control nearly all 
spheres of public life including the media 
gramoz pashko a cofounder of the recently legalized democratic 
party said fridays decision meant the planned newspaper rilindja 
demokratika or democratic revival would go to press in the next 
day or two 
he said in a telephone interview that the democrats held a rally 
friday in the central city of elbasan their second rally outside 
tirana and estimated that 35000 people attended 
pashko reported no police interference and no incidents 
he said the government authorized use of stateowned presses at 
a fee to print the paper a first edition of 100000 is planned to 
be distributed around albania by students and other supporters for 
a one lek 10cent cover price he added 
pashko said the paper would also be sold to albanian communities 
in neighboring yugoslavia and elsewhere abroad we shall cover 
the costs and by selling abroad raise funds for the party 
the price for the eightpage paper was three times that of the 
communist party daily zeri i popullit 
an electoral law adopted before the democratic party was 
legalized forbids political parties to receive foreign funding 
but pashko said raising funds through newspaper sales was legal 
four decrees by the council of ministers on friday were all 
signed by premier adil carcani 
one says newspapers would not be allowed to publish articles 
calling for overthrow of the constitutional order or other 
destabilizing acts said an albanian radio report monitored by 
the british broadcasting corp 
pashko confirmed reports by the yugoslav news agency tanjug that 
the communists organized counterrallies friday in tirana and other 
albanian cities but he said attendance was sparse and mainly 
old people were there 
speakers at the opposition rally asked popular support for the 
democratic partys demands that february elections be postponed for 
two or three months to allow the democrats more time to organize 
an effective campaign 
even with a newspaper the opposition must rely mainly on 
wordofmouth and rallies to propagate its cause in this small 
isolated balkan nation of 32 million with its poor roads and 
communications 
the government on monday rejected the request for a 
postponement saying urgently needed reforms and constitutional 
changes require that parliamentary elections as soon as possible 
alia on wednesday acknowledged there have been mistakes in 
the 46 years of oneparty rule he pledged to reform the communist 
party and remove the communists guaranteed leading role in society 
from the constitution 
he also promised reforms to shore up albanias isolationist 
economy now on the brink of collapse

soviet officials investigating the 
massacre of 15000 polish officers during world war ii are 
conducting a thorough and comprehensive probe a polish 
prosecutor said friday 
deputy prosecutor general stefan sniezko said soviet military 
prosecutors showed him 35 volumes of files relating to the 1940 
katyn massacre including such details as schedules for trains that 
carried the prisoners 
after 47 years of denials the soviet government in april 
admitted responsibility for the murders which it had previously 
blamed on the nazis on dec 18 polish prosecutors were allowed 
their first look at the documents sniezko said 
a total of 4254 polish prisoners including the cream of the 
polish intelligentsia and 800 doctors were executed and stacked in 
mass graves by the soviet secret police in the katyn forest near 
the city of smolensk 
the bodies were found by german troops moving east through 
russia in 1943 
but until the current investigation the whereabouts of an 
additional 10000 poles who were interned in camps at starobielsk 
and ostashkov northwest of moscow had been a mystery 
sniezko said that the soviet military prosecutors who took over 
the case in october after the personal intervention of president 
mikhail s gorbachev hoped to chart the fate of each victim 
polish experts have been invited to attend an exhumation of 
bodies next year near kharkhov in the southern ukraine sniezko 
said 
referred to as the second katyn the site found in june is 
likely to contain bodies of prisoners from the nearby starobielsk 
camp 
poles regard the murders as evidence of stalins drive to 
prevent the resurrection of an independent polish state after nazi 
germany and the soviets divided poland between them in 1939

israeli leaders assured jordan on friday that 
they intend to remain at peace with the neighboring kingdom 
tensions have risen with reports of military buildups on both sides 
of the border 
jordan which has shown sympathy for neighboring iraq has 
reinforced its security forces along the ceasefire line with 
israel as a precaution against an attack by the jewish state 
jordanian military sources said thursday 
prime minister yitzhak shamir during a meeting with visiting 
us secretary of transportation samuel k skinner said israel is 
carefully monitoring the events in jordan but wants to live with 
it like good neighbors israel radio reported 
the real interest of jordan is to keep any country any 
foreign element from entering jordan jordanian officials have 
presented this as one of the reasons for the present increased 
level of defensive alert said israels chief of staff lt gen 
dan shomron 
shomron in a speech in tel aviv on friday said israel wants to 
prevent any alien element and of course the iraqis from 
invading jordan israel has repeatedly issued such warnings to 
jordan which it fears iraq may use as a springboard for an attack 
on israel 
however the jordanians are wrong in assuming that we plan to 
invade jordan to harm it and to seize territory we have no such 
intentions and im also saying that reports that we are massing 
troops on the jordanian border are simply not true shomron said

a mentally ill woman who refused to 
have a courtordered abortion has given birth to a boy 
denise lefebvre who spent much of her pregnancy strapped to a 
hospital bed to protect staff from her violent outbursts had the 
baby wednesday said her guardian kathleen phillips 
the 5pound 10ounce infant who wasnt expected until january 
suffered no obvious ill effects from lefebvres medication for 
severe manic depression phillips said 
its a sad and happy occasion said phillips who became 
lefebvres guardian when she was declared mentally incompetent in 
september we have a baby but who knows what will happen to the 
baby denise is very ill 
who will be the childs guardian has yet to be decided but 
phillips said the state department of health and rehabilitative 
services likely will take custody of the boy 
the birth at broward general medical center will allow lefebvre 
to resume powerful drugs she was taking before she stopped last 
spring for fear it would hurt her unborn child she quickly slipped 
into a deep psychotic state prompting doctors at broward general 
to seek a courtordered abortion they said was necessary to save 
her life 
lefebvre insisted on keeping her baby but without her 
medication lefebvre was attacking and accosting her doctors 
urinating and defecating on herself and refusing to sleep or eat 
in september after the case bounced through south floridas 
courts a judge declared lefebvre mentally incompetent and 
appointed phillips to act on her behalf 
phillips and the doctors agreed to help lefebvre have her baby 
lefebvres ordeal drew the attention of prochoice and 
antiabortion groups which united in support of her decision to 
keep the baby 
phillips said lefebvre is reacting to her baby the way any 
mother might 
shes very happy phillips said i dont think she 
realizes what will happen to the baby

rescuers drilled a hole in the hull of 
a capsized barge off finland and saved two crew but officials said 
friday that although divers continued to search eight more missing 
men were thought dead 
olli lommi 36 first mate and jouko kosonen 41 chief 
engineer were rescued late thursday after being trapped for nine 
hours in an air pocket in the engine room of the upturned finnish 
vessel finnbaltic 
rescuers working in a snowstorm and heavy winds had redoubled 
their efforts after hearing tapping inside the barge 
the 550foot 15000ton barge including a motorized pusher 
section capsized in rough weather off the southwestern port of 
hanko at about 1 pm on thursday while carrying iron ore between 
finnish ports news reports said it overturned in 10 seconds 
because the barge took on water and the cargo shifted 
strong winds and rain forced rescuers to stop searching late 
thursday but operations resumed after weather conditions improved 
friday morning 
the barge was reported entirely submerged at first but 
officials said it later drifted into shallower water and part of it 
jutted a dozen feet or more above the surface allowing rescuers to 
walk on the hull 
we dont believe anyone else is alive in the pusherbarge but 
we have a dozen or so divers trying to get into the vessel from the 
underneath nils radstedt deputy chief of the hanko coast guard 
said 
the pusherbarge had nine finnish crewmen and a pilot on board 
rescue officials declined to speculate on why the vessel sailed 
in winds of up to 62 mph 
we just dont know and we will leave that upto the special 
investigation committee all we know is that it happened very 
quickly and there was no warning radstedt said in a telephone 
interview 
janeric dahlberg the security chief of fg shipping the barge 
owner said the two survivors said they had sailed in worse 
conditions before this vessel was built to sail in rough seas 
radstedt said heat from the pushers engine helped keep lommi 
and kosonen alive while a snow storm raged outside they were in 
good health when taken to the hanko medical center 
the rescued men said they think there are eight others 
trapped in the ship but there is no hope that they are still 
alive radstedt said 
in a separate incident the german freighter transgermania which 
hit a rock thursday was being towed into turku on finlands west 
coast 
rescue officials said the finnishbuilt rollon rolloff vessel 
had a cargo of dangerous chemicals but danger had passed that it 
would sink 
none of transgermanias 22 german crew were in danger said jari 
simi of the turku maritime rescue coordination center 
there are still 12 crew on the ship and 15 firemen pumping 
water out three tugs are pulling the vessel and there is no danger 
now simi said 
earlier 10 crewmen were evacuated from the sinking ship which 
had worked itself free off the rock and listed dangerously the 
ships pumps main engine and anchor chain broke in the storm

the militant pan africanist 
congress said friday it has been holding talks with nelson 
mandelas african national congress about joining forces in a 
united front against apartheid 
in another development justice minister kobie coetsee announced 
that the government will help an antiapartheid group with the 
repatriation of thousands of political exiles expected to return 
soon 
the return of exiles has been a key demand by the anc and other 
major opposition groups if exiles begin returning in large 
numbers it will help improve the climate for blackwhite 
negotiations between the government and opposition groups 
pan africanist president clarence makwetu said in a new years 
message friday 1991 will be characterized by the creation of a 
united front or patriotic front of the principal liberation 
movements 
in this regard it pleases us to announce that preparatory 
discussions between the pac and the anc for the creation of a 
united or patriotic front are proceeding with great promise 
leaders of both organizations have said black opposition groups 
should confront the whiteled government together but they have 
many disagreements 
anc spokeswoman gill marcus said as far as she knew there have 
been very very preliminary discussions 
she added unity isnt something simply declared on a piece of 
paper or achieved in talks it must be forged on the ground in 
action you have to have certain common basic principles 
such unity could be difficult to achieve for the anc the pan 
africanist congress and inkatha freedom party the largest 
antiapartheid groups they are split by deep rivalries 
the pan africanist congress was formed in 1960 by militants who 
broke away from the more moderate anc it refuses to recognize the 
whiteled government and has rejected an invitation to join current 
talks involving the anc and government the negotiations are 
intended to open the way for fullscale talks on giving majority 
blacks a say in the countrys political system 
both the pan africanist congress and anc support international 
sanctions to pressure the government to end apartheid the official 
system of racial separation but the conservative inkatha freedom 
party opposes sanctions 
in addition supporters of the anc and inkatha freedom party 
have waged virtual warfare for five years in natal province the 
fighting spilled over to the townships around johannesburg in 
august more than 3000 people have died this year in the unrest 
the anc and inkatha both oppose apartheid but they differ on 
tactics for fighting it and on their vision of a future south 
africa 
coetsee announced on thursday that the government has appointed 
two senior officials to work with the national coordinating 
committee for the repatriation of south african exiles 
the repatriation committee headed by antiapartheid activist 
rev frank chikane has urged the government to allow the united 
nations to play a role in the process but coetsees statement did 
not address the issue of un involvement 
the ministry will help identify problems related to exiles 
return and bring them to the attention of appropriate officials 
the statement said 
the government agreed in august to allow the return of tens of 
thousands of exiles but the process has bogged down as the 
government and the anc have tried to resolve a variety of issues 
the anc has demanded blanket amnesty for exiles but the 
government says exiles who fled prosecution for specific crimes 
must apply for amnesty and will have their cases judged 
individually 
the exact number of exiles is unknown the anc says about 20000 
of its members are in exile

a reclusive millionaire killed when fire 
gutted his cluttered home left more than 1 million to charity his 
attorney said 
nathan rounds 76 had no close relatives showed little 
interest in money or taxes and rarely went anywhere in the past 
decade said attorney joseph t thompson 
he wasnt unpleasant thompson said he just liked to keep 
to himself and wasnt a sociable person he was acquainted with 
howard hughes at one time and he was a recluse 
thompson said his client spent his last years secluded like 
hughes and had attended the 1947 flight of the multimillionaires 
spruce goose flying boat 
the attorney said rounds left an estate worth more than 1 
million and directed in his will that the money be donated to 
charity the will does not specify how the money should be spent 
rounds died early wednesday of apparent smoke inhalation after 
he fell while trying to escape a fire that gutted his 560000 home 
in sherman oaks said police detective mark rooney 
to say the house was cluttered does not come close to 
describing it rooney said it was like an obstacle course 
without a path 
there was no indication of foul play rooney said 
several small electric heaters placed all over the house may 
have caused the fire rooney said 
an autopsy was scheduled friday but preliminary results were not 
available from the los angeles county coroners office 
rounds inherited his fortune from parents who found him on a 
church step and adopted him he showed little interest in the trust 
fund his parents left after they died thompson said 
he didnt try to invest to make more money and didnt file his 
income taxes on time thompson said i never knew him to be 
employed he didnt need to be i heard he drove race cars as a 
young man 
thompson said he met rounds two or three times a year to deliver 
stock dividend checks but was never invited inside the hilltop 
home instead the two always met in his clients garage he said 
he wasnt incompetent and certainly wasnt mentally 
impaired thompson said he didnt want to be bothered he 
didnt want to do things and just generally didnt care

nancy cruzans family gave her the gift of 
freedom by disconnecting her feeding tube and allowing her to die 
after nearly eight years in a vegetative state her father said 
friday at her funeral 
it was time joe cruzan told about 200 people gathered at a 
chapel we all feel good that nancy is free at last 
ms cruzan 33 died wednesday at missouri rehabilitation center 
in mount vernon 12 days after her family won court permission to 
disconnect the feeding tube that kept her alive 
she did not die in vain her father said 
the familys legal efforts to end her life led to a landmark 
supreme court decision june 25 that patients like ms cruzan could 
be allowed to die if there was clear and convincing evidence 
that was their wish 
ms cruzan had been in a persistent vegetative state after 
suffering severe brain damage in a 1983 car accident her parents 
and former coworkers said it was her desire to die rather than 
live in such a state 
ms cruzans father said requests for living wills which allow 
adults to decide whether they want to be kept alive by artificial 
means increased 500fold since her case got national attention 
i believe that these facts alone speak to the legacy that 
nancy left us he said 
ms cruzan was buried in carterville just north of her 
southwest missouri hometown of joplin 
her blue metal casket adorned with drawings of flying sea 
gulls remained closed during the 45minute service two dozen 
floral arrangements surrounded the casket including a single red 
rose from her grandparents 
thirteen photographs of ms cruzan were displayed above the 
casket including one of her as an infant bundled for winter play 
as a little girl wrestling with a tootall bicycle and as a young 
darkhaired woman dressed in red with a beaming smile 
nancy seemed to be born with laughter in her spirit said 
the rev bob clyde the cruzans minister 
tapes of ms cruzans favorite songs were played in the chapel 
including the rose by bette midler and coming home by bob 
seger 
demonstrators picketed and camped outside the hospital while ms 
cruzan was dying and unsuccessfully pleaded with missouri and 
federal courts to order her feeding tube reconnected 
to the ones who maybe didnt understand or didnt agree we 
did what we felt we had to do cruzan told reporters we 
appreciate their prayers 
after a crush of mourners left ms cruzans grave her father 
returned stood quietly for a moment then placed a single pink 
flower on the casket before wiping his eyes 
nancys free at last thank god he said

the justice department said friday it had 
filed a civil antitrust suit aimed at blocking the planned merger 
of two banks in hawaii 
the banks are first interstate and first hawaiian first 
hawaiian planned to buy all the shares of first interstate on 
monday for 140 million 
the suit filed in us district court in honolulu charged that 
the consolidation would have excessive market power in business 
banking services in hawaii to an extent forbidden by the clayton 
act 
the department said first interstate is the fourth largest bank 
in hawaii with 771 million in deposits or 56 percent of the 
hawaii total while first hawaiian is the second largest with 
deposits of 5 billion or about 32 percent of the total 
james f rill assistant attorney general in charge of the 
antitrust division said in a statement this acquisition will 
hurt the many small to mediumsized businesses in hawaii the 
acquisition will eliminate one of only a few banks serving those 
customers and will likely result in them paying higher prices for 
services 
walter dods president of first hawaiian said in honolulu the 
department had nine months to make its objections known but waited 
until the last possible day to go to court 
asked if the merger was an antitrust violation he said it was 
not we have very strong opinions and our lawyers agree and 
thats why the federal reserve board approved the deal 
he said it was highly likely the bank would contest the 
departments suit

claiming that disney violated her contract by producing 
videocassettes of the classic 
ilene woods shaughnessy who in 1948 was paid 2500 said in 
the suit that her contract forbids disney from making copies of the 
movie for sale to the public

she performed such songs as so this is love and a dream is 
a wish your heart makes for the movie he said 
shaughnessy also sang on radio programs including the bing 
crosby show and the paul whiteman show smith said 
the suit is similar to at least two others brought against 
disney

before releasing the videocassette version of lady and the 
tramp 
lee provided voices and cowrote songs for the 1955 animated 
film

the government announced a deep 
devaluation of the currency on friday as part of a package of 
economic reforms that it urged parliament to pass to keep the 
fractious federation from falling apart 
premier ante markovic announced the measures in an address to 
both chambers of the federal parliament he said yugoslavias 
survival depended on the successful redirection of the nations 
economy along freemarket lines 
we are at a crucial juncture shall we permit this country to 
be faced with inevitable violence or will we ensure a peaceful 
legal and democratic solution to the crisis by continuing our 
reforms he asked 
markovic asked for a wage freeze in most sectors to help keep 
inflation down and for ceilings on public spending by the 
federation and yugoslavias six republics 
under the devaluation the dinars value against the german mark 
would fall 22 percent from seven dinars to the mark to nine the 
dollar would be worth 135 dinars after the devaluation 
markovic said the international monetary fund had approved his 
program and imf officials had assured him they stood ready to 
approve a 1 billion standby agreement for yugoslavia in january 
yugoslavia could lose access to western credit if it doesnt 
stick to his program he said 
since coming to power almost two years ago markovic has slowed 
inflation which hit 2500 percent in 1989 and introduced major 
procapitalist reforms 
inflation has crept up again to an estimated 120 percent annual 
rate but markovic predicted it would drop to 40 percent in 1991 
the economy was hit hard by loss of 13 billion in contracts 
due to the persian gulf crisis and 17 billion from a long 
drought markovic said 
but yugoslavia succeeded this year in repaying 38 billion of 
its hard currencydenominated foreign debt which now stands at 
165 billion 
the governments of yugoslavias six republics whose members 
range from former communists to freemarket conservatives have 
hurt the countrys economy by expanding public spending and 
granting pay raises in staterun companies markovic said 
each republic has wide control over its own economic and 
financial policies under yugoslavias federal system and the 
central government often cannot intervene 
centerright or nationalist parties triumphed in elections this 
year in four republics communists remained in power in serbia and 
montenegro 
slovenia and croatia want the patchwork federation of often 
hostile ethnic groups transformed into a loose association of 
independent states serbia favors keeping power centralized in 
belgrade the federal and serbian capital 
serbia imposed 50 percent taxes on goods from slovenia and 
croatia this year torpedoing markovics plans to keep a unified 
internal yugoslav market 
the serbian government opposes his plans for privatization and 
other market reforms and has launched a media campaign demanding 
the premier resign 
the eightmember federal presidency met with all six state 
presidents thursday and friday for negotiations aimed at concerting 
the countrys future

a small band of leftist rebels signed a 
peace treaty with the government friday and pledged to throw its 
weapons into the caribbean sea 
the agreement represents another important step in the 
governments effort to disarm a variety of guerrilla groups behind 
a threedecadeold insurgency the peace accord is the second to be 
signed with colombian guerrillas this year 
the new agreement which ended eight years of fighting was 
signed by government officials and rebels of the revolutionary 
workers party know by its spanish acronym prt presidential 
press spokeswoman amparo trujillo told the associated press 
the document was signed in the northern colombian town of don 
gabriel where prt guerrillas assembled after declaring a 
ceasefire and entering peace talks with the government on oct 23 
under the accord the revolutionary workers estimated 100 
rebels will throw their weapons into the caribbean and join the 
political process within a month officials said 
a more extensive accord with additional details on the 
guerrillas demobilization will be signed in january trujillo 
said 
during the past eight years the revolutionary workers have 
fought the army and police in the northern coastal province of 
sucre 
in march the much larger m19 rebel group signed a treaty with 
the government in exchange for amnesty 
the m19s success in transforming itself into an influential 
political party has been seen as key in convincing other rebel 
groups to give up armed struggle 
two other groups are reported near an agreement with government 
although the countrys major guerrilla movement has kept on 
fighting 
two other guerrilla outfits the maoistinspired peoples 
liberation army and quintin lame a small but fierce band of 
indigenous rebels are expected to sign treaties within weeks 
however colombias oldest and biggest rebel group the armed 
revolutionary forces of colombia is still fighting the army in the 
countryside about 160 troops and guerrillas have died this month 
in fighting

an ultraorthodox rabbi considered to be a 
political kingmaker has enraged religious and secular israelis by 
claiming the holocaust was gods punishment for sins such as 
violating the jewish sabbath and eating pork 
not for a long time has any single remark caused such an 
emotional reaction said razi barkai host of a radio talk show 
that was flooded with hundreds of calls thursday over the remarks 
of rabbi eliezer schach 
barkai said calls ran about 32 against the 97yearold rabbi 
who also predicted another disaster may befall jews for violating 
traditional religious tenets 
the last time he brought destruction it was the holocaust 
because of the sins the almighty may bring another holocaust upon 
us and it may already be tomorrow schach told jewish seminary

the navel orange crop in the san joaquin valley the states 
main growing region was virtually wiped out in the siege of

washington ap the ink was barely dry on the first official 
1990 census results when the numbers came under attack from state 
and local officials fearful of losing political clout and federal 
dollars 
i think this thing was destined to fail from day one said 
mayor jimmy kemp of meridian miss a longtime critic of how the 
headcount was run he was far from the only mayor to complain that 
the census overlooks many of the nations poor living in big 
cities 
the census numbers determine how many representatives each state 
sends to congress and how many federal aid dollars states and 
localities receive

it is nice to be 82 and still a working 
journalist but alistair cooke who is both reports one problem 
when young reporters arrive to interview him 
i am at the stage where i ask does the name adolf hitler 
mean anything to you 
despite this gentle reminder that those who forget history are 
doomed to see it repeated on cable cooke has prevailed in 
broadcasting and will take due note of it early in the new year 
on jan 13 to be precise 
hell celebrate his 20th anniversary then as host of pbs 
masterpiece theatre commencing a nineweek retrospective of 
some of its betterknown dramatic bundles from britain but of 
course they include upstairs downstairs i claudius and 
the jewel in the crown 
if thats not enough pbs will offer a jan 24 parody of the 
series masterpiece tonight concocted by gerard alessandrini 
whose forbidden broadway here regularly applies the needle to 
broadway musicals 
a transplanted englishman who gives urbane a good name cooke 
has been the only host of masterpiece theatre since it began on 
jan 10 1971 with the first churchills one of his 
leastfavorite shows incidentally 
an elegant man he favors blue blazers gray slacks and the 
graceful turn of phrase also jazz piano 
born in manchester and a us citizen since 1941 he first came 
here as a student in 1932 he returned as a man of print and 
broadcast who since 1938 has tried to explain america to the 
british no mean feat 
in 1970 he embarked upon an even more difficult feat 
explaining america to the americans in his acclaimed america 
series a bbc coproduction that nbc aired in prime time in 
197273 the show won four emmies 
but it also almost prevented him from signing up for 
masterpiece theatre he was in boston filming the third 
america episode when accosted by a young british producer 
christopher sarson 
the masterpiece idea hosting a weekly series of british 
dramas adapted from famous novels was explained cooke begged 
off saying hed be tied up on america for two years and 
constantly travelling 
but sarson was a deadpan scoundrel and terrifically 
persuasive he said 
a veteran americawatcher whose dossier of pals and influences 
includes hl mencken cooke will celebrate another milestone in 
march 
that will be his 45th anniversary of commenting on his adopted 
countrys wild and sometimes disturbing ways in letter from 
america a 14minute weekly report he delivers on radio for the 
bbc 
heard via shortwave in 52 countries including this one he 
likens what he calls my talks to a diary in a way written 
for a friend 
he comments on whatever strikes his fancy sad or funny minute 
or of great import and consequence he does admit gently laughing 
that he has yet to give the onceover to madonna and her amazing 
mondo video 
its his proud semiboast that in all the years of letter he 
hasnt missed a week although we came damn close a few months 
ago when he had to go to a hospital here for a prostate 
operation 
arrangements were made for him to tape that weeks show in the 
hospitals boardroom they rolled him there in a wheelchair 
accompanied by two public relations officials both stunning 
from the hospital 
he recalls telling them what a pity we didnt have a 
photographer with us its the first time in 44 years that ive 
broadcast with a catheter bag 
as befits a man of his years and travels he occasionally is 
asked to compare the america of say 1940 with the america of 
today given the chance to go cosmic he instead offers a 
refreshing unexpected answer 
i couldnt do it he says the standard thing is to talk 
about the loss of innocence every generation thinks it was 
innocent when it was young it wasnt innocent it was young 
he smiles when asked when if ever hell sign off the air and 
retire 
oh it may happen tomorrow i live from day to day and its 
not for me to decide that but i dont have any intention of doing 
that i think when you retire you keel over 
 
elsewhere in television 
should auld acquaintance be forgot its for a darn good reason 
the usual new years shows are loose on the networks starting at 
1130 pm est tonight cbs has happy new year america 1991 
hosted by melissa manchester and featuring terry bradshaw in times 
square thats where nbcs jane pauley also will be as part of a

editors note one of the most popular working actresses today 
is a 19yearold named after a minnesota town wynona ryder she 
has appeared in three movies this year edward scissorhands 
mermaids and welcome home roxie carmichael she is engaged 
to actor johnny depp her costar in edwawrd scissorhands 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
winona ryder laughed as she started to drink a 
wellearned cup of coffee its all kind of meshed together but 
its all very clear she says sounding a lot like her godfather 
timothy leary 
the worlds most exhausted 19yearold makes herself comfortable 
on the couch of her hotel suite sitting indian style and letting 
her hands hang over her legsryders face is small almost elfin 
with pale skin pouty lips and eyes that stand out like dark brown 
dots 
few people can look back on a year and say they starred in three 
films and got engaged to actor johnny depp friends family and 
lots of caffeine have been the secrets helping her through a time 
highlighted by the movies she made mermaids and edward 
scissorhands one she didnt make the godfather part iii 
and a tattoo on depps right arm that reads winona forever 
when i started out working i made a point of doing one movie a 
year ryder said i was going to have a lot of free time but 
all of a sudden i fell into these movies that i wanted to do i 
went from one character to another without having time to think 
about it you kind of lose identity 
its important to surround yourself with people who have the 
best intentions for you and want the best things for you i have a 
family who are my best friends in the world i have two other close 
friends and i have a boyfriend who is great 
hard as she tries for a normal life without maids and servants 
and limousines most people her age dont have careers dont own 
homes and dont dodge photographers 
but her great appeal as an actress is how easy she is to relate 
to the look of permanent adolescent boredom in beetlejuice or 
the mixture of fear and desire as she comes to terms with sexuality 
in great balls of fire and mermaids 
actors seek a childlike frame of mind an openness to emotions 
that allows them to react spontaneously its easier for ryder she 
has fewer years to lose 
i love movies about children like to kill a mockingbird i 
loved it because it was told in this voice of innocence of purity 
it was so incredibly powerful to me because of that it wasnt just 
an adult trying to write in the eyes of a child i liked my life 
as a dog for the same reason 
most of the fan mail i receive is thanking me for heathers 
ryder says of the hit black comedy about the gruesome revenge of 
teen outsiders i think heathers was the first movie that 
didnt completely patronize teenagers i think they were sick of 
what john hughes was cramming down their throats 
heathers is her favorite film but ryder also loved edward 
scissorhands the romantic fable directed by close friend tom 
burton and mermaids the quirky comedy costarring cher and 
bob hoskins 
more disappointing was welcome home roxy carmichael a 
critical and commercial flop that ryder insists was turned into 
something i couldnt relate to and the godfather part iii 
which the overworked actress dropped out of because of exhaustion 
her role of michael corleones daughter went to sofia coppola who 
has been panned by critics 
i dont regret doing any movie i have ever done she says 
whether or not it was any good or not i got something out of it 
from roxy carmichael i made a really good friend also i learn 
things standing up for yourself lessons in terms of direction 
ryders first name came from a town in her home state of 
minnesota she grew up in san francisco and enjoyed a world of 
bohemian poets communes and old movies 
her father owns a bookstore and served as archivist to leary 
the merry lsd guru of the 1960s her mother makes educational 
films ryder took up acting 
i started at 10 or 11 she said i went to a theater 
school american conservatory theater in san francisco and i was 
just taking classes there it was something i was doing as a hobby 
because i was having trouble in regular school i couldnt make any 
friends so i thought i could meet people more like me 
early roles included lucas 1969 and square dance 
in beetlejuice she played the most alienated of teenagers 
decked out in black robes pulled from the actress own closet and 
was the child bride of dennis quaid in great balls of fire 
based on the life of rock n roller jerry lee lewis 
ryder swears edward scissorhands represents her graduation 
from high school films and she is scheduled to appear as a taxi 
driver in a new movie by mystery train director jim jarmusch

editors note johnny depp a forgotten young tv star largely 
unknown by the moviegoing public has found new popularity thanks 
to his title role in edward scissorhands his costar is also 
his fiance actress winona ryder 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
once dismissed as a television star with a 
teen following johnny depp is earning new respect this season as 
the cutleryequipped creation of scientist vincent price in 
edward scissorhands 
with his weaponlike hands and scarred pallid face depp has 
been drawing critical praise for his haunting portrayal in tim 
burtons hit fantasy its a far cry from the undercover cop tom 
hanson he played during four seasons of the fox networks 21 jump 
street 
the real johnny depp is a handsome 27yearold with a faint 
stubble of black beard and spiky hair reminiscent of edwards he 
recalls being overwhelmed upon reading the edward scissorhands 
script by caroline thompson 
i had a feeling about the story and the character that i cant 
describe he recalled i knew i had to do it 
i started thinking about the character right away i kept 
thinking of the faces of dogs i had owned the eyes of newborn 
babies pinocchio all the great classics like the hunchback of 
notre dame started coming to me and they all compiled in this big 
mass 
when i first met with tim we talked for two or three hours 
me and tim and denise di novi the producer i think we had similar 
images of the character i saw tims drawings and everything just 
clicked 
burton a former animator for the walt disney co brought his 
unique vision to peewees big adventure beetlejuice and 
batman his drawings helped convey the physical appearance of 
edward but depp had to build a character out of someone who had no 
past he was simply an unfinished creation of vincent price 
i kept thinking of a dog depp theorized dogs have that 
unconditional love if you scold a dog he cowers in a corner as 
soon as you call him back hes there and all is forgotten 
a lot of the things that tim and i talked about was just to 
maintain the purity of the character edward has lived in the attic 
of this mansion for seven years and when he comes into suburbia 
everything was beautiful and fascinating to him 
i got the scissor hands a few months before we started 
shooting i just tried to function normally with these long shears 
normal things like working remote control on the television set 
were just impossible trying to work the tv set manually or turn on 
the cassette player was tough going to the bathroom is something i 
dont want to talk about 
i went to sleep with the hands on woke up and one of them had 
been thrown across the room i nicked myself a few times after a 
while it became second nature 
because edward doesnt say a lot i knew early on that the 
character would rely on gestures when i was finally put into the 
costume and bound up that escalated the ideas i had the feeling 
of being bound up and completely restricted not able to move with 
full capacity the wardrobe the hands and the costume helped a 
lot 
depps love interest in edward scissorhands is winona ryder 
his offscreen sweetheart we had been together for six months 
before we started the movie he said it was kind of a lucky 
coincidence she had already been attached to the project then i 
read it and thought that tim would never want me i was pleasantly 
surprised when he did 
johnny depp was born in owenboro ky and moved to miramar 
fla when he was 6 he came to hollywood in 1983 intending to be 
a rock musician a friend introduced him to an agent and depp was 
cast in a nightmare on elm street he played one of the 
soldiers in platoon then began his fouryear sometimes stormy 
association with 21 jump street 
theres nothing bad i can say about the series he said 
on one level it definitely put me on the map theres not a 
better way to learn than to just do it every day on camera five 
days a week 
ive had no trouble with being typed when you meet me you 
realize im an entirely different person from the character i 
played on television

a rock group that sings in taiwans native 
language has taken this island nation by storm becoming the first 
music group to criticize the nationalist government in another sign 
of taiwans increasing freedom 
blacklist a trio of two taiwanese and one american mouths its 
dissent with bold lyrics and a musical style that blends rock n 
roll with the exotic strains of traditional chinese music 
nobody is safe from the bands sarcastic lyrics which mock 
prodemocracy protesters and conservative nationalist politicians 
alike even taiwans middleclass lifestyle comes in for a beating 
in a song that goes heh heh taxi where are you going 
one song called democracy bumpkin from the bands new lp 
makes fun of both the government and demonstrators the tune begins 
with trumpets feebly playing taiwans national anthem an electric 
guitar cuts in 
the groups sings i stroll in downtown taipei riot police 
block the street suddenly my heart feels a chill tell me 
please mr policeman are we preparing a war to regain mainland 
china 
as the music blares shouts of i want to protest fill the 
air a reflection of the pentup frustration in taiwans highly 
regulated society 
the song criticizes elderly lawmakers who have occupied about 
half of the seats in the legislature since 1949 when the 
nationalist government lost a war to communist forces on mainland 
china and fled to taiwan the legislators have been frozen in 
office to support the nationalists claim to represent all china 
they are so old that they can hardly breathe the government 
fears they may die anytime so our tax money pays for their 
intravenous drips the song goes 
government censors tolerated the bands first album songs of 
madness released in november 1989 but taiwans 
governmentcontrolled radio and television stations have never 
broadcast their tunes the unofficial ban has hurt the band 
nevertheless the album has so far sold more than 100000 copies 
to students and intellectuals an impressive figure for the group 
these are taiwans most rebellious songs in 40 years they are 
candid eyewitnesses of our time said jack liu chief editor of 
the audio art monthly 
joe wang founder of the blacklist does not seem to worry about 
the broadcast ban 
we know some nationalist authorities hate these songs but we 
have to send out the message that people here are not happy with 
taiwans politics and society he said in a recent interview at 
blacklists studio 
it is encouraging that our album is still wellreceived 
added keith stuart studio engineer of the group it means this 
society is open enough to accept new concepts 
wang 36 formed the blacklist two years ago with friend io 
chen a 29yearold cellist they were joined by stuart 34 of 
little rock ark who specializes in synthesizing and composition 
taiwan has undergone great change since 1987 when the government 
ended the 38 years of martial law that had cemented the 
nationalists in power opposition parties were legalized shortly 
thereafter restrictions on the press were relaxed and free 
elections were held 
still largescale resentment continues 
while most artists here refrain from offending authorities 
blacklist participated in taiwans largest student protest in march 
to demand that the elderly lawmakers step down 
during the weeklong sitin at a taipei park thousands of 
college students outraged by the governments slow pace of 
political reforms sang aloud we wont wait any more an 
impromptu song dedicated to the protesters by blacklist 
the government later agreed to retire all the aging lawmakers 
mostly in their 80s or older by the end of 1991 
those old deputies are the most ridiculous phenomenon in the 
world wang said but they are not to blame the nationalists 
made them absurd 
another thing that makes the group unique in taiwan is their use 
of the local taiwanese dialect instead of official mandarin 
chinese 
when the nationalists took power in taiwan they imposed the 
culture of the mainland on this island taiwanese comprise of about 
85 percent of taiwans population of 20 million but mandarin 
chinese replaced the taiwanese dialect in the classroom and 
students were penalized if they spoke the local patois 
wang a native taiwanese started writing songs in taiwanese 
about five years ago when his grandmother complained she could not 
understand him over the telephone 
i didnt know i was a taiwanese when i was young i even took 
pride in my fluent mandarin he said 
the band has met with much critical acclaim even from 
intellectuals 
the music is very good with its originality said hsiao yeh 
a prominent writer the songs grow from this land and show their 
concerns for the people 
wang might disagree 
in some ways he said we are aliens in taiwans pop 
music

jimi hendrix is dead and selling jeans in britain 
still selling records too 20 years after his death still 
unmatched by all wouldbe imitators of his furious blazing mastery 
of the electric guitar 
the hendrix phenomenon has never really gone away says 
george mcmanus marketing executive at polydor records 
two decades gone hendrix is a briskly moving product polydors 
cornerstones album hit the top five and will shortly go 
platinum in britain wrangler adopted crosstown traffic for a 
jeans commercial 
bass player noel redding and drummer mitch mitchell the 
survivors of the jimi hendrix experience each published books this 
year 
jimis death was the most lucrative act of his sad career 
according to redding whose book is partly a diatribe against the 
hendrix estate 
the us army which counts hendrix as an alumnus kicked off 
the year by including his voodoo chile as part of its amplified 
getoutofthatrefuge concert in panama for gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
the anniversary may be a melancholy event for anyone who 
remembers the first earboggling encounter with foxy lady 
manic depression or purple haze scuse me while i kiss 
the sky from the are you experienced lp in 1967 
serious craziness was the hendrix experience a stoned banshee 
swathed in psychedelic foppery caressing and bullying and 
battering his guitar bending the starspangled banner into 
weird shapes at woodstock amazing the plaster casters fleeing a 
concert in denver in a cloud of tear gas taking too many downers 
and choking to death on his own vomit 
born in seattle in 1942 hendrix found fame in britain and 
britain is where he died in his london apartment on sept 18 
1970 
his records have always sold well but his impact wasnt widely 
recognized until the wrangler jeans company commissioned a survey 
into british teenage musical tastes hendrixs name ranked high 
alongside living rock stars 
wrangler decided to feature hendrixs crosstown traffic in 
what became a highly effective tv commercial filmed in new york 
it showed a handsome young taxi driver who dumps his cab in the 
middle of manhattan and takes off to miami wrangler followed up 
with another commercial including footage of hendrix in concert 
his appeal is partly his rebel image and partly his short 
life the james dean factor polydors mcmanus said but deeper 
than that i believe it is because he is the source of so much of 
todays music people like bon jovi and def leppard will readily 
admit to the debt they owe him you can hear 20 seconds of a guitar 
and know it is jimi hendrix very few people had that ability 
one of the most successful new british bands to cite hendrix as 
an influence is the stone roses from the thriving manchester scene 
whose indie dance music combines psychedelia with discoderived 
house music 
hendrixs influence can be detected on their two recent top 10 
singles one love and fools gold 
hendrix is top for me says stone roses guitarist john 
squire he was trying to expand peoples minds in the 60s and 
were trying to do the same thing for the 90s he had an extrovert 
approach which we share he is one of the few people we can relate 
to 
the two men most closely related to hendrix have contrasting 
stories to tell 
redding who was sacked from the band emphasizes financial 
matters his book are you experienced is about the millions 
of dollars worth of royalties he claims to be owed 
mitchells book the hendrix experience is full of pictures 
and generally happier 
hendrix according to mitchell was far from a tragic 
character for one thing he had a wicked sense of humor thats 
why the women in particular really liked him because were 
talking about a man who was funny 
one of hendrixs secrets as a guitar technician mitchell 
writes were his thumbs nearly as long as his fingers 
mitchell also complains about his treatment by the estate but 
he had one lucrative gift from hendrix a fender stratocaster that 
sold for 350000 at auction in april 
one important figure who has not written his memoirs is chas 
chandler former bass player of the animals who saw hendrix in a 
greenwich village club brought him to england and formed the jimi 
hendrix experience 
i considered writing a book now and again but i never had the 
time and anyway i enjoy books too much chandler said in a rare 
interview 
he has returned to his roots in a coastal village in the 
northeast of england where he lives with his family and manages a 
local rock outfit the steve graham band 
chandler produced the first two hendrix albums are you 
experienced and axis bold as love but quit halfway through 
electric ladyland frustrated with the hangerson and endless 
rerecording of tracks 
my only obvious regret is i wonder if i didnt walk out maybe 
he would still be alive he is a loss he was a good friend 
otherwise i certainly have no regrets chandler said 
i do think there is a death cult around jimi there is 
something black about all this brooding over his death he is 
typified as some sort of brooding genius but when he was alive he 
was a very funny guy full of laughter he was quite a gentle lad 
quiet but witty and a good mimic 
you would have thought he went everywhere and burned his 
guitar but he only did it twice 
chandler said that when he met him hendrix hadnt written a 
song but i knew there was a place in england for him through the 
sheer potential of his guitar the music audiences in england had 
become quite sophisticated the beatles were pushing the 
boundaries of what was acceptable and audiences were quite willing 
to grasp something that was experimental 
chandler also believes hendrixs appeal endures because of his 
imitators 
most of the riffs played by a lot of guitar bands have their 
origins in hendrix he was an originator of sounds the greatest 
guitar player to have lived chandler said

in its brief heyday it was a place 
where people would go to browse for antiques or enjoy a night on 
the town 
but for the last 13 years ever since a series of mob bombings 
and gangland slayings closed taverns and scared customers away 
kansas citys river quay area has sat deserted 
transients slept beside empty buildings and an xrated movie 
theater the only sign of a former era came on saturday mornings 
when produce companies sold vegetables and fruit out of dilapidated 
stalls 
now with 40 million in public and private investment and a new 
name the citys river market area hopes to draw people back with a 
renovated produce market upscale loft apartments quaint 
restaurants shops and a riverboat museum 
its the kind of restoration that has led to a business and 
economic surge for historic commercial areas in many cities from 
bostons faneuil hall marketplace to fishermans wharf in san 
francisco 
were trying to create a neighborhood to have people living 
down here and shopping down here and were finally starting to 
show some results said bette guarino president of a nonprofit 
group that struggled for years to find a private company to develop 
the area 
people with organized crime connections no longer own property 
in the area which lies just north of downtown and south of the 
missouri river ms guarino said the mob cant move in this time 
because of tighter city zoning controls she said developers are 
focusing on restaurants and apartments not bars 
but others say the river quays legacy lingers 
when its finished itll be the greatest thing that ever 
happened to this city said mary jane orlando the owner of mama 
orlandos restaurant one of the few eateries open in the area 
more are scheduled to open soon 
but its not finished yet mrs orlando said people are 
watching whats going on down here theyre aware of the progress 
but theyre still scared 
mrs orlando said she got a typical reaction during a recent 
trip to a dentist in a northern kansas city suburb 
when i gave the address of my place of business the 
receptionist who id never met looked at me and said arent you 
scared to be down there with the mafia mrs orlando said so a 
lot of people are still thinking about that 
in the last year the area has regained some of its former 
charm the private development company that bought many of the 
areas old buildings has leased more than 70 loft apartments to 
young professionals and couples many of whom work downtown 
another developer owns two buildings full of loft apartments where 
poets hold public readings on weekend nights 
the city has repaved streets and put in new lights brick 
sidewalks and trees this spring a museum housing a restored 
paddlewheel from a riverboat that sank in 1856 is scheduled to 
open 
the physical renovation is going really great said brian 
collins president of the economic development corp we have a 
lot of hopes for it in other cities this kind of market area has 
really sparked revivals 
the area evolved slowly from a stretch of river shorline into a 
a business district and farmers market the brother of tom 
pendergast a famous political boss once owned a tavern there but 
it was mostly warehouses by the time a local developer got the idea 
to attract artists and restaurants in 1972 
a year after the first shops and artists lofts opened 60 
businesses were operating but a surprisingly high number were 
bars as the area prospered the mob mucled in attempting to 
transform it into a redlight district 
then arson fires started the father of one bar owner who 
resisted mob intimidation was found slain in a car trunk other 
slayings followed artists moved away and customers stopped coming 
there was a time when i had to defend this project everywhere 
i went and everyone i talked to because of all that history ms 
guarino said i still run across that a little but not nearly as 
much now people want to know whats happening

with america facing the possibility of 
another war and the unbound optimism of the 1980s becoming 
threadbare the late phil ochs songs carry the same bite today as 
they did two decades ago 
and theyre getting wider play again at least in the east 
verses such as so young so strong so ready for the war so 
willing to go and die upon a foreign shore from one more 
parade could just as easily be a lament about soldiers marching 
off to the persian gulf as southeast asia 
and if you cant afford your bill dont tell me that youre 
ill cause thats the free enterprise way from the sarcastic 
ama song rings a chord for people hit by the spiraling cost of 
health care 
ochs sounds like oaks wrote those songs in the 60s 
when his gift for composing tuneful poisonpen letters to the 
establishment placed him near the top of the heap of popular folk 
singers 
i think everybody in the field at the time felt he had a great 
influence and was a great writer said dick cerri president of 
the world folk music association 
as a songwriter he was second to only bob dylan in the 
late 60s said ochs brother and former manager michael ochs 
but when the peace and love spirit of the woodstock generation 
withered in the early 70s so too did ochs spirit feeling he 
lost touch with his audience and his abilities he killed himself 
in 1976 at the age of 36 
but this is a case where the old cliche is true the death 
silenced ochs but not his music old ochs songs have been ringing 
out with regularity the last eight years in clubs from 
massachusetts to the masondixon line 
keeping the spirit of her younger brother alive sonny ochs has 
been organizing phil ochs song nights during which old folkies 
and younger performers highlight ochs extensive song catalog a 
typical performance recently in albany less than 40 miles from her 
rural middleburgh home featured national folk stars nancy tucker 
and magpie sharing a club stage with local acts 
i get all these people together through phils music ochs 
said 
she has been organizing the concerts since 1982 when choosing 
the lineup for a planned memorial show at the nowdefunct 
speakeasy in manhattan inadvertently fell in her lap 
i picked up the ball and ran with it and ive been running 
ever since she said 
ochs has since put on shows all over the east 
i just did not want the songs to die what would have been the 
point of his life if no one listened to them anymore she asked 
born dec 19 1940 in el paso texas phil ochs was mostly 
raised in the east following an inandout college career he 
headed to where every aspiring folkie headed in the early 60s 
greenwich village 
i was very arrogant at the time and i thought id be the best 
songwriter in the world he said but then i immediately met 
dylan and decided that id be the secondbest songwriter in the 
world 
ochs built a following on the strength of songs like i aint 
marchin any more and when im gone 
a keen observer and sharp wit in the tradition of woody guthrie 
ochs fired lyrical salvos at everyone from the nixon administration 
to fellow liberals his acid tongue attracted listeners but also 
scared a lot of people off 
everyone just assumed he was a raving commie but he wasnt 
said michael ochs not as lovable as peter paul amp mary or as 
dropdead cool as his estranged friend dylan ochs was mostly 
ignored by the mass media 
he was censored when he was alive sonny ochs said he 
couldnt get on national tv or radio 
even without media attention ochs could sell out a hall 
including carnegie hall three times and he relied on album sales 
he also maintained a high profile in the civil rights and antiwar 
movements 
but he grew disillusioned when the antiestablishment fervor 
faded after the 60s he moved on to more introspective songs and 
he became depressed 
he felt he didnt fit in anymore michael ochs said 
his sister said phil felt he lost his gift for writing songs he 
began avoiding live appearances and stopped writing songs 
he refused to even try she said the last three years 
were the worst 
on april 9 1976 he hanged himself in his sisters bathroom in 
new york city

early in the persian gulf crisis sen richard 
lugar was invited for a private dinner with the president and a few 
advisers in the living quarters upstairs at the white house 
for an hour and a half they talked about lugars public 
assertion earlier in the day that saddam hussein must either leave 
power or be removed 
president bush heard very well everything i had said the 
indiana republican later recalled in an interview when lugar told 
him he planned to repeat the same ideas in a speech the next day in 
indiana bush did not try to dissuade him even though the thought 
of removing saddam went well beyond any public administration 
position 
asked whether he was pushing bush to go farther or giving voice 
to things the president couldnt say himself lugar paused then 
smiled and said maybe both 
after five months of dealing with the crisis it is clear that 
some of the administrations toughest messages have been delivered 
through lugar the most respected foreign policy voice in the 
senate 
lugar is sure to play a big role in the new session of congress 
likely to be dominated by the gulf crisis after reassembling 
wednesday the nations lawmakers will have to decide whether the 
president can send american forces into an offensive war without 
first obtaining congressional consent 
to its own surprise congress also must look for a way to pad 
the impact of the economic downturn at a time when the deficit is 
growing beyond all expectations and it confronts the possibility 
that the nations banks will need a shoring up if not a 
fullscale bailout 
on the gulf issue lugar is sure to be heard he pressed 
unsuccessfully for an emergency congressional session to vote on 
a resolution endorsing bushs gulf policy he has aligned himself 
with a new group of congressional hawks formed to support a 
hardline approach 
in general he is the point man for the administration on the 
foreign relations committee said sen paul simon dill a 
member my assumption is that whatever he says he is also 
speaking for the administration or with their approval 
the crisis is giving still more prominence to lugar at 58 he 
is graying but trim a jogger a senate workhorse he was elected 
mayor of indianapolis when he was 35 and he remains loyal to bush 
even though it must have been painful when bush reached over him to 
select his junior partner in the senate dan quayle as his running 
mate in 1988 
not that everything lugar says on the gulf pleases bush lugar 
has been the nagging voice asking some unpopular questions 
what does the united states do if saddam hussein withdraws from 
kuwait but remains in power in his own country with a millionman 
army and nuclear ambitions 
who starves first if the international food supply to iraq is 
cut off soldiers or children 
why should congress be allowed to criticize the us military 
buildup and snipe at the administrations policy without a formal 
vote on whether it is willing to use military force to remove iraq 
from kuwait 
somebody in the public dialogue has to raise these 
questions lugar said he denied that he was the launcher of 
white house trial balloons but added my thinking is a fairly 
careful fit with the way they see the world 
that has not always been the case he earned his foreign policy 
credentials during the reagan administration most often by pushing 
the administration to do things it resisted 
lugar was the key to a policy shift that gave up on keeping 
ferdinand marcos in power in the philippines and he was a decisive 
vote when congress forced reagan to accept economic sanctions 
against south africa he also has been active in other arenas from 
central america to southeast asia 
and the only foreign aid authorization bill to be passed by 
congress during the past decade came during lugars brief tenure as 
chairman of the foreign relations committee in 198586 when the 
gop controlled the senate 
these days hes not even the senior republican on the 
committee that job belongs to jesse helms of north carolina who 
pulled seniority to beat lugar out of the post four years ago the 
bitterness lingers and the two senators barely speak to each 
other 
but lugars credibility on foreign policy comes not from his 
standing on the committee but his personal contacts and study 
around the globe 
he reads and studies issues visits with a number of 
specialists and travels a fair amount said colleague nancy 
kassebaum rkan who added that lugars game plan in foreign 
affairs isnt always clear he tends to keep his cards very close 
to his vest she said 
some have suspected that his toughness on the gulf issue might 
be a form of political inoculation against a preinvasion stand 
opposing sanctions on iraq for using poison gas against its own 
citizens 
sanctions would have hurt american farmers an important 
constituency for the indiana senator and would have damaged 
administration efforts at the time to strengthen iraq as a 
counterweight to islamic fundamentalism in neighboring iran 
but lugar denies that hes bending over backwards to make up for 
that stand saying he still opposes the use of food embargoes as a 
foreign policy tool because it starves the innocent 
instead he says he wants to help shape what bush has called 
one of the defining moments in history 
we are really coming to a crucial point as to whether there is 
the potential for the worlds people to unite in a crisis he 
said that seems to be a pretty sober responsibility things 
are going to happen and the consequences are going to be very 
substantial i just see this as an amazing opportunity

in the anemic environment that prevailed on wall 
street in 1990 medical and drug stocks proved to be the best 
prescription for financial health 
at the same time shares of bank and savings and loan holding 
companies dominated the markets sick list as the year drew to a 
close 
most broadbased indicators of stockprice trends showed 
doubledigit percentage losses for 1990 as of late december 
turning in their poorest performances since the bear market of 
198182 
just 11 of 82 stock groups tracked by dow jones amp cos 
industrygroup indexes posted gains for the year through the close 
of trading on dec 21 
among the gainers the medical and biotechnology group led the 
pack with an advance of better than 20 percent followed by medical 
supplies pharmaceutical manufacturers healthcare providers and 
retail drug chains 
the performance of these stocks testifies that health care 
remains a booming though by no means troublefree business in the 
early 1990s 
while the nation debates what to do about soaring health costs 
and uneven distribution of medical services many companies in the 
field continue to thrive as the population ages and seeks longer 
healthier lives 
technology and other innovation add an extra measure of 
opportunity however risky in business terms for venturesome 
healthcare enterprises both large and small 
a justpublished quarterly report by the value line investment 
survey on the medical supplies industry cites growing demand for 
health care a decent pricing environment and the entry of more 
highmargined products as major reasons for recent enthusiasm 
over stocks of this kind 
even the gloomy outlook for the economy has worked in favor of 
healthcare stocks by encouraging investors to look for 
defensive issues that are insulated from the effects of a 
business slump 
as value line observed in its latest evaluation of the drug 
stocks pharmaceutical manufacturers have always been known for 
their defensive characteristics 
they look particularly recessionresistant this time around 
due to the elimination of many lowmargined nonhealth care product 
lines over the course of the last several years 
a standout example of a winning healthcare stock in 1990 us 
surgical producer of a line of products used in surgical stapling 
which soared from 24lsqb in january to a recent high just under 70 
turn us surgicals stock chart upside down and you would have 
a pretty fair representation of what happened to many bank and 
savings and loan issues over the past year 
dow joness sampl index fell nearly 60 percent its gauge of 
moneycenter banks dropped 37 percent and its composite of 
regional banks from the various corners of the country lost 40 
percent 
the story gets even more somber when you look at the behavior of 
many individual issues from the banking and sampl sector for 
example bank of new england which fell from above 9 to less than 
1 for a drop of about 93 percent 
first city bancorp crossland savings unionfed financial 
citytrust bancorp and homefed all suffered declines of more than 80 
percent 
in the last few weeks of 1990 many depressed financial issues 
have rallied a bit on buy orders from investors attracted by 
distress merchandise 
if the upswing in bank stocks were to continue analysts say it 
might start shaping up as a signal that the worst of the nations 
spell of debt retrenchment and credit crunch were past 
but whether any such hopes are warranted now remains to be 
determined in 1991

not long ago yolanda whitaker was just another 
kid growing up among gangs and drugs in southcentral los angeles 
when she walked home from school crips gang members threw rocks at 
her because she lived in a bloods neighborhood 
fast forward five years 
yolanda is now known as yoyo one of the leading female rappers 
to emerge from the decadelong maledominated rap revolution 
shes only 19 and she has just one album to her name but shes 
made enough money to buy her own apartment in hawthorne a quiet 
los angeles suburb light years away from watts 
she also gives women a voice in the macho often misogynistic 
rap industry with such songs as put a lid on it she sends a 
message to the kind of teenage girls she grew up with urging them 
not to have sex and babies so freely 
or as she might say onstage shes wreckin rhymes and taking 
names 
i address most of my rhymes to the ladies she said during a 
recent interview while on tour in new york the ladies are 
struggling i try to inspire them to go after what they want and 
work on their selfesteem 
yoyo a protege of former nwa member ice cube is one of about 
a dozen leading female rappers to break out in the last few years 
their journey from anonymity to fame and fortune they can make up 
to 30000 and more per week on tour came astonishingly fast for 
most of them 
in an industry in which rap superstar mc hammer whose age 
varies from 27 to 35 in published reports might be considered 
almost ancient leading women rappers such as yoyo queen latifah 
mc lyte salt n pepa monie love nikki d shelly thunder 
oaktown 357 tarrie b shazzy and ms melodie are between the 
ages of 18 and 25 
despite their youth many are preternaturally wise and 
selfconfident yoyo queen latifah and nikki d are all barely out 
of high school but hold forth in interviews and on stage like 
wizened street sages 
you have to be tough said nikki d people will pull you 
back in a heartbeat 
nikki d 22 sports a gold front tooth and grew up as nichele 
strong in a middleclass los angeles neighborhood but she went to 
school with all the rough guys from the projects she began 
smalltime rapping in roller rinks and small clubs 
she met rapper icet at a culver city calif mall and he asked 
her to perform with him when she was 18 she and a friend took a 
bus to new york city arriving with only 35 cents a year later 
nikki d was the first female rapper signed to def jam records 
but some of the swagger of female rappers is as much part of the 
act as the attire many female rappers wear what they call 
bgirl for beat clothes baggy sweatshirts jeans 
hightops and baseball caps queen latifah has made regal 
afrocentric clothing her trademark 
they are the descendants of the few women such as funky four 
plus one more who began in the early days of rap in the late 1970s 
and others like roxanne shante and salt n pepa who rode the wave 
of the first commercially successful female rappers beginning in 
1985 
some such as yoyo grew up on mean streets with the 
gangstas that have become part of rap legend others lived near 
the fringe of tough neighborhoods in new york city and north 
jersey or from gangridden areas like compton and watts in los 
angeles most write their own rhymes 
they include 20yearold queen latifah the preeminent female 
rapper who was raised in nwark and east orange nj and led the 
irvington nj high school womens basketball team to two 
consecutive championships before abandoning sports for the mike 
i think rap brings reality to people who arent from the inner 
city said latifah during a break from recording her next album 
whether you consider it positive or negative were teaching 
reality 
latifah nee dana owens began rapping in high school where she 
started as a human beat box for two girlfriends known as ladies 
fresh 
she started making demos with the help of friends she met in the 
rap industry and finally scored with princess of the posse 
which was shown on yo mtv raps and led to a contract with 
tommy boy records 
her debut was titled all hail the queen members of her 
posse usually wear jackets labeled the queens army 
more than any of her peers latifah epitomizes the proud regal 
takenoprisoners attitude of female rappers in stark contrast to 
the lyrics of male rap groups 2 live crew nwa public enemy and 
others many female rappers write rhymes to raise the 
consciousness and selfesteem of women 
yoyo recently started the ibwc intelligent black womens 
coalition which she said is aimed at increasing the status and 
selfesteem of all women 
though women are often referred to as bitches and hos 
whores and portrayed negatively by male rappers the majority of 
women rappers say they do not take offense 
none of it bothers me said nikki d i wouldnt down any 
rap its like our own language and not everyone understands that 
and the thing is there are a lot of women like that 
nikki ds lyrics are more macho than some including the singles 
lettin off steam and up the ante for the panties 
the women said that they believe many male rappers put down 
women because of the number of groupies who surround rap stars 
there are a set of women who are golddiggers who will do 
anything for a guy sleep with him one night and never see him 
again and thats ok said nikki d whose own boyfriend fellow 
rapper apache accompanies her on tour 
latifah concurred 
the girls they talk about have no respect for themselves and 
theyre materialistic she said im not like that 
latifah wants her music such songs as the anthem ladies 
first and latifahs law to uplift women 
youve got to be positive and strong and respect yourself 
she said 
rap would seem to be a tough field to break into but many 
female rappers said they were encouraged by their male 
counterparts 
they were very cool with me said latifah i had no 
problem with the guys i didnt get putdowns 
nikki d still remembers the day in may 1987 when she came back 
to a friends apartment in new york and heard the voice of rap 
impresario russell simmons on the answering machine 
simmons had just listened to her demo and liked what he heard 
he was yellin shes dope shes dope where is she i want 
her she recalled i was like ecstatic

the closer 1991 gets the dicier it looks to wall 
street analysts trying to sort out prospects for the economy and 
corporate profits 
the news on business activity has grown gloomier and gloomier in 
the waning weeks of 1990 challenging widespread hopes in the 
financial world that the economy might face nothing worse than a 
short and shallow recession 
the portents for the near future dont offer much consolation 
on friday the commerce department reported a fifth consecutive 
monthly decline in the index of leading economic indicators 
many forecasters also lament that the special characteristics of 
the current slump make its dangers hard to gauge 
in most downturns of the past few decades recessions ran their 
course as businesses were able to work down inventories that had 
built up in booming inflationary periods 
now most observers agree the prime source of trouble lies not 
in production and distribution but rather in finance 
specifically the accumulated debts of the past decade or more 
in the absence of much recent precedent analysts say it is 
tough to calculate how long it might take or how much pain will be 
required to complete the process of debt retrenchment 
the need to reliquify after a decade of debt accumulation 
should be the overriding force in the years ahead said jack 
lavery director of global research at merrill lynch 
the economy will likely remain in recession until the second 
half of 1991 the recession is likely to be about average in length 
and severity with direction of risk on the weaker and more 
protracted side 
we hate to be skeptical adds robert nurock a paoli pa 
investment advisor 
however we see little evidence that the economy is close to 
bottoming in fact we believe that most of the recently released 
data implies that the decline is accelerating 
amid such misgivings stock prices drifted lower in the past 
week in extremely light activity surrounding the christmas holiday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 445 to 262921 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 122 to 17965 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market dropped 
241 to 37120 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 155 at 30465 
volume on the big board averaged only 8747 million shares a 
day down from 17670 million the week before 
even if the recession as it is ultimately defined by 
economists turns out to be relatively mild many analysts worry 
that the ensuing recovery could be slow and painful 
once the us economy emerges from the recession or 
nearrecession we expect sluggish growth for years to come 
gerald rothstein at oppenheimer amp co told the firms clients 
overall growth will be hampered by the hangover from 
privatesector leverage and the need for private funds to be used 
to fund the federal deficit and the savings and loan and perhaps 
banking crisis 
or as analysts at the firm of griggs amp santow put it this 
slowdown has its origins in the excesses of the 1980s 
specifically the decision by all sectors of the economy to greatly 
expand their debts and to take greater risks 
all these activities were largely financed by institutions 
that now find themselves the notsoproud owners of real estate and 
securities that are under water 
the real estate and junkbond markets face problems now that go 
well beyond any questions of federal reserve policy or the level of 
interest rates the firm asserts 
thus look for the fed recognizing the nature of this 
downturn to move cautiously despite its recent aggressiveness 
and for the economy to recover from this downturn very slowly

it took the closing of an oklahoma 
foundry to get singer joe diffie into the country music business 
he had long dreamed of having a career in music and when he was 
laid off in 1986 he decided to move to nashville and pursue one 
the twist of fate paid off diffies first record home was 
a no 1 hit in november 
seeing it come to fruition is very gratifying the 
31yearold performer said in an interview during his third day 
back in nashville after a whirlwind fiveweek tour of 
onenighters 
diffie had been working at the foundry in duncan okla running 
a core machine when he lost his job and his 1700amonth salary 
i never had any hair left on my arms it was always singed 
off he recalled about the job i always had burns all over me 
i detested every second of the job i didnt like any aspect of it 
except the people there 
it was a blessing in disguise when it shut down if it hadnt 
id probably still be there or some place like it 
after reaching nashville he took a job for 1 years in the 
shipping and receiving department at the gibson guitar factory 
home spent six weeks in the top 10 on the country music 
popularity charts faring better than tunes by more estalished 
singers such as anne murray and eddie rabbitt 
the wistful song is about the values of home life 
a swimming hole and fishing pole and the feel of the muddy 
road between my toes 
a back yard swing where i would sit and mom would sing 
amazing grace while she hung out the clothes 
an easy chair with my daddy there and the smell of sunday 
supper on the stove 
diffie said the song stirred strong emotions 
i think everybody related to it regardless of whether they 
were raised in the country or city because everybody has a home in 
their memory when i first heard it i got a lump in my throat it 
brings back a feeling of when you were younger safe and secure 
without any worries and no problems 
it was a sweet song but not too syrupy 
the tune is on his first album a thousand winding roads on 
epic records the lp is a mixture of ballads and uptempo songs 
performed in a style described by billboard magazine as randy 
travis with a merle haggard catch to his voice 
his second single released from the album is if you want me 
to a traditional country weeper about a man offering to leave 
his lover if thats what she wants 
another cut on the lp there goes the neighborhood is a 
ballad about marriages dissolving the cut almost home is about 
the decline of an aging parent 
diffie who cowrote four of the songs on the album says hes 
taken advantage of a new era in country music 
theres been a changing of the guard in country music the 
listeners the artists the radio stations and the people producing 
the records he said 
the songs are getting better and better with the new 
songwriters coming in thats not to say the old ones are bad but 
its almost like country music has got a little edge to it now 
some of the more sensitive matters are being touched upon 
diffie is a native of the duncan area and spent much of his life 
there his father had a huge collection of country music and his 
parents instilled in him a love of the music he remembers singing 
amazing grace you are my sunshine and peace in the 
valley with his two sisters while they traveled in the family 
pickup truck 
he briefly attended cameron university in oklahoma and eyed a 
career as a heart surgeon or chiropractor but he was more 
interested in music 
he has a sixpiece band and a fan club with the catchy name 
diffie cult keeping things in the family his mother is its 
president

the nations only law regulating video 
display terminal use was signed thursday by mayor art agnos who 
touted the ordinance as being on the cutting edge of social 
change 
the law covers city workers and businesses with 15 or more 
employees 
it requires employers to provide adjustable work stations 
regular breaks and training on safe use of vdts the law also 
recommends that pregnant vdt users be shifted to other work if they 
request it 
employers would have been given two years to make the changes 
but a compromise worked out last weekend between agnos and business 
and labor leaders gives employers four years to comply 
this legislation will ensure san francisco workers are 
protected from dangerous injury without driving away businesses 
agnos said its legislation on the cutting edge of social 
change 
one voice raised against the measure is that of tom hsieh a 
member of the board of supervisors who contends it violates the 
city charter legal authorities in city hall say hes wrong 
a similar ordinance passed in 1988 in suffolk county on new 
yorks long island and bitterly opposed by business owners was 
overturned a year later by a state court on the grounds the local 
government lacked authority to make such rules that decision is 
under appeal 
the san francisco legislation was pushed by a coalition of 
activists who cited potential risks to vdt operators including 
repetitive strain injury back and neck pain deteriorating vision 
and miscarriage 
hsieh said the city charter prohibits supervisors from changing 
working conditions for city employees without studies by the civil 
service commission jonathan holtzman special assistant in the 
city attorneys office said the provision only applies to changes 
in pay not safety measures 
the law will affect an estimated 56000 workers in its first 30 
months it will cost businesses about 14 million said paul 
varacalli executive director of service employees international 
union local 590 which backed the measure 
he estimated the cost of bringing the city into compliance at 
231552 
the 11member board of supervisors is to vote next month on the 
compromise program of compliance 
under the program new equipment would have to meet standards 
set in the ordinance after one year for existing work stations 
retrofitting costing less than 250 would have to be completed 
within 30 months retrofitting costing more than 250 would have to 
be completed within four years 
the compromise was reached after business and labor officials 
said time constraints in the ordinance were unacceptable 
we hope that careful administration of this ordinance provides 
something we all can live with said gwen kaplan president of 
the san francisco small business association at best its a 
first step toward longrange solutions 
varacalli said the push to provide legal guarantees for vdt 
safety wont end in san francisco 
we know it cannot stop here this is the beginning we had to 
have a beginning he said

eighteen directors of mazda motor corp are 
voluntarily taking temporary pay cuts to impress upon employees the 
seriousness of a government warning to pay stricter attention to 
car safety 
in japan there is an old saying that superiors must suffer 
first in order to motivate workers mazda spokesman tetsuo nagase 
said thursday explaining the action announced a day earlier 
mazda said wednesday that chairman kenichi yamamoto and 17 other 
directors would take a pay cut of 5 percent to 10 percent in the 
first three months of 1991 in connection with a recall of nearly 
3500 cars 
the pay cuts were decided after the transport ministry 
investigating charges that mazda has been replacing defective parts 
during routine maintenance without recalling the cars or notifying 
the government warned the company to pay stricter attention to 
safety 
after the warning mazda notified the ministry tuesday it would 
recall 3498 luce model passenger cars produced between aug 8 
1986 and jan 31 1987 because of switch defects in their stop 
lights and cruise control mechanisms 
nagase said the directors pay cut has a very symbolic meaning 
and employees will realize it we believe cutting directors 
salaries is a more effective way of having workers realize the 
importance of the matter than cutting workers pay 
he also said it would have been very unjapanese to try to 
pinpoint an individual or department for blame 
pinpointing who is responsible and firing him would not solve 
the problem nagase said 
hajime karatsu a professor at the research and development 
institute of tokai university said that whenever something goes 
wrong for japanese corporations the first move is for directors to 
take salary cuts 
in extreme cases business and political leaders offer their 
resignations in a recent example the chairman of sumitomo bank 
stepped down to take responsibility for illegal loans allegedly 
arranged by a branch manager for stock manipulation 
all the responsibility should be placed with managers thats 
the way of thinking in japan karatsu said 
he said actions such as executive pay cuts were a modern form of 
harakiri the ritual suicide by disembowelment practiced by 
highranking japanese to avoid disgrace 
but spokesman nagase said mazda did not view the government 
warning as a matter for which the company needed to take 
responsibility he said mazda broke no laws and violated no 
regulations 
we and our president have acknowledged that our judgment was a 
bit shortsighted he said 
he said company officials told the ministry that mazda will try 
to streamline its quality check systems

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge dropped for the fifth consecutive month in november the 
government said today in a report that offered little hope the 
slumping economy would recover soon 
the 12 percent plunge in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators followed an even worse 13 percent drop 
in october that decline revised from a previous estimate of 12 
percent was the worst since november 1987 
the latest steep drop follows a spate of gloomy economic news 
for the month including a jump in the unemployment rate and 
plunging orders for big ticket durable goods such as 
automobiles and appliances it was seen as a sign the economy would 
continue to deteriorate 
i think its consistent with the other evidence that the 
recession is clearly in place and clearly has further to go said 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
stock prices slipped this morning in early trading following the 
release of the report 
the november indicators leave no doubt that a serious and 
lengthy recession is under way said economist william k 
macreynolds of the us chamber of commerce the only remaining 
questions are just how far the economy will plummet and how long it 
will stay there 
three consecutive declines in the index designed to predict 
economic activity six to nine months in advance are considered a 
fairly good but not infallible sign a recession is approaching 
the index rose slightly as recently as june but most private 
economists believe the nation has already toppled into a recession 
in november eight of the 11 forwardlooking components of the 
index fell 
pulling the index down in order of importance were a decline 
in new orders to factories for consumer goods a drop in prices of 
raw materials a decline in the backlog of unfilled orders at 
factories a fall in new orders for business investment equipment 
a jump in new claims for unemployment benefits a decline in the 
average workweek a contraction in the inflationadjusted money 
supply and a drop in building permits 
the only positive contributors were an increase in stock prices 
a slowing in business delivery times and a slight improvement in 
consumer confidence following a plunge after iraqs august invasion 
of kuwait 
the various changes left the index at 1397 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 down 44 percent from its 1462 peak in june it has 
been the worst multiplemonth retreat by the index since 1981 at 
the start of the last recession 
the consensus of most analysts so far is that the current 
economic contraction will be a relatively mild one shorter and 
less harsh than the 16month 198182 recession which was the worst 
since the great depression 
an outbreak of war in the persian gulf could change that by 
sending oil prices soaring again thus squelching any tendency for 
the economy to start growing again 
the blue chip economic indicators a consensus forecast of 52 
top economists says the economy already is in a recession on 
average it expects th gross national product to decline 13 
percent in the septemberdecember quarter and an additional 09 
percent during the first three months of 1991 a recession is 
usually defined as at least two consecutive quarters of 
contraction 
the forecasters predict the economy will begin growing again in 
the second quarter next year 
however a significant minority of analysts say the nation is 
heading for a protracted and deep recession they were further 
discouraged thursday when the commerce department reported new 
orders for durable goods plunged 105 percent in november 
that matched the sharpest decline on record set last january 
and depressed orders to the lowest level in 2 years 
im in the pessimistic camp i think this recession will be 
one of the longer ones in the postworld war ii period said 
economist sung won sohn of norwest corp in minneapolis 
sohn said the drop in orders means that factory payrolls which 
have declined by 800000 jobs since january 1989 200000 in 
november alone will shrink further 
rep lee hamilton chairman of the congressional joint economic 
committee predicted thursday that the nations unemployment rate 
could rise to nearly 8 percent from the current 59 percent thats 
about 15 percentage points worse than most private analysts are 
expecting 
we will in fact have a recession hamilton dind said 
in his 1991 outlook he based his jobless rate forecast on average 
increases in unemployment in downturns since world war ii

american airlines inc says its pilots unreliable 
attendance will force the nations secondlargest carrier to reduce 
its schedule by about 4 percent and lay off some employees 
meanwhile the pilots union has told members to obey a temporary 
restraining order against the tactics that management alleges have 
caused delays and flight cancellations 
the allied pilots association has denied americans charges that 
pilots have been staging sickouts taxiing slowly to waste fuel and 
filing frivolous requests for equipment maintenance 
but a taped message from apa president fred vogel on thursday 
advised pilots not to employ supposedly contrived slowdown 
devices or to call in sick if they are not ill the dallas 
morning news reported 
the apa which represents the fort worthbased carriers 8700 
pilots has been in contract talks since october 1989 the old 
contract expired jan 1 1990 
american spokeswoman lise olson said typically 300 pilots will 
call in sick on a given day but since dec 21 more than 500 a day 
have been out sick some 250 pilots are over in saudi arabia for 
operation desert shield and that compounds the problem she added 
the temporary restraining order came late wednesday from us 
district judge john mcbryde barring pilots from actions designed to 
influence contract negotiations 
the union said it will challenge the ruling which it called a 
rush to judgment 
vogel an american pilot raised concerns that management may 
use the order in a way that will impair safe operations 
the message told union members the responsibility for safe 
operation of the aircraft is yours and neither the company nor the 
court will help you if there is an incident in which you say you 
were influenced by the courts order 
american spokesman tim smith denied thursday that pilots would 
be jeopardizing air safety by obeying the judges order 
nobody is asking anyone to compromise safety and i dont 
think anyone has compromised safety smith said were talking 
about unnecessary safety or mechanical writeups that were not 
borne out in fact 
mcbryde set a jan 3 hearing date to determine whether the 
temporary injunction should be made permanent 
by late thursday 24 flights were canceled 13 of them 
crewrelated smith said since sunday 352 flights have been 
canceled including 78 that were crewrelated the airline handles 
about 2300 flights per day 
smith said decisions on what flights would be reduced and who 
would be laid off will not be made until next month the airline 
will seek to cut flights from areas with the least demand he said 
and passengers booked on those flights will be notified in advance

november 
the 12 percent decline in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators followed a 13 percent drop in october 
three consecutive declines in the index which is designed to

considered a strong sign of an impending recession

with recession on most economists calendars for 
the first half of 1991 the outlook for bonds is good 
us treasury bonds the safest investment available 
historically do well in recessions as the stock market real estate 
and other investments appear at their riskiest 
economists forecast rallying bond prices will push the yield for 
the 30year treasury bond down to around 75 percent in 1991 the 
benchmark bond has been yielding around 830 percent in recent days 
and was above 9 percent as recently as early october 
the bond market has been rallying since the federal reserve 
early last month signaled it was ready to lower interest rates to 
increase economic activity 
the fed cut its target for the federal funds rate three times in 
december in 025 percentage point increments to 7 percent the 
central bank also lowered the discount rate by 050 percentage 
point to 65 percent 
the fed funds rate is the overnight loan rate between banks the 
discount rate is the feds loan fee to banks 
two factors could strongly affect bond prices and their yields 
the persian gulf crisis continues to be unpredictable and federal 
reserve policy as always will influence bond yields 
there is strong pressure from washington for the fed to ease 
more aggressively however some on wall street are concerned that 
lowering interest rates too much would cause more inflation which 
erodes the value of fixedincome securities like bonds 
if the fed moves too quickly inflation expectations could 
rise said lawrence a kudlow chief economist at bear stearns amp 
co as it has thus far the fed should take its cue from the bond 
market and gold prices according to kudlow falling gold prices 
and rising bond prices should precede another fed easing move he 
said 
kudlow expects longterm bond yields to fall to 760 percent by 
midyear and fluctuate around there for the rest of the year 
john lonski senior economist at moodys investors service inc 
expects longterm interest rates could fall to 735 percent if core 
inflation excluding food and energy is significantly reduced 
increased government borrowing will put pressure on bond 
yields but cutbacks in private sector borrowing will ensure an 
adequate amount of funds he said also banks and others will 
put more money in treasury securities 
the safety of treasury bills notes and bonds historically 
attracts investors wary of the risks inherent to investing in a 
recession treasury securities are seen as extremely safe because 
they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us 
government if the federal government couldnt pay its debts money 
wouldnt be of much use because the economy would be in shambles 
corporate bond prices are expected to follow treasury bonds the 
fortunes of corporate borrowers and their ability to repay debt 
will be helped if interest rates go lower 
the corporate market is basically trying to determine the 
outlook for profits cash flows and credit worthiness theres 
nothing better than lower interest rates kudlow said 
junk bonds will probably still be in the dumper in the coming 
year 
in 1990 22 billion in corporate bonds issued by 91 companies 
defaulted according to preliminary numbers compiled by the bond 
investors association in 1991 the nonprofit group that tracks 
bond defaults expects 25 billion worth of corporate debt to 
default 
the recession combined with the absence of demand for new 
issues of junk bonds is causing the spiraling default rates said 
c richard lehmann bia president 
before the collapse of the junk bond market issuers could avoid 
default and restructure their debt by floating new bonds now that 
junk bond buyers have all but disappeared that option has been 
removed 
the trend lately has been for issuers to give up equity to 
bondholders to entice them to agree to a restructuring 
some investors most notably twa chairman carl c icahn have 
been selectively buying junk bonds with hopes of picking up a 
profit in a debtforequity swap

former vernon savings association owner don r 
dixon will remain in jail until his february sentencing on bank 
fraud charges a federal magistrate ruled friday 
dixon has been jailed without bond since his conviction dec 20 
on 23 bank fraud charges 
attorneys asked us magistrate john tolle to release dixon 
friday pending sentencing on feb 19 eighteen witnesses testified 
on dixons behalf including his wife and former minister 
but the judge said the testimony did not refute government 
evidence that the former vernon owner was likely to flee 
after dixons conviction federal prosecutors asked that he be 
jailed without bail because fbi investigators suspect he has money 
stashed in foreign bank accounts and might flee the country 
dixon dressed in an orange jail uniform listened quietly 
during the ruling 
in the court papers dixon said he is not under any 
circumstances likely to flee 
among the paperwork submitted on his behalf were 81 letters from 
relatives friends and business associates 
one of the letters was from dixons 6yearold granddaughter 
written in her firstgrade scrawl it reads dear judge can big 
daddy get out of jail he will not leave town love candice 
deborah goodall an attorney for dixon said the defense sought 
to prove that dixon is not a flight risk she said the letters 
submitted to the court show that dixon has a long solid history 
of facing his problems rather than avoiding them 
dixon said he needs to be free until sentencing so he can 
implement a family survival plan based on the probability i will 
be incarcerated for some considerable time 
vernon savings failed in 1987 and its bailout is expected to 
cost taxpayers more than 12 billion 
dixon and his wife dana declared personal bankruptcy in 1987 
and dixon said he has no money or other financial resources of any 
consequence 
he has supported his wife three of his eight children and his 
motherinlaw for the past two years he said with about 9000 a 
month that he has borrowed from relatives and other sources and 
earned as an independent financial consultant

cashstrapped pan am said friday it has had no 
word from twa owner carl icahn on whether his takeover proposal 
still stands and whether the ouster of pan am chairman thomas 
plaskett was a condition for the deal 
officials at trans world airlines suburban mount kisco ny 
offices did not return several phone calls seeking confirmation 
that plasketts removal was on a list of terms attached to a 
proposed merger of the two carriers 
that caveat was cited by unidentified sources quoted in fridays 
editions of the wall street journal and the new york times 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said that while the proposal to 
remove plaskett has not been forthcoming from mr icahn mr 
plaskett will do whatever is in the best interest of pan am and its 
shareholders that presumably does not preclude stepping down 
from the executive suite 
the journal said icahn was understood to lack confidence in 
plasketts management abilities plaskett who once led an investor 
group on an abortive attempt to acquire northwest airlines parent 
nwa inc has been trying to sell off pan am assets to raise cash 
to keep the carrier alive 
the marriage maneuvering between twa and pan am is the latest 
sign of how a declining us economy and a sharp rise in jet fuel 
prices since the persian gulf crisis last august have severely hurt 
the airline industry especially financially weak carriers such as 
twa and pan am 
both airlines pioneered overseas travel and were once leading 
international competitors but are now scrambling to retrench and 
shrink to the benefit of healthier airlines pan am already has 
sold some of its most attractive european routes to united 
airlines while twa has done the same in a deal with american 
airlines 
icahn earlier this month suggested he would be willing to 
acquire pan am for 225 million in cash and 150 million in debt 
securities but he has yet to present pan am with a formal 
proposal 
apparently there was some confusion over when exactly icahn 
would unveil his merger plan to pan am bickering erupted after 
icahn claimed pan am canceled a meeting last monday pan am 
countered that no meeting had been scheduled 
part of icahns proposal is understood to require pan am to seek 
chapter 11 protection from creditors in order to receive a large 
loan to carry it until the merger with twa is consummated 
pan am disagrees with that approach the company is opposed to 
entering into an agreement with mr icahn that has as a condition 
the company filing chapter 11 hanlon said 
the newspaper reports said icahn would replace plaskett with pan 
ams chief financial officer richard francis who has been 
negotiating with the twa chief the carriers general counsel 
roger cooke also would be retained the published accounts said 
plaskett is not believed to have been directly involved in the 
talks with the icahn team 
while acquirers often replace managers once a deal is completed 
its less typical for personnel issues to surface so early in 
negotiations

fees earned on wall street for underwriting 
corporate stocks and bonds plunged in 1990 to a sixyear low 
providing further statistical evidence that the booming 1980s have 
died 
combined with a sharp drop in other critical investment banking 
activity and thousands of layoffs analysts said the figures 
released friday signal losses at many securities firms for the 
year 
its definitely meaning weaker profitability for all the 
firms even historically strong ones said mara hilderman a 
senior analyst with moodys investors service 
investment banking fees from new issues of stocks and bonds 
plunged 38 percent to 193 billion from 309 billion in 1989 
securities data co reported the figure was the lowest since 141 
billion in 1984 before wall streets threeyear surge 
despite the decline overall new issues reached a record 312 
billion up from 309 million last year said securities data a 
newark njbased firm that compiles wall street statistics 
but securities industry experts said the total masked a 
fundamental malaise in corporate america and on wall street other 
figures showed that a late1990 decline had begun to set in due to 
the slumping economy and middle east crisis 
idd information services inc another wall street data firm 
said total domestic underwriting volume in the fourth quarter of 
1990 declined sharply from the same 1989 period 
were in a market thats in a doldrums said samuel b hayes 
iii an investment banking professor at the harvard business 
school for corporations the prospect of selling stock at this 
point looks as though its very expensive money 
securities data said the total volume of common stock issued 
fell 16 percent to 192 billion in 1990 while initial public 
offerings of stock tumbled 26 percent to 137 billion 
those figures reflect companies diminished ability and desire 
to raise money by selling shares to the public hayes said that as 
stock prices dropped in 1990 corporations balked at selling what 
would have amounted to cheap shares 
wall street firms serve as intermediaries for stock and bond 
offerings they acquire the securities from companies and then 
resell them to the public charging a fee for the service 
raising money by offering debt in the form of corporate bonds 
rose by 36 percent in 1990 to 2825 billion idd reported but 
several key component areas fell including straight debt and junk 
bonds 
the market for risky highyield bonds dried up with just 10 
junk bond offerings totaling 13 billion in 1990 compared to 25 
issues totaling 253 billion in 1989 idd said 
despite the overall rise in total new issues fees declined 
because of increased competition and the drop in common stock and 
junk bond underwriting which historically has generated the 
largest fees analysts said 
more japanese german and swiss investment firms are competing 
with domestic firms for us deals also the growth of practices 
such as shelf underwriting in which a company opens the 
bidding among investment firms for a deal have driven down fee 
commissions 
theres just been an absolute compression on fees because of 
intense competition hilderman said 
not all of wall streets losses are due to the decline in 
underwriting fees other key areas for big investment banks also 
fell sharply in 1990 particularly mergers and acquisitions fees 
and takeoverstock speculation 
securities firms are cutting back to stanch losses they are 
slashing payrolls abandoning struggling business areas and 
focusing activities on moneyproducing areas such as stock and 
bond trading 
in the third quarter of 1990 new york stock exchange member 
firms lost 124 million for the first nine months of the year 
profits were just 22 million compared with 128 billion the same 
yearago period less than half of the 334 firms reporting were 
profitable the nyse said 
since peaking at 262000 workers at the end of the september 
1987 industrywide employment stood at 214000 at the end of 
september this year the securities industry association said 
several thousand jobs in the last three months have pushed the 
employment decline over 5000

the lowest silver prices in nearly 15 years arent stimulating 
much demand but some analysts see modest gains for investors 
willing to wait 
im not so sure weve seen the ultimate lows said bernard 
savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber inc 
nevertheless investor buying during the last two weeks of 1990 
helped lift the spot silver price on new yorks commodity exchange 
back above 4 per troy ounce after it fell on dec 14 to 393 the 
lowest level since february 1976 
silver for january delivery settled friday at 419 a troy ounce 
compared with 4038 a week earlier 
i think some large investors are taking a renewed look at 
silver at these low prices said research analyst joseph rosta of 
cpm group a preciousmetal research and consulting firm in new 
york 
silver prices are extremely low and i think that on the part 
of some major players in the market there is a feeling that prices 
may be reaching a cyclical low he said 
silvers value tumbled this year from more than 5 an ounce as 
the economy weakened sliding stock prices and slowing industrial 
output raised concerns about demand for silver from the electronics 
and jewelry industries which together account for about 60 percent 
of silver consumption and the photographic industry which 
represents about 40 percent of silver demand 
a general easing of inflation fears in the second half of the 
year prompted unloading of silver bullion by investors who tend to 
buy precious metals as an inflation hedge 
domestic silver consumption in the coming year is generally 
expected to outpace the supply of newly mined and recycled silver 
but us stockpiles are more than adequate to meet the demand 
the silver institute an industry trade group estimates 1990 
us industrial consumption at 123 million troy ounces the 
commodity exchange reported silver inventories of more than 265 
million ounces as of thursday 
as long as we have comex stocks representing well over two 
years of consumption it is unlikely that we will have a 
sustainable rally in silver prices said painewebber analyst fred 
demler 
he said silver could test 380 an ounce in 1991 and he would 
not rule out the possibility of a slide to 350 on a very 
shortterm basis 
rosta said he concurred with the silver institutes cautiously 
bullish longrange forecast for silver in the 1990s which projects 
a 3 percent to 4 percent annual increase in silver demand versus a 
2 percent rise in supply per annum 
demler agreed that silver has the potential to provide a decent 
return in the long run 
for those looking to hold silver for five to 10 years these 
are very attractive levels he said 
on the other hand anyone who bought silver 10 or 15 years ago 
and held it has a loss on their hands at this point

fall when dealings shifted to europe as investors took profits 
shortly before the us market opened the dollar fell hard 
across the board and was unable to stage a convincing recovery 
said marc chandler an analyst with the firm idea 
traders received more negative news about the us economy in a 
commerce department report showing that the index of leading 
economic indicators fell 12 percent in november its fifth 
consecutive monthly decline normally three consecutive monthly 
declines indicate a recession is imminent 
it was much below expectations chandler said of the figure 
as the economy weakens pressure builds on the federal reserve to 
lower interest rates to stimulate growth but lower interest rates 
are bearish for the dollar because they erode the value of 
fixedincome investments like bonds 
the sharp decline in the dollar came despite a political 
backdrop that would appear to support the currency tensions in the 
persian gulf as well as political strife in the soviet union might 
encourage investors to seek a safe haven in the dollar 
chandler maintained that the us currency would trade still 
lower if not for these political developments the full 
dimensions of the current economic contraction arent being fully 
appreciated by the market he said

canadas stateowned nuclear power 
company signed a 535 million us contract friday to build a 
nuclear power plant for korea electric power corp 
the deal is a coup for the canadian government and caps more 
than 10 years of sales efforts by its atomic energy of canada ltd 
or aecl it will be the second canadian reactor built in korea 
officials said the 700000kilowatt power plant estimated to 
cost a total of about 1 billion us will be built in wolsong 
160 miles southeast of seoul it will be built next to the first 
canadian reactor which has been operating since 1983 
were ecstatic said william b schumacher the canadian 
ambassador to south korea a deal of this size has implications 
for bilateral relations it opens up a basis for broadening even 
further the relationship 
south korea and canada are each others fifthlargest trading 
partners trade between the companies is expected to reach 4 
billion us in 1990 
the korean power company or kepco has nine nuclear power 
plants in operation and two more under construction the government 
expects to have 50 nuclear plants in operation in the next 40 
years 
a nuclear reactor provides heat that converts water into steam 
the steam is then fed from the reactor into a turbine system to 
convert into electricity 
schumacher said south korea is the only country using two 
complementary kinds of nuclear reactors a heavywater reactor 
developed by canada and the more commonly used pressure water 
reactors 
the canadian model uses natural uranium and heavy water that 
means the socalled candu reactor can use the spent fuel from 
pressurewater reactors enabling korea to reduce the amount of 
nuclear waste it generates experts said 
the sale should also prove beneficial to aecl it is the 
companys first in nine years and could provide a boost to canadas 
nuclear industry 
a turbine generator for the new plant will be supplied by 
general electric co along with korea heavy industries and 
construction co under a contract to be signed soon officials 
said 
aecl will receive about 60 percent of the total contract sum 
korean subcontractors will receive the other 40 percent for 
providing components and services kepco said 
construction will begin next july and is scheduled to be 
completed by mid1997 
the contract was formally signed at a ceremony friday by ahn 
byongwha president of kepco and dr stanley hatcher of toronto 
president of aecl

crude oil gained 165 a barrel 
the merc was closed on monday and tuesday for christmas am 
abbreviated session is set for monday and the market will be closed 
on new years day 
traders said volume was light as many market participants 
refrained from trading at the end of the month and year and 
because of an absence of significant news on the persian gulf 
crisis 
andrew lebow a senior broker with edampf man international 
futures inc said traders bought futures after a trading floor 
rumor that shots had been fired in the iraqus standoff 
lebow said he believed the rumor resulted from confusion over 
reports that iraq test fired a surfacetosurface missile for the 
second time this week us officials in saudi arabia said the 
missle was fired away from multinational forces and landed within 
iraq 
the approach of the united nations jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait has agitated the market oil prices are

bond prices staged a sharp retreat in light 
holiday trading friday in response to warlike news about the 
persian gulf and a betterthanexpected jobless report 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond dropped 2132 point or 
656 per 1000 in face amount its yield which rises when the 
price falls rose to 830 percent from 824 percent late thursday 
the session was one of the most lightly traded of the holiday 
season with many traders absent due to new yorks first snowfall 
and to holiday vacations government securities markets closed at 3 
pm instead of the usual 530 pm because of the inclement 
weather and the coming new years holiday 
market participants blamed much of the long bonds price drop on 
the release of a government report of betterthanexpected 
unemployment figures 
the labor department reported that claims for state unemployment 
insurance on a seasonably adjusted basis fell by 14000 to 
441000 in the week ended dec 15 from 455000 claims the week 
before 
the figures were not as bad as had been the case said kevin 
flanagan a money market economist for dean witter reynolds inc 
signs of economic upturn are generally viewed as negative by the 
government securities market because the federal reserve would be 
less likely to ease interest rates to stimulate the economy 
falling interest rates boost the value of existing bonds 
however the market was little moved by a commerce department 
report showing the index of leading indicators fell 12 percent in 
november the fifth consecutive monthly decline economists said 
many of the components of the index have already been reported 
but the bond market was thrashed by several persian gulf 
developments that traders saw as heightening the prospects for war 
in the troubled region thus raising fears of higher inflation 
analysts said the next important clue to how the economy was 
faring would come next friday with the release of the governments 
monthly unemployment report 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds shortterm 
maturities were down 116 point to unchanged intermediate 
maturities were down 532 point to 1132 point and longterm 
issues lost 1932 point to 2132 point the telerate inc financial 
information service reported 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer fell 259 to 118074 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 662 percent as the

sixmonth bills were down to 685 percent as the discount fell 4 
basis points to 654 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 690

when talks at the worlds major trade forum 
collapsed earlier this month experts and headlines echoed each 
other in handwringing dismay over the loss of a chance to set 
visionary rules for the 21st century 
but not all agree the consequences of a breakdown would be dire 
a small but vocal group of experts argues that the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade is at best imbalanced further 
some say the world is becoming so economically interdependent that 
trade will increase exponentially in coming decades even without a 
broader agreement 
we might end up having a thoroughly free trading world because 
it is imposed by economic realities rather than policymakers and 
politicians says world trade expert dominick salvatore of 
fordham university in new york 
even without a gatt agreement bilateral trade talks will 
continue us and japanese negotiators for example have 
continued talks under the structural impediments initiative aimed 
at reducing internal barriers to trade in their countries us 
agriculture secretary clayton k yeutter visited european community 
counterpart ray macsharry a few weeks ago to discuss trade 
the latest gatt talks launched four years ago in uruguay were 
suspended dec 7 in brussels after the united states and other 
agricultural exporters demanded deep cuts in agricultural subsidies 
a politically explosive issue in the 12 ec nations and japan 
where farmers form strong political blocs 
the talks aim to overhaul the world trade system by rewriting 
rules and lowering barriers in 15 areas including textiles 
agriculture manufactured goods and services such as banking 
telecommunications and construction 
us negotiators hope that if developing nations gain markets 
for their food exports they will in turn grant concessions in the 
newer areas the gatt doesnt cover financial services high 
technology and socalled intellectual property such as patents 
and copyrights all of which most analysts agree hold the highest 
potential for future growth in developed nations 
when the 107nation talks were halted some feared the end of 
the pact credited with slashing barriers to trade since the gatt 
was signed in 1947 global trade has increased over five times in 
real terms to about 4 trillion in 1990 
there is still hope for gatt the talks could resume as early as 
january and a deadline set by congress of march 1 1991 to vote 
on a world trade treaty can easily be extended two years at 
president bushs request the next two months will probably 
decide it said julius katz deputy united states trade 
representative 
but salvatore and others argue that the gatt is offbase 
anyway they say that the united states naively cajoles other 
nations to hold to fair trade principles but those countries 
arent even convinced laissezfaire capitalism is best for them 
my concern is its the wrong fight at the wrong place at the 
wrong time salvatore says the future lies not in 
agricultureit is in high technology 
even if gatt succeeds it may not bring the huge trade flows 
negotiators are promising 
clyde v prestowitz and robert w jerome of the economic 
strategy institute in washington disparage a us estimate that a 
new gatt agreement could bring an extra 1 trillion in trade over 
the next decade 
bemoaning the fate of the uruguay round is kind of misplaced 
because no matter what came out of that round we the united 
states were going to have problems says prestowitz president 
of esi 
prestowitz and jerome say that under the current system the more 
liberal trading nations lose 
under current national treatment and mostfavorednation 
rules a gatt country must treat other members the same way it 
treats businesses at home no matter how restrictive a countrys 
home policies it can take advantage of more liberal members 
internal rules say jerome and prestowitz 
prestowitz a former us commerce department official cites 
european government backing for the airbus airliner 
the europeans have been pursuing development of the airbus for 
20 years subsidized to the tune of about 28 billion he says 
were not losing market share because our planes are bad or our 
prices too high were losing it because were being 
outsubsidized

the difficult christmas season has ended but 
many of the nations retailers are finding it hard to breathe a 
sigh of relief with the outlook poor for consumer spending in the 
first half of 1991 many still have tough sledding ahead 
as a result retailers are retrenching paring inventories and 
expenses and in some cases closing stores others in financial 
distress are expected to seek refuge in bankruptcy courts 
its going to be terrible was the way daniel barry a 
kidder peabody amp co industry analyst summed up the outlook 
the christmas season when retailers hope to make half their 
annual profits was disappointing as consumers put fears about the 
economy and the middle east ahead of holiday sentimentality 
the nations biggest retailers will report sales for the month 
of december on thursday but several already have said it was a 
dismal or at best trying season 
many economists predict consumers will spend cautiously well 
into 1991 as the recession continues that means americans will 
limit what is called discretionary spending outlays for 
nonessentials such as toys furniture appliances even clothing 
with retailers dependent on such expenditures a further 
slowdown is expected to be devastating for 1991 earnings thomas j 
tashjian an analyst with seidler amdec securities inc in los 
angeles predicted overall industry profits would fall about 30 
percent in the first quarter and 15 percent the second quarter 
even before christmas retailers were taking steps to reduce 
inventories and many have said they are trying to keep merchandise 
levels tight going into the new year 
we will continue to plan very conservatively kenneth macke 
chairman of dayton hudson corp said last week macke reported his 
christmas sales were unchanged to 1 percent higher than a year 
earlier a disappointing performance 
retailers especially apparel merchants will be taking fewer 
chances in 1991 
theyre going to choose very carefully things to sell said 
walter loeb a retail analyst and consultant theyre going to 
buy classic clothes which are safe 
some companies are taking more drastic steps one retailer 
younkers inc which owns 34 department stores in five midwestern 
states announced last week it was closing three small marginally 
profitable stores in nebraska 
its just a sound business decision company president 
thomas gould said 
others including such big names as rh macy amp co inc and 
carter hawley hale stores inc have already sold extra stock or 
some of their stores to try to reduce their debt loads 
macy got a 119 million cash infusin from a sale of stock 
earlier this month and has been buying back some of its junk bonds 
macy which had a disastrous christmas a year ago and has been 
under pressure to reduce its multibilliondollar liabilities 
fared better this holiday season according to a source familiar 
with the retailers results 
macys sales volume was not good in comparison to last year or 
to others in the recent past but because of lower inventories and 
reduced expenses our margins this christmas were well above a 
year ago said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
carter hawley hale which operates department stores in 
california and the west recently sold its thalhimer brothers 
division in the southeast to reduce its debt the company lost 
149 million in its first quarter which ended in november after 
losing 26 million the previous fiscal year 
for some retailers the recession will mean more business 
storeowners who can offer consumers the lowest prices should do 
well said tashjian 
closeout retailers such as pic n save corp who buy 
manufacturers overstock and sell the goods at a steep discount 
and discount retailers such as walmart stores inc are likely to 
fare better than competitors tashjian said 
walmarts sales gains consistently outpace those of other 
discounters because its distribution system is more modern and 
efficient tashjian said adding the company is in a position to 
have better pricing and still be profitable 
walmart said last week it was pleased with christmas results 
but the company found it difficult to draw customers 
some retailers are beginning the new year in bankruptcy court 
on friday youthland inc a columbus ohiobased chain of 26 
childrens clothing stores filed for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
the retailer said it had lost money for seven consecutive 
quarters and blamed the losses on a heavy debt load poor locations 
for its stores and the economy 
analysts expect other bankruptcies largely among smaller 
privatelyheld retailers and companies that are overburdened by 
debt 
therell be hundreds of little firms that go out of business 
that youll never hear about barry said 
retail capital spending may also be a victim of the business 
slowdown with less money available from banks fewer shopping 
malls will be developed loeb predicted 
but at dayton hudson no major changes are planned in the 
companys capital spending plan macke said 
macke said he was looking pessimistically at business for the 
first part of 1991 noting that consumers traditionally spend more 
at christmas than any other time of the year

well overall during the 190point tumble in the dow jones 
industrial average on oct 13 1989 and a subsequent sharp rise on 
oct 16 
but the report cited several problems in the handling of trading 
on the exchanges and at the automated national association of 
securities dealers system and called for several revisions in how 
trading is regulated 
the secs division of market regulation said some exchange floor 
market makers known in the industry as specialists failed to 
perform adequately during the volatile trading and said the 
exchanges should review performances and take appropriate 
remedial action 
specialists generally match up buyers and sellers of stock but 
are required to correct imbalances by making purchases or sales 
from their own supplies when necessary to maintain fair and orderly 
markets 
the sec report said the exchanges should use their authority to 
reallocate stocks when they determine that specialists display a 
substantial or continued failure to maintain orderly markets 
during volatile times 
it also said the nyse amex and regional stock exchanges should 
consider developing capital levels for specialists based on 
individual stocks specialists are required to make markets for 
trading of particular stocks 
the amex said in a statement that it continually reviews 
specialists performance did so for the october 1989 market drop 
and has taken appropriate action where warranted 
however we believe that overall our specialists performed 
exceptionally well during this difficult period the statement 
said 
an nyse spokesman could not be reached for comment the exchange 
in the past has ardently defended its marketmaking system saying 
specialists helped prevent financial catastrophe during the 1987 
and 1989 market declines 
with regard to the options markets the sec report recommended 
improving procedures for halting and reopening the trading of 
options contracts linked to indexes of stocks during times of 
extreme price movements 
the report also was critical of the nasds overthecounter 
market saying that some market makers withdrew from trading during 
the drop but it said the overthecounter market in general 
performed well 
overall the sec said the markets performed better during the 
october 1989 minicrash than during the october 1987 crash partly 
due to safeguards implemented after the 508point drop in the dow 
jones average 
the report was the second part of the secs analysis of the 1989 
market slide in june the sec concluded that the drop was 
accelerated by index arbitrage and other computerized program 
trading strategies that report was criticized by other agencies 
and many wall street officials

western union corp the communications 
pioneer that has foundered because of heavy debts said friday it 
was close to alleviating a substantial part of its obligations 
the company said enough bondholders appeared to have accepted 
its offer to exchange highyield junk bond debt securities for 
50 cents on the dollar 
the announcement suggested the company has avoided a cash 
crisis there had been persistent speculation that western union 
could have been forced into bankruptcycourt refuge because of its 
debts 
when the exchange offer expired midnight thursday preliminary 
figures indicated that 3286 million of the debt securites which 
paid 19 percent interest and 59 million of securities which 
paid 16 percent interest had been exchanged for the cash company 
spokesman warren bechtel said 
western union had offered to make the exchange for up to 350 
million worth of these securities a minimum of 250 million of the 
19 percent notes had to be tendered for the proposal to go 
through bechtel said 
the apparent success of the offer would mark the end of a 
grueling fivemonth ordeal for western union which has been 
struggling to satisfy bondholders afraid they wouldnt get repaid 
the company based in saddle river nj originally had proposed 
exchanging 530 million of highyield notes for loweryield notes 
plus stock after numerous deadline extensions for acceptance of 
that offer western union realized it wouldnt be accepted and 
offered the cash instead 
i guess the cash tender offer was successful because a 
substantial percentage of noteholders concluded that it was prudent 
to accept 50 cents on the dollar now rather than taking their 
chances going forward on what they might get bechtel said 
when the offer went into effect nov 29 c richard lehmann of 
the bond investors association advised bondholders to take the 
money and run 
the exchange offer will erase 334 million from the liabilities 
side of western unions balance sheet reducing the companys debt 
to about 311 million bechtel said 
completion of the cash tender hinges on the sale of most of 
western unions business services unit to american telegraph and 
telephone co bechtel said 
that transaction expected to go through monday will net 
western union 175 million bechtel said 
most of the money will be used to fund the cash tender offer 
the rest will go to repay interest on an additional 196 million 
worth of junk bonds that has been due since june 15 he said 
western union is one of the the countrys oldest companies 
known for its telegram and telex communications services but the 
company has failed to keep pace with enormous leaps in 
communications and information technology dominated by rivals such 
as atampt and regional bell phone companies western union hasnt 
made a profit in years

american airlines could be threatening passenger 
safety if pilots are discouraged from calling in sick or filing 
maintenance requests union officials said friday but the carrier 
called that statement hogwash 
the allied pilots association which represents americans 8000 
pilots has told members to obey a temporary restraining order 
against the illegal tactics that management alleges have caused 
delays and flight cancellations 
but pilots said the injunction granted wednesday by us 
district judge john mcbryde could jeopardize passenger safety if 
i is used to inhibit pilots from filing necessary maintenance 
requests and staying home when they are sick 
the clash over the court ruling is the latest in an increasingly 
testy struggle between american and its pilots who have been 
working without a contract for nearly a year mcbryde set a jan 3 
hearing date to determine whether the temporary injunction should 
be made permanent 
we pointed out to the court that there is a danger that the 
company may use the order in a way that will impair safe 
operations we cannot permit that to happen apa president fred 
vogel told pilots in a taped message on the unions telephone 
hotline 
the union has denied americans charges that pilots have been 
staging sickouts taxiing slowly to waste fuel and filing frivolous 
requests for equipment maintenance 
american spokeswoman lise olson said typically 300 pilots will 
call in sick on a given day but since dec 21 more than 500 a day 
have been out sick 
she said 204 flights had been canceled as of friday afternoon 
48 of which were crewrelated a snowstorm in the northeast caused 
most of the others she said 
ms olson said the airline never would compromise passenger 
safety 
thats hogwash its not our intention to endanger anyone 
olson said we would expect all of our employees to act 
professionally 
vogel said sick pilots could fail faaadministered drug tests if 
they are forced to work after taking certain overthecounter cold 
remedies he added that pilots will not be able to blame such an 
incident on the injunction 
you can bet your bottom dollar it will be the pilots who bear 
the responsibility if there is an incident vogel said 
the apa has been in contract talks since october 1989 the old 
contract expired jan 1 1990 
on thursday american said the pilots unreliable attendance 
will force the nations secondlargest carrier to reduce its 
schedule by about 4 percent and lay off some employees
