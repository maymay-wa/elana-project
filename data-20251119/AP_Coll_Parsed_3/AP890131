officials of the world alpine ski 
championships maintained tuesday that no safety violations 
contributed to the death of a cousin of spains king but a champion 
skiier suggested the victim was on a closed course 
the duke of cadiz a 52yearold first cousin of king juan carlos 
and member of the international governing body of ski racing was 
killed monday at the beaver creek ski resort when he ran into a 
cable being raised to hold a finishline banner for the mens 
downhill course 
alfonso de borbon y de dampierre suffered neck lacerations and 
apparently died instantly eagle county coroner donna meineke said 
an official cause of death had not been released by tuesday 
afternoon 
de borbon was at onetime married to the granddaughter of spanish 
dictator francisco franco although he was not in the line of 
succession to the spanish throne he was a descendant of louis xiv 
the french sun king and was the bourbon or legitimist candidate 
for king had the monarchy ever been restored in france 
king juan carlos and queen sofia in spain expressed their sorrow 
over his death 
there is no reason to believe that any safety violations 
occurred bob knous president of the championships organizing 
committee told a news conference tuesday 
it truly appears that this was an accident a very very 
unfortunate and tragic incident knous said 
sheriff aj johnson would not say tuesday night whether eagle 
county officials agree with knous 
we will make no conclusions about safety violations not until 
the investigation is done johnson said i will discuss the 
investigation with the district attorney until then we are looking 
at all possibilities 
but defending world downhill champion peter mueller of 
switzerland said the victim and other ski officials ignored normal 
procedures when they skied down a closed course 
johnson who said his investigation would take a month confirmed 
that the course was closed but said we believe he de borbon 
had the authority to be on there 
de borbon was skiing monday with companions when he hit the cable 
as course workers were moving the finish line and banners uphill 
from the end of the slalom course to the end of the downhill 
witnesses said one of the companions former austrian olympic 
champion toni sailer saw the cable and warned de borbon who 
acknowledged the warning but still slammed into it at neck level 
according to johnson 
knous said there were no safety violations despite the fact that 
the course was closed following an inspection by the international 
ski federation known by its french initials as fis also there were 
no banners or identifying material on the cable that the duke hit 
he said he couldnt comment on whether the duke and his skiing 
companions should have been on the course at the time 
mueller 31 one of the favorites in saturdays race said 
normally when we prepare for a competition the course is closed 
but here the fis is skiing down for pleasure i think thats a big 
mistake if the downhill course is closed it should be closed for 
all people 
downhill training went on as scheduled tuesday although social 
events were canceled or postponed officials of the championships 
wore black armbands and flags throughout the ski resort flew at 
halfstaff 
the spanish ski team which had been training at another colorado 
ski resort still planned to come to vail and compete knous said 
the championship meet continues through this weekend 
de borbon served as spains ambassador to sweden from 1969 to 
1973 was president of the spanish skiing federation from 1977 to 
1984 and an eighttime spanish skiing champion 
de borbons father was the elder brother of king juan carlos 
father both mens fathers were the sons of king alfonso xiii who 
abdicated the spanish throne in 1931 
the duke married carmen franco in 1972 and they divorced in 1982 
in february 1984 the older of his two sons was killed in an auto 
accident in which de borbon was driving a judge ruled that de 
borbon had been negligent and stripped him of the custody of his 
other son 
francisco fernandezochoa the slalom gold medalist at the 1972 
olympics and a close friend of the duke said de borbon liked to 
ski fast and drive fast 
referring to the dukes divorce the fatal auto accident and the 
skiing tragedy fernandezochoa described the victim as an unlucky 
person bad things happened to him

after years of coldshouldering the united 
nations the united states now sings its praises and increasingly 
suggests things for it to do but us dollars to match the tasks 
are not forthcoming and the united states remains the biggest un 
debtor 
the united states is urging the world body to take on more 
responsibilities from monitoring the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan and cuban withdrawal from angola to fighting terrorism 
and drug trafficking and investigating human rights abuses and 
chemical warfare 
it also is expected to monitor the eventual vietnamese withdrawal 
from cambodia and to play a role in a middle east settlement 
but little money is forthcoming from the us congress to fund 
the burgeoning us agenda for the 159nation organization the 
united states is the largest un contributor assessed onequarter 
of the annual budget of 800 million 
while the united nations has registered a series of formidable 
peacemaking and peacekeeping successes that advance us interests 
congress has been withholding us dues 
the united states ended 1988 about 402 million in arrears in 
budget and peacekeeping dues 535 percent of the total un 
arrears of more than 750 million 
largely because of us nonpayment the united nations 
periodically faces financial crises and is having trouble paying for 
new peackeeping operations 
president bush a former us ambassador here praised the united 
nations during his election campaign and called for the payment of 
us dues 
congress has been withholding a large part of the dues because of 
budget constraints and disaffection with the world body the 
organization was seen as biased against the united states 
bureaucratically bloated and wasteful 
some money was withheld in an effort to force the united nations 
to reform itself despite administration and state department calls 
for fullfunding 
george p shultz said before leaving office as secretary of state 
said it is important for us foreign policy to fully fund our 
contributions to un agencies and to initiate a plan to pay 
arrearages over a fiveyear period 
he said the request for nearly full payment of dues is critical 
to our objectives of resolving regional conflicts the un can play 
an important role in this regard 
us undersecretary of state richard s williamson in charge of 
international organizations said up through last year the 
executive state department and white house sought full funding 
congress failed to appropriate the full amount 
in a telephone interview williamson said some people hold the 
united nations in disrepute when it does disreputable things it 
rightfully is criticized he said for overspending and for 
political moves like a general assembly resolution equating zionism 
with racism 
but he said the united nations has improved because the united 
states took a firm stand 
last year the united nations scored spectacular achievements and 
its peacekeeping forces won the nobel peace prize 
in afghanistan un observers are monitoring soviet withdrawal 
under a unmediated agreement for years ending soviet 
involvement in afghanistan was a prime us foreign policy goal 
in the persian gulf un peacekeepers are monitoring a 
ceasefire while iran and iraq are talking under un auspices the 
ceasefire enabled the united states to scale back its costly naval 
presence there 
in southern africa the united nations is helping to fulfill 
another us goal getting sovietbacked cuban troops out of angola 
un observers will monitor the cuban pullout and peacekeepers will 
oversee namibias transition to independence from south africa under 
a un plan 
in the western sahara conflict a un peace plan has been 
accepted by morocco antimoroccan guerrillas and algeria and the 
world body will supervise free elections there in cyprus un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has sponsored talks 
between greek and turkish cypriot communities to discuss 
reunification of the mediterranean island 
in his final budget president ronald reagan requested nearly 
full un funding in the 1990 fiscal year 2055 million for the 
regular budget plus an additional 46 million to begin paying off 
us arrears the arrears of 403 million include 3077 million for 
the budget and 941 million for peacekeeping 
the soviet union has been paying its arrears and now owes 9 
million to the regular budget and 172 million to peacekeeping 
for almost eight years the reagan administration and the world 
body were estranged the united states charged it was ineffectual 
prosoviet antiamerican and wasteful but in his farewell address 
to the general assembly in september reagan praised the world body 
for helping to end regional conflicts

president bush has called free choice 
the single most promising idea in education but hed get an 
argument from bob duncan and others involved in the nations most 
comprehensive application of the concept 
i dont know if anyone can say it is off to a good start 
said duncan superintendent of a school district on northern 
minnesotas iron range were very close to being out of 
business 
the problem is that nearly a third of the districts 1000 
students have applied to attend school in neighboring virginia 
minn next year the exodus is possible because of a statewide open 
enrollment program that will give all public school students freedom 
to choose where they attend school 
duncans district stands in contrast to the affluent public 
schools in edina a predominantly white district in suburban 
minneapolis two districts do not take outsiders sartell because 
it is crowded and edina because it voted not to take part in the 
open enrollment program 
critics say the open enrollment program wont reach the poor 
penalizes small towns invites interschool athletic recruiting 
leaves some districts with inappropriate staffing levels and 
provides dissident parents an extortion tool to use on school boards 
others hail the program for promoting excellence 
at a white house workshop on choice in education on jan 10 
former president reagan referred to open enrollment as that 
marvelous program in minnesota that is fostering unprecedented 
competition among public schools to make them more attractive to 
parents and students 
reagan and bush are not the only admirers of the plan which 
encourages free markettype competition among public schools 
peggy hunter enrollment options specialist with the state 
education department said the program will probably weed out 
lackluster schools 
gov rudy perpich said the program makes the state a national 
leader in empowering families to make choices about their childrens 
education 
but not all state officials are convinced 
based on the limited experience weve had in this state its 
ridiculous said state rep bob mceachern chairman of the state 
house education committee 
only 435 of minnesotas 740000 grade school and high school 
students applied for the program this year and applications for next 
year have reached 1300 the program applies to school districts of 
more than 1000 students and will be extended to all school 
districts by the 199091 school year districts now have the option 
of voting not to participate 
its a choice for the rich mceachern insisted thats 
all 
in mountain iron and buhl communities still recovering from the 
collapse of the taconite industry a decade ago parents have been 
divided over which school buildings to close in the aftermath of a 
merger open enrollment has been an escape route from conflict 
duncan said 
the lower enrollment wont cut operating expenses but it will 
reduce state aid by 12 million a third of the districts budget 
he said 
if chaos continues more students will leave and it will be 
lights out duncan said 
duncan also said some poor families wont have access to open 
enrollment because of transportation costs 
in edina where the 6000pupil district is 96 percent white and 
the average price of a home in 1985 was 141000 the school board 
voted to opt out of the program 
we kind of anticipated that this would be viewed as a racially 
motivated decision said edina school superintendent raymond 
smyth who denied elitism played a role in the decision 
he said open enrollment allows students to transfer schools for 
athletic purposes and other reasons he considers trivial 
another drawback is the inevitable erosion of education quality for 
students who remain in schools of declining enrollment he said 
but hunter said edina wants to pick and choose its students 
the law says you cant deny a student because of their race or 
their academic ability or whether theyre a problem student you 
cant select and choose which kids are educated and edina says we 
want to pick and choose she said 
the minnesota parent teacher association has warmly endorsed open 
enrollment partly because parent and student satisfaction with 
their school is absolutely vital to their success said barbara 
zohn president 
but zohn noted that the pta unsuccessfully lobbied for a 
declining enrollment fund that would have sent state money for one 
or two years to schools losing students to give them a chance to 
improve 
duncan joked that the success of schools under open enrollment 
may someday be linked to their marketing ability 
how about come here well give all as or finish four 
years in three

gov ray mabus has gotten himself into an 
emotional battle by proposing to close the three charity hospitals 
that the nations poorest state operates for its poorest people 
mabus says the poor would be better served if the money that 
funds the hospitals went instead into medicaid and attracted federal 
funds but opponents claim to have more than 100000 petition 
signatures to keep the hospitals open 
mabus who took office a year ago after a reformbased campaign 
says the hospitals are underfunded and represent the lower tier of a 
double standard of health care in mississippi 
we have to work toward the day when where you live and how much 
you make are not the deciding factors in the standard of care you 
get the 40yearold democrat said recently 
but he has been unable to convince some people that the health 
care needs of the poor could be better served by closing matty 
hersee hospital in meridian south mississippi state hospital in 
laurel and kuhn memorial state hospital in vicksburg 
the hospitals set up in 1916 collectively maintain only 199 of 
the states more than 15800 hospital beds on a budget of 68 
million they served 77508 patients in the 1988 fiscal year out of 
a population of about 25 million that includes 8278 who required 
hospitalization and 69230 outpatients 
the buildings are older buildings but they are well kept and 
theyre very clean said peggy sprayberry of the state 
eleemosynary board which oversees charity hospitals 
the governors plan sparked a recent rally at the state capitol 
i dont have no insurance no medicaid and you cant get no 
doctor to wait on you if you dont have no money said georgia mae 
jones one of about 300 people who traveled the 90 miles from laurel 
for the rally 
when you go to the state hospital they take good care of you 
they dont ask you if you got money they just wait on you jones 
said if you go to these other hospitals theyre going to turn 
you out theyre going to say you got to get some money and thats 
something these people aint got 
mabus hastily called a news conference to counter the public 
attention drawn to the rally 
i think that the people marching today and i have the same aims 
and thats quality health care for mississippians mabus said i 
think as governor ive got to make the decision of how we can get 
the most health care for the most people 
mabus has said that putting into medicaid the money that now goes 
for the charity hospitals would attract to the state an additional 
28 million in federal matching dollars he also has proposed other 
medicaid expansions 
mississippi spent 440258967 on medicaid in the 1988 fiscal 
year which ended june 30 1988 of that 346324369 was in 
federal matching funds and 93934598 in state funds 
mabus said his plan would provide medical assistance to far more 
people than are served by the charity hospitals 
by shifting these funds to medicaid we can cover literally 
tens of thousands more mississipians statewide we can do it in a 
more equitable manner he said 
but opponents say they have more than 100000 signatures on 
petitions and most legislators from the areas where the hospitals 
are located have worked against the governors plan 
my question is if you close the charity hospitals how many 
working poor people are going to fall through the cracks asked 
state sen alan heflin whose district includes matty hersee 
but lawmakers who back the goverors proposal agree with him that 
the issue is one of quality health care for the poor 
i think the people of mississippi can be served by the charity 
hospitals it theyre properly funded but theyre not properly 
funded and the legislature has refused to properly fund them for the 
last 10 years said rep ed buelow

hedda nussbaum has become a powerful symbol of 
family violence and could become a powerful advocate for other 
battered women says the psychiatrist who is nurturing her recovery 
tragedy put ms nussbaum into her role portrayed by prosecutors 
as a brainwashed victim of brutality and by joel steinbergs defense 
as a fraud who killed the little girl they illegally adopted and 
raised until her death at age 6 
the oncepretty woman bared her scarred face and psyche to 
television viewers during testimony that unraveled an alltoocommon 
story of domestic violence a state jury monday convicted steinberg 
of manslaughter 
when ms nussbaum a 46yearold former childrens book editor 
for random house was arrested with steinberg after little lisa 
steinbergs death she had a black eye broken nose nine fractured 
ribs split lip cauliflower ear and a leg so severely ulcerated 
that doctors called the injury lifethreatening 
charges against her were dropped when prosecutors determined she 
was too physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for 
the girls death ms nussbaum agreed to become the key prosecution 
witness 
steinberg 47 was charged with beating lisa on the night of nov 
1 1987 the death three days later of a child from an affluent 
welleducated household shocked many and became a nationwide symbol 
of family violence as a problem that cuts across social strata 
ms nussbaums testimony described a 12year relationship in 
which she was beaten brainwashed and subjected to other bizarre 
punishments for transgressions imagined by steinberg 
slowly deliberately ms nussbaum told how she came to see 
steinberg as a godlike figure asking his permission to eat 
obeying his orders to sleep on the floor or sit in a tub of cold 
water 
jurors saw handwritten pages in which ms nussbaum vowed to care 
about steinbergs hair clothes work problems diet future teeth 
and other concerns in another paper she wrote 10 times that 
anger is destructive and that selfdefense is regressive 
her psychiatrist samuel klagsbrun has said ms nussbaum wont 
be ready to leave the four winds hospital in katonah north of new 
york for at least two months but while she hasnt made definite 
plans klagsbrun said he wouldnt be surprised to see ms nussbaum 
become an advocate for other battered women 
she feels an obligation at this point to be helpful to others 
in helping people stand up and fight for themselves and regain a 
level of selfrespect said klagsbrun shes very conscious of 
the responsibility she now has to take a horrible part of her life 
and make it useful for other women as well as for herself her own 
healing 
shes articulate and intelligent she has the capacity to 
relate and be available to other people and already has helped 
other patients during her hospitalization said klagsbrun 
her impact on other people who have experienced battering has 
been enormous he said she has allowed some people to reveal 
more than they were prepared to do to feel they can assert 
themselves in society and stand up to evil people have said things 
along those lines to her 
during seven days of testimony in december ms nussbaum said 
that steinberg told her in bed after they had freebased cocaine 
and while lisa lay comatose on their bathroom floor that he had 
knocked lisa down and she didnt want to get up 
the defense charged that ms nussbaum was jealous of steinbergs 
attention toward lisa and inflicted the fatal injuries 
prosecutors said ms nussbaum who lost her job when she 
frequently missed work because of injuries suffered from the 
battered spouse syndrome and was herself too much a victim herself 
to have hurt or helped the child

the waistcoat reputedly worn by king charles i at 
his beheading in 1649 is being taken back to the museum of london 
today after a police crime lab failed to determine if its 
mysterious stains are royal blood 
we have examined it but we cannot tell if the stains are 
blood said graham divall a biochemist at the metropolitan police 
forensic science laboratory 
if we had a piece of the silk we could look for some form of 
hemoglobin by using intensive xrays to show the protein structure 
but naturally the museum wont let us cut it up said divall 
to discover whether the stains could have been the kings blood 
the museum sent the waistcoat to the lab where it underwent the 
routine tests that would be conducted in a modernday crime divall 
said 
i am convinced we have the kings waistcoat kay staniland 
the museums keeper of costume and textiles said on monday the 
340th anniversary of the execution 
the workmanship of the knitting is right for the time and when 
it was bought for us from a collector in 1925 it had a note 
attached saying it had belonged to dr hobbs the physician who 
attended the king on the scaffold it then passed to his daughter 
susannah and remained with their descendants until it was auctioned 
in 1898 miss staniland said 
the faded blue silk waistcoat is believed to have been worn by 
the king next to his skin when his head was chopped off on jan 30 
1649 after he lost his long struggle against the puritan leader 
oliver cromwell the monarch stepped out on the scaffold in 
whitehall central london from a window of the banqueting house 
which still stands 
the longsleeved garment with buttoned neck opening and small 
upstanding collar has armpit stains probably from sweat but no 
collar stains two large stains on the upper chest and abdomen 
have survived an attempt to clean them off 
we took ultraviolet light photographs and did a very sensitive 
chemical test for blood which we are doing every day on clothing 
weapons and at the scene of a crime we were not surprised at the 
negative results because blood would have degraded in 300 years 
he said 
the king was a small man and the waistcoats chest measures only 
28 inches it is long enough to reach his thighs 
we wanted to see if the legend about the stains being blood 
could be true but the only way we could prove that without 
destroying anything was if we had some proved bloodstains of the 
same period and we havent said suzanne keene the museums head 
of conservation 
an eyewitness of the execution said the king was wearing a sky 
blue garment and the waistcoat is a faded sky blue ms keene 
added 
miss staniland said authentication is a difficult business and 
it would help if we had other garments of the king 
knitted 17th century silk garments are believed to have been made 
in italy or spain 
the waistcoat is displayed beside a sample of modern knitting in 
the same pattern as the waistcoat below it is a german engraving of 
the execution supposedly drawn by a witness and showing the king 
kneeling 
but the execution block was only 10 inches high so he must have 
been lying prone miss staniland said

a jury monday convicted joel steinberg of 
manslaughter in the beating death of his illegally adopted 
6yearold daughter lisa a death that refocused national attention 
on domestic violence 
steinberg showed no emotion as each of the 12 jurors was polled 
on the verdict which came at 638 pm on the eighth day of 
deliberations in the threemonthold trial he was acquitted on the 
more serious charge of seconddegree murder 
the verdict culminated a case that touched the nations 
conscience with witnesses providing wrenching detail of the 
physical and emotional havoc wrought by spousal and child abuse 
and the failure of others to intercede 
lisas biological mother michele launders 27 said before the 
jury returned that the only verdict that would be justice for lisa 
is murder after the verdict she left the courtroom in tears and 
would not speak to reporters 
she was sitting next to graceann smigiel the grandmother of a 
young boy who was found in steinbergs apartment when police and 
emergency medical service paramedics removed lisas comatose body 
the morning of nov 2 1987 
the boy who also was illegally adopted by steinberg has since 
been returned to his biological mother 
the conviction on the charge of firstdegree manslaughter carries 
a maximum sentence of 8 13 to 25 years it was a charge that 
prosecutors at one time had considered dropping from the case 
sentencing was set for march 8 
in acquitting steinberg of murder the jury apparently concluded 
that steinberg meant to hurt lisa but not to kill her a 
seconddegree manslaughter conviction would have meant he did not 
mean to hurt her but showed reckless disregard for her life 
district attorney robert morgenthau who promised to ask for the 
maximum punishment said the trial highlighted the dreadful 
problems that beset our city child abuse drug abuse and family 
violence all of us have a responsibility to work to ensure that 
similar tragedies do not reoccur 
ira london steinbergs lawyer said we do not consider this 
verdict a win for joel or a triumph for joel 
one of the jurors helena barthell 36 she argued in favor of 
convicting steinberg of murder said the jury had virtually 
ignored the testimony of hedda nussbaum steinbergs battered 
livein companion of 12 years 
ms nussbaums lawyer barry scheck said she is relieved its 
all over he said she watched the verdict on television at the 
psychiatric facility in westchester county where she has lived 
since march 1988 
the possibility of a hung jury was a very frightening prospect 
for her she would have to go through this all again he said 
public attention was riveted on the trial during ms nussbaums 
seven days of testimony last month her story of abuse and 
psychological manipulation was broadcast live on new yorks three 
television network affiliates and in part nationally on the cable 
news network 
ms nussbaum testifying under immunity from prosecution said 
she was so dominated by steinberg that she was unable to defend 
herself from virtually systematic beatings or to protect the child 
lisa steinberg 
she also said she was unable to bring herself to summon medics 
promptly on nov 1 1987 after steinberg told her lisa was 
unconscious on the bathroom floor the girl lay there nearly 12 
hours by the time ms nussbaum called an ambulance she died of 
brain damage in a hospital three days later 
defense lawyers claimed it was ms nussbaum steinbergs livein 
girlfriend who fatally beat lisa out of jealousy over the attention 
steinberg paid the child prosecutors pointing to ms nussbaums 
own severe injuries and deteriorated mental state said she was 
incapable of such an act 
she was a 45yearold woman who appeared much older than her 
age the emergency room doctor who examined ms nussbaum after her 
arrest testified at trial she was chronically debilitated 
malnourished wasted 
nonetheless state supreme court justice harold rothwax 
instructed the jury that it must consider ms nussbaum an accomplice 
in lisas death as such her testimony had to be supported by other 
evidence 
it was the layers of tragedy in the steinberg case that commanded 
public attention one question was how ms nussbaum a former 
childrens book editor could allow herself much less the child 
to sustain such damage 
another was how bruises on lisa could have been noticed by a 
student teacher at her elementary school and by neighbors but 
failed to come to the attention of child welfare officials yet 
another issue was the ease with which steinberg illegally gained 
custody of lisa and another child 16month old mitchell from their 
unwed teenage mothers 
and at the center of the case were the unknown motivations of 
steinberg a lawyer who was disbarred last fall for having falsely 
claimed a military exemption from the bar exam he did not testify 
at the trial 
steinbergs lawyers denied that he ever beat lisa prosecutors 
and ms nussbaum told another story 
ms nussbaum testified that on nov 1 1987 he ordered her and 
the girl to eat hot peppers then drink large amounts of water 
typical of the irrational behavior common in the household 
ms nussbaum said that she was in the bathroom when lisa went 
into the bedroom to ask steinberg if she could go out to dinner with 
him about 6 or 630 pm he walked into the bathroom holding 
lisas limp body 
and i said what happened ms nussbaum testified he 
said whats the difference what happened this is your child 
hasnt this gone far enough 
they put the unconscious child on the bathroom floor steinberg 
then left for dinner saying dont worry just let her sleep 
she testified 
when steinberg returned from dinner about 10 pm she said they 
smoked cocaine it was then that he admitted hitting the girl she 
testified 
about 6 am steinberg said lisa had stopped breathing and tried 
to revive her she said they finally called 911 at 630 am she 
said 
steinbergs lack of concern for the girl exhibited more than 
depraved indifference to human life assistant district attorney 
peter casolaro said at the trial it was monumental indifference 
to human life 
staffers from st vincents hospital many of them clearly 
hostile to steinberg testified that he appeared unconcerned about 
lisas welfare and made distasteful comments when he was told she 
had brain damage 
what youre saying is shes not going to be an olympic 
swimmer dr patrick kilhenny quoted steinberg as replying 
casolaro also said steinberg gave differing versions of details 
of the events of the night of nov 1 including how lisa was bruised 
the defense said the prosecutions case built largely on 
circumstantial evidence did not disprove every possibility except 
steinbergs guilt as the law requires 
ira london and adrian diluzio steinbergs lawyers sought at 
various times to explain lisas injuries by suggesting she had 
choked on her dinner had fallen had been struck by a classmate 
had contracted reyes syndrome and had been killed by doctors who 
put a monitoring needle into her brain

athens greece in a bid to control hot mediterranean tempers 
and teach them a smattering of english for the benefit of tourists 
athens bus drivers are being sent to charm school 
the 43 million program is aimed at improving the image of the 
capitals public transportation system which faces stiff 
competition from taxis whose cost is among the cheapest in the world 
classes such as driver and communication with the public and 
english for drivers are part of the 15day courses for the staff 
of the semiprivate urban transportation company 
the classes will help the driver control his mediterranean 
temperament but passengers must also understand that its not 
the drivers fault when the bus is late said andreas kolas a 
spokesman for the union of bus drivers 
quarrels often break out between bus drivers and passengers irked 
by waiting for buses or when riders insist on getting off where 
there is no bus stop 
because of the chaotic state of public transportation bus 
routes and timetables are rarely available tourists often take 
taxis which cost about 2 for a threemile ride the bus fare is 20 
cents 
kolas said drivers manners arent helped by the aggravation of 
navigating the capitals notoriously congested streets 
according to the transit companys chairman vassilis xeomeritis 
about 3500 of the 5000 bus drivers are very experienced but 
older people with almost no education 
our drivers could use some retraining they must understand 
that passengers are our customers and that its the drivers duty to 
serve the public xenomeritis said 
the corporations 1200 buses cover the whole of athens a 
120squaremile area with only one subway line crossing the city 
more than 70 percent of athenians commute by bus daily 
a bus driver who wouldnt let his name be used said the public 
should also learn how to behave and use the transportation 
system properly 
passengers sometimes ask us unbelievable things he said 
we try to explain something to them and they are already so upset 
that they turn around and swear at us 
about 1500 drivers are scheduled for the course in 1989 the 
rest will take it in the next couple of years said christos 
halazias a transportation company spokesman 
the corporation received almost half its financial backing for 
the training program from the european economic community he said

he is a man of conflicting images a patriot 
seven rows of ribbons on his uniform charged with crimes against 
the united states 
barring new delay oliver laurence north 45 goes on trial 
tuesday facing a dozen coverup and tax counts stemming from his 
role in the secret sale of arms to iran and the diversion of some of 
that money to the nicaraguan rebels 
the jury will decide in the end whether this former lieutenant 
colonel and junior staff member of the national security council was 
true to his government and his mission or whether his deceits 
principally to congress were the designs of a rogue operating 
outside of law and white house order 
along the way the nation may learn more about the worst foreign 
policy debacle of ronald reagans presidency and about how north 
came to run some of the administrations riskiest ventures from a 
cluttered room no 392 in the old executive office building next 
door to the white house 
congress tried for months to unravel those mysteries but like 
the 1987 commission headed by incoming defense secretary john tower 
congressional panels left many questions unanswered meanwhile in 
nationally televised hearings a defiant oliver north emerged from 
his shadowy world one of pseudonyms and codes and furtive border 
crossings to confront his legislative tormentors 
ollie stood up there took the heat and the american people in 
every bar in chicago and every bowling alley in texas and every 
little home said hey this guy believes in something and i can 
identify with it said george bush last december 
norths bravura performance and his subsequent whirlwind of 
25000 speeches to cheering conservative groups around the country 
revealed just one of his many sides 
he has always been ollie to his white house coworkers and 
the american right but to his brothers and sisters his highschool 
chums back in his hometown of philmont ny he remains larry 
north to surviving members of his combat platoon in vietnam he is 
blue leader of blues bastards in other travels he has 
been paul or mr goode or mr johns or 
steelhammer 
another code name may be most telling blank check that was 
the term assigned to the private interoffice computer 
communications network between north and his superior former 
national security adviser john m poindexter the tower commission 
found that the creation of blank check coincided with the 
initial shipment of antitank missiles to iran 14 months before the 
scheme blew up in the administrations face in late 1986 
according to richard allen reagans first national security 
adviser north was brought to the nsc in 1981 to handle easels and 
carry the charts yet he became in a matter of months the nscs 
chief troubleshooter responsible for central american and terrorism 
issues and played a vital role in some of the administrations most 
daring foreign exploits 
they included the invasion of grenada in 1983 initial arms 
shipments by the cia to the nicaraguan rebels also in 1983 the 
mining of three harbors in nicaragua in early 1984 a crackdown on 
the death squads in el salvador and the organization of free 
elections there the interception of an egyptian airliner carrying 
the hijackers of the italian cruise ship achille lauro and the 
bombing raid upon libya in 1986 
part of norths ascendancy no doubt can be attributed to his 
own drive and fervor if there was a loose ball said retired 
maj gen john singlaub a key player in norths efforts to aid the 
contras oliver north would grab it and run with it 
as a youth he was kept on a tight leash his father oliver clay 
north an army colonel who won a silver star in world war ii worked 
long hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim to polyester 
and he switched to teaching history 
his mother ann would whistle for the kids to come in every 
evening at 5 pm for dinner family ritual included a discussion of 
world events before the table was cleared in school he ran track 
and was in the chorus chess drama and science clubs as well as the 
student council the girls voted him bestlooking 
north intended to follow his father who died three years ago 
into teaching and enrolled at the state college at brockport as an 
english major not premed at rochester as he later claimed and 
joined the marine reserves as an officer trainee after spending the 
summer at camp lejeune in north carolina he was a convert to the 
corps 
his appointment to the naval academy came after his sophomore 
year at brockport and north had to start over as a plebe then 
before hed really settled in he was in a car wreck suffering 
severe knee and back injuries 
he boxed as a southpaw and in the intramural ranks he made it 
into the finals against a highly favored james webb later to become 
a decorated combat veteran and a bestselling novelist north won 
again on points 
after his graduation a review board threatened to dismiss him 
because of his auto injuries north made the board look at the film 
of his fight against webb he got his commission 
soon after north and betsy stuart were married in a formal 
military service he was shipped out in december 1968 to vietnam 
he was all guns guts and glory according to randall herrod 
a fellow exmarine officer whom north credits with saving his life 
on the battlefield 
once north was knocked off a tank rocked by enemy fire and 
despite broken ribs and a punctured lung rose up to kill the enemy 
gunner with a grenade that got him a bronze star other awards 
followed 
but north in recounting his vietnam experiences has sometimes 
seemed to exaggerate his record he has testified that his 
decorations included several purple hearts military records 
show two he headed a platoon of 40 men but said in court that he 
was a company commander in the special operations force again 
no record of it he has said in court that he was in vietnam from 
1968 through early 1970 and then again in 1971 but the corps 
says it has no record of an extended first tour or second tour 
north did return to vietnam on his own time when word arrived 
that herrod had been charged with war crimes in the killing of women 
and children herrod eventually was acquitted while the case 
dragged north was going off voluntarily to fight in the bush 
after tours at quantico va and on okinawa he wound up with a 
desk at marine corps headquarters he worked 18 hours a day 
meanwhile north and wife betsy were going about the business of 
raising their four children 
something finally snapped north wound up in bethesda naval 
hospital for 22 days diagnosed as suffering delayed battle 
stress once again he overcame his medical difficulties and was 
cleared for duty

employers and all but the poorest americans 
would be taxed to finance a national health care system extending 
medical insurance to the estimated 37 million who lack coverage 
under a plan proposed by a commission including three former 
presidents 
the proposal encourages continued reliance on private health 
insurance provided through the workplace but calls for a new 
program to provide universal access to basic medical services costs 
would be spread among employers and all americans above 150 percent 
of poverty level 
the plan offered monday is designed to extend medical coverage to 
all americans stem the growth of medical expenses which now stand 
at 550 billion annually and improve the quality of medical care 
nationwide said the national leadership commission on health care 
which worked 2 years preparing its proposal 
if we continue the present trend the 550 billion will double 
in six years and triple in 12 years said paul g rogers a former 
democratic congressman from florida who cochaired the commission 
with former iowa gov robert d ray a republican 
the commission also is headed by three former presidents 
richard nixon gerald ford and jimmy carter who served as honorary 
cochairmen the commission was financed by 38 corporations unions 
and foundations 
the commission called its plan eminently fair and estimated 
it would add about 15 billion to the 550 billion already being 
spent on health care annually 
it is not something that will blow us over as a nation said 
uwe reinhardt a princeton university professor of economics and 
member of the commission 
members of the commission are to meet soon with bush 
administration officials and members of congress to go over the 
recommendations 
under the proposed system all americans would be covered by a 
basic package of medical services which would be the minimum 
coverage for all private health insurance plans and for a publicly 
funded benefits pool 
many workers would continue to get privately financed coverage as 
an employment benefit with the employer paying most or all of the 
premium and they could add to that coverage if they wanted the 
federal medicare insurance program for older and disabled americans 
also would continue 
everyone else would be covered by the pool called the universal 
access program recipients of medicaid the federal health insurance 
program for the poor would be covered by the new program 
the universal access pool would be financed by all employers and 
by all individuals not covered by medicare who have incomes above 
150 percent of the poverty level the schedule of fees would be 
designed to encourage employers to offer coverage to employees and 
improve coverage under some existing plans 
there is strong incentive to keep the pool of people falling 
into the public system as small as it can be reinhardt said 
under the current system the millions who are uninsured though 
they cannot pay for their health care still do receive medical 
services he noted their cost however is borne largely by 
hospitals and doctors that provide the care and it inflates 
insurance premiums paid by companies for their workers he said 
there would be some shifting of costs from large firms who do 
offer generous health insurance packages to those who in some sense 
freeload and do not offer their employees any health insurance and 
thereby benefit their employees are implicitly covered anyhow and 
big business picks up the tab reinhardt said 
under the proposed system employers who dont provide a minimum 
level of health insurance coverage to their fulltime workers would 
have to pay a fee for each worker not covered in addition all 
employers and employees would have to pay a fee based on employees 
income the rates would be determined once a national package of 
basic services was developed 
the commission also proposed a 500 millionayear research 
program funded with the health care fees to study the effectiveness 
of current medical procedures such research could reduce 
inappropriate care and waste while saving at least 15 billion a 
year by 1993 the commission said

north dakota farmer luther berntson stood 
before an audience at the department of agriculture and spoke what 
he admitted sounded like heresy lock the plow in the barn he 
advised and farm without tilling 
my neighbors say it is sacrilege unpatriotic and everything 
else he said it was the plow that opened the prairie thomas 
jefferson made improvements to the plow why the plow is mentioned 
in the bible 
yet what berntson advocated wasnt heresy here he was a 
participant in a agriculture department conference monday on a new 
breeze in farming lowinput agriculture 
thats maximum farming with minimal disturbance to nature 
farming with seed soil and manure and as little chemistry as 
possible 
the movement is similar in some respects to organic farming 
although many lowinput practitioners find they cant stay in 
business without using herbicides and other chemicals scorned by 
their more dogmatic counterparts 
with drought blowing the topsoil away the cost of petrochemicals 
skyrocketing and farmers coming under the scrutiny of the 
environmental protection agency for polluting groundwater the 
agriculture department decided to take a fresh look at lowimpact 
farming 
keynoter will erwin an indiana farmer said public impatience 
has given urgency to the cause 
he summed up the publics attitude toward farmers this way we 
paid you not to produce so much and you used chemicals and 
fertilizers to produce more and spoiled the environment to boot 
with his topsoil only six inches deep and more blowing away every 
time he plowed berntson a third generation wheat farmer in 
northeastern north dakota started notillage farming 10 years ago 
raising wheat and barley from acres that normally get a mere 18 
inches of rain a year 
does it pay off 
the jury is out he said farming his way is costly and still 
requires a lot of herbicides to control weeds doing what his 
lockedup plow once did 
he puts so much stuff on the weeds he said that we say we are 
plowing with a can and a jug 
as for his neighbors they are not quite ready to go to 
notill and maybe theyre smarter than i am 
the agriculture department spends just 39 million of its 25 
billion annual budget on alternative agriculture tom brown a 
westcentral nebraska farmer pleaded with it to do more 
brown who raises corn and soybeans with three sons on 3300 
acres said he too has parked his plow and if this makes me a 
good guy i guess i qualify 
hes a member of the sierra club but he can hardly be called a 
lowinput farmer he said 
to get corn yields of 150 to 200 bushels per acre this is what 
he pours onto each acre 24 in seeds 51 in fertilizer 18 in 
herbicides 12 in insecticides and 50 to 60 worth of electricity 
to run the irrigation system 
we know this is wrong said brown but we dont know what 
else to do about it because we still have to make a living i belong 
to a lot of organizations that recognize the problem but i have to 
make a living

former rep jim jones withdrawal from the race 
for chairman of the democratic national committee clears the field 
for former jesse jackson aide ronald brown to assume the top party 
job next month 
jones became the last opponent of brown to drop out of the race 
monday when he conceded brown had enough votes on the 404member 
committee to assure his election next week 
i dont see prolonging a campaign that is outvoted jones 
said 
browns election to the top democratic party job was assured last 
week when three other rivals for the post dropped out and endorsed 
him although jones briefly continued his challenge brown claimed 
he had enough votes to win and there was nearunanimous agreement 
within the party that he did 
the democratic national committee meets in washington on feb 10 
to select a new chairman to replace paul kirk who is giving up the 
job 
jones a former congessman from oklahoma said he spoke with 
brown on sunday and congratulated him for winning 
brown was democratic national convention manager for presidential 
hopeful jackson last year some of browns opponents had cited his 
ties to jackson sen edward m kennedy dmass and new york gov 
mario cuomo as evidence he would give ammunition to republicans 
trying to paint the democrats as too liberal 
brown met over the weekend with jewish leaders in denver in an 
attempt to put to rest concerns about his views on israel which 
were raised because of his association with jackson 
jones in announcing his withdrawal said he would still address 
the dnc members during their twoday meeting in washington and would 
continue efforts to move the party to a more centrist position 
he said brown has to take some steps that will show true 
independence and display a commitment to winning back southern and 
western voters to the democratic party 
he warned that the party is perceived by many as too liberal 
that voting trends are moving against democrats and that they could 
lose control of congress and find themselves a true minority party 
in coming years 
the democratic party could go the way of the british labor 
party unless we make some fundamental changes in our message and 
image he said 
if the democrats keep sweeping under the rug the fact that we 
are losing moderate voters that were losing adult white male 
voters that were losing white and ethnic minority young voters if 
we keep sweeping those statistics under the rug and failing to face 
up to them we are really buying our own doom jones said

no need to hold your nose a new organization 
of skunk lovers says the animals make wonderful pets once their 
ability to create a stink is removed 
these are the most misunderstood animals in the world said 
jane bone a national authority on skunks in the state of 
georgia there has never been a documented case of rabies in 
domesticated skunks 
so maybe rabies isnt what some people had in mind but the new 
members of skunks as pets inc say theyve taken steps to ensure 
that their pets are uh socially acceptable 
pet skunks are descented at an early age and are incapable of 
any olfactory assaultism they say 
about 30 people met sunday to organize an augustaarea chapter of 
the skunk organization as they talked their pets stinky daisy 
barney pudgy and friends made themselves at home ambling around 
and checking things out 
ms bone said pet skunks are not wild animals in fact skunks as 
pets which is beginning to register skunks much like the american 
kennel club does dogs will not recognize a black and white skunk 
unless it can be proven the animal is domestic 
consequently the skunks at the meeting were either albinos 
which have been bred domestically for more than 100 years or 
chocolates which have been bred for 40 to 50 years 
ms bone was quick to point out that the animals arent for 
everyone particularly children under age 12 and that they 
require conscientious care

conservatives applauded and liberals took a 
waitandsee attitude toward the justice departments recommendation 
of federal appeals court judge kenneth w starr as the new us 
solicitor general 
justice department sources confirmed monday that starr 42 had 
been recommended to president bush to becme the governments chief 
appeals lawyer arguing cases before the supreme court and deciding 
whether to appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies 
white house spokesmen said monday they did not know when bush 
might nominate starr but a justice department source speaking on 
condition of anonymity said i understand its a done deal bush 
hasnt done anything on it but we wouldnt have recommended it 
formally if we didnt think it suited his personnel people 
the nomination would be subject to senate confirmation 
starr born in vernon texas has been on the us circuit court 
of appeals for the district of columbia since oct 11 1983 before 
that he had been a clerk for former chief justice warren e burger 
a partner with the los angeles law firm of gibson dunn amp crutcher 
and counselor to former attorney general william french smith 
he had previously been mentioned as a possible supreme court 
nominee after the 1987 retirement of justice lewis powell 
starr was unavailable for interviews monday his secretary said 
kenneth cribb a top aide in reagans white house and in former 
attorney general edwin meese iiis justice department said monday 
that starr would make an excellent solicitor general 
i found him to be quite compatible with the conservative 
judicial philosophy of the reagan administration in all matters 
said cribb a senior fellow at the conservative heritage foundation 
bruce fein a conservative columnist and attorney who was 
associate deputy attorney general during president reagans first 
term said in a november 1988 column that starr epitomizes the 
reagan judicial legacy 
fein said monday that virtually all of starrs written opinions 
have been earmarked by conservative instinct yet openmindedness 
theres no ideological fervor 
but liberals expressed some wariness 
were looking at the nomination very cautiously said susan 
liss legal director for people for the american way 
i think the most interesting thing about starrs selection is 
that it gives the administration another seat in the dc circuit to 
fill she said starr has been a less reliable conservative than 
the reagan administration may have hoped when it selected starr to 
sit on the court 
one seat on the appeals court robert borks already is open 
bork resigned after the senate rejected reagans nomination to place 
him in the supreme court 
to colleen oconnor of the american civil liberties union 
starr is a question mark 
however she added all the signals that have come out of the 
bush administrations justice department do not seem all that 
different from what weve seen in the past 
in some recent cases starr has joined with other judges to 
uphold first amendment rights 
in other cases he helped overturn courtimposed limits on the 
district of columbias prison population and helped throw out the 
dc fire departments affirmative action hiring plan 
starr received his bachelors degree from george washington 
university in 1968 got a masters from brown university in 1969 and 
graduated from duke university law school in 1973 
if approved starr would succeed charles fried who has left the 
solicitor office to return to harvard university law school

thirtytwo medical employees of the veterans 
administration have been disciplined for accepting money and other 
gratuities from drug companies doing business with the agency 
the va said monday that its department of medicine and surgery 
took the action as a result of a threeyear investigation by the va 
inspector general into dealings between va doctors and other 
employees and five pharmaceutical suppliers 
the actions were for the acceptance of travel expenses speaking 
fees grants or consulting fees and for being absent from work 
without taking vacation to do the outside work the va said 
the probe began after an earlier investigation into dealings by 
another drug company resulted in disciplinary actions against 34 va 
physicians and other employees in 1987 
in response to a freedom of information act request the vas 
office of inspector general said that in the latest actions one 
employee was suspended 29 received admonishments and two received 
reprimands which are more serious than admonishments 
in three other cases no action was taken because the employees 
resigned 
six cases were referred to the justice department which decided 
against prosecution in four of them in most cases citing lack of 
criminal intent the other two cases remain under consideration 
in addition the agency provided counseling to 18 employees and 
issued instructional letters to 473 employees steps that were the 
result of the investigation but are not considered disciplinary 
actions 
the inspector general withheld names of the employees involved 
in a written statement the va said the employees violated 
regulations or policies concerning actual or apparent conflict of 
interest through the improper acceptance of money or other 
gratuities many of the cases involved va doctors or other employees 
attending or speaking at meetings and symposiums sponsored by the 
companies 
assistant inspector general jack h kroll said the investigation 
has not been closed and that actions involving several va employees 
have not been completed 
investigative reports released by the inspector general said that 
in one case a va doctor employed parttime received fees and 
expenses totaling over 175000 from eli lilly amp co and for two 
years had a 10000 a year consulting agreement with lilly 
during that period he served as chairman of a va hospitals 
formulary committee a panel that selects drugs for use by the 
hospital 
in another case a va employee received speeking fees amounting 
to 35050 and expenses of 14018 and was absent from work for 335 
hours the agency said in still another an employee received 
honoraria from two companies on 79 occasions including fees of 
38250 and expenses of 34018 
in addition to lilly companies involved were cibageigy corp 
hoechstroussel pharmaceuticals inc merksharp amp dome and abbott 
laboratories 
the original investigation involved payments by smith kline amp 
french laboratories 
both investigations involved activities in 1981 through november 
1985 
donna st john spokesman for the vas department of medicine and 
surgery said that following the initial investigation the va took 
steps to ensure employees were familiar with regulations and 
policies prohibiting certain dealings with private companies 
the va which in march will become the department of veterans 
affairs operates the nations largest hospital system and has 
194000 employees

the dogwoods may not be blooming at camp david 
this spring because of a devastating fungus disease that the 
agriculture department says could become a national epidemic among 
the native trees 
usda plant geneticist frank s santamour said monday that the 
disease has swept through native dogwood seedlings at a test site 
near the presidential retreat in marylands catoctin mountains the 
seedlings were from 17 states and proved highly susceptible to 
anthracnose disease 
they all declined in vigor and after two years 75 percent were 
dead santamour said he predicted that all of the test seedlings 
will be dead by the end of 1989 
santamour who works for the departments agricultural research 
service at the national arboretum in washington said no north 
american flowering dogwood trees of the species cornus florida are 
known to resist the disease 
asiatic or chinese dogwood cornus kousa which produces flowers 
similar to c florida showed some leaf spotting from the disease 
but otherwise were said to have performed well in santamours study 
the fungus that causes dogwood anthracnose has not been 
identified exactly he said but there appears to be no insect 
carrier of the fungus as with dutch elm disease the dogwood fungus 
depends on wind and water to spread from tree to tree 
santamour said the origin of the disease outbreak is obscure it 
began in the late 1970s on the west coast among c nuttallii 
dogwoods and the c florida on the east coast he said 
however we can probably rule out environmental stress as a 
casual factor santamour said 
a 1984 survey of nearly 50000 dogwoods in catoctin mountain park 
by the us park service and usdas forest service confirmed 
scattered reports of the new devastating disease among the native 
dogwoods 
santamour there is probably little hope for finding native 
dogwoods resistant to anthracnose 
dogwoods in the study were grown from seeds from alabama 
arkansas connecticut florida georgia kentucky louisiana 
maryland michigan missouri mississippi new jersey north 
carolina ohio oklahoma pennsylvania and virginia

its long past time for scoffing at socalled 
lowinput farming and its reduced use of fertilizers pesticides and 
weedkillers say a growing number of experts including senior 
agriculture department officials and many others 
will erwin an indiana farmer and a member of the federal farm 
credit assistance board said monday that socalled lowinput 
sustainable agriculture called lisa by advocates does not mean 
returning to the era of horse power and manual labor on the farm 
we cannot look back we cannot look at it as going back 
erwin told the conference 
but there are some good reasons economic and environmental 
for farmers to trim back on some of the the items they use such as 
fertilizer and pesticides and the manner in which those items are 
used 
there is a growing force in our society that says to farmers 
that we paid you not to produce while you used chemicals and 
fertilizer to produce more and more and we want lower cost 
programs and a safer environment he said 
the concept of lowinput sustainable agriculture has been around 
for a long time it has grown since the energy crunch of the 1970s 
and as environmental issues such as soil and water pollution have 
taken a deeper hold 
congress in the 1985 farm law authorized usda to conduct research 
and education programs in alternative farming systems often 
referred to as lowinput or sustainable agriculture in 1987 
congress appropriated 39 million to push the lisa concept 
the twoday conference at the department attracted about 150 
registrants to hear farmers and other talk about their experiences 
with lowinput production methods more than 100 of those registered 
represented special interest groups usda agencies and other federal 
offices 
vivan jennings deputy administrator of the extension service 
called lisa an issue whose time has come but cautioned that no 
one should expect miracles 
we should recognize its not a panacea jennings said its 
not going to solve all of our problems and we need to remember that 
as we move ahead 
luther berntson a north dakota farmer who uses the lowinput 
approach for years on his 2000acre operation said that federal 
farm programs helped put production agriculture into a rut 
i dont need to remind you that the government farm programs of 
the past have not rewarded the best management practices he said

severely depressed patients not only see the 
light but turn from sad to glad while wearing an unusual hat fitted 
with two fluorescent tubes according to researchers who hope to 
help millions with the device 
the invention is a hat that looks like a pith helmet with the two 
tubes placed parallel to the eyebrows it was designed as a 
portable wearable way to treat patients suffering from a severe 
form of winter depression dubbed seasonal affective disorder or sad 
almost everyone i know cant stand february and looks forward 
to spring said dr george brainard a neurologist who along with 
biomedical engineer dan benson developed the hat at thomas jefferson 
university 
but he said the victims of sad have an outright lack of 
energy and an inability to cope 
sad is characterized by withdrawal social isolation depression 
a craving for carbohydrates weight gain a tendency to sleep longer 
and fatigue people with sad generally improve as springtimes 
sunnier days grow closer 
scientists estimate that sad severely afflicts about 10 million 
americans about 25 million experience a milder form of the 
disorder most of the cases occur in the northern states where days 
are shorter 
researchers have found that exposure to bright light or 
phototherapy alters the production of the hormone melatonin and 
relieves the depression 
brainard said researchers believe the therapy works because light 
directed into the eyes stimulates a region of the brain called the 
hypothalamus which controls production of hormones including 
melatonin 
how light works to alter hormone production and relieve 
depression is not known he said 
the two 6inch lights five times as bright as the light in a 
welllit room fit under the brim of the hat which is attached by 
a cord to a battery pack worn on a shoulder strap 
brainard and benson designed the first prototype two years ago 
this month they began testing the hat on six patients with sad and 
hope to treat up to 20 this season 
in 85 percent of sad cases light therapy has caused a 
significant improvement or complete relief of all symptoms said 
brainard 
but most patients cant spend their days outside in bright 
sunshine the light hat enables people to fit the phototherapy into 
their busy lives by wearing the hat at home 
patients wear the hat for about two hours a day usually in the 
morning said dr karen stewart director of jeffersons sad clinic 
a portable device makes it possible for a person to receive 
therapy and still maintain a regular morning routine she said 
patients using conventional phototherapy must spend one to five 
hours daily in front of a fluorescent light box the bulky light box 
weighs about 25 pounds and patients often complain about scheduling 
the therapy around jobs and family 
you cant really carry them on an airplane brainard said 
five of the six patients using the hat have responded to the 
treatment ms stewart said 
one responded so well that even after she was withdrawn after 
a week of wearing the hat she hasnt relapsed into depression in 
three weeks she said 
the patient who didnt respond was physically ill at the time and 
will test the hat again 
other scientists also are working on similar projects 
dr thomas wehr of the national institute of mental health in 
rockville md said he and his collegues designed several 
prototypes of a light visor two years ago and found it extremely 
effective in treating sad 
we had trouble getting the devices back he said 
wehr said he was aware of at least one or two other groups 
working on similar devices and his group is continuing development 
of a lighter version 
both groups have applied for patents 
the knowledge gained through the clinical testing of the light 
hat will further brainards research for the national aeronautics 
and space administration on artificially lit environments such as 
the space shuttle 
brainard said that as humans and animals spend increasingly 
longer time in space researchers are concerned about how the body 
can react adversely to artificial light 
his research is financed in part by the space agency to design 
and develop lighting systems for the shuttle and the planned space 
station

a federal judge is being asked to block the 
first application of genetic engineering using an animal virus gene 
in the experimental treatment of human cancer 
the request is contained in a us district court lawsuit filed 
monday by the foundation on economic trends and its president 
jeremy rifkin 
it asks for an injunction to block plans by researchers at the 
national institute of health to use a rat virus to manipulate a gene 
in an experimental treatment of melanoma a virulent and often fatal 
skin cancer 
the suit claims that the institutes recombinant dna advisory 
committee which reviews human genetic engineering experiments 
approved the cancer therapy without conducting proper public 
hearings 
as the suit was being filed in downtown washington on monday 
rifkin and others in the foundation met with the 25member committee 
at the institutes offices in maryland for a heated discussion of 
rifkins proposal that the nih be required to form a citizens 
committee to evaluate dangers involved in human genetic engineering 
members of the institutes advisory group voted 230 with two 
members abstaining against forming the citizens committee rifkin 
vowed to come back again and again and again with his proposal 
the lawsuit asks the court to block the first formal attempt ever 
to insert a foreign gene into human beings 
the suit targets research approved earlier this month to treat 
melanoma patients with a type of white blood cell called a tumor 
infiltrating lymphocyte til that has been genetically altered 
til cells are developed by the body in small numbers to fight the 
growth of melanoma tumors 
three nih researchers steven a rosenberg r michael blaese and 
w french anderson showed in earlier work that til cells can be 
used to battle cancer by taking them from a patients tumor growing 
them in large numbers in the laboratory and then reinserting them 
into the patient in results published in december the technique 
was at least partially successful in 12 of 20 patients 
to understand why til therapy works for some but not others the 
scientists want to trace the white blood cells after they are 
returned to the patient in order to do this the researchers want 
to mark the cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistance 
to neomycin an antibiotic in this way cells from the patients 
tumors or blood stream could be identified and movement of the cells 
into the tumors could be monitored 
but in order to get the gene of the bacteria into the white blood 
cells the scientists proposed to use a rat leukemia retrovirus it 
was the use of this virus that triggered the lawsuit 
the study proposed that the experimental therapy be used on 10 
melanoma patients with a life expectancy of just 90 days and that 
it not be used on other patients until the technique is reevaluated 
the research proposal underwent seven months of reviews 
including hearings by nih committees the food and drug 
administration and a congressional committee on jan 18 james b 
wyngaarden director of the nih gave final approval 
in their lawsuit rifkin and the foundation on economic trends 
say the approval was not proper because a subcommittee review of the 
proposal was not conducted with public notice and public 
participation and that final approval by the full committee was by 
a mailed ballot instead of in a public hearing 
a court clerk said the case has been assigned to the court of 
us district judge john g penn no hearing had been scheduled 
monday but the clerk said it would probably be sometime this week

president bush isnt talking yet about his plan 
to restructure the savings and loan system but the report of a 
study group he headed as vice president may preview his approach 
if the 1984 recommendations of the task group on regulation of 
financial services are any indication bush will take a cautious 
approach rather than advocate a wholesale restructuring of the 
industry 
the 1984 report recommended maintaining a separate system for 
sampls at least in the near term but allowing sampls to become banks 
as their activities and services grew more banklike 
and rather than calling for a return to old restrictions the 
group emphasized a system of incentives including riskbased 
insurance premiums and higher capital levels to encourage sampls to 
operate safely 
bushs staff director for the task group washington attorney 
richard breeden joined the white house staff last week and is 
expected to play the key role in shaping the administrations sampl 
plan 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that the 
president hopes to outline the plan in a feb 9 speech although he 
may not have all the details by then 
much has changed since bush signed the task group report but 
although the magnitude of sampl insolvencies had not yet come to 
light the study recognized what since has been identified as a key 
contributor to the problem permissive laws in some states that 
allowed sampls to stray into risky areas far removed from their 
traditional business of making home mortgage loans 
rather than force sampls to revert to their traditional form the 
bush group recommended riskrelated insurance premiums requiring 
institutions entering new areas to pay more into the government 
insurance fund than conservatively run sampls currently all sampls pay 
the same premium 
higher levels of capital also would discourage excessive risks 
it said the owner of an sampl with low capital levels has little to 
lose and much to gain from taking a big risk while the taxpayers 
who are the ultimate backers of insured deposits have much to lose 
and nothing to gain 
the task force recommended that sampl capital levels be brought up 
to the stricter standards applied to commercial banks that is now 
being done but wont be in full force until 1991 
contrary to the current thinking of most analysts bushs group 
advocated that federal regulators turn over some of their authority 
to the states but only to states whose regulatory systems met 
federal requirements 
that would create an incentive for states to develop stronger 
regulatory programs it argued as a guard against states whose 
standards slip it said federal insurers should be permitted to 
revoke the insurance of stateregulated institutions 
currently there are two schools of thought regarding the future 
of the sampl industry one advocated by the chief industry lobby 
group the us league of savings institutions contends that 
thrifts should remain distinct from commercial banks but that they 
ought to stick primarily to mortgage lending 
the other school says theres no longer a need for a separate 
industry it notes that commercial banks and mortgage firms owned by 
nonfinancial companies such as sears roebuck amp co have entered 
home mortgages in a big way thanks to governmentchartered agencies 
which buy mortgages and repackage them into securities for sale to 
investors 
the bush task force steered a middle course it recommended 
retaining the federal home loan bank system for thrifts and keeping 
three separate insurance funds for banks thrifts and credit unions 
but it offered a mechanism for the financial system to evolve 
thrifts that stuck primarily to mortgage lending would remain part 
of a separate system at a certain point sampls that entered enough 
new areas becoming more like banks would have to join the bank 
regulatory system with its stricter regulation

the mexican government has asked us officials 
to provide information that allegedly links top mexican law 
enforcement officials to narcotics trafficking the washington post 
reported today 
the paper said former secretary of state george p shultz 
shortly before leaving office asked us law enforcement agencies 
to provide any credible information on the matter the post said 
the newspaper reported the new mexican government of president 
carlos salinas de gortari asked for the information a request that 
some us officials fear could compromise sensitive us 
intelligence sources in that country 
shultz in a jan 13 letter obtained by the post said a senior 
mexican government official had pledged that appropriate 
investigations and actions would be taken if the request was 
fulfilled 
shultz said however that the mexicans needed the information 
before it was made public in the press because the salinas 
government could not be perceived as responding to us media 
allegations 
the letter which the post said has not been answered by any us 
agency is the latest development in a growing dispute between us 
law enforcement officials and the state department over the new 
mexican governments commitment to cracking down on drug trafficking 
the post said some us officials have expressed concern that 
some of salinas top appointees particularly in the attorney 
generals office and other law enforcement agencies may have ties 
to major mexican drug traffickers or have not shown full commitment 
to eliminating drugrelated corruption

members of congress are moving to close a 
custommade loophole in federal election laws allowing some of them 
to keep unspent campaign funds a potential personal bonus of up to 
1 million each 
the loophole which was written to help ensure passage of the 
1980 election law has since lost some of its popularity in 
congress repealing the provision is now part of a package of 
legislation related to a pending 50 percent pay raise 
its an embarrassment to them norman ornstein a political 
analyst with the american enterprise institute said monday its 
the sort of question not too many members who were there before 1980 
want to have asked of them 
i think its a foregone conclusion that theyll do away with 
it 
more than 61 million in surplus campaign funds is sitting in the 
accounts of 191 house members and 71 senators who were in congress 
when the law was passed a grandfather clause in the law allows 
them to convert the money for personal use an action forbidden for 
those who came to congress later 
on the average house members who were grandfathered in hold 
about 224000 in their campaign accounts while senators whose 
campaigns usually are considerably more costly have an average of 
341000 according to fec records 
i didnt go out and spend all the money because thats not the 
way i operate my own home said rep larry j hopkins rky i 
spend what i think is appropriate to win 
hopkins who cruised to reelection on a 3to1 margin last year 
had 604824 left over in his campaign account according to records 
at the federal election commission 
that puts him in 10th place among members of the house 
the top spot in the house belongs to rep stephen solarz dny 
with more than 11 million solarz is cosponsor of a bill that 
would abolish the grandfather clause 
the house ways and means committee chairman rep dan 
rostenkowski dill has more than 1 million up from 596000 
since january 1987 and has not expressed an opinion on the issue 
of abolishing the loophole according to an aide 
in the senate the list is topped by sens bill bradley dnj 
with nearly 21 million and phil gramm rtexas with 19 million 
however those amounts are not unusually big war chests since both 
those senators face reelection campaigns next year 
the legislation now before each house would eliminate the 
possibility of letting the grandfathered members convert leftover 
funds to their own uses but would continue permitting conversion for 
the other uses allowed under the law 
candidates for congress can use leftover campaign money to 
support political organizations or other candidates in addition 
members of congress can use the money to defray any ordinary and 
necessary expenses arising because of their position 
and unlike the house the senate has a rule forbidding its 
members from converting their campaign money for personal use 
although it does not have the force of law and its effect on former 
senators or their survivors is unclear 
proposals to abolish the exemption in both the house and senate 
have come up as members of congress are about to pick up 50 percent 
pay raises boosting salaries from 89500 to 135000 annually for 
rankandfile lawmakers 
hopkins said monday that he kept his campaign treasury stocked 
with cash because he represents a largely democratic district and he 
doesnt want to borrow 
you will never see larry hopkins holding one of these dumb fish 
frys at 25 a head to retire a campaign debt he said 
he offered to give back money over the next month to anybody 
who donated to my campaign last time and is not satisfied please 
contact me and i will send the money back

a federal judge has blocked a random 
drugtesting program at the interior department calling it an 
example of bureaucracy run amok that would deprive thousands of 
people of their fundamental right to privacy 
the program which would have taken effect today would require 
17000 of the agencys 70000 employees to be tested for drug use 
us district judge harold h greene granted a preliminary 
injunction sought by the national federation of federal employees 
in his 36page opinion greene said the program is essentially 
a show in which the civil servants employed at the interior 
department are the involuntary players 
the program was aimed at those who were considered to be holding 
jobs sensitive enough to require drug testing the departments 
definition of sensitive positions included clerical assistants mail 
and file clerks auditors cartographers and printing press 
operators 
greene said such designation of routine job holders as being 
all in sensitive positions is bureaucracy run amok 
greene said the governments goals do not justify a significant 
intrusion into an employees privacy particularly when there is 
absolutely no showing that drug use exists that is impairing the 
routine functions let alone the critical responsibilities of the 
department 
greene said the program would deprive thousands of citizens of 
fundamental privacy rights not because anyone actually suspects 
that they are drug users but because they are employees of the 
government whom that government believes it can command on that 
account to repair to the toilets so that it is able thereby to 
demonstrate its commitment to the war on drugs 
the program had been envisioned by former interior secretary 
donald hodel as a model for the government 
greene did not enjoin the department from testing employees on 
reasonable suspicion of drug use and the lawsuit did not 
address the departments recent policy requiring drug tests of job 
applicants including secretarydesignate manuel lujan jr who was 
the first tested under that policy

lawrence rainey the sheriff when three 
civil rights workers were slain in rural neshoba county in 1964 is 
demanding a retraction from the producers of mississippi burning 
they didnt use my name but nobody in mississippi or any other 
state has any doubt they intended that sheriff to be me said 
rainey 65 now employed as a security officer in meridian 
we will be mailing a demand letter for a retraction on tuesday 
and thats a prerequisite for a lawsuit under mississippi law 
said his attorney james mcintyre 
rainey was acquitted on charges of violating the civil rights of 
the three workers in a federal trial at which he was represented by 
mcintyre 
mcintyre said the film mixes fact with fiction and depicts 
rainey as terrorizing citizens of neshoba county it depicts him as 
being a person bent on violence and it is not an accurate fair 
account of what did happen in neshoba county in 1964 
on june 21 1964 james earl chaney 21 who was black and 
whites andrew goodman 20 and michael schwerner 24 disappeared 
after they were released from the county jail in philadelphia they 
had been stopped for speeding after investigating a church burning 
by the ku klux klan 
their bodies were found 44 days later in a soggy earthen dam in 
rural neshoba county all three had been shot to death 
alan parkers mississippi burning an orion pictures release 
is loosely based on the murders the film which stars gene hackman 
and willem dafoe has drawn both praise from movie critics and 
criticism from blacks who contend it gives the fbi too much credit 
in the civil rights struggle 
rainey maintains his innocence and said the movie had subjected 
him to ridicule 
the character in the movie was a big man like me and he chewed 
tobacco like i chewed tobacco all the time said rainey who works 
for a blackowned security firm 
everybody knows it was made off the happenings in neshoba 
county he said monday the actor had twice as big a crew of 
tobacco as i ever had but they might have well as called him 
lawrence rainey 
rainey who served as neshoba county sheriff from 1964 to 1968 
said he had lost a security job in 1975 following a movie based on 
the civil rights violence in mississippi 
ive got a good relationship with blacks he said im 
working for a black man and a black company but he is getting a lot 
of feedback for working me 
the former sheriff said he wanted mcintyre to proceed with a 
damage suit immediately because of the way it has hurt me and is 
going to hurt me 
if they say we are sorry for what has happened and it isnt 
true mcintyre said that still does not negate a cause of 
action it only mitigates the damages 
mcintyre noted that of the 18 individuals brought to trial on 
charges of conspiring to violate the victims civil rights only 
rainey and a few others were found innocent seven were convicted 
and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years 
calls to orion pictures were not answered late monday afternoon

the bush administration is reaching out to 
congressional democrats on the sampl crisis after creating a furor 
over a plan to charge depositors a fee for federal insurance of 
their savings and checking accounts 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who floated the idea of a 
depositors fee last week in meetings with congressional 
republicans met privately monday with house speaker jim wright 
dtexas and other key democrats to stress other options being 
considered 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting house 
ways and means committee quoted brady as saying during the meeting 
in wrights office that president bush has made no decisions on any 
of the alternatives 
everybodys looking for the path of least resistance 
rostenkowski said theres no solution thats not going to be 
painful 
industry and government experts say the cost of closing insolvent 
thrift institutions while protecting their depositors against losses 
would range from 90 billion to more than 110 billion over the next 
10 years 
the alternatives include issuing 25 billion to 60 billion in 
bonds some of it backed directly by the government or through 
raising the premiums that banks and savings and loan associations 
now pay for federal insurance 
the healthy institutions wont be for increased premiums 
rostenkowski said 
but he added that the idea of charging depositors about 250 for 
each 1000 in their checking or savings accounts in federally 
insured institutions is as flat as a pancake 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that bush 
hopes to spell out plans for dealing with the savings and loan 
crisis in his feb 9 budget address to congress but might not be 
ready with details by then 
fitzwater said bush and other administration officials will 
continue to seek advice from members of congress despite complaints 
by white house chief of staff john sununu that lawmakers had leaked 
discussions of a fee on deposits 
consultations are a very important part of the process 
fitzwater said president bush has been reaching out to congress 
in many forms we would expect that to continue 
sununu had suggested on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley on sunday that certain members of congress may have 
violated the administrations trust in leaking word that the 
depositor fee was being considered 
fitzwater said such a fee which some critics say would violate 
bushs nonewtaxes pledge remains an option

vice president dan quayle told religious 
broadcasters that the gospel of vladimir lenin still pervades 
the soviet union and the united states must be realistic in dealing 
with that communist nation 
speaking monday to the national religious broadcasters quayle 
said the soviet communist party had over the years gained an 
appalling confidence in its own wisdom indeed its own 
omniscience 
i think the root of the matter all comes back to a hatred of 
god to a rejection of the entire concept of a religious system 
he said 
comparing the american revolution with the communist revolution 
in russia quayle said look how much good has come into the world 
as a result of the first revolution and how much evil has entered 
the world because of the second 
bush is addressing the group wednesday 
quayles comments somewhat reminiscent of ronald reagans 
rhetoric in the early days of his presidency when he called the 
soviet union an evil empire differed in tone from recent bush 
remarks concerning the soviets 
bush has used less harsh wording but has urged a cautious 
approach to ussoviet relations which were improving as reagans 
term came to an end 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said quayles 
comments were not inconsistent with administration policy 
quayle quoted lenin the leader of the 1917 communist revolution 
as saying the idea of god is unutterable vileness of the most 
dangerous kind 
that was lenin and unfortunately his gospel is still actively 
pursued in the soviet union quayle said 
on the other hand quayle said the us founding fathers had a 
belief in the existence of a creator whose laws have placed 
irrevocable limits on the power of the state 
he also said that if moscows planned 1991 international human 
rights conference occurs the united states must ensure that it is 
not just a public relations extravaganza for the soviet leadership 
president bush has said he would follow through on reagans plan 
for us participation in the conference but also has said us 
officials will be watching soviet human rights performance in the 
interim 
talking about his trip this week to venezuela and el salvador 
quayle said my message will be democracy democracy and more 
democracy he said 
quayle is not expected to make any policy initiatives during the 
trip but plans to meet with a number of heads of state who will 
attend thursdays inauguration of venezuelas new president carlos

the nations 15000 nursing homes will have to 
meet higher standards of care and give patients more say in their 
treatment under new regulations for medicaid and medicare 
reimbursement 
the final regulations announced monday cap several years of 
efforts by the health care financing administration to meet the 
terms of a law passed by congress in 1987 to improve the quality of 
nursing home care 
these regulations change our focus in regulating nursing homes 
away from looking to see merely if a facility has the capacity to 
deliver care to looking at the quality of care that is actually 
being delivered said dr william l roper hcfa administrator 
among other things the regulations will 
give patients the right to refuse treatment manage their own 
money receive visitors manage their own privacy express 
grievances be free of physical restraints and not be transferred or 
discharged against their will 
offer patients services needed to treat specific conditions and 
guard against such things as inappropriate weight gain and loss and 
bed sores 
require nursing homes to have 24hour nursing capability 
including a registered nurse for eight hours of every day 
require facilities to train nurses aides provide dental 
vision and hearing care and offer an activities program by a 
qualified professional 
the final regulations will apply to nearly 15000 longterm care 
facilities the rules are open to a 90day comment period and most 
will go into effect 90 days after that the rest will go into effect 
oct 1 1990 
the american health care association which represents licensed 
nursing homes and longterm health care facilities generally 
endorsed the regulations but expressed concern about the length of 
time it is taking to put them in place 
the group also is concerned that if there is not adequate 
funding for them they wont have the impact they were intended to 
have said linda keegan a spokeswoman for the association 
the american nursing association said it was extremely 
concerned at the disregard for the quality of care in the 
regulations 
lucille joel president of the nursing association criticized 
the rules for permitting hfca to waive a requirement that a 
registered nurse be on duty for eight hours a day seven days a week 
the health and human services agency has proposed no criteria on 
which to grant waivers and has implied that the waivers may be 
used as a way to cut the budget for medicare and medicaid nursing 
home programs she said 
tom hoyer director of provider service coverage policy at hfca 
said the law allows waivers only when a nursing home cant find 
nurses to hire and would be granted only if quality of care were not 
affected the agency will be issuing proposed rules for waiver 
requirements in the next couple of months he said

a new drug therapy can extend the lives of men 
with advanced prostate cancer by nearly 25 percent according to a 
study on which the food and drug administration based its approval 
of the new treatment 
the fda on monday approved the new hormoneblocking drug 
flutamide for use in combination with another drug that affects 
hormone production in patients whose prostate cancers are in the 
most advanced stage 
the drug will be marketed under the trade name eulexin by the 
scheringplough corp of madison nj 
fda commissioner frank e young cautioned that flutamide is not 
a cure but he said a national cancer institute study 
demonstrated how it can be used to extend the lives of some men 
young also stressed that when detected in the early stages 
prostate cancer can be treated successfully 
these prostate cancers generally need not get to this stage 
if every man over 40 would have a simple rectal exam each year 
young said 
cancer of the prostate a walnutsize gland at the base of the 
male bladder is the third leading cause of cancer deaths among 
american men it kills more than 25000 men annually and about 
100000 new cases are reported each year the fda said 
the disease often develops with no noticeable symptoms warning 
signs can include difficulty in urinating frequent urination and 
presence of blood or pus in the urine or semen these are the same 
symptoms that mark prostate infections and a benign enlargement of 
the prostate that is common in older men 
in its early stages the disease can be treated successfully by 
removing all or part of the prostate or by radiation but if the 
cancer spreads to other tissue and organs chances of successful 
treatment diminish considerably 
the nci study involving 617 men with advanced prostate cancer 
showed that flutamide in combination with the previously approved 
drug leuprolide extended survival by nearly 25 percent patients 
receiving the two drugs survived an average 349 months seven 
months longer than the group that received leuprolide alone the fda 
said 
the drug has been in clinical development for 15 years and is 
marketed in 34 countries scheringplough said 
the drug works by blocking the spread of cancer cells in the 
prostate as well as in surrounding tissue 
scientists believe the male hormone testosterone stimulates 
proliferation of cancer cells by a diseased prostate leuprolide 
stops production of the hormone by the testes and flutamide is 
believed to inhibit the hormones action on cancer cells by blocking 
the receptor sites that testosterone uses in the cells the fda said 
side effects of the combined therapy included hot flashes in 61 
percent of the patients loss of libido in 36 percent impotence in 
33 percent diarrhea in 14 percent and nausea and vomiting in 12 
percent the agency said

asked to rethink its decision to require bridges to be inspected 
every four years instead of every two years as previously required 
an auto safety advocacy group and relatives of people killed in a 
1987 new york bridge collapse said in a petition filed monday 
fhwa failed to obtain crucial information relevant to the decision 
and consequently could not make a knowledgeable analysis of the 
effects of less frequent bridge inspections 
the new rule was passed in august and affects about 122000 
bridges nationwide 
the federal agency has issued the final rule despite the 
documented inadequacies of state bridge inspection programs covering 
576000 bridges clarence m ditlow iii executive director of the 
center for auto safety said in a letter accompanying the petition 
that asks the agency to review the rule change 
also filing the petition were relatives of three people who were

us power companies must build more generating 
capacity than currently planned or the nation may face an 
electricity shortage in the 1990s a trade group says 
based on conservative projections of growth in electricity 
demand the nation will need an additional 50000 megawatts of 
generating capacity by 1997 in order to avoid a shortage a newly 
published american gas association study said monday 
that amount would be needed in addition to the 32500 megawatts 
of capacity currently under construction the study said 
using an assumption of faster electricity demand growth over the 
next decade which the gas group said it considered to be more 
realistic an additional 105000 megawatts of plant capacity would 
be needed to avoid shortages 
the study said 71 percent of capacity additions planned in the 
197988 period were canceled

handgun manufacturers and sellers would be 
liable for injuries and deaths caused by the weapons under a new 
proposal by the district of columbia city council 
the proposal is designed to force gun manufacturers to consider 
carefully the purposes for which handguns are manufactured said 
council chairman david clarke the bills sponsor 
sponsors of the legislation said it will be the first of its kind 
in the nation 
the plan would hold handgun manufacturers importers and dealers 
liable for damage caused by handguns in the same manner that some 
states hold tavern owners or party hosts liable for injuries caused 
by drunken drivers 
the bill is supported by 12 of the 13 council members in a city 
whose officials are worried about a rising murder rate 
january is already the bloodiest month in city history with 49 
killings through monday the highest yearly total was set in 1988 
when 372 people were killed in the nations capital

the federal communications commission is trying 
to abandon the method it has used for the past quarter century to 
grant radio and television licenses in favor of a random lottery 
the fcc decision monday to scrap the old comparative licensing 
process was immediately criticized by a media watchdog group which 
said the commission was abdicating its decisionmaking 
responsibility and closing what has been a means of access by 
minorities and women to broadcast ownership 
in voting 30 to dump the old process commissioners called it 
slow costly and not guaranteed to determine the best applicant 
under the old system wouldbe owners must prove their worthiness to 
hold a broadcast license 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick said the lottery is faster 
arguably more equitable 
the fcc said the lottery process would be less costly to 
applicants and therefore would lower entry barriers and 
encourage newcomers to enter the broadcast industry 
but andrew schwartzman executive director of the 
washingtonbased media access project advocacy group said the 
lottery proposal was an outrageous lastditch effort to 
substitute a roll of the dice for government officials defining and 
implementing the public interest 
its spitting in the face of minorities and women and 
experienced broadcasters and instead its going to bring in the 
buccaneers on the night flight from las vegas schwartzman said 
schwartzman claimed that when congress in 1982 gave the fcc the 
power to use the lottery process it did not envision it being used 
for full service broadcasters 
the commission previously has instituted lottery procedures to 
award licenses for lowpower tv stations and cellular telephone 
operations 
the comparative process conducts hearings to compare applicants 
on factors ranging from the extent to which applicants would 
diversify media ownership the degree to which media owners would be 
integrated into station management whether such owners were local 
residents or minorities and the degree of differences in the area in 
populations to be served 
administrative law judges then grant preferences to applicants on 
each comparative factor the applicant with the best comparative 
record receives the license pending appeals a process the fcc 
said may take anywhere from three years to five years 
commissioner patricia diaz dennis said the lottery would preserve 
two major items of the comparative hearings credit for 
diversification of ownership and minority ownership 
i think that what weve set up in this item will insure that 
minority applicants and those with no other broadcast interests will 
do at least as well under a lottery as they would have done under a 
comparative hearing she said 
she said that under the current system one applicant in most 
cases will buy out a competing applicant during the challenge 
process and the fcc merely approves the settlement 
im told that 80 percent of all our cases settle and in those 
cases we then play absolutely no role in enforcing our comparative 
criteria dennis said so the applicant with the worst 
comparative qualifications can simply buy out the other applicants 
and we will routinely approve the settlement 
she said she was concerned about how the public benefits by 
having applicants pay each other 65000 to 70000 even before they 
begin to build a station 
the proposal will be open for public comments following its 
official publication in about two weeks the fcc said

a woman who gave up her baby girl under a 
surrogacy agreement and the couple who intended to adopt the infant 
but then got divorced are waging a threeway court battle over 
custody of the child 
the fight further complicated by the fact that the sperm donor 
is not the man seeking custody centers on blondhaired browneyed 
tessa now 4 years old biological daughter of norma lee stotsky 
in january 1985 the dayold girl was given to richard reams and 
beverly seymour a married couple who paid mrs stotsky 10000 and 
expenses under a surrogate mother agreement 
the marriage broke up a year later before the couple started 
adoption proceedings 
the legal entanglements began a short while later in juvenile 
court in columbus when mrs stotsky reams and ms seymour 
petitioned for custody 
subsequently reams filed an adoption petition with mrs 
stotskys consent prompting ms seymour to file one of her own 
legal and personal complications have delayed a decision in the 
case and put the child and her future at risk according to mrs 
stotskys attorney patricia grimm 
i honestly feel for all three of these people they all love 
her she said my client is pursuing this for the benefit of 
tessa she wants to make sure she gets a good home 
despite their clients differences ms grimm tessas 
courtappointed attorney charles milless and reams attorney kim 
halliburton agree on one thing tessa is bound to get hurt 
it really is a legal pingpong game said ms halliburton 
unfortunately tessa is the ball 
milless said his goal is to protect tessa from pain 
any child involved in a custody battle is an unfortunate child 
overall shes in pretty good shape we have protected her or tried 
to from publicity he said im not so sure that she 
understands all of this 
a courtordered paternity test revealed that a sperm donor other 
than reams was tessas biological father despite what ms grimm 
said was a gentlemans agreement among the three parties that 
reams would be the father 
although the donor a former colleague of mrs stotskys has 
waived any claim to the child both wouldbe adoptive parents and 
mrs stotsky have not 
all three filed custody petitions in juvenile court but a 
complicating factor is that ohio has no law governing surrogacy 
contracts 
the custody requests were put on hold while the question of 
petitions for adoption filed by reams and ms seymour was debated 
reams and ms seymour temporarily lost their separate efforts to 
adopt tessa last week when probate judge richard metcalf dismissed 
their adoption petitions primarily on the grounds that the two had 
failed to post required 3000 bonds 
the order moves the case back to juvenile court where custody 
and financial support will be determined milless said 
reams likely will appeal metcalfs decision ms halliburton said 
if his rulings are not reversed a choice will have to be 
made she said this child who loves both of her parents and 
who truly believes that they are her parents will be awarded to one 
of them 
ms grimm said another married couple is interested in adopting 
tessa but has yet to formally enter the case 
all three attorneys indicated they would fight any attempt by an 
outside party to adopt the girl 
ms grimm said mrs stotsky is undecided about whether to 
continue her pursuit of custody once the case goes back to juvenile 
court 
ms seymour could not be reached for comment on the case because 
she has an unlisted telephone number 
tessa now a ward of the juvenile court splits her time each 
week between reams and ms seymour who live in separate towns near 
columbus 
although tessa knows mrs stotsky she is unaware that she is her 
biological mother said ms grimm 
milless said he has no plans to appeal metcalfs ruling because 
he believes adoption may not be right for tessa 
i see no reason that one person should be allowed to adopt as 
opposed to the other adoption freezes the others out of the life of 
the child he said

prices for raw materials all over the world 
reached their highest level for the 1980s last year according to 
figures collected by the world bank 
it calculated that the drought in this country pushed the average 
price of wheat to 16890 a metric ton or 469 a bushel last 
month compared with an average of 11210 a metric ton or 311 a 
bushel in 1987 
big demand by the industrial countries of east asia helped raise 
the price of copper to a record 349890 a metric ton nearly 120 
a pound the world bank said monday 
the average rise for a long list of commodities was 102 percent 
for the year that brought the overall level to just a little 28 
percent above the average for the years 1979 to 1981 
problems of third world countries have been aggravated in recent 
years by low prices they have been getting for the products of 
fields and mines their chief source of foreign income for some 
things are now improving 
aluminum nickel rice sugar bananas fats and oils were all up 
for the year timber cotton and oranges were down 
in addition to the arab countries of the middle east oil is a 
major export for nigeria mexico venezuela ecuador indonesia and 
others chile benefits doubly from the rise in the copper price and 
the drop in the oil price because oil is a big import 
the average oil price in 1988 was 1360 a barrel compared with 
1720 a barrel in 1987 and the price dropped as low as 1160 a 
barrel in the fourth quarter of 1988 however oil prices increased 
steadily in december reflecting growing market confidence in the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries november decision to 
set a production ceiling of 185 million barrels a day according to 
the report 
penelope hartlandthunberg trade expert at the independent 
center for strategic and international studies said that commodity 
prices go in shortterm cycles now up and now down but the long 
term trend is now toward a decline as new inventions come into use 
and fewer raw materials are used for each dollar of goods produced 
ron duncan chief of the world banks commodities division 
pointed out that there is sometimes a wide spread even within 
individual commodities high quality arabica coffees from the 
highlands of brazil colombia and jamaica are being bought more and 
more in western europe he said 
the report credited the reintroduction of export quotas under the 
international coffee agreement as helping raise the price of 
arabicas by 20 percent in 1988 
that meant a shift away from the lower grade robusta coffees 
grown nearer the sea in west africa and indonesia their prices were 
down by 8 percent 
duncan also emphasized the uneven effects of price movements 
the newly industrialized countries in asia are importing feed 
for pigs and poultry he said that pushes up the price of grain 
up for the low income countries of africa which have to buy more 
because theyre producing less themselves and theres less foreign 
aid available 
west africa countries especially the ivory coast are suffering 
from low prices for both their coffee and cocoa

the lead witness in the night stalker 
trial described finding the nearly decapitated body of his mother 
whose slaying was the first of 13 blamed on the man who terrorized 
california four years ago 
there was a neck gash as if someone tried to remove her head 
and almost succeeded jack vincow said of his 79yearold mother 
jennie 
the sight of my mothers head almost removed was just too much 
to deal with 
the trial of richard ramirez was scheduled to resume today with 
more testimony from vincow who discovered his mothers body in her 
apartment on june 28 1984 
during his opening statement monday deputy district attorney 
philip halpin gave a detailed account of each of the slayings using 
an enlarged los angeles county map as a guide 
the prosecutor called for the death penalty against ramirez a 
shaggyhaired drifter from el paso texas who was chased down by a 
mob and arrested in the summer of 1985 
halpin did not emphasize the satanic or ritualistic aspects of 
the serial murders he let sensational aspects of the crimes speak 
for themselves and delivered a lowkey outline of the crimes that 
will be recounted for the superior court jury during the trial 
this is where your work begins he told the panel 
defense attorney daniel hernandez reserved his opening remarks 
until after the prosecution concludes its case which halpin said 
would take four months 
ramirez 28 is charged with 13 slayings and 30 other felonies 
stemming from the crime spree 
the unpredictable defendant who once shouted hail satan in 
court was subdued in the packed courtroom monday and sat slumped in 
his chair 
dressed in a dark gray suit and sunglasses he was shackled at 
the ankles as a security measure the shackles were kept from sight 
of the jury 
halpin described how the night stalker killed his victims 
through a combination of shooting slashing and bludgeoning most of 
the female victims were raped sodomized and often asked to swear 
to satan 
although the prosecutor said satanic symbols were found at some 
murder scenes he hinted the real motive was burglary 
he said the killer told his victims virtually the same thing 
wheres the money dont look at me shut up 
halpin said the prosecution will prove its case through 
fingerprints lifted from crime scenes ballistics tests and 
eyewitness testimony 
makes you scared to go home at night muttered spectator 
nancy vgoretz of los angeles as she left the courtroom 
i heard so much about him i had to see him in person 
she said adding im fascinated 
ramirez was arrested after he was captured by an angry east los 
angeles mob on aug 31 1985 the day his picture appeared in 
newspapers for the first time identifying him as the alleged night 
stalker

an american businessman and a dutch national 
have been arrested for diverting shipments of an industrial 
lubricant to jordan for use as a chemical weapon by iraq 
authorities said 
besides announcing the arrests us authorities said monday that 
a baltimorebased company agreed to plead guilty to one count of 
violating export laws in connection with the export of thiodiglycol 
the lubricant used in inks and textiles and sold under the brand 
name kromfax produces lethal mustard gas when combined with 
hydrochloric acid 
nicholas j defino 64 of new jersey and dutch citizen frans van 
amraat who was apprehended in milan italy on jan 26 were 
charged with conspiracy listing phony destinations on export 
documents and violating us export laws 
defino surrendered to customs service agents in baltimore on 
monday and was released on bond after appearing before a magistrate 
van amraat is awaiting extradition 
the chemicals manufactured by alcolac international inc of 
baltimore were illegally shipped to iran and iraq by separate 
agents during 1987 and 1988 said us attorney breckinridge l 
willcox 
the two men were accused of shipping the chemical to belgium then 
to jordan from there the chemical was transported to iraq said 
willcox 
four shipments each weighing more than 100 tons were sent to 
western europe in 1987 and 1988 but at least three wound up in 
iraq according to the federal complaint 
last year a west german pleaded guilty to purchasing a component 
of mustard gas from alcolac and shipping it via greece and singapore 
to iran 
defino conducted business with alcolac through nu kraft 
mercantile corp of new york city purchasing the more than 400 tons 
of the chemical authorities said van amraat was the european agent 
for nu kraft authorities said 
willcox said defino is vice president of united steel and strip 
corp of new york 
alcolac officials said the chemicals were sent to the middle east 
without their knowledge 
that was not my understanding said willcox who refused to 
elaborate 
alcolac vice president jack rubin said the company was unaware 
the chemicals were going to the destinations other than the european 
points listed on shipping documents he said the company has 
cooperated fully with federal investigators 
one former employee filled out the shipping documents in a way 
that ran afoul of the complex provisions of the export 
administration act rubin said the employee did not know the 
eventual destinations he said willcox declined to say whether the 
worker would be charged 
no one within this company had any indication that these 
materials were going to be diverted to the iraniraq war zone 
rubin said we feel just awful that one of our products was 
misused for that end use 
the federal investigation previously led to the arrest in july of 
peter walaschek a west german employee of chemco gmbh who 
purchased three shipments of the chemical during 1987 and 1988 for 
shipment to greece and singapore and then reexported them to iran 
willcox said 
walaschek pleaded guilty to violating american export law for 
arranging the shipments after initially agreeing to cooperate with 
prosecutors as an informant walaschek fled the country forfeiting 
a 350000 bond authorities said 
willcox said talks were continuing with west german officials 
about extraditing walaschek 
chemco had purchased thiodiglycol at the direction of sexed 
kharim ali sobhani an iranian diplomat stationed in west germany 
the new york times reported sunday 
under american law exporting the chemical requires a license 
shipments to iran iraq and syria are barred 
chemco purchased three shipments of thiodiglycol from alcolac and 
90 tons were delivered to iran in 1987 and 1988 willcox said a 
later shipment of 120 tons was intercepted by customs investigators 
who substituted water for the chemical and then traced their travels 
to iran authorities said 
one ton of thiodiglycol produces about a ton of mustard gas one 
hundred tons would cover about 50 square miles

pakistani officials are willing for the first 
time to agree to verification that they are not building nuclear 
weapons if they are permitted to buy usmade reactors for power 
production says a senior member of the house foreign affairs 
committee 
rep stephen solarz dny who brought the proposal back from a 
recent trip to pakistan said monday it deserves serious 
consideration and he will hold hearings on the idea in his asia 
subcommittee 
solarz said key pakistani officials had endorsed the 
reactorsforsafeguards swap but declined to say which ones during 
his stay in islamabad he met with new prime minister benazir bhutto 
president ghulam ishaq khan and army chief of staff gen aslam beg 
among others 
under the proposal pakistan would agree to some form of 
negotiated verification process to ensure that its nuclear program 
is put only to peaceful uses and is not devoted to weapons 
development 
pakistans nuclear intentions have been a source of friction in 
past relations with the united states although us policymakers 
sought to put those concerns aside in recent years because of 
pakistans cooperation in funneling weapons to the antisoviet 
rebels in neighboring afghanistan 
now that soviet troops are being withdrawn however the nuclear 
issue has come back to the forefront of relations between the two 
countries administration officials have said us aid to pakistan 
may be cut off after sept 30 because president bush will not be 
unable to certify that the pakistanis have not developed a nuclear 
weapon 
further details of the pakistani weapons program were reported 
monday by cbs which said nuclear materials made in the united 
states found their way to pakistan through by way of west germany 
the network said heavy water from the us savannah river weapons 
reactor complex near aiken sc was sold to a west german company 
and was processed 15 to 20 years later into the tritium gas used to 
build nuclear warheads then after being sold and resold it 
reached another west germany firm ntg which shipped the gas to 
pakistan cbs said 
pakistan is receiving 230 million in military aid and 215 
million in economic aid from the united states this year making it 
the third largest beneficiary of us aid after israel and egypt 
solarz said an agreement that would provide safeguards against 
pakistani weapons development could not only head off a prickly 
showdown over us aid but it also could facilitate a budding 
reconciliation between pakistan and neighboring india 
if the united states is willing to sell nuclear reactors for 
peaceful nuclear energy pakistan would agree to establish 
fullscope safeguards on all their nuclear facilities including 
existing ones solarz said in describing the proposal made by 
pakistani officials 
if we can cap the pakistani nuclear program at its present 
level that would represent a very significant and constructive 
development 
pakistan in the past has refused to cooperate in international 
inspection procedures under a nonproliferation treaty bhutto said 
recently that her country will not sign the international treaty 
unless india does too 
solarz noted that pakistans relatively high level of us aid 
was based on its key role in supporting the afghan rebels and that 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan would lessen the 
need for military aid but he said there might be a greater need for 
economic aid than in the past 
the reagan administration in its 1991 budget proposal asked 
that military aid levels to pakistan be increased to 240 million 
and economic aid be increased to 250 million

the soviet union has published its most detailed 
breakdown ever of warsaw pact conventional forces in europe in an 
effort to rebut western claims that the soviet bloc has a clear 
advantage over the nato alliance 
the breakdown in mondays edition of pravda the communist party 
newspaper did not however account for differences between east and 
west over how to interpret the figures 
those differences have for 15 years stymied negotiations on 
reducing conventional forces in europe 
in its statement the soviet bloc acknowledges having twice as 
many tanks in europe as nato far below the 31 advantage alleged 
by the west but claims the west has the advantage in attack 
aircraft and personnel 
hence the soviets asserted the strength of the two sides is 
about equal 
western experts did not agree 
it is clear that the idea of a rough parity of forces in europe 
does not correspond to the factual situation said henry sloan a 
spokesman for the north atlantic treaty organization 
gen john galvin the alliances american military commander 
declared i definitely do not agree that a rough parity of 
conventional forces already exists in europe 
warsaw pact defense ministers said in a statement that the 
figures add up to rough parity in conventional forces they said 
the western alliance has issued tendentious data based on a 
selective approach 
new negotiations on conventional forces are to begin march 7 in 
vienna those talks were given a boost dec 7 when president mikhail 
s gorbachev said the kremlin would reduce the red army by half a 
million soldiers by 1991 
moscow also says it will get rid of 10000 tanks 8500 artillery 
systems and 800 combat planes 
the other warsaw pact countries romania bulgaria 
czechoslovakia hungary east germany and poland have also 
announced cuts in their military forces 
pravdas report said the 16nation nato alliance has 21 million 
ground troops in europe facing 18 million from the warsaw pact 
countries and 685000 sailors in nearby seas compared to only 
338000 for the east bloc 
nato contends the warsaw pact has 31 million ground troops 
while the alliance has 22 million 
the pravda report acknowledged a 21 warsaw pact advantage in 
tanks and its tables also showed a heavy advantage for the east in 
armored personnel carriers and combat infantry vehicles 
a western analyst in moscow said privately that the warsaw pact 
appeared to have tailored the categories of forces to support its 
longstanding contention that the sides are about equal 
he noted that nato contends the eastern alliance has qualitative 
superiority in virtually every major weapons system 
sample comparative figures illustrate the differences in strength 
estimates 
the report in pravda says the warsaw pact has 59470 tanks to 
30690 for nato but the western alliance says the figures are 
51500 to 16424 
although the soviets say the west has a dramatic advantage in 
strike aircraft and helicopters nato says the warsaw pact has a 
comfortable edge 
warsaw pact figures say nato has superior numbers of ground 
troops air forces navy personnel strike aircraft helicopters and 
large surface ships while the east is ahead in tanks tactical 
missile launchers interceptor aircraft artillery and infantry 
vehicles and armored personnel carriers 
in its november report on troops in europe nato said the east 
had more soldiers main battle tanks armored infantry fighting 
vehicles artillery antitank weapons air defense systems 
helicopters combat aircraft and armored vehicle launched bridges 
that report did not include naval forces which nato said are 
capable of global deployment and this makes it artificial to 
identify specific numbers of ships associated with any one region 
analysts generally feel the west has a qualitative edge in 
tactical aircraft and naval forces neither of which is to be 
included in the vienna negotiations

prime minister yitzhak shamir has chosen former 
soviet prisoner and human rights activist natan sharansky to be 
israels new ambassador to the united nations a senior government 
official said today 
news of the choice raised concern among some israeli diplomats 
about the possibility of offending the soviet union at a time when 
relations with moscow broken off more than 20 years ago are 
improving 
a senior government official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said shamirs selection of sharansky was expected to get the 
necessary approval from finance minister shimon peres head of the 
leftleaning labor party 
labor shares power with shamirs likud bloc in the coalition 
government 
sharansky 41 served nine years of a 13year sentence in soviet 
prisons and labor camps on charges of spying he was released feb 
11 1986 as part of an eastwest prisoner exchange and flew 
immediately to israel to join his wife avital 
he was arrested in 1977 after angering the soviet authorities as 
an outspoken leader of the jewish emigration movement and for 
maintaining numerous foreign contacts 
sharansky also belonged to a human rights watch committee headed 
by andrei sakharov that was sharply critical of kremlin policies 
toward prisoners and national minorities 
the outspoken sharansky interviewed today on israel army radio 
would not comment on the report saying only he had not been 
officially offered the job 
pressed by the interviewer sharansky added i will say only 
what i want to say i have enough experience with interrogations and 
i know how to give answers i have had no formal proposal 
israel radio said shamirs surprise choice of sharansky followed 
a recommendation from former un ambassador benjamin netanyahu now 
deputy foreign minister and a legislator of the rightwing likud 
bloc 
israel has not replaced netanyahu since he left the post last 
year 
the government official said the process of appointing sharansky 
could be delayed as israeli diplomats study the soviet unions 
response 
now that were on the eve of renewing diplomatic ties on such 
a delicate time in our relations with moscow it could take some 
time to determine whether this would not offend them he said 
the soviet union one of the first countries to recognize the new 
state of israel in 1948 severed diplomatic ties during the 1967 
middle east war when israel seized lands from moscows arab allies 
ties have warmed over the past two years with both countries 
exchanging lowlevel diplomats or consular officials 
since arriving in israel sharansky has lobbied to improve 
conditions for soviet immigrants he also changed his first name 
from the russian anatoly to the hebrew natan 
sharansky has turned down bids to join any of israels major 
political parties he and his wife have two daughters rachel 2 
and hannah two months 
soviet jewry activists praised the choice of sharansky for the 
un post 
this is a good way for israel to use his talents said yuli 
edelstein a colleague of sharanskys who immigrated from moscow two 
years ago

in a new offensive against drug 
traffickers colombias narcotics police destroyed eight cocaine 
laboratories 2310 pounds of cocaine and 44 runways in remote 
areas the national police chief said 
the raids all in jungle areas occurred last weekend as part of 
operation springtime gen miguel antonio gomez said in a news 
release on monday 
gomez took over the national police last month in one of the 
frequent changes of command in government security forces new 
police commanders frequently come on strong with a series of raids 
eight people who had all made just a few dollars a day as 
laborers at the cocaine processing labs were arrested in the 
weekend raids gomez said 
not one of colombias dozen major cocaine bosses has ever been 
arrested on drug trafficking charges and convicted in colombia 
an average of two dozen cocaine processing labs are destroyed in 
colombia each year and scores of clandestine runways are bombed by 
the air force 
new labs and new runways appear within weeks a police colonel 
told the associated press last year that there probably were more 
than 500 clandestine runways in use by drug traffickers in colombia 
at any given time 
the us government gives about 15 million worth of aid to 
colombia each year in the form of equipment and training to fight 
drug trafficking 
colombian narcotics officials have suggested privately that 15 
million dollars does not go far toward stopping the 
multibilliondollar illegal cocaine trafficking in colombia 
scores of helicopters and thousands of police would be needed to 
deal effectively with the problem the officials have said privately

jeremiah cole a 46yearold former health 
maintenance organization senior manager was the foreman of the jury 
that convicted joel steinberg of firstdegree manslaughter following 
a 12week trial these are his comments as told to associated press 
writer samuel maull who covered the threemonth trial 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we arrived at a verdict in the joel steinberg 
murder trial in our eighth day of deliberations because for a short 
period on monday i abdicated my position as chairman of the group 
that action enabled the last holdout against a guilty verdict 
for firstdegree manslaughter to participate more fully in the 
deliberations that person and i had had some friction some 
conflict and another persons assumption of the chair enabled the 
holdout to participate without dealing with me 
the timing for this action was right it could not have been done 
any sooner 
i knew before the testimony was half over that there was enormous 
potential for a hung jury i could sense it in the people 
i thought there would be a hung jury this was because of the 
complexity of the case and the circumstantial nature of the evidence 
it was clear from the beginning that the only possibility of 
arriving at a verdict was to keep everyone talking avoid for a time 
the areas of greatest conflict and try to find things we could 
agree on 
we did not take a vote right away when we began deliberations an 
immediate vote would have made the jurors feel locked into a 
position i felt that we should start with as many facts that seemed 
to have significance that we could agree on 
there were unmistakable indications at the beginning of our 
deliberations that we were almost hopelessly divided 
there were three who indicated that it was more probable that 
hedda nussbaum steinbergs livein lover had done it fatally 
injured lisa than that joel had done it 
but they were not putting forth their case they never made any 
effort to convince anyone of their point of view they thought it 
was enough that they had this point of view essentially their 
position was i dont think joel did it and thats it they 
didnt understand how a jury works and comes to a consensus 
there were two other groups who were generally willing to argue 
their positions there were four in the joelisguilty group and 
about five were in what basically is a middle group that was 
undecided they always felt they should try to convince the other 
people of the positions they were holding 
the defense strategy changed several times during the trial and 
that internal inconsistency weakened their case 
only two people could have killed lisa if joel knows hedda did 
it then whats all this stuff about reyes syndrome which the 
defense at one point contended was the cause of death i could have 
easily entertained a defense of insanity and there was another 
juror who was in the joelisguilty camp who said she would have 
been open to an insanity defense he left the child on the bathroom 
floor when he went out to dinner then he comes home and uses 
cocaine there was some casual speculation by us about why they 
didnt put on an insanity defense 
the people who believed hedda had done it used marilyn waltons 
testimony who said she saw ms nussbaum slap lisa in their own 
arguments they were taking it into account in support of their case 
eventually we voted unanimously a not guilty verdict on the 
murder count this was a very difficult vote for several jurors who 
may have done so in order to avoid a hung jury 
there were hundreds of times when tension was relieved by joking 
there were only about four times when people almost came to blows 
i think that if i look deeply into my heart i would say there 
were people jurors i did not trust and some i did not hold in 
great respect over time i came to change my opinion about some of 
the people 
in the final analysis everything we accomplished was as a result 
of the two things we had in common a sense of humor and a great 
willingness to work together one of the court officers said that we 
were the loudest and funniest jury he had ever observed the noise 
the running jokes and the laughter were our way of letting off 
steam during and after our many long tense emotional deliberations 
there was an enormous amount of affection in that jury room i 
would say a form of love 
this jury was an extraordinarily diverse group of people i think 
its fair to say that despite all of our differences of background 
and of opinion we became a family so much so that we are planning 
a reunion in march

joel steinberg who faced four homicide counts in 
the death of his 6yearold illegally adopted daughter lisa was 
acquitted of the most serious charge and convicted of the 
secondmost serious 
steinberg was charged with seconddegree murder which would have 
required a finding by the state supreme court jury that he had 
recklessly struck the girl and then showed depraved indifference to 
her life by failing to get medical help 
the jury acquitted him of that charge which carries a sentence 
of 25 years to life in prison 
the charge on which steinberg was convicted firstdegree 
manslaughter required the jury to find that he intended to cause 
serious physical harm to the girl and that the injury caused her 
death the charge carries a maximum penalty of 8 13 to 25 years in 
prison 
the judge had instructed the jury it could infer that steinberg 
intended to cause the injury by the results produced by his act 
but if they found his use of cocaine had so dulled his awareness 
that he could not form intent they were to find him innocent of 
firstdegree manslaughter 
the jury did not need to consider the two lesser charges 
seconddegree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide 
the former requires action that is reckless but not with depraved 
indifference it carries a fiveto15year prison sentence 
the latter covers situations in which a death is caused by 
someone who fails to perceive the risk of his actions it carries a 
term of 1 13 to four years

shouting yankee go home dozens of 
radical students hurled firebombs today at the us cultural center 
in kwangju us officials said it was the second such attack this 
month 
about 30 firebombs were thrown but none landed inside the 
compound said an official at the us embassy in seoul the 
official who requesting anonymity said there were no injuries or 
damage 
about 50 students shouted antius slogans as they dashed out of 
alleys and hurled dozens of firebombs and rocks toward the center 
the yonhap news agency reported most of the bombs landed on the 
street it said 
drive out yankees who manipulated the kwangju massacre 
yonhap quoted students as shouting 
they also chanted shut down the kwangju center and punish 
former president chun doohwan and president roh taewoo the 
agency said 
roh was elected in december 1987 and replaced chun who stepped 
down after seven years of authoritarian rule and played a leading 
role in the brutal military suppression of the 1980 kwangju uprising 
about 100 riot police guarding the center charged at the 
attackers firing tear gas and chased them away in a few minutes 
yonhap said the agency did not say whether any students were 
arrested 
on jan 18 about 50 students attacked the center with 
sledgehammers rocks and firebombs and broke windows no one was 
hurt 
us officials in seoul who say the center has been attacked 
eight times in the past last year by radical students today denied 
reports that they have decided to close it 
but they said the facility could close if the attacks continue 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington that 
the united states has been seeking promises from south korean 
authorities that they will provide adequate protection for the 
kwangju center and its staff 
us cultural centers in seoul and pusan have also been attacked 
but not as frequently as the kwangju center the centers have 
libraries and occassionaly offer speaker programs 
antius sentiment is relatively high in kwangju an opposition 
stronghold 180 miles southwest of seoul because of the suppression 
of the 1980 prodemocracy civil uprising in the southern city 
by official count about 200 people were killed and more than 
1000 injured or wounded as government troops put down the nineday 
armed revolt 
many opposition and dissident figures claim the united states was 
involved in the kwangju incident by supporting a south korean 
government plan to quell the uprising ruthlessly 
the united states has denied any involvement in the incident and 
agreed to submit written testimony from us officials to south 
korean lawmakers who are conducting parliamentary investigations 
into misdeeds committed under chun 
the united states has 42000 troops stationed in south korea 
under a mutual defense treaty and many radical students want the 
us soldiers to leave

barbara nelson had been afraid to go out 
at night because of sniper attacks near her home then she learned 
that her tenant had confessed to the crimes 
and here he is living in my house mrs nelson exclaimed 
monday after authorities said selfstyled commando yusef abdullah 
rahman had confessed to one killing and sniper attacks that wounded 
three people on eastern long island 
ive been sitting here all morning shaking my head back and 
forth mrs nelson said i cant believe it 
rahman also has admitted to three killings in kansas city mo 
authorities said 
there is some indication that he wanted to kill all the drug 
dealers in kansas city kansas city police sgt pete edlund said 
suffolk county police reported getting telephone calls following 
the long island attacks in which the caller said his victims were 
drug dealers and crooked cops but police said there was no 
evidence that the shootings were drug related 
police arrested rahman on saturday six days after weapons found 
in a car in southampton were linked to him and the sniper attacks 
police said rahman told them that he began to play army combat 
games when he was 6 years old bought his first real gun when he was 
14 and killed someone four years later 
it appears that he enjoyed killing said timothy mazzei 
deputy chief of the district attorneys homicide bureau he got 
his kicks out of playing army and shooting people 
in written and videotaped confessions after his arrest rahman 
said he frequently went into the woods to practice combat training 
maneuvers 
on dec 5 the day of the first long island shooting rahman said 
he was running and crawling in the woods when he encountered a 
dog which he shot he said he then saw the dogs owner bernard 
timothy heaney 
i opened up on him rahman said in the police confession 
police said heaney was shot to death with a 22caliber rifle 
in three other attacks in which people were wounded rahman 
apparently chose his victims at random firing into their home 
windows before riding away on his bicycle 
in his final attack rahman shot the emergency lights out of a 
police patrol car but no one was injured 
friends in the lower income neighborhood in riverhead where 
rahman has rented a room since august described him as an extremely 
quiet devout muslim 
they seem to be talking about a different person than who lived 
here mrs nelson said of police he was very mannerly and 
respectful 
mazzei said rahman told police he knew his actions were wrong and 
expressed remorse for his actions 
there is no question there is a sickness involved but we dont 
believe he was legally insane he said 
the case is to be presented to a grand jury later this week 
rahman was placed on a suicide watch at the suffolk county jail 
where he is being held without bail warden salvatore romano said

television evangelist jimmy swaggart has 
accused penthouse magazine of trying to destroy his ministry through 
a diabolical and slanderous story in which a stripper says she 
performed sexual acts for him 
the strippers employer labeled the womans allegations detailed 
in the magazines current issue a pornographic fairy tale as 
swaggart threatened to file a libel suit monday the magazine said 
it was standing by its article 
the allegations by the woman catherine mary kampen are similar 
to those levied last year by a prostitute debra murphree those 
allegations led to swaggarts ouster from the assemblies of god a 
pentecostal denomination and a major downturn in the fortunes of 
jimmy swaggart world ministries 
there is not one shred of truth to these allegations i have 
never met or seen the woman swaggart said at a news conference at 
his ministry headquarters 
our attorneys learned of this fraudulent story in december and 
had clearly shown penthouse and its porno writer art harris the 
author that the story was untrue swaggart said we now know 
that they already knew and did not care that it was a lie 
penthouse spokesman sy presten issued a statement for publisher 
bob guccione saying the magazine stood behind the story 
the fact that she was with swaggart has been corroborated by 
her husband and others in louisiana the statement said the 
things she reports swaggart made her do are very similar to the 
story of debra murphree which have never been contradicted 
kampen 38 was quoted in penthouse as saying swaggart gained her 
trust with his counseling then emotionally manipulated her into 
acting out sexual fantasies 
she was reported to be in new york for promotional appearances 
about the article and could not be reached for additional comment 
rhonda shear coowner of hot lines a striptease telegram 
service that employs kampen in new orleans said her sister nona 
told her that kampen made up the story after seeing the penthouse 
account of murphrees relations with swaggart 
she told my sister it was all concocted shear said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles she saw the issue with debra 
murphree and said its only a matter of time before someone 
jumps on that band wagon why not me she said it was foolproof 
if she said it happened at her house 
shears sister contacted in new orleans said a lawyer had 
advised her not to comment she refused to confirm her sisters

a greenpeace ship collided with a 
japanese whaling vessel today off antarctica in the most serious 
incident since the environmental group began a campaign a week ago 
to stop the whale hunt 
the japanese ship nisshin maru no 3 sustained minor damage to 
its hand rails while the greenpeace ship gondwana was not damaged 
said greenpeace spokesman peter wilkinson there were no injuries 
he said 
wilkinson speaking from the gondwana by radio telephone told 
the associated press the 1435ton greenpeace ship was in a 
perfectly legitimate position when the vessels collided 
in sydney greenpeaces coordinator for antarctica lyn 
goldsworthy said the japanese ship used an iron grappling hook 
and attached it to the gondwana to pull it out of the way in the 
maneuvering that resulted the japanese boat collided with gondwana 
immediately after the collision wilkinson said there was a 
flood of communications between the skippers of both ships the 
japanese told us to stay away and keep a distance of at least 300 
yards he said 
japan has said it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of 
its scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks 
despite a moratorium imposed by the international whaling commission 
greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi 
restaurants in japan 
in tokyo a whaling official said today that attempts by the 
environmental group to block japanese ships from whaling in the 
antarctic are endangering the lives of the crewmen and amount to 
terrorism 
this is terrorism the same as that opposed by the united 
states and other countries said takehiro takayama of the 
tokyobased japan whaling association they have no concern about 
human life 
wilkinson said that after the collision the gondwana carrying a 
crew of 19 launched inflatable dinghies into the icy waters in an 
effort to prevent the loading of harpooned whales onto the factory 
ship 
they then turned water hoses on us he said wilkinson a 
veteran of antarctic expeditions said the greenpeace vessel later 
chased several japanese catcher ships whose crews were hunting for 
whales with explosive harpoons 
he estimated that japanese harpooners already have taken between 
50 and 55 minke whales this season about 10 of them since the 
gondwana caught up with the whaling fleet a week ago 
wilkinson said greenpeace would continue harassing the japanese 
whaling fleet for several more days the whales dont belong to 
the japanese he said they belong to all of us

four men have been convicted and jailed for 
stealing at least 53 million in cash gold silver gems and other 
valuables in britains biggest robbery police say about twothirds 
of the haul is missing 
valerio viccei the 34yearold italian who masterminded the 
robbery at a london safe deposit center was sentenced to 22 years 
in jail on monday after the twomonth jury trial at londons old 
bailey central criminal court 
detectives speaking on condition of anonymity said they thought 
viccei who had most of a month to dispose of the haul before he was 
arrested still controls much of it 
one scotland yard detective said he is set for a very 
comfortable retirement when he gets out of prison 
assisted by parvez latiff the 32yearold debtridden owner of 
the safe deposit center the gang broke into 120 deposit boxes on 
july 12 1987 and stole enough valuables to fill a bathtub at their 
hideout prosecutor roy amlot told the jury 
viccei and an accomplice had posed as customers at the safe 
deposit center across from harrods department store in the expensive 
knightsbridge area 
once inside they pulled guns on security guards and on latiff 
who concealed his involvement the gang members then spent two hours 
breaking open boxes taking goods such as a 40carat diamond since 
recovered belonging to the wife of west german industrialist gerd 
rudolph flick 
one robber cried bingo when he opened a box containing 
265000 worth of cocaine the court heard 
but viccei cut his finger on one box took off his glove and 
left a fingerprint which allowed police to arrest him a week before 
he planned to flee to south america 
viccei estimated the haul was worth 70 million and detectives 
said it was worth at least 53 million 
latiff who had been promised onethird of the haul was 
sentenced to 18 years in prison for robbery and five years 
concurrently for possessing a gun 
one accomplice david poole was given 16 years with a fiveyear 
concurrent sentence another peter odonohue was sentenced today 
to 11 years in jail some you win some you lose odonohue said 
as he was led from the court 
viccei also received a concurrent 12year term for a firearms 
offense 
police said about 17 million worth of the haul has been 
recovered they said about 12 million worth of this will be 
returned to owners but that about 5 million worth remains unclaimed 
police think many of the mainly foreign owners may not have 
claimed items of stolen property because they want to conceal the 
full extent of their wealth for political tax or other reasons 
once any appeals or subsequent trials have been dealt with the 
unclaimed goods will be auctioned off for charity police said 
insurance companies have contacted detectives to authenticate 
claims and losers cannot claim for more than they admitted to 
police one detective said we think a lot of people have lost 
property they never told anyone about 
britains previous biggest robbery was the theft of gold 
platinum diamonds and travelers checks worth a total of 46 million 
from a brinks mat warehouse near londons heathrow airport on nov 
26 1983 
the guinness book of records says the worlds greatest robbery 
was the theft of the equivalent of 44 billion in present day 
values from the reichsbank following the collapse of nazi germany in 
1945

another senior military officer told 
communist party leaders today yugoslavias economic and political 
crisis is threatening to break apart the nation and that the army 
might intervene 
vice adm stane brovet told the session of the policymaking 
central committee that in some parts of yugoslavia the situation 
is escaping control and the countrys territorial integrity 
and constitutional order are being jeopardized 
protesters in a wave of mass demonstrations in past months have 
demanded sweeping changes in party leadership 
forces that wish the destruction of yugoslavia through 
noninstitutional illegal methods are appearing on the scene 
brovet said 
yugoslavia can survive only as a true federation and the 
forces which are working toward the breakup of such a yugoslavia 
should be prevented primarily by political but also by all other 
means he said without elaborating 
his comments followed a similar warning monday 
what some describe as the battle for yugoslavia will not be 
waged without the yugoslav army declared adm petar simic a 
member of the ruling politburo and the militarys chief political 
officer 
simic called for party unity at the plenary session of the 
central committee 
liberal and hardliner committee members have been clashing over 
how to cope with 250 percent inflation a sharp drop in living 
standards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest 
the army generally has remained on the sidelines in the struggle 
to end the countrys woes that pits advocates of greater democracy 
against supporters of a more centralized communist system 
but senior officers are now showing signs of increasing unease 
and simic indicated the military with an estimated combined 
strength of about 200000 might take a more active role in 
putting a stop to confrontations between the republics 
the crisis in yugoslavia is rapidly approaching its 
culmination simic said adding that the party is losing battle 
after battle as the political system is breaking apart the 
army is stable and prepared to fulfill its role and purpose he 
said 
the central committee session was convened to discuss calls for 
the resignation of the communist party leader stipe suvar a 
liberalminded croat who favors greater decentralization of the 
economy 
it was expected to be the scene of a showdown between liberals 
and the hardline coalition led by slobodan milosevic the ambitious 
party chief of serbia the largest of yugoslavias six loosely 
federated republics 
suvar told committee members monday that yugoslavia must now 
choose between more democracy and neostalinism 
he also lashed out at milosevic his chief political rival not 
mentioning the serbian party boss by name but attacking the politics 
of centralized control favored by milosevic 
milosevic on monday called for sweeping personnel changes in the 
countrys leadership which he blamed for the current crisis 
it would be honest and intelligent that those who have clashed 
with the people should allow themselves to be replaced by better and 
more capable men he said 
milosevic who has called for more centralized party control over 
the countrys affairs draws his support from yugoslavias poorer 
southern regions in those areas people fear that marketoriented 
economic reforms could lead to massive layoffs if they cause 
unprofitable enterprises to forfeit state subsidies 
suvar is supported by yugoslavias most liberal and westernized 
republic slovenia and his native croatia which favor more 
democracy and radical marketoriented reforms as a solution to the 
countrys protracted crisis 
milan kucan slovenias party chief warned monday that 
yugoslavia is practically falling apart 
the country of 23 million people its living standard in steep 
decline since 1980 experienced thousands of strikes last year and 
unemployment reached 15 percent 
since the death in 1980 of josip broz tito the strongwilled 
founder of communist yugoslavia an eightman rotating presidency 
has headed the country under the guidance of the communist party 
the system balances the countrys competing ethnic groups

joel steinberg was convicted of beating to death 
his illegally adopted daughter but jurors rejected a murder charge 
because his livein companion could have saved lisas life 
during nearly 12 hours she lay comatose on a bathroom floor 
eight days of heated deliberations ended monday when the jury 
reached the manslaughter verdict in the case that focused national 
attention on domestic violence and the question of who should report 
cases of suspected child abuse 
by acquitting steinberg of seconddegree murder the jurors 
decided that the disbarred lawyer had not shown depraved 
indifference to human life when he struck 6yearold lisa in a 
rage in november 1987 
its a sad day for the kids who are being abused in this 
country said dr vincent fontana chairman of the mayors task 
force on child abuse who believed steinberg was guilty of murder 
the child protective system failed lisa the school system 
failed her and now the judicial system has failed her 
district attorney robert morgenthau promised to seek the maximum 
8 13to25year prison sentence for the firstdegree manslaughter 
conviction which required the jury to find that he intended to 
cause lisa serious harm steinberg 47 faces sentencing march 8 
steinberg has shown himself to fully deserve that sentence 
morgenthau said adding the case highlighted the dreadful 
problems that beset our city child abuse drug abuse and family 
violence all of us have a responsibility to work to ensure that 
similar tragedies do not reoccur 
steinberg was stoic as the verdict was announced ending a 
threemonth trial in a case that spun a web of drugs and domestic 
violence from behind the facade of a quiet greenwich village 
building 
he did not say anything said steinbergs attorney ira 
london he did not do anything 
we do not consider this verdict a win for joel or a triumph 
for joel said london 
london said an appeal is planned based in part on the showing of 
a graphic videotape of injuries suffered by steinbergs former 
companion hedda nussbaum he has called the tape prejudiced and 
inflammatory 
michele launders lisas 27yearold biological mother fled the 
courtroom in tears and would not speak to reporters after the 
verdict 
just before the announcement she said the only verdict that 
would be justice for lisa is murder 
she had been sitting next to graceann smigiel the grandmother of 
a then16monthold boy who was found in steinbergs apartment 
tethered to a crib and drinking spoiled milk when police and 
paramedics removed lisas comastose body on the morning of nov 2 
1987 
steinberg and ms nussbaum were charged with lisas death but ms 
nussbaum testified under immunity as the star prosecution witness 
publicity about the case reached a peak during ms nussbaums 
emotionally wrenching testimony in december when local television 
stations gave gaveltogavel coverage and cable news network 
broadcast extensive chunks of her testimony nationwide 
during seven days of testimony she said she was so dominated by 
steinberg that she was unable to defend herself from virtually 
systematic beatings or to protect lisa 
she said that steinberg told her in bed on the night of nov 1 
1987 after they had freebased cocaine and while lisa lay comatose 
on their bathroom floor that he had knocked lisa down and she 
didnt want to get up 
she said she was unable to bring herself to summon help promptly 
the girl lay there nearly 12 hours before ms nussbaum called an 
ambulance she died of brain damage in a hospital three days later 
juror helena barthell said the panel virtually ignored the 
testimony which was sharply challenged by defense lawyers who 
stressed ms nussbaums responsibility in lisas death 
hedda nussbaum could have saved lisas life if she had made 
that call for medical assistance mrs barthell said 
she also said the manslaughter charge was a compromise with some 
jurors arguing for the murder charge and some leaning toward lesser 
charges 
a murder conviction she conceded certainly would have 
sent a stronger message 
deliberations had been so heated that jurors nearly came to blows 
four times said foreman jeremiah cole who asked the court for a 
few minutes to kiss and make up before the verdict was announced 
ms nussbaums lawyer barry scheck said his client is 
relieved its all over 
he said she watched the verdict on television at the psychiatric 
hospital where she has lived since march 
the possibility of a hung jury was a very frightening prospect 
for her she would have to go through this all again he said 
defense lawyers claimed it was ms nussbaum who fatally beat lisa 
out of jealousy over the attention steinberg paid the child 
prosecutors pointing to ms nussbaums own severe injuries and 
deteriorated mental state said she was incapable of such an act 
nonetheless state judge harold rothwax instructed the jury to 
consider ms nussbaum an accomplice as such her testimony had to 
be supported by other evidence to secure a murder conviction 
one question was how ms nussbaum a former childrens book 
editor for random house could allow herself much less the child 
to sustain such damage 
another was how bruises on lisa could have been noticed by a 
student teacher at her elementary school and by neighbors but 
failed to come to the attention of child welfare officials yet 
another issue was the ease with which steinberg illegally gained 
custody of lisa and the other child mitchell from their unwed 
teenage mothers the boy has been reunited with his biological 
mother 
at the center of the case were the unknown motivations of 
steinberg who was disbarred last fall for having falsely claimed a 
military exemption from the bar exam he did not testify at the 
trial 
steinbergs lack of concern for the girl exhibited more than 
depraved indifference to human life assistant district attorney 
peter casolaro said at the trial it was monumental indifference 
to human life

city conservatives shunned ultrarightists who made 
a surprisingly strong showing in west berlin elections and instead 
opened talks today on forming a mainstream coalition with leftists 
the ultrarightist republicans campaigning on a platform of 
ridding berlin of foreigners captured 75 percent of the vote and 
11 seats in the west berlin legislature it was the first time they 
gained a place in that body since their party was formed in 1983 
however the conservative christian democrats who suffered heavy 
losses in sundays vote ruled out a coalition with republicans 
the republicans national chairman is franz schoenhuber a 
66yearold former nazi waffen ss soldier under west germanys 
complicated election laws the party will also gain two seats in the 
national parliament after the december 1990 federal elections 
national party leaders instructed west berlins christian 
democratic mayor eberhard diepgen to begin todays coalition talks 
with his leftist social democratic rival walter momper 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats lost a natural ally 
when the centrist free democrats failed to gain any seats in the 
legislature the two parties had governed west berlin in a coalition 
that also controls the federal government 
sundays voting gave the christian democrats and social democrats 
55 seats each in the 138seat house while the farleft alternative 
list came away with 17 seats 
momper said he would not govern with the alternatives as long as 
they insist on cutting back the number of allied troops stationed in 
west berlin 
the outcome was overshadowed by the success of the republicans 
who say they have 1000 cardcarrying members in west berlin and 
more than 7000 nationwide 
kohl told a news conference in bonn on monday the outcome was 
worrisome because of the republicans appeal among west germans who 
are increasingly worried by a wave of foreigners competing for jobs 
housing and social services 
there is an urgent need to discuss these problems and come up 
with better solutions kohl said 
mayor diepgen calling the elections a bitter loss said the 
obvious surge in ultraright support poses a serious challenge for 
the leading political parties in the city and country

archbishop desmond tutu who won the 1984 nobel 
peace prize for his struggle against apartheid in south africa has 
called on a fellow nobel laureate to join him in mediating the 
israelipalestinian conflict 
tutu made the offer to 1986 nobel peace prize recipient elie 
wiesel as he accepted an award monday night from the stephen wise 
free synagogue in manhattan 
the idea i must say did not come to me cerebrally but in a 
vision because of its symbolic significance as two men who have 
been honored with the nobel peace prize tutu said at the award 
ceremony 
he said he had not consulted with wiesel the author and 
holocaust survivor before making his proposal wiesel was not in 
the audience 
tutu said he supported israels right to territorial integrity 
and condemned terrorism but israel is not infallible 
mercifully 
tutu was honored by the synagogue for his leadership in the 
struggle against apartheid and for the entire spectrum of civil and 
human rights for all peoples

national museum of the american indian on the washington mall as

transferred to the smithsonian pending approval by the new york

islamabad pakistan four longrange soviet missiles slammed 
into villages today near the main soviet withdrawal route and killed 
70 people moslem guerrillas said 
western diplomats said an upsurge in soviet and government 
attacks during the past week appeared to be aimed at pressuring the 
guerrillas to reach a political settlement with the sovietbacked 
government in kabul 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the red 
army is expected to be out of the kabul area by feb 6 
moscow pledged in a unbrokered accord last year to remove all 
of its more than 100000 combat troops from afghanistan by feb 15 
although the final phase of the pullout is in full swing in 
kabul the diplomats did not predict when the soviets would leave 
other parts of the country notably shindand air base in western 
farah province 
jamiatiislami one of the major afghan guerrilla factions said 
it received news of todays missile attack in a radio report from 
its commander ahmad shah masood 
the guerrillas said the ss1 scud missiles hit in the khinja 
section of the panjshir valley about 30 miles northeast of the 
salang highway 
there was no independent confirmation of the missile attacks 
official afghan media have accused masood of attacking convoys 
carrying food to the capital however the jamiat faction said the 
convoys also were loaded with arms and ammunition for the kabul 
regime 
combined soviet and afghan government forces have leveled 
villages and killed hundreds of people since jan 23 in coordinated 
highaltitude bombing attacks artillery barrages missile launches 
and ground assaults according to western and guerrilla sources 
most of the attacks were targeted along the salang highway the 
red armys main pullout route between kabul and the soviet border 
they said but they said villages up to 30 miles away from the road 
also suffered 
also today the 11 remaining members of the us embassy staff in 
kabul left the country a day after closing their mission because of 
concerns about fighting in kabul after the red army leaves the 
embassy staff flew out of the afghan capital aboard a chartered 
plane to new delhi india and they are expected to go to washington 
later this week 
although the embassy was closed monday the americans could not 
immediately depart because kabul airport was shut by a threeinch 
snowfall 
in washington on monday the state department accused the soviet 
union of pursuing what it called a scorched earth policy as its 
troops withdraw 
by contrast state department spokesman charles e redman said 
usarmed afghan insurgents were showing restraint toward the 
departing red army 
the soviets continue what might even be called a scorched earth 
policy as they continue very very intensive air activity redman 
said we just dont believe that this kind of a policy is what is 
called for at the time when afghanistan ought to be looking to the 
future 
one western diplomat in islamabad said the soviet bombing and 
missile attacks cannot be explained by a putative soviet desire to 
protect its retreating troops 
he said the guerrillas have not been attacking the withdrawing 
soviet troops on the salang or elsewhere 
the situation for survivors of these attacks is bleak said 
another diplomat survivors have been left homeless in the midst 
of one of the worst winters in recent memory in most cases without 
provisions 
the communists seized power in kabul in a 1978 coup touching off 
a civil war with moslem insurgents soviet forces intervened in 
december 1979 to replace one promoscow government with another 
then remained to fight the guerrillas

consumer groups are supporting a european ban 
of hormonetreated beef from the united states and say consumers 
here also should demand the right to buy meat certified as 
chemicalfree 
the consumer federation of america and other consumer advocates 
are also urging president bush to reverse the administrations 
refusal to let texas and other states export hormonefree beef while 
europe and the united states spar over the safety of growth hormones 
the consumer advocates want bush to negotiate a 90day 
coolingoff period with the european economic community to keep the 
dispute from escalating into a trade war 
if the european community and the united states proceed in the 
direction that theyre going we very well could have a real trade 
war in which consumers on both sides of the atlantic are really 
going to be the ones who get hurt rod leonard executive director 
of the community nutrition institute said monday 
the eec has said it will slap tough tariffs on american walnuts 
and dried fruit if no progress is made by feb 20 to end the dispute 
over hormones used by domestic producers to fatten cattle more 
quickly 
the eec on jan 1 banned imports of beef treated with hormones 
contending they are a health threat the united states disputes 
those claims and retaliated against the loss of about 100 million 
in annual beef sales by setting 100 million in higher tariffs on a 
variety of common market goods 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower has been working 
with the eec to certify hormonefree beef from texas and find buyers 
for the lone star exports 
but the us trade representatives office last week said such a 
deal would not be allowed because the us department of agriculture 
has no way to certify beef is hormonefree 
leonard said he believes usda can do a certification procedure 
if it wants to and questioned the administrations decision to bar 
such exports as farmers inching toward recovery after their worst 
recession in decades have an opportunity to find new markets 
leonard said a 90day cooling off period would give bush time to 
develop a hormonefree beef certification procedure 
the consumer federation of american said the eecs ban is an 
issue of consumer protection and not trade protection 
serious questions have been raised about the necessity and 
safety of hormone additives in meat through the ban consumers in 
europe have expressed their preference for hormonefree beef they 
have opted to be safe rather than sorry and we believe that 
preference must be respected said sandra eskin of the cfa which 
represents more than 240 state local and national organizations 
she said us consumers should push their preference for 
hormonefree beef and urge the usda to develop a procedure that 
certifies beef has not been treated with hormones and other drugs or 
chemicals 
rich parker a spokesman for the american meat institute said 
prices would increase if producers stopped using growth hormones 
the ami contends the hormone issue is a trade barrier that has 
nothing to do with safety parker said europe wants to be a 
net exporter not a net importer

authorities have broken an international 
ring of sicilian mafia and rightwing terrorists who trafficked in 
drugs and weapons newspapers reported today 
arrest warrants for 72 suspects wanted for criminal association 
arms and drug trafficking have been issued in italy and abroad 
including the united states and switzerland the reports said 
quoting authorities at a monday news conference names of suspects 
living outside italy were not immediately disclosed 
authorities said they arrested at least 48 people monday for 
involvement in the ring whose plots included plans to sell french 
warplanes to the west african nation of guineabissau 
the investigation extends to chile argentina brazil and peru 
canada and nigeria the turin daily la stampa said 
warrants were issued by judge alba dova of the tuscan coastal 
city of massa carrara where the investigation was coordinated for 
more than a year 
dova said the link between the mafia and rightwing extremists 
leads one to think of the existence of an international extremist 
rightwing political organization that finances itself through 
illegal financial operations and ties with organized crime 
much of the illegal trafficking was arranged through two italian 
importexport firms called eurogross and fininvest 2000 authorities 
said 
the rings activities included deals in stolen art cars and 
foreign currency with some money recycled through coded swiss bank 
accounts they said 
a key figure named in the warrants is marco affatigato a reputed 
leader of new order an extreme rightist group accused of a string 
of terrorist attacks in italy in the 1970s and early 1980s 
affatigato is believed to be in france 
among mafia suspects rounded up in raids were members of the 
corleone family considered sicilys most powerful mafia clan and 
of the minore family from trapani a sicilian port linked to 
clandestine drug and arms shipments the man considered the corleone 
familys cashier michele cillari was among more noted figures 
arrested on monday 
the judge said the investigation stemmed from the 1987 discovery 
of arms and drugs aboard a lebanese ship off italys adriatic coast 
the ship set out from beirut and was loaded with heroin hashish an 
antitank bazooka a soviet grenadelauncher and other arms 
initially it was linked to alleged arms smuggling between italy 
and the middle east including clandestine delivery of mines to 
iran several italian industrialists and arms manufacturers were 
arrested but later released and charges dropped 
on monday official said documents seized in connection with the 
ship led them to the ring evidence included false certificates of a 
dummy bank called the canadian credit bank of detroit 
the gang allegedly plotted to deliver french mirage jetfighters 
to guineabissau acting as middlemen in return for kickbacks 
authorities said 
the scheme allegedly involved an italian representative of the 
african country and an official of the french aircraft company 
dassaultbreguet it was not known if the planes were delivered

the governor ordered national guard troops 
to help with patient care today at a state hospital where unionized 
employees have staged a sickout since saturday most of the workers 
later showed up 
general hospital spokesman dan caley said hospital officials 
requested the troops from gov edward d diprete and the 
approximately 60 uniformed guard members were assigned to work 
throughout the hospital 
theyre not here for security at all caley said 
about 80 employees eventually showed up at the state general 
hospital this morning out of 106 scheduled to work caley said 
things seemed to have cooled off a little said fran 
segerson a spokeswoman for the governor with 80 percent of the 
employees working it seems like some of the employees are getting 
tired of this 
talks continued between the hospital and union leaders to end the 
sickout by attendants and licensed practical nurses but caley had 
no details of the talks the union which has refused to comment 
reportedly is angry over proposed schedule changes designed to 
reduce the hospitals burgeoning overtime bills 
segerson said the governor called out the guard after a meeting 
monday night between thomas d romeo director of the state 
department of mental health retardation and hospitals and 
officials from local 1350 of the american federation of state 
county and municipal workers failed to produce a settlement 
i think that last night they hoped to get the problem resolved 
but when it looked like they couldnt do that he wanted to ensure 
that patient services were not affected segerson said

a court today acquitted a man who spent 30 years on 
death row for the kidnap and murder of a 6yearold girl 
it was japans fourth case in six years in which a death row 
inmate was acquitted of murder in a retrial in all four cases 
judges said confessions which defendants made during interrogation 
but later recanted lacked credibility 
after todays verdict the court freed masao akabori 59 who had 
been sentenced to death by a district court in 1958 the sentence 
was upheld by the supreme court in 1960 but a retrial began in 1987 
in the shizuoka district court after four appeals by akabori 
i am glad i won the appeal because i am innocent and i am so 
thankful to my lawyers and all the people who have supported me and 
encouraged me through the past 35 years akabori said in a 
statement 
his lawyers said he managed to avoid hanging because of an active 
support group such a long stretch on death row is rare but not 
unprecedented in japan 
akabori was arrested two months after 6yearold hisako sano was 
kidnapped and strangled march 10 1954 near her home in shimada 
about 125 miles west of tokyo 
under police questioning he confessed to the crime but he later 
withdrew the confession and pleaded innocent

lacked credibility and there was no other credible evidence linking 
him to the crime 
akaboris lawyers said he is entitled to 930200 in government 
compensation for his wrongful time behind bars

working families with children and incomes of up to 18576 may 
qualify for a portion of the earnedincome tax credit if they 
qualify their tax bills could be wiped out completely and they 
could get a check even if they owe no tax 
the center on budget and policy priorities a nonprofit 
washingtonbased organization that keeps an eye on federal actions 
affecting low and middleincome americans is coordinating a drive 
to educate potential recipients of the credit the campaign is being 
underwritten by organized labor the us catholic conference the 
conference of mayors and other groups as diverse as planned 
parenthood and vietnam veterans of america 
we are concerned that millions of lowincome working families 
with children may miss out on a valuable benefit they have earned 
robert greenstein director of the center told reporters 
the 1986 tax overhaul expanded the credit making it available to 
more families at the same time the new law eliminated as many as 6 
million poorer people from the tax rolls altogether meaning they 
dont even have to file a federal tax return 
however they must file a return in order to receive the 
earnedincome credit greenstein and his coalition are distributing 
fliers radio commercials and other educational material that spells 
out the credit and how to obtain it 
we think it is almost a crime if the people who are entitled to 
these benefits dont obtain them said kenneth young executive 
assistant to the president of the aflcio 
sharon daly director of social policy for the catholic 
conference said the nations 189 dioceses will be asked to place 
inserts in church bulletins and lead community discussions to ensure 
that poor families are informed of the credit 
as many as 11 million families are eligible for the credit which 
was enacted in 1975 to provide a bonus that was aimed at keeping 
them off the welfare rolls the benefit was designed essentially to 
offset a significant part of the social security taxes paid by the 
poorest workers 
the credit begins declining after family earnings exceed 9840 
it disappears once income hits 18576 
the credit cancels out up to 874 of a familys tax bill if the 
family owes no tax the credit is refundable that is it can 
exceed tax liability thus if a family owes no tax the government 
will mail a check for up to 874 
greenstein pointed out that workers who qualify for the credit 
may be able to get it in advance in their paychecks through the 
year too those who qualified for the credit in the past but did 
not file for it may be able to collect retroactive payments for the 
past three years

a conservative activist told the senate armed 
services committee today that he encountered defense 
secretarydesignate john tower in an inebriated condition on several 
occasions accompanied by women other than his wife 
the witness paul weyrich chairman of the free congress 
foundation has opposed towers nomination on grounds he is soft on 
star wars today weyrich questioned whether tower had the moral 
character to oversee the pentagon reforms that president bush has 
promised he would initiate 
i have made enough personal observations of this man here in 
washington to have serious reservations about his moral character 
weyrich said 
weyrich claimed that bushs transition team received hundreds of 
letters criticizing tower some containing specific allegations of 
moral impropriety against the nominee but did not bring the 
letters to the presidents attention 
weyrich said he never saw the letters but i have encountered 
the senator in a condition lacking sobriety as well as with women he 
was not married to 
the encounters occurred frequently enough to make an 
impression i did encounter this on a number of occasions he said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the panel immediately 
suggested that discussions of any information weyrich had on the 
nominees personal life be taken up in a closed session scheduled 
this afternoon tower was to testify in that session 
tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before 
his nomination was announced by bush in divorce papers filed by his 
second wife lila burt cummings tower was accused of marital 
misconduct 
bush has defended tower saying an fbi background check found 
nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary 
tower a 63yearold texas republican served 24 years in the 
senate including a brief tenure as chairman of the armed services 
committee from 198184 
he considers sdi strategic defense initiative a bargaining 
chip we dont weyrich has said previously hes not in favor 
of military reform we think military reform is necessary 
particularly in this year of budget crunch 
tower told the committee last week he does not believe that we 
can devise an umbrella that can protect the entire american 
population from nuclear incineration i think thats unrealistic 
tower said a more limited system might work but cautioned that 
it remains to be seen whether that is a realistic objective 
in his two days of testimony tower also pledged to remain 
objective in pentagon decisionmaking despite receiving more than 1 
million in consulting fees from defense contractors 
but jackson a senior fellow and associate professor at the 
fulbright institute of international relations at the university of 
arkansas questioned towers pledge 
mr tower is the wrong man for this job at this time jackson 
said in a telephone interview monday i plan to focus on how he 
symbolizes the revolving door syndrome in the defense culture as he 
called it 
jackson onetime foreign policy adviser to former secretary of 
state edmund muskie said tower showed little interest in defense 
reform when the texas senator served as chairman of the armed 
services panel 
hes a bad choice when we need someone whose track record is 
sound jackson said 
phillips president of the national council for industrial 
defense said monday he is unsure whether tower will implement the 
reform recommendations of the packard commission the presidential 
panel that called for strengthening the authority of the chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff 
im not sure he knows whats involved what kind of buzzsaw 
hell run into said phillips 
phillips who heads a nonprofit nonpartisan organization that 
includes small defense subcontractors also criticized towers 
record on foreign sourcing for contracts 
i dont know what his position is phillips said when he 
was on the committee he didnt do anything to help our industries 
then when he left he worked for british aerospace as a consultant 
a lot of our people have gone out of business

in an attempt to end nicaraguas 
economic crisis president daniel ortega has announced plans to cut 
the budget by nearly half lay off 35000 troops and public 
employees and end subsidies for basic goods 
he said in announcing the austerity plan on monday that city 
dwellers would be hardest hit and suggested many move back to the 
farm 
speaking to the national assembly ortega called for the 
cooperation of private business and told landholders the leftist 
sandinista government would no longer confiscate private property 
however opposition leaders said they are puzzled by the plan and 
wont support it 
daniels speech is rather nebulous said ramiro gurdian vice 
president of the opposition nicaraguan democratic coordinate and 
president of a farm owners organization he said there was no 
agreeement with private businessmen to back the plan 
opposition leader enrique bolanos said he understood the speech 
to mean the government wants to control everything including 
producers profits while producers take all the risks 
it doesnt make much sense he said 
in ending the twohour 40minute address ortega told his fellow 
35 million nicaraguans that sacrifice is needed to bring the 
economy out of crisis and curb inflation which reached 20000 
percent last year 
i appeal to the sensibility and honesty of all nicaraguans so 
this proposal doesnt turn into a political confrontation ortega 
said otherwise well be paying with the blood and the future of 
our people 
he said the federal budget this year would be cut by 44 percent 
461 billion cordobas or about 100 million to 200 million 
the president said the government would impose a war economy 
policy if inflation is not brought under control he did not 
elaborate 
ortega said the government will reduce subsidies for basic goods 
but did not provide details 
he did not say during the speech how many workers the government 
plans to lay off but in a telephone interview with the newspaper el 
nacional in caracas venezuela he put the figure at 35000 
including 23000 from the army and interior ministry and 12000 from 
other public institutions the sandinista army had 74000 troops 
last year including reservists and militia 
laidoff workers will receive temporary compensation and be 
offered agricultural employment he said noting that about 10000 
workers are needed for the coffee harvest 
he suggested in addition that laborers who live in cities 
consider moving to rural areas to find employment 
thousands of nicaraguans migrated to managua the capital and 
other cities to flee the fighting during the 7year war with the 
usbacked contra rebels in which a preliminary ceasefire was 
reached last march 
thousands more flooded into cities after hurricane joan ravaged 
the country in october the storm killed more than 100 people left 
at least 200000 people homeless and caused more than 800 million 
in economic damage according too the government 
ortega has described storm damages to crops as immeasurable and 
annual soviet bloc assistance of 500 million has failed to right 
the battered economy nicaragua once exported rice and beans but 
now imports those staples shortages have pushed food prices skyward 
ortega said the budget cuts will require deep slashes in capital 
investment and government credits to agriculture and business 
staterun banks he said will provide new loans only to those 
who can pay but he said the government would continue 
stimulating private producers regardless of their political 
positions 
in another gesture to the private sector ortega declared that 
government confiscations of private property were a thing of the 
past 
about 85 percent of farmland in nicaragua is in private hands 
and just 15 percent is owned by the state he said 
ortega also announced that the official and parallel rates of 
currency exchange will be merged to eliminate black market demand 
for dollars he did not say what the rate would be 
the official rate 2300 cordobas per dollar is used to 
calculate payment for exports and the parallel rate at 4400 
cordobas is used for those selling dollars 
the dollar now fetches about 5500 cordobas on the black market 
the president blamed nicaraguas runaway inflation on spending 
associated with the contra war which by government count claimed 
26500 lives a united states trade embargo imposed against 
nicaragua in 1985 also reduced government revenues he said

the us attorney for massachusetts resigned 
following months of allegations that he politicized his office and 
lied about seeing his predecessor smoke marijuana 
the work of this office is far too important to be sidetracked 
by any controversy frank l mcnamara jr said in announcing his 
resignation monday 
in his brief statement mcnamara did not mention a continuing 
justice department investigation into his conduct that staff members 
said had hindered the offices activities 
he said he intended to return to private practice 
jeremiah osullivan head of the new england organized crime 
strike force was named the interim head of the office and was sworn 
in this morning before us judge edward f harrington in boston 
mcnamara a 41yearold republican has been the target of a 
justice department investigation since november when investigators 
found no evidence to support allegations that he saw william f weld 
smoke marijuana during the probe mcnamara admitted to smoking 
marijuana himself 
on friday 28 of the 39 assistant us attorneys working for 
mcnamara wrote to us attorney general dick thornburgh urging him 
to expedite mcnamaras departure 
mr mcnamaras conduct and performance while united states 
attorney is resulting in a loss of confidence in the adminstration 
of justice the letter said the credibility and operations of 
this office will continue to be damaged unless he is removed 
prosecutors who had been critical of mcnamara privately expressed 
relief over his decision to leave 
president reagan nominated mcnamara to replace weld in april 
1987 when weld ascended to head the justice departments criminal 
division but mcnamaras confirmation was held up while the fbi 
investigated his failure to pay income tax for several years and 
irregularities in his congressional campaign finances after his 
unsuccessful 1982 race against thenhouse speaker thomas p tip 
oneill jr 
during the confirmation process mcnamara said he believed weld 
was trying to scuttle his nomination and told investigators that he 
had seen weld drunk on a couple of occasions he also alleged he had 
seen weld smoke marijuana at a 1982 wedding party 
a justice department investigation failed to support mcnamaras 
charges and mcnamara admitted that he had smoked marijuana at a 
later date 
last weekend mcnamara denied urging a federal investigation into 
marijuanasmoking charges against democratic us rep joseph 
kennedy ii and robert farmer the top fundraiser for gov michael 
dukakiss presidential campaign 
mcnamara said the allegation stemmed from an unsubstantiated fbi 
report that was leaked to reporters 
in november several assistant prosecutors said mcnamara pursued 
an investigation of a prison land deal by the dukakis administration 
in an attempt to discredit dukakis then the democratic nominee for 
president 
shortly after mcnamaras announcement monday dukakis commended 
him for resigning saying it was long overdue

the strongest high pressure system in north american history 
tightened its frigid grip on alaska and that arctic air hit montana 
today after high wind blew railroad cars off their tracks and 
knocked down a grain elevator 
balmy weather that set records for warmth in many cities ended 
abruptly today in montana where great falls dropped to 10 degrees 
below zero this morning after a record high of 62 on monday the 
national weather service said the temperature at great falls 
dropped 48 degrees within three hours after the cold front of arctic 
air passed over the city 
nearly two dozen rural north dakota schools closed today when 
strong northerly wind reduced visibility to near zero with blowing 
snow and dropped wind chill factors to 45 degrees below zero 
authorities advised no travel in the northeastern part of the state 
it was 51 degrees below zero monday morning in fairbanks alaska 
where the temperature has risen above minus 40 only once during the 
past three weeks there were unofficial readings of 75 below in some 
parts of alaska the weather service said 
the severe cold in alaska closed schools brought state 
government to a virtual standstill and was tentatively blamed for 
the crash of a canadian military transport plane outside fairbanks 
high wind that produced extreme wind chill factors also disrupted 
the flow of oil through the alaska pipeline by preventing ships from 
entering valdez harbor to load up 
the cold air is being caused by a dome of extremely high 
atmospheric pressure over alaska the barometer at northway alaska 
rose to a record high of 3174 inches of mercury the weather 
service reported today 
just the day before big delta alaska reached a high of 3154 
inches breaking the previous record for north america of 3153 
inches recorded in the yukon territory of canada in 1974 
although temperatures in much of alaska have risen slightly since 
the weekend the moderation has been accompanied by rising winds 
that have disrupted ship traffic and created dangerously low 
windchill readings 
the arriving cold front produced snow today over montana and 
north dakota and wind chill factors were between 30 and 40 below 
zero over north dakota 
before the front arrived weather service forecasters in great 
falls said it would be the coldest arctic system in five years 
to hit the state 
this is a very dangerous storm and should not be taken 
lightly the weather service said in a special statement issued 
monday 
meanwhile wind up to 124 mph hammered montana on monday blowing 
at least 10 railroad freight cars off their tracks near browning 
toppling a grain elevator near cut bank and fueling an unusual 
midwinter range fire authorities said no injuries were reported 
the wind was caused by the flow of air between a high pressure 
system over utah and lower pressure along the arctic cold front the 
weather service said 
it coincided with a period of record high temperatures in montana 
and across much of the country 
high temperature records fell in places as far apart as great 
falls mont where it was 62 burlington vt where it was 45 and 
minneapolisst paul where it was 48 miami tied its record for the 
date of 82 
although alaska is exporting its cold weather no significant 
warming is expected there for at least five days the weather 
service said 
there was however some good news for alaskans on monday when 
the coast guard reopened the valdez narrows between the port of 
valdez and prince william sound late monday after winds abated 
enough to allow safe tanker operations 
gusts approaching 100 mph had forced the closure of the port for 
a day prompting the alyeska pipeline service co to reduce flow in 
the transalaska oil pipeline by 65 percent 
alyeska spokesman tom brennan said the pipeline should be able to 
resume normal production of about 2 million barrels a day by late 
tuesday the state treasury had stood to lose 3 million a day in 
lost taxes and royalties if the closure had continued 
the temperature crept a few degrees above zero in southcentral 
alaska on monday 55 mph gusts blew windows out of a downtown 
anchorage office building schools were closed in several places 
around the state and the state court system shut down out of 
concern for the safety for jurors 
gov steve cowper ordered all nonessential state employees in 
fairbanks to stay home until there was a break in the weather 
the cold continued to hamper exercises designed to show the 
militarys ability to function in harsh arctic conditions canada 
pulled its troops out of brim frost 89 after eight men were killed 
when a transport plane crashed while trying to land at fort 
wainwright near fairbanks

american teenagers came out at the bottom of 
the heap in a survey of math and science performance among students 
in five countries and four canadian provinces the educational 
testing service reported today 
the low math performance levels are a matter for grave 
concern while the science results are sobering and pose a 
serious challenge to our position in the world community 
according to the report called a world of differences 
the ets study is its first international assessment of 
educational progress a counterpart to the groups periodic national 
assessments in various academic fields it was financed by the 
national science foundation and the department of education 
findings were based on tests of approximately 24000 13yearolds 
in ireland korea spain the united kingdom the united states 
british columbia new brunswick ontario and quebec the last three 
were divided into french and englishspeaking samples 
in all countries and provinces the more time spent watching 
television the poorer student performance in both math and science 
the report found and in all but two more than 50 percent of the 
students reported spending an hour or less each day doing homework 
in all their subjects the exceptions were ireland and spain where 
two hours or more was the norm 
the survey revealed that almost all us 13yearolds have 
mastered math basics and know everyday science facts but ets notes 
that national assessments consistently reveal a weakness in 
higherorder thinking skills and this is borne out in the 
international assessment 
korean students demonstrated the highest overall mathematics 
achievement while those from the united states and ontario the 
french speakers showed the lowest 
for example the report said 78 percent of the korean 
13yearolds can use intermediate mathematics skills to solve 
twostep problems compared with only 40 percent in the united 
states and frenchspeaking ontario 
also in korea 40 percent of the students understand measurement 
and geometry concepts and can solve even more complex problems 
compared with under 10 percent in the united states and 
frenchspeaking ontario 
despite their poor performance the ets report said twothirds 
of us students said they considered themselves good at 
mathematics only 23 percent of korean students the highest 
achievers shared that attitude 
that only 40 percent of the us students can solve twostep 
problems is a matter for grave concern ets said percentages 
for more complicated tasks are even more modest and suggest that 
the pool of trained talent from which to draw our future scientists 
engineers and technicians is small indeed 
based on comparisons with more successful participants in the 
assessment ets suggests examining the impact of heavy television 
watching the small amount of math homework typically done and the 
importance attached to math by schools and society in general 
on the science front youths in korea and british columbia turned 
in the best performance the united states along with ireland and 
frenchspeaking ontario and new brunswick perform well below the 
mean the report said 
the united states has traditionally thought of itself as 
technologically innovative and in the forefront in science ets 
said these results are sobering and pose a serious challenge to 
our position in the world community 
more than 70 percent of the youngsters in korea and british 
columbia can use scientific procedures and analyze scientific data 
while only 35 percent to 40 percent of their peers in the bottom 
four samples showed the same degree of competence the report said 
the us results are clearly unacceptable it said 
gordon ambach executive director of the council of chief state 
school officers called the ets report striking and challenging 
particularly its finding that us students who did worst in 
math think theyre good at it 
before we feel good about our performance we had better test 
it against the competition ambach said in a statement the 
united states cannot be internationally competitive with our 
13yearolds at the bottom in mathematics and near the bottom in 
science achievement

the soviet government in keeping with a new policy 
to disclose crime statistics said tuesday that 111 murders were 
committed in the entire country in january including one policeman 
killed in the line of duty 
militia col yuri arshenevsky a spokesman for the interior 
ministry was quoted by tass as saying previously classified crime 
statistics henceforth will be available for everyone 
the first figures released as part of the new policy showed 93 of 
the 111 january murders had been solved and that most were 
committed at home due to drunkenness and jealousy the official 
news agency said 
in january 1988 new york city reported 152 cases of murder and 
nonnegligent manslaughter 
tass said 137 holdups were committed in january 1989 only 61 of 
which were solved the report added that drivers of unregistered 
taxis increasingly are being victimized 
one militia serviceman was killed this month when performing 
his official duty of maintaining public order and 12 were 
injured the report said it added the militia personnel the 
soviet unions uniformed police force used firearms 11 times during 
the month and that investigation showed each case was justifiable 
arshenevsky said the ministry will begin publishing a statistical 
bulletin and in due course possibly all people who wish will be 
able to subscribe to it 
soviet authorities used to provide no information about domestic 
crime and the statecontrolled media ignored the subject but under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of greater openness the 
subject often is discussed in the media some particularly 
noteworthy cases such as airplane hijackings and even the recent 
firebombing of a private cooperative restaurant in moscow are widely 
reported 
pravda published a report by the interior ministry in january 
that the crime rate in the soviet union had soared by 17 percent 
during 1988 the report however gave no figures for individual 
crimes

attorney general dick thornburgh flanked by 
the us attorneys from new york chicago and kansas city today 
announced formation of special task forces to target crime in the 
suites primarily securities and commodities fraud 
the securities and commodities fraud task forces including 15 
additional assistant us attorneys will be located in six cities 
new york chicago los angeles san francisco kansas city and 
denver 
us attorney rudolph giuliani in new york and us attorney 
anton valukas in chicago already have undertaken substantial 
investigations of the markets in those two cities 
we are undertaking to bring this additional firepower to bear 
on behalf of investors who might otherwise run the risk of being 
defrauded or lose confidence in the market thornburgh said 
he said the task forces were being formed to combat what can 
aptly be called crime in the suites fraud is being committed 
under the guise of respectability in the financial and securities 
markets he said 
in addition thornburgh said the treasury loses more than 90 
billion a year as a result of tax fraud and whitecollar crime has 
been a factor in many recent business failures including many of 
the bank and savings and loan closings

president bush said today he will insist on 
tighter controls and higher quality from military contractors in a 
drive to wring the last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the 
way we buy our weapons 
he said those steps are vital to building a national consensus in 
support of a strong defense 
bush on first trip out of washington as president made his 
remarks in a speech on the deck of the aircraft carrier america at 
the huge norfolk naval base to an audience of thousands of navy 
personnel and contractor employees 
standing coatless in temperatures in the 50s bush coughed 
frequently and spoke in a raspy voice evidence of a cold that has 
plagued him for nearly a week excuse the cough here he said 
after the speech bush had lunch on the ship with enlisted men 
he said he was feeling better but that his throat was bothering him 
so much he thought he might not be able to make it through his 
speech and had been just croaking away during it 
touching on cost overruns and the current criminal investigation 
into pentagon purchasing practices the president said 
even if overruns are not new they are still wrong and hurt 
the national security particularly when budgets are tight we want 
tighter controls and higher standards in weapons procurement 
bush who was a carrierbased navy pilot in world war ii said 
the first bulwark of our national defense is our national will if 
our will is ruptured our ship of state cannot sail or at least 
sail safely 
i firmly believe that the vital first step to broadening our 
national consensus on defense is to wring the last drop of waste and 
mismanagement out of the way we buy our weapons he said and 
thats what we intend to do 
the justice department is pursuing a 2yearold investigation of 
alleged purchasing fraud the case focuses on charges that private 
consultants hired by military contractors bribed defense 
department officials to obtain inside information that gave 
companies an edge in bidding for pentagon work 
the probe so far has led to guilty pleas by several individuals 
and one defensecontracting firm the indictment of another 
contractor 
some 5500 crew members stood at parade rest on the flight deck 
of the 1048footlong carrier as bush spoke several hundred 
civilian contractor employees and some members of congress also were 
were in the crowd 
taking note of the setting the president said you know as an 
old carrier pilot today is a very special day for me i cant help 
thinking of the carrier i once sailed on the uss san jacinto he 
said world war iivintage carriers were much smaller had narrow 
decks smaller planes no electronics 
the president used the occasion to emphasize his program to 
highlight public service praising members of the military for the 
sacrifices they make 
in the years ahead i want to make sure that those who build our 
ships planes and weapons live up to the standards of service 
dedication and duty that this crew and this shipyard set he said 
bush predicted that one day peace and freedom will triumph 
worldwide 
and on that day who were the heroes generations to come will 
ask who drove the chariots of fire across the sky who brought that 
day to the earth and the answer will be you 
the president pledged to be not only commanderinchief but a 
friend to the military and together we will work to spin the 
gossamer thread of human dreams into a sturdy fabric of peace that 
will last for generations to come he said

amnesty international today told the un human 
rights commission that israel has killed about 60 palestinians in 
the occupied territories by misusing tear gas 
a plo spokesman meanwhile told the 43nation commission that 
palestinian children were being killed in israeli gas chambers 
nabil ramlawi a palestine liberation organization representative 
said the israeli practices were reaching war crime proportions 
its all a great lie said avi pazner spokesman for prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of israel 
ramlawi charged that pregnant arab women were beaten causing 
them to miscarry and that organs were stolen from dead palestinians 
to be used in transplant operations in israeli hospitals 
a text of ramlawis speech was not available but an unofficial 
summary paraphrasing his speech said his comments on israeli gas 
chambers seemed to refer to the use of tear gas 
the 13month palestinian revolt in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip has claimed the lives of 370 palestinians and 15 
israelis the palestinians are protesting occupation by israel 
which seized the lands from neighboring arab states in the 1967 
middle east war 
amnestys statement said it was gravely concerned because israeli 
authorities appear so far to have condoned if not encouraged the 
excessive use of force knowing that it would result in the death or 
injury of thousands of people 
amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot and killed by 
israeli soldiers during the uprising and that thousands of other 
people were shot and injured many critically 
deaths in the occupied territories have also been caused by the 
apparently deliberate misuse of tear gas fired for example into 
hospitals and homes amnesty said this has happened despite 
explicit instructions from the manufacturer not to use tear gas in 
confined spaces as it is potentially lethal 
it said about 60 people were reported to have died in teargas 
related incidents some of them as a direct result of its misuse 
pazner denied all the allegations its all nonsense he 
said israel does all it can to cause the minimum damage to 
property and of course with respect to human life israel has 
certainly not shot into hospitals 
amnesty said only three israeli soldiers were reported to have 
been convicted following fatal shootings with the longest sentence 
being 18 months in jail for manslaughter amnesty said a few other 
soldiers drew lesser terms for punitive beatings 
no prosecutions in cases of apparently deliberate misuse of 
tear gas resulting in deaths are known to have been initiated it 
said

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
arrives wednesday to put the final touches on preparations for the 
first sinosoviet summit since the two communist giants split in 
bitter rivalry 30 years ago 
shevardnadzes visit comes after a year of rapid progress in 
bilateral relations expected to culminate this spring when mikhail 
s gorbachev becomes the first soviet leader to travel to china 
since 1959 
during his threeday stay shevardnadze is to hold two rounds of 
talks with his chinese counterpart qian qichen and will meet with 
premier li peng he is also to travel to shanghai for a meeting 
saturday with chinas top leader deng xiaoping 
shevardnadze is not scheduled to meet communist party head zhao 
ziyang eastern european sources said china apparently wants to 
wait for gorbachev before officially recognizing a restoration of 
relations between the two parties 
qian who in december became the first chinese foreign minister 
to hold talks in moscow in 32 years told australian foreign 
minister gareth evans on monday that the cambodian conflict would be 
high on the agenda 
soviet support for vietnams invasion of cambodia has been the 
last and hardest sticking point in sinosoviet discussions on 
normalizing political ties 
but china apparently satisfied that moscow wants vietnam to end 
its war against the chinesebacked resistance in cambodia accedes 
that conditions for a summit have been met 
the gorbachev visit which could come as early as the second half 
of march would be the first since nikita s khrushchev met his 
ideological foe mao tsetung in beijing in 1959 
khrushchev already feuding with mao over the leadership and 
direction of world communism at that meeting rescinded an offer to 
provide china a prototype atomic bomb the next year moscow 
withdrew more than 1000 technicians and ended all assistance for 
chinas industrial and military development 
relations reached a nadir in 1969 when troops along the border 
clashed and mao called on the nation to prepare for allout war 
political normalization talks started in 1982 but made little 
headway because of what china calls the three obstacles 
cambodia the soviet intervention in afghanistan and soviet military 
presence along the chinese border 
but 1988 proved particularly auspicious for sinosoviet 
relations the authoritative weekly beijing review said in its 
latest edition it cited gorbachevs decision to leave afghanistan 
and his announcement of major troop reductions in sovietally 
mongolia and along the sinosoviet border 
last august the two sides for the first time held direct talks on 
how to solve the cambodian conflict and in october they settled 
most of their disputes along the eastern sector of the 5000mile 
border 
qian returning from his historic visit to moscow in december 
said the most important result was that we started the 
normalization process 
but the chinese also emphasize there will be no regression to the 
relationship of the 1950s when the newly founded communist state in 
china depended on soviet economic aid and followed the soviet lead 
in international affairs 
normal relations with moscow the beijing review said in an 
indirect reference to the united states will not affect the 
development of friendly relations between china and other countries 
washington whose own normalization of relations with china was 
in part spurred by common concern over the soviet military threat 
has welcomed the sinosoviet rapprochement saying it will ease 
tensions

speaker jim wright today was conducting a rare 
hurryup survey of house members that leaves open the possibility of 
a public vote on the 50 percent congressional pay raise scheduled to 
take effect next week 
wright asked if he would schedule a vote should members demand 
one in the survey said if the members want it yes of course 
but house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said i dont 
think there will be a vote he predicted that in return for the 
raise becoming law on feb 8 the house will approve a day later a 
package of outsideincome and campaignfinance restrictions applying 
to members 
in the survey sent to house members late monday the speaker said 
he wanted to be faithful to the wishes of lawmakers and asked 
whether they demanded a vote before feb 8 
an associated press survey of the 100 senators meantime found 
that 88 plan to vote against the pay raise and six for it with the 
other six either undecided or unwilling to disclose their position 
wright awaited the replies of his colleagues as the senate 
governmental affairs committee began two days of hearings on the 
issue that has dominated the early days of the congressional session 
lloyd cutler the chairman of a federal pay commission that 
recommended the increase defended the proposed 45000 raise before 
the panel but said lawmakers should retain a similar increase for 
judges and federal bureaucrats if they dont accept it for themelves 
wright has acted in other ways to blunt the impact of the 
proposal to raise congressional pay from 89500 to 135000 
negotiators for the speaker and the republican leadership have 
tentatively agreed to major elements of a package to severely 
restrict outside income 
wright said he would keep the anwers confidential but asked 
members tell me how you really feel 
in addition to asking about a vote wright asked if members 
thought the raises proposed by former president reagan were fair 
would cut the 50 percent proposal to 30 percent thus offsetting 
what house members can keep in speech honoraria would support a 
strict ban on all honoraria and would vote against rescinding the 
raise if it meant a loss of income assuming an honoraria ban passes 
most of the six senators who told the ap they planned to vote for 
the raise said they will do so only if honoraria are banned in 
return 
it was unclear how many of the possible yes votes in the 
survey were firm since the language of the pay rejection resolution 
was still under discussion more than a quarter of the senate has 
sponsored legislation that would roll back the increase if it 
becomes law on feb 8 as expected 
senate leaders also are negotiating whether to restrict outside 
income beyond a simple ban on honoraria the catchall term covering 
speaking fees appearances and articles 
house negotiators representing the leadership in both parties 
have tentatively worked out restrictions that range far beyond an 
honoraria ban 
the raise from 89500 to 135000 for rankandfile lawmakers 
can only be stopped if both houses reject the increase senate 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine has promised senators a 
vote on rejecting the pay plan but house democratic leaders have 
said they will not allow a vote 
the pay proposal submitted to congress in former president 
reagans final budget would give lawmakers federal judges and top 
political appointees in the executive branch 50 percent increases 
sen christopher dodd dconn said he will vote for the pay 
raise but keep only the amount that will replace the money he now 
earns from honoraria 
dodd said it is a politically tough choice and he was critical 
of those who would vote no and take the dough 
to me thats the height of hypocrisy that is why people have 
so much difficulty with congress and politicians he said 
thats where peoples stomachs begin to turn youve got to be 
honest about it 
several senators opposed to the raise said they will return the 
money to the government or give it to charity 
those who said they will support a raise in some form included 
dodd james m jeffords rvt spark m matsunaga dhawaii 
mitchell daniel patrick moynihan dny and ted stevens ralaska 
senators who said they were undecided or refused to disclose 
their views were glenn slade gorton rwash richard lugar 
rind barbara mikulski dmd frank murkowski ralaska and 
william v roth jr rdel 
the remaining senators said they are against the raise 
in the house the tentative agreement on outside income is 
designed in part to soothe public anger over the size of the 
increase and the lack of a house vote 
the package according to leadership sources would 
end the honoraria system which has allowed rankandfile house 
members to keep up 26850 of the money they earn each year from 
speeches articles and other appearances 
abolition of the grandfather loophole in campaign financing 
law the loophole has allowed 190 house members who were in office 
as of jan 8 1980 to stockpile more than 39 million in surplus 
campaign money for their personal use the provision does not apply 
to senators 
restrict travel probably through time limits that is often 
paid for by special interests who invite lawmakers for speeches and 
plant tours this would prevent members from getting long vacations 
at resorts even if they speak for free 
restrict nonhonoraria income such as fees for serving on 
corporate boards

afghan guerrillas who have fought 
marxist regimes since 1978 say they want a nonaligned islamic 
republic but not necessarily the kind an arab nation or the 
persians of iran would create 
the people of afghanistan are moslems hamed karzai said but 
added we have lived in that location for thousands of years its 
a question of culture 
hes an arab im an afghan he wears skirts i wear this he 
said pointing to his loose cotton trousers and kneelength shirt 
called a shalwar kameez and we are absolutely different from 
iran 
karzai is a spokesman for the sevenparty islamic unity of afghan 
mujahedeen based in this ancient dusty frontier city and a 
political officer of the afghan national liberation front 
the front is considered one of the more moderate 
westernoriented parties of mujahedeen or holy warriors karzai 
acknowledged that conservative groups have more power within the 
alliance and said there are differences on how to define an islamic 
state even within the afghan context 
shahruk gran a field commander of the moderate national islamic 
front of afghanistan said all the guerrillas are moslems but that 
does not mean they fit a specific political mold 
some people misinterpret islam some putting it on a narrow 
path and some on a broader one he said but i think for all of 
us it means having the right of choosing our own government 
he and the other mujahedeen believe that right was usurped in 
april 1978 when communists seized control of afghanistan in a 
military coup the insurrection began soon afterward 
more than 5 million afghans have fled the country most of them 
to pakistan the neighbor to the east and the others to iran on 
afghanistans western border the guerrillas use refugee camps as 
bases and most of their support comes from the united states and 
pakistan 
soviet military forces intervened in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 red army soldiers were in afghanistan when they 
began withdrawing may 15 under a unmediated agreement all are to 
be gone by feb 15 
grans reference to broad and narrow paths illustrates the 
difference between the three moderate parties and the four groups of 
hardliners who describe themselves as islamic revolutionaries first 
and afghans second 
among the most powerful conservative factions is the 
hezbiislami faction led by gulbaddin hekmatyar 
our government should be one of moslems especially those who 
have shed their blood for allah against the foreign invaders and 
their puppets he said in an interview last 1988 the future of 
afghanistan is for those who have fought for it and no one else 
pressure has been brought from outside particularly the united 
states and pakistan for a softer position now that the soviets are 
leaving and the marxist regime in kabul is expected to fall 
there is room for all of us but under no circumstances will we 
accept the communists not after what they have done said ghaus 
amer a hekmatyar spokesman in islamabad capital of pakistan 
whatever their differences the mujahedeen factions agree their 
government should have friendly relations with neighbors even the 
soviet union but be free of foreign interference 
we have a 2000kilometer 1200mile border with the 
russians so of course we want good diplomatic relations karzai 
said there will be problems with trust especially at the 
beginning but we will have to build those relations gradually 
strong as their desire for independence may be the afghans will 
be heavily dependent on foreign aid to rebuild after a decade of war 
that reduced many cities to rubble much of the industry and 
agriculture is idle or in ruins and mines litter the landscape 
onethird of the prewar population lives in the refugee camps of 
pakistan and iran and must be repatriated un officials estimate 
reconstruction and resettlement will cost more than 2 billion 
western diplomats in islamabad expect most afghans to be 
preoccupied with rebuilding their lives 
one said the question of government is relevant mainly to the 
political leaders of the mujahedeen the afghans tradition has 
been to run their affairs locally with as little interference as 
possible from kabul

bridge officer lou garcia the fogshrouded bridge reopened at about 
8 am 
highway patrol cars and san francisco police were sent to clear 
lanes for commuter traffic heading into the city from marin county

about 
but a caller to the associated press bureau in san francisco said 
the protest was organized by a group called stop aids now or else 
the caller who did not identify himself said the demonstrators 
either have the fatal disease or have been deeply affected by it

seasonal stirrings are about to lead the 
nations groundhogs from their snug burrows in search of lady 
groundhogs 
thats right when the furry mammals set forth in midwinter they 
couldnt care less about making weather predictions researchers say 
its hormones that get them moving only the timing proves a boon 
for small town chambers of commerce which seek publicity by taking 
advantage of the appearance of the animals and the associated 
ancient weather folklore 
feb 2 known as groundhog day in the united states has been a 
time for weather prognostications for centuries the date is also 
known as candlemas in the christian tradition a feast somewhat 
overshadowed by the commercial hype in recent years 
the popular idea of predicting winters end from animal behavior 
extends back at least to the ancient celts and was spread by the 
roman legions 
over the centuries farmers came to consider the celebration 
occurring about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring 
equinox a good time to try to make weather predictions applying 
the theory that the rest of winter would be the opposite of that on 
candlemas 
if candlemas be bright and clear therell be two winters in 
the year goes one traditional british rhyme if candlemas bring 
clouds and rain go winter and come not again 
similar beliefs are reported from ireland scotland france and 
spain so serious was this taken that some german farmers were said 
to have preferred to see a wolf in the stable than that candlemas 
day be pleasant and clear 
it was the germans who settled in pennsylvania who brought to 
america the tradition of predicting the weather on this date 
in europe they had looked to the first movements of hibernating 
bears hedgehogs and badgers for weather predictions on this side 
of the ocean the honor fell to the woodchuck also known as the 
groundhog or marmot 
woodchucks do begin to leave hibernation at this time of year 
at least in some parts of the nation but scientists report that 
whats on the animals minds is sex not weather 
the males come out of the burrows first while female groundhogs 
wont awaken for a week or more in the meantime the males search 
for food and fight among themselves according to researchers in 
maryland and pennsylvania 
the folk belief however is that animals somehow know future 
weather and if they end their hibernation and sally forth spring 
is close 
thus developed the worry that a shadow might frighten the animal 
back into its home leading to a prediction of six more weeks of 
winter 
most folks consider that bad news 
in the more northerly areas of the country however some people 
are said to hope that the groundhog will see its shadow predicting 
that winter will last only six more weeks 
the us naval observatory meanwhile relays a report that 
sailors who have been stationed at guantanamo bay say local people 
in cuba have a somewhat similar tradition 
that is that around this date banana rats find a tree to climb 
and relax in if they settle at a low level of the tree it will be a 
bad year for hurricanes while rats climbing high in the trees means 
a mild hurricane season the belief goes 
for the more religious the church observations on feb 2 are 
known as the feast of the presentation of the lord and the feast of 
the purification of mary 
this celebrates the time when mary as required by jewish law 
went to the temple in jerusalem to be purified 40 days after giving 
birth to a son and to present that son jesus to god 
that presentation of jesus said to bring light to the world 
helped lead to the custom of blessing on this date the candles 
destined to be used for the rest of the year hence the name 
candlemas 
and even those candles extend the weatherfolklore connection 
with the superstition that a candle blessed on this date will 
protect a home if lighted during a thunderstorm

timely enforcement of environmental laws saying the environment can 
be protected without hindering economic growth 
reillys nomination by president bush as head of the federal 
governments key environmental agency is expected to win early 
senate approval his appearance today before the environment and

reilly told the senators that while he plans to enforce 
environmental laws aggressively whenever it is warranted to 
safeguard public health and environmental quality he also will 
seek to deal with environmental problems through consensus and 
cooperation 
we no longer have the time or luxury of allowing the

environmentalists and industry 
reilly said he has spent his career in the environmental movement 
advocating environmental protection and economic growth and

staffers of the national park service at 
yellowstone national park were determined to maintain the natural 
fire regime as fires grew out of control there last summer 
according to a memo by a park service official visiting from another 
park 
the memo by sequoyia national park fire specialist howard nichols 
said yellowstone staffers were bemoaning the fact that new fire 
starts as mandated by the secretary had to be suppressed 
according to a copy of the memo made public today at a congressional 
hearing on the fires 
the aug 15 memo was submitted by nichols to the western regional 
director after a weeklong visit to yellowstone that began july 28 
on july 21 theninterior secretary donald p hodel ordered that 
what some have called the let it burn policy be suspended and 
all fires fought 
rep ron marlenee rmont submitted the memorandum at a joint 
hearing of the national parks subcommittee of the house interior 
committee and the forests subcommittee of the house agriculture 
committee 
nichols did not say that anyone disobeyed hodels order but 
marlenee suggested to denis galvin deputy director of the national 
park service that the memo showed that hodels policy was not 
being carried out 
galvin said the service would absolutely look into points 
raised by the memo 
among other things nichols said the tactics used for these 
fires may well result in the suggestion that yellowstone was using 
suppression dollars to achieve natural resource benefits a patently 
illegal use of these funds 
also he said yellowstones preexisting fire plan was 
deficient in not stating how many acres should be permitted to burn 
at any time 
marlenee and other members of congress from the yellowstone area 
have protested that the park service endangered their constituents 
businesses and property in neglecting to fight the fires until they 
were too far gone for effective suppression 
the park service and environmental groups supporting it argue 
that fire is necessary to regenerate the high lodgepole pine forests 
of yellowstone and only the unforeseeable and exceptional drought 
made 1988s fires so devastating to normal tourist and other 
activity

a powerful airline industry group has urged further 
study before construction begins on denvers proposed new 3 billion 
airport 
the air transport association which represents most major us 
airlines including denvers two largest carriers opposes the 
citys plan to break ground on the new airport this summer 
it will voice that position during public hearings in denver this 
week the new airport is planned about 20 miles farther out of the 
city than stapleton international airport located on the citys 
eastern outskirts 
this airport isnt needed right now leslie rowland a 
spokeswoman for the washingtonbased association said monday 
weve already got a lot of unused capacity right now this needs 
further evaluation 
the group hasnt decided what an appropriate timetable should be 
she said 
rowland said the association decided last week to participate in 
denvers public hearings partly on the advice of continental and 
united airlines both carriers argue that denver is planning the new 
airport too quickly and both are represented on the transport 
associations executive committee 
mayor federico pena and gov roy romer say a new airport is 
needed because stapleton among the nations busiest airports cant 
handle its traffic volume critics of the new aiport say stapletons 
volume has fallen off somewhat in the past year and that stapleton 
should be expanded rather than building at a new site 
the federal aviation administration supports the airport plan 
said faa spokesman john leyden

an index measuring the ability of the typical 
american family to buy a home edged down in december leaving buyers 
with slightly less purchasing power than they had a month earlier a 
real estate trade group said tuesday 
the national association of realtors said its affordability index 
was 1123 in december down from 1128 in november 
the december figure means that a family earning the median income 
of 32100 had 123 percent more income than needed to qualify for a 
mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of a 
medianpriced home 
for all of 1988 the index was 1134 down slightly from 1138 in 
the previous year as family incomes mostly keep pace with increases 
in mortgage interest rates and home prices 
the median price of an existing home in december fell 300 from 
the previous month to 87700 meaning half the homes sold for more 
and half for less median family income rose 104 and the mortgage 
rate used to calculate the index rose from 948 percent to 961 
percent representing a composite of fixed and adjustable rates 
the affordability index which has been above 100 since june 
1986 was at its highest point for 1988 in april when it reached 
1138

last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the scandalscarred 
military procurement system and said that cost overruns hurt the 
national security 
standing on the sunsplashed deck of the aircraft carrier 
america bush delivered his message in a speech to thousands of 
sailors at the norfolk naval base and air station the largest naval 
installation in the country a number of representatives of defense 
contractors also were in the audience 
still fighting off a cold bush had a raspy voice and coughed 
repeatedly during his remarks he said later he had been just 
croaking away and wasnt sure during his speech that he would be 
able to finish 
it was his first outoftown trip since becoming president and 
his speech came against the backdrop of a fraud and bribery scandal 
in the military procurement system 
bush said he believed that the overwhelming majority of 
procurement officers and defense contractors care about the quality 
of the ships planes and weapons that they sell to the pentagon i 
am determined to make sure that every single one of them does he 
said 
the president said that cost overruns are not a new problem but 
they are still wrong and hurt the national security particularly 
when budgets are tight 
we want tighter controls and higher standards in weapons 
procurement and we will get tighter controls and higher standards 
in weapons procurement he said 
saying he will insure that the military has the proper support 
from the country bush said i firmly believe that the vital first 
step to broadening our national consensus on defense is to wring the 
last drop of waste and mismanagement out of the way we buy our 
weapons and thats what we intend to do 
bush flew by helicopter from washington and landed directly on 
the deck of the carrier a staff helicopter that landed first sent a 
gust of wind across the deck that nearly blew away the red carpet 
taped down for the president it was rolled up and then laid out 
again once bush landed 
as part of security precautions bushs armored limousine was put 
on the ships deck it rode alongside him as he walked 
bush did not wear an overcoat in the mild weather the 
temperature was in the 50s although the sailors and many members 
of the audience wore jackets and coats to ward off the chill of the 
wind bush who came down with a cold late last week said he was 
feeling better 
despite his cold bush seemed in good spirits after his remarks 
he ate lunch in a mess hall with enlisted sailors dining on egg 
drop soup cantonese meat sticks porkfried rice a spring roll 
shrimp and a glass of milk 
he asked if the chow was show business food or if the sailors 
always ate as well they said they generally ate pretty well 
you want a little trivial pursuit he asked a sailor he said 
he had been stationed at nearby oceana naval air station a 
thousand years ago as world war ii was coming to an end 
i had just gotten orders to go back overseas he recalled 
thank god the war ended 
introducing bush to the audience vice adm richard dunleavy the 
air commander of the atlantic fleet told bush youre back to your 
roots and proclaimed a homecoming 
bush was a naval combat fighter in world war ii and recalled some 
of his experiences 
saying he would demand high standards from defense contractors 
bush said ive been inside a submerged submarine while depth 
charges were going off all around it and i know what its like to 
hear the vessel strain and shake and pray to god that the people in 
charge of buying and building cared as much about the vessel as you 
do 
bush spent weeks aboard a submarine during the war after he was 
rescued as sea when his plane was shot down

finance minister shimon peres on tuesday 
introduced a 307 billion budget for the 1990 fiscal year with a 1 
billion deficit that was bigger than expected 
the document presented to the knesset or parliament calls for a 
19 percent increase in the governments operating budget to be 
partly offset by a reduction in the development budget and increases 
in taxes and fees 
defense outlays are to rise to 59 billion in the fiscal year 
beginning april 1 from 505 billion in the current year 
part of the rise in military spending is to cover increased costs 
for countering the 14month palestinian uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip dealing with the arab revolt has been 
costing the government about 14 million a month 
the budget is expected to win easy approval in parliament where 
a coalition between peres labor party and prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs likud bloc controls fourfifths of the seats but tax 
increases and cuts in food subsidies have already brought an angry 
public response 
peres has pledged to hold down federal spending in announcing 
his economic austerity program on jan 1 he said the aim was to try 
to hold this years deficit to the same level as last years 833 
million in red ink 
he did not explain tuesday why the goal was not attained but he 
told parliament that we have learned that nothing feeds inflation 
more than a budget deficit therefore we decided to cut the 
expected budget deficit 
the nations massive histadrut labor federation which represents 
about 80 percent of israeli workers has pledged to oppose peres 
plan contending it will increase unemployment and significantly 
raise food transport and insurance costs that workers cant afford 
an announced earlier the budget calls for reducing government 
subsidies for food and public transport fees for universities 
hospitals and insurance are to increase and new taxes will be 
imposed on cars and imported services 
israeli tv estimated up to 4000 government workers could lose 
their jobs under the austerity program 
the israeli economy grew a sluggish 1 percent last year down 
sharply from 52 percent growth in 1987 about half of the slowdown 
has been blamed on the uprising which has reduced tourism business 
investment and sales to the territories

ugandas president yoweri museveni said tuesday 
that libya was too small a country to present a threat to other 
states but if they do well kick them out 
museveni speaking at a national press club meeting with 
reporters also said that although the united states has accused 
libya of supporting terrorism the libyans have denied the charge 
so we dont know what to think he said 
libya has no power to destabilize anyone theyre just 3 
million people said museveni who is on a private visit here to 
promote his country to business leaders and journalists if they 
do he added his government will kick them out 
libya as well as north korea provides uganda with weapons and 
military advisers uganda also got some 8 billion in 1988 from the 
united states for development projects 
us officials are pleased with musevenis threeyear rule 
saying he is the best leader his country has had in recent years 
museveni came to power in 1986 after waging guerrilla warfare 
against the governments of idi amin and milton obote museveni had 
accused both men of bankrupting uganda in pursuit of personal power 
and wealth 
the annual state department report on human rights around the 
world which is to be published this month praises uganda for 
progress it has made in offering amnesty to resistance groups and 
allowing a free press but also criticizes long jail periods without 
trial and a slow judicial process us officials say

friends mourning the death of pegeen fitzgerald 
recalled how she and her husband partners in a groundbreaking radio 
format wove their way into the hearts of ardent listeners from 
eleanor roosevelt to average new yorkers 
if you listened to them it seemed like you were eavesdropping 
on a conversation with a loving but not always an agreeing couple 
said radio host john a gambling who worked with mrs fitzgerald 
and her husband edward at woram 
mrs fitzgerald 78 died of breast cancer monday in her 
apartment said roger garner a personal assistant it was from that 
apartment that the fitzgeralds most often broadcast their unscripted 
show a program which featured discussions of the couples everyday 
life their friends and current events 
they got mad at each other on the air they celebrated things 
on the air said kathy novak a television producer who 
apprenticed with the fitzgeralds pegeen always said we dont 
read from any scripts 
the show which first aired in 1937 ended with the death of 
edward in 1982 mrs fitzgerald continued on wor for another year 
before moving to public radio station wnyc where she was on the air 
until last spring 
the fitzgeralds program was the first of its kind and quickly 
inspired an assortment of imitators 
the monthly bills could provide a shows worth of material as 
the couple chatted the sounds of their many pet cats or their 
cleaning woman running the vacuum could be heard in the background 
their only preparation for the program was a cursory reading of the 
newspapers and listeners mail 
the couples onair arguments were the result of honest anger 
edward once became so upset during one breakfast show that he 
returned to bed and left his wife alone to finish the show 
were a true soap opera she once remarked to a reporter 
mrs fitzgerald first took to the airwaves when employees of a 
department store where she worked had to fill the air time of a 
storeowned radio station 
in 1937 a woram executive offered to put a microphone in her 
office at the store and she soon was doing a halfhour show during 
her lunch hour 
when she caught pneumonia management asked if she could go on 
air from her hospital bed and later from her home while she was 
convalescing 
because she did not want her announcer henry morgan to see her 
in a bathrobe she asked if her husband could take his place the 
husbandwife combination became a radio first and first lady 
eleanor roosevelt once went to their apartment to watch 
ardent listeners protested vigorously whenever station executives 
tried to remove the fitzgeralds from the airwaves the listeners 
were so devoted to the couple that several willed their pets to the 
animalloving couple 
mrs fitzgerald was survived by four sisters and one brother

the government proposed tuesday to expand 
safety requirements at electrical utility companies and said the 
changes could prevent about onethird of the 75 workrelated deaths 
in the industry each year 
the proposal by the labor departments occupational safety and 
health administration would cover 660000 employees of electric 
utilities and related services the government said 
the regulations subject to a public comment period before they 
take effect were drafted in cooperation with the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers and the edison electric institute 
a utility industry trade group 
the guidelines would affect such routine tasks as using ladders 
to enter manholes as well as work on exposed electric lines by 
treetrimmers and repair workers 
osha said it would cost about 21 million to bring utilities in 
compliance the regulations would not cover construction and 
telecommunications workers who face similar hazards those workers 
are covered by separate standards 
the tighter rules were proposed for electric utility workers 
because they encounter far greater risk of electric shock and falls 
osha said in a statement the proposal does not cover electric power 
plants not run by utilities but osha said it was considering 
extending the rules at a later date to cover all electric power 
generation transmission and distribution 
the agency said full compliance with the regulations should 
eliminate 24 to 28 of the approximately 75 workrelated fatalities 
each year among covered workers more than 3200 injuries also 
should be prevented osha said 
electric shock accounts for half the deaths and injuries in the 
industry 
to protect workers from shock the guidelines would require wider 
use of protective equipment such as insulating blankets gloves and 
sleeves a number of training and safety measures also are included 
in the proposed guidelines

a cold stiff wind rips down town lake as 
terry page stands on the deck of a floating shantytown overhead a 
man yells from a passing car on the first street bridge get a 
job 
right there is someone who doesnt understand the issues of the 
homeless said page who knows the problems first hand 
page 29 spends many of his days and nights on the shantytown 
three scrapwood huts lashed together atop styrofoam blocks that have 
been anchored in the middle of the lake that bisects downtown austin 
the floating eyesore deliberately ugly to prick the consciences 
of the thousands who drive or jog by daily has been floating in 
the lake since the end of october it is the creation of the street 
peoples advisory council or spac an organization founded by james 
williams that has performed similar publicity stunts to increase 
awareness of the homeless 
last year spac members took a gosling hostage and threatened to 
cook and eat it if the city council didnt meet with them they got 
their meeting 
williams 49 was briefly held by police for trespassing last 
year when he and other homeless people broke into and lived for 
several days in an abandoned house owned by the university of texas 
when the state legislature convened in january spac members 
panhandled at the capitol for quarters so they could park a couch in 
a metered parking space 
the group is now lobbying the city council to build a permanent 
tent city for the citys 2700 homeless people although austin 
winters are generally mild with temperatures in the 50s the 
thermometer occasionally dips below freezing 
i try to figure out something that is humorous and to the 
point a lot of people have heard the issues and have turned a deaf 
ear williams said in a recent interview 
acting city manager barney knight says williams and his group 
have been forceful theyve done a very effective job in keeping 
their issue before the public 
others who try to serve the areas downandout mistrust williams 
and spac 
they are a selfappointed group serving themselves as far as 
homelessness and needing of assistance they are phonies said 
marion morris director of helping our brothers out or hobo 
hobo provides transitional housing for homeless people and works 
with other human service agencies to get help the needy 
i personally dont feel these people spac members should come 
under the heading of the homeless morris said they should come 
under the heading of chemical abusers 
a lot of these guys have been on the street most of their 
lives they would like to use the government services to sustain 
them while they go about taking care of their drug habits he said 
williams concedes some spac members have drug and alcohol 
problems but he said morris misses his groups point 
were strictly a high pressure advocacy group were a 
nonproviding group were a referral agency williams said 
spac has only five people on its council but 20 to 30 people 
check in daily at its offices said carl riley sergeantatarms and 
executive administrator 
hobo has a low outlook on street people and we dont 
williams said i dont practice telling someone how to run their 
life we dont push rehab on them we dont push religion we try 
to get people into some type of housing with dignity 
housing is the critical issue if a person has an address and a 
telephone then they can get employment said williams originally 
from los angeles but who has lived in austin for the past 15 months 
and then the next thing would be health care services 
williams page and a man named joe who refused to give his last 
name live in the floating threeplex 
knight said the structure on town lake probably violates a city 
ordinance but added were somewhat reasonable about giving these 
people a way to advertise 
to circumvent the ordinance the three men have purchased a 
fishing license and keep several lines in the water 
although short on dignity the huts have many comforts 
page and williams built shelves inside their units they have 
heaters sleeping bags camping stoves lanterns radios and an ice 
chest full of food they also have a car battery rigged up to power 
a light at night williams has a rowboat to ferry people and 
supplies from shore all the materials to construct the boats have 
been donated 
and as a symbol the boats have served well page said 
thats what theyre meant to be eyesores people ask us what 
is this for we tell them we are protesting about lowincome 
housing theres not enough of it

the military service exemption for 
sons of jewish victims of the holocaust has been extended to the 
grandsons of those persecuted the defense minister said tuesday 
the issue of military service is still very sensitive for the 
children of holocaust survivors defense minister rupert scholz said 
in an interview with the hamburgbased panorama television program 
the decision to extend the exemption is in keeping with a 
longstanding desire for reconciliation scholz said 
until recently only the sons of holocaust victims were exempted 
from west germanys compulsory military service 
scholz said the decision was made at the request of the west 
german jewish council 
the jewish council made its request after a frankfurt court ruled 
against a jewish man who asked that he be exempted because his

eyestinging spruce smoke cloaked 
dimly lit figures huddled against subzero cold at the end of their 
first long day of learning the tricks of arctic survival 
nothin but a bunch of boy scouts with bad language someone 
quipped 
he was partly right the only scouts were a halfdozen eskimo 
scouts who teach the military how to stay alive when it gets so cold 
that people from the lower 48 states cant comprehend it 
the scouts weeklong course 100 miles north of the arctic circle 
is short on lectures and long on cold at least four full days and 
nights are spent in the wilderness 500 miles northeast of anchorage 
now in its third winter the alaska army national guard school 
has trained about 150 people to cope with temperatures that 
consistently range in the neighborhood of 40 degrees below zero it 
hit 45 below on the last two nights of januarys class and a couple 
days after the students left alaskas great cold wave struck with 
temperatures down to 50 and 60 below zero 
students run the gamut from army special forces troops to raw 
national guard recruits and alaska adjutant general john schaeffer 
says it is not just nonalaskans and nonnatives that need the 
training 
the type of eskimo were enlisting today doesnt have the 
survival skills of the older eskimos says schaeffer a 
participant in the january class he estimates about half of the 
guard is eskimo or indian 
because of cultural changes natives no longer have to rely on 
the skills handed down for generations says schaeffer an eskimo 
from kotzebue weve got a bunch of eskimos and indians around 
here who would have as much trouble surviving the cold as anyone 
else 
schaeffer an experienced arctic outdoorsman says he attended 
the class to lend it some credibility and assure its permanency and 
funding 
were doing what we should have been doing for years taking 
the skills weve learned from centuries of living here and passing 
them on the twostar general says 
the school was started in response to requests from national 
guard flight crews who wanted training similar to that offered at 
the air forces cool school at eielson air force base near 
fairbanks 
maj jerry finney the us army adviser to the 5th scout 
battalion of the 297th infantry got together with an arctic village 
hunting buddy timothy sam 
sam recruited other instructors from the nearby gwichin indian 
villages of venetie and fort yukon and they began showing students 
what it takes to survive 
the practical experiences of the natives are backed by scientific 
data from finney about human physiology and thermodynamics 
finney says one of the most difficult survival obstacles is to 
overcome the macho approach to the cold too often soldiers are 
afraid to admit they are freezing he says 
at 40 below zero severe frostbite can occur within two to four 
hours as the result of a series of minor errors or less than an hour 
from one serious mistake finney says 
the worst injury in the six previous classes at arctic village 
involved a special forces sergeant who suffered serious frostbite to 
nine toes part of the cause was an experimental boot but much of 
it was a stubborn unwillingness to acknowledge the cold finney says 
nobody knows better than you if youre cold finney preaches 
if youre cold do something about it deal with it 
shelter construction is one of the areas of major emphasis at the 
school types of shelters depend on the materials at hand and the 
foothills of the brooks range near arctic village have plentiful 
supplies of stunted black spruce 
boughs are used for ground insulation and to thatch the sides and 
roofs of leantos limbless trunks become the framework for the 
shelters wood is gathered for allnight fires 
instructors show students how to snare hares and catch fish to 
supplement their diet but this part of alaska doesnt support a 
bunny population large enough to feed two dozen hungry troops 
icefishing is somewhat more productive 
ideally a caribou would be killed and instructors detail the 
many uses for the meat hide and entrails the gwichin have 
survived on caribou for centuries 
but this january the nearest caribou were 80 miles away

terror and asked for an urgent un inquiry into human rights

consolidating rural settlements critics say the plan would 
involve razing thousands of villages

the jet carrying the us embassy staff 
out of kabul on tuesday narrowly missed hitting a soviet transport 
plane approaching the besieged capital of afghanistan the two 
senior american diplomats said 
we had a nearcollision 10 minutes after takeoff with an 
incoming flight from the north charge daffaires jon glassman 
said after the chartered indian airlines boeing 737 arrived in new 
delhi 
air traffic control at kabul is never very good said jim 
schumaker secondranking diplomat at the kabul embassy which 
closed monday 
he said the plane carrying the last 11 kabul staff members came 
within a mile of a collision with the soviet ilyushin76 transport 
both men praised pilot rc maulay for his quick and expert 
evasive action 
we drank a champagne toast after crossing the afghan border 
schumaker said 
maulay is a veteran of flights in an out of the kabul airport 
which requires precipitous corkscrew landings and takeoffs 
the airport sits on the kabul plain which is turned into a 
geological bowl by surrounding hills and mountains planes routinely 
drop flares designed to divert heatseeking missiles fired by moslem 
guerrillas camped in the heights around the city 
in closing the embassy the united states cited fears of 
deteriorating security after all red army soldiers leave 
soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 to 
help the marxist government fight moslem guerrillas all are to be 
gone by feb 15 under a unmediated withdrawal agreement 
other western nations also are closing their embassies west 
germany removed its remaining staff members last saturday 
the last us embassy personnel to leave were glassman 
schumaker five other members of the us foreign service staffers 
and four us marine guards 
maulay the pilot modestly did not mention the nearcollision 
he said the chartered jet carried 8 tons of cargo on the twohour 
flight from kabul to to delhi 
john r hubbard us ambassador to india and his deputy grant 
smith greeted the americans who smiled broadly and carried their 
luggage to limousines and vans two large embassy trucks loaded the 
rest of the gear 
the new delhi embassy issued a statement saying most would return 
to the united states soon 
most noncommunist nations including the united states removed 
their ambassadors from kabul in protest after soviet troops arrived 
the withdrawal also constituted a diplomatic snub and refusal to 
recognize a succession of governments put in power by assassination 
and party purges

the government said tuesday it has no 
evidence that the suspicious deaths of two priests within 10 days 
were politically provoked

around poland and spreading death among priests government 
spokesman jerzy urban told a news conference 
authorities performed an autopsy tuesday on the body of the rev 
stanislaw suchowolec 31 a prosolidarity priest found dead monday

another priest the rev stefan niedzielak 74 who died of a broken 
neck on jan 21 niedzielak was sympathetic to the solidarity

political provocation in the deaths urban said 
the rev cezary potocki chancellor of bialystok district said 
roman catholic church officials attended the autopsy of suchowolec 
who worked in the parish of the immaculate heart of mary

there was a considerable amount of smoke in the room father 
suchowolec was lying next to the couch his dead dog was lying there 
too he said 
the windows in the room were shut the window and door panes 
were blackened with soot maybe the electric circuits were cut off 
which could have been the source of the fire said urban 
suchowolec actively supported the banned trade union solidarity 
early in his six years as a priest he served for three years as 
vicar in suchowola home village of the rev jerzy popieluszko who 
was murdered by security police in 1984

a man who claimed to be an astronaut sported 
impressive medals uniforms and badges and even wangled a 10minute 
audience with the lord mayor of dublin 
but robert hunt 27 was grounded monday when he was arraigned on 
charges of larceny and fraud and ordered held on 100000 bail he 
was charged with duping a youth into joining the navy and then 
claiming he could get him released from his commitment for 2000 
hunt claimed to be a marine captain a decorated fighter pilot 
and told convincing but false stories about himself to his wife his 
inlaws some people at the bedford veterans administration 
hospital an aer lingus pilot and cadets at the us naval academy 
in annapolis md according to state trooper andy palombo a state 
police investigator 
palombo said he started looking into the stories earlier this 
month i did some checking and found out there was no such animal 
as robert hunt who was a marine captain and fighter pilot or 
astronaut he said 
the charges against the man stem from allegations he persuaded an 
18yearold saugus youth to enlist in the navy and then told the 
teenagers parents their son could get out of his commitment for 
2000 palombo said they paid him that amount twice once in a 
check he said was no good and then in cash though he later cashed 
the check palombo said 
last summer the man married a woman who like her parents was 
convinced that he was an astronaut the man showed them burned 
kitchen tiles he claimed came from the explosion of the challenger 
space shuttle three years ago 
when i arrested him saturday noon at his home his wife still 
thought he was an astronaut palombo said 
the charges against hunt also include his alleged use of his 
wifes credit card for a variety of charges including the charter 
of a private jet to montreal 
he later wrote the crew complimenting them on their performance 
being a former astronaut i would like to make note that the 
landing in montreal was equal to our landing of the shuttle 
atlantis the letter stated 
before he flew with his wife to ireland just before christmas he 
called ahead to tell officials in ireland he was an astronaut 
palombo said 
he was given a big state welcome and made an honorary citizen 
of ireland by lord mayor of dublin benjamin briscoe because he was 
an astronaut according to palombo 
but briscoes spokeswoman who requested anonymity said briscoe 
gave hunt a 10minute audience on oct 8 at mansion house his 
official headquarters after being told hunt was a visiting 
astronaut 
a source close to briscoe also requesting anonymity said hunt 
told him british prime minister margaret thatcher was arranging for 
him to be married in westminster abbey in london briscoe quickly 
realized the man was not the full shilling but politely went 
along with the charade the source said 
hes very good the trooper said i had him in the cruiser 
and i asked him one question he talked for 10 minutes without 
hesitating from medford to boston 
i said to him but you never answered my question and he 
said thats right

prime minister noboru takeshita said tuesday he 
would work to restore public faith in his government which has been 
shaken by a major financial scandal 
speaking to members of his liberal democratic party hours before 
leaving on a weeklong us trip he said political reform is my 
top priority 
no matter how difficult i will restore the peoples trust in 
government and earnestly work toward political reform takeshita 
said i will thoroughly enforce discipline in my administration 
and bring back public faith in it 
for the last six months japanese politics has been rocked by 
disclosures that top politicians or their aides profited from shares 
in a real estate development firm because they bought them before 
public trading when the sales went public the shares soared in 
value 
the purchases of shares in the firm a subsidiary of the 
information conglomerate recruit co were not illegal but raised 
questions of political ethics fundraising and influencepeddling 
three of takeshitas cabinet ministers have resigned in the last 
three months because they received political donations from recruit 
or were linked to purchase of the shares 
in the wake of the recruit problem we have been subject to 
severe criticism over political ethics takeshita said in his 
speech to the conservative party which he addressed in his capacity 
as its president political reform should be the basis for all 
reform 
he said he had assembled an advisory group on political reform 
that has begun drawing up concrete measures to deal with the problem 
the political opposition calls the recruit affair proof of 
corruption in the governing party although a few opposition 
politicians have also been implicated the opposition has demanded 
that the entire cabinet step down and takeshita call new elections 
but he has refused 
in an editorial last week the newspaper asahi shimbun said the 
scandal had damaged the image of politicians 
it does nothing but deepen the nations political discredit 
the asahi said takeshita must make clear to the people how he 
will put an end to such a shameful political situation and take 
political responsibility 
the liberal democrats have been buffeted in both electoral and 
opinion polls in recent weeks 
a recent survey by kyodo news service showed support for 
takeshita had plummeted from 534 percent in september to 359 
percent a poll released saturday by the asahi put public support at 
28 percent down from 57 percent a month earlier 
the party also suffered a setback in elections last weekend in 
kitakyushu western japan where the opposition socialists and 
communists made slight gains in municipal balloting 
opposition politicians also claim a new tax package which 
introduces a general consumption tax of 3 percent and lowers 
corporate and higherbracket income taxes was steamrolled through 
parliament and benefits the wealthy 
also tuesday takeshita disclosed his personal assets saying he 
was worth more than 1 million

a food and drug administration panel said 
tuesday that children with healthy teeth may need dental xrays no 
more than once every year or two and dentally healthy adults once 
every two or three years 
the panels guidelines reported in the current issue of the 
journal of the american dental association were prompted by concern 
among some experts about the frequency of dental xrays both 
overuse and underuse 
although the radiation risk from a dental xray is extremely 
low our goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure fda 
commissioner frank e young said in an news release on the 
guidelines tuesday 
until these guidelines were developed there were few concrete 
criteria a dentist could use in deciding when xrays were needed 
he said 
young also stressed the flexibility of the guidelines saying 
these are not hard and fast rules in deciding whether an xray is 
needed the dentist must use clinical judgment in evaluating the 
patients needs 
the guidelines say children and adults generally do not need 
xrays each time they see a dentist if they are not at high risk and 
show no signs of dental disease highrisk patients include those 
with enamel defects poor dental hygiene or inadequate exposure to 
fluoride or those who come from families with poor dental health 
the guidelines say that children visiting a dentist for the first 
time will need xrays 
most children who have not developed cavities and do not show any 
other symptoms of dental disease will need xrays generally once 
every year or two according to the guidelines xrays also are 
sometimes needed to check on the proper growth and development of 
permanent molars 
the panels guidelines are supported by the american dental 
association the academy of general dentistry the american academy 
of dental radiology the american academy of oral medicine the 
american academy of pediatric dentistry and the american academy of 
periodontology the fda said

a juror hopes joel steinbergs manslaughter 
conviction will send a message to other child abusers but prison 
sentences alone wont solve the complex problem experts said 
tuesday 
think about what youre doing juror annemarie king a 
physical therapist implored all child abusers after the verdict 
monday night 
steinberg will face a maximum prison term of eight and onethird 
to 25 years for fatally injuring 6yearold lisa his illegally 
adopted daughter on nov 1 1987 
its important that these cases be prosecuted but i am not 
sure that will deter anything said dr richard krugman 
director of the denverbased kempe national center for the 
prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect 
the idea that they might go to jail for it is so far from their 
abusers thinking that its not a very effective deterrent 
agreed david finkelhor an expert in domestic violence and a 
professor of family research at the university of new hampshire 
instead krugman and others said the trial should highlight the 
urgent need for prevention 
i havent been impressed that theres been an enormous effort 
to do something about prevention and treatment of abused children in 
new york city before or after lisa steinberg said krugman 
you could prevent 500 serious cases of abuse with the money 
spent prosecuting steinberg said krugman that would be a living 
memorial to her to have a prevention program in her name 
dr vincent fontana director of the mayors task force on child 
abuse said the social system is riddled with problems 
child protective agencies are understaffed overloaded and 
poorly supervised people are leaving agencies after theyve been 
trained because of demoralized attitudes he said 
child abuse deaths number two to three a week in new york city 
and about 4000 to 5000 a year nationwide said fontana 
steinberg had illegally gained custody of lisa and a baby boy 
from their unwed teenage mothers 
despite the familys supposed affluence steinberg was an 
attorney now disbarred and his companion hedda nussbaum was a 
childrens book editor lisa slept on a sofa and looked 
increasingly dirty and unkempt a school photographer testified that 
he used makeup and lighting tricks to camouflage bruises neighbors 
and a teacher also noticed injuries 
a child abuse caseworker had visited the steinberg home in 1984 
less than a month before lisas death police found ms nussbaum 
with a swollen lip but she refused to press charges 
ms nussbaum later testified for the prosecution about a 12year 
relationship in which she was beaten brainwashed and subjected to 
other bizarre punishments for transgressions imagined by a 
cocaineusing steinberg 
fontana charged that ms nussbaum although physically damaged 
and perhaps mentally damaged could have certainly saved the child 
before the abuse escalated 
that doesnt excuse the school system doesnt excuse the 
police doesnt excuse the child protective agency doesnt excuse 
the community there were friends relatives neighbors who knew 
what was going on and no one did anything he said 
still some good could emerge from the tragedy 
state senators introduced 11 new bills tuesday to toughen 
penalties for child abuse 
fontana is pressing the mayor for a special agency that will 
prioritize child abuse and neglect he also suggested that 
schools hospitals and social service agencies have access to a 
computerized data bank to judge whether a child is at risk 
meanwhile the trial has shown that abuse occurs in all walks of 
life said deborah daro director of research for the chicagobased 
national committee for the prevention of child abuse 
lisa steinbergs legacy is that the middleincome people have 
been able to identify with child abuse echoed fontana 
dr samuel klagsbrun ms nussbaums psychiatrist at four winds 
hospital in katonah said the case has made a difference in two 
ways by heightening awareness of domestic abuse and by proving that 
a severely battered woman with significant treatment can come 
back to life thats the most hopeful part for women who are 
battered and watching this story 
the real question is what shape will this experience take down 
the line said klagsbrun will people learn something from 
it or is it just another sensational story which disappears 
i think this is such a powerful story that it wont be 
forgotten

vice president dan quayle on a mission to 
encourage democracy in latin america will meet with el salvadors 
outgoing president and representatives of rightwing factions but not 
with anyone from the leftist party battling for power in the 
upcoming election us officials said tuesday 
quayles stop in san salvador on friday will include meetings 
with president jose napoleon duarte and members of his christian 
democratic party as well as with representatives of the rightist 
nationalist republican alliance or arena and a very diversified 
group of people said a senior bush administration official 
but quayle will not meet with leftist presidential candidate 
guillermo ungo or members of his democratic convergence party those 
officials said 
the officials who briefed reporters on the condition of 
anonymity said quayles schedule should not be read as a sign the 
administration is taking sides in the march 19 election or is 
signalling any rejection of the recent truce proposal put forward by 
the guerrilla coalition allied with ungos party 
the explanation the officials offered for quayles willingness to 
meet with candidates of two political parties but not the third was 
that it would send the wrong signal at this point given the 
delicacy of the internal situation we want to go down there and 
see what the major parties have to say 
another us official knowledgeable about relations with el 
salvador said it would be awkward for quayle to meet with a civilian 
ally of rebels fighting to overthrow the usbacked government 
quayles threeday journey with a stop in venezuela on thursday 
for the inauguration of that countrys new president carlos andres 
perez is being characterized as a chance for the vice president to 
get acquainted with latin leaders hear their concerns on such 
issues as the debt crisis and regional strife and show us support 
for latin democracies 
one official who briefed reporters said the trip would also 
bolster quayles statements that he will be a top adviser to bush 
the vice president will be privy to information that no one 
else has right now and will relay it to the president the 
official said bushs policies on such matters as latin american 
debt and the regional peace process are under review quayle is not 
expected to offer major policy initiatives 
quayles office has not released the names of the heads of state 
with whom he will meet in caracas saying the plans are not yet 
final 
but a state department official involved in planning the trip 
said he is scheduled to meet with the presidents of spain portugal 
brazil colombia and honduras he will also meet with a group of 
caribbean leaders 
one of the topics for those meetings will be the plight of the 
usbacked contra rebels battling the leftist government of 
nicaragua 
in el salvador the focus of discussions will be human rights 
an administration official said quayle intends to have very 
good substantive specific conversations very straightforward 
to emphasize that the administration is serious about adherence to 
human rights 
officials have expressed concern that congress will balk at 
further aid to the strifetorn nation if its government does not 
reign in human rights abuses 
ungos party is a political ally of the umbrella faribundo marti 
national liberation front which has been fighting the government 
since 1979 on jan 23 the guerrillas offered for the first time to 
participate in elections but only if the ballotting is postponed 
until september 
opinion polls have shown arenas candidate alfredo cristiani

attorney general dick thornburgh said tuesday 
that six task forces are being created in major cities to combat 
crime in the suites by fighting against securities and 
commodities fraud 
we see every year billions of dollars of losses to investors 
and in tax revenues to the federal government by reason of schemes 
involving deceit concealment and breach of trust carried out for 
example in the securities and commodities businesses thornburgh 
told reporters 
the attorney general flanked by us attorneys from new york 
chicago and kansas city announced plans to create six securities 
and commodities fraud units in those cities as well as los angeles 
denver and san francisco 
the announcement came just weeks after disclosure that federal 
investigators in chicago had been conducting a twoyear undercover 
operation that has turned up widespread evidence of fraud by 
commodities futures traders at the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
thornburgh said 15 federal prosecutors with experience 
investigating insider trading stock manipulation and other 
sophisticated financial crimes would be assigned to work exclusively 
in this area along with law enforcement agents 
the units will combat what can aptly be called crime in the 
suites thornburgh said the kind of criminal activity thats 
carried out under the guise of respectability in the major financial 
markets 
all of these investigations are difficult and require the 
sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors they are not made 
by breaking down the door and seizing the evidence said 
thornburgh himself a former us attorney in pittsburgh 
the task force idea was first pressed in 1987 by federal 
prosecutors including rudolph giuliani the outgoing us attorney 
in new york who spearheaded the successful prosecution of insider 
trading on wall street 
thornburgh hinted that the creation of task forces in denver san 
francisco los angeles and kansas city would result in criminal 
indictments 
stay tuned the attorney general told reporters 
selection of those cities for task forces was based on what the 
history had been what the pending investigation caseload was he 
said 
the problem is bad enough that we want to undertake some extra 
steps to deal with it thornburgh said 
the record speaks for itself in the prosecutions that have been 
undertaken to indicate we want to bring this additional 
firepower to bear on behalf of investors who otherwise might run the 
risk of being defrauded and might lose their confidence in the 
integrity of these markets he said 
thornburgh defended chicago us attorney anton valukas who has 
been accused by defense attorneys of using strongarm tactics to 
pressure commodities traders into cooperating with the investigation 
mr valukas has kept the department fully apprised of any 
significant investigations that he has undertaken and they have been 
approved at the appropriate levels thornburgh said 
the attorney general said the 15 new positions would be taken 
from extra slots in us attorneys offices provided for in the new 
drug bill and other legislation the experienced prosecutors would 
be replaced with new hires he said 
another 15 investigators and some clerical support staffers would 
be assigned to the task forces which would number between 30 and 40 
people department officials said 
agents from the us postal service the internal revenue 
service the securities and exchange commission and the commodity 
futures trading commission would also be permanently assigned to 
the task forces

deeply split factions in yugoslavias 
communist party quarreled for the second day at a key meeting 
tuesday and the military issued new warnings that it will intervene 
if the crisis continues 
the meeting also was told that the central committee will discuss 
demands for the ouster of national party chief stipe suvar but that 
the 23member politburo the most powerful party body will make a 
final decision 
suvar took the floor to announce that if the politburo decides to 
relieve him i shall accept this only as a moral reprimand because 
the central committee alone can decide on an ideologicalpolitical 
measure such as dismissing him 
his comments suggest there is disagreement even on the rules and 
procedure for a possible dismissal 
the meeting of the policymaking central committee which started 
monday is marked by a rift between liberals and conservatives over 
ways to overcome the countrys worst economic and political crisis 
as opposing delegates clashed two senior military officers 
issued dramatic warnings that the armed forces would not remain idle 
if the countrys fortunes continue to decline 
one of the biggest barriers to the stabilization of the 
situation in the country is the disunity of the leaderships on all 
levels said vice adm stane brovet the deputy defense minister 
yugoslavia can survive only as a true federation and the 
forces which are striving toward the breakup of such a yugoslavia 
should be prevented primarily by political but also by all other 
means brovet said 
the military has remained on the sidelines of recent political 
conflicts between those favoring more democracy and political 
pluralism and those advocating a strong centralized communist 
system to solve the countrys problems 
senior officers show signs of increasing unease over the crisis 
which includes a 250 percent inflation rate a sharp drop in living 
standards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest 
the political chief of the armed forces adm petar simic told 
the meeting monday what some describe as the battle for 
yugoslavia will not be waged without the yugoslav army 
both military men have called for an end to the feuding 
but supporters of slobodan milosevic the hardline party chief 
of the serbian republic continued attacks on suvar a croat and 
other nonserbian federal officials whom they blame for polands 
protracted crisis 
croatian ivo druzic sparked a sharp debate when he appealed to 
suvar and milosevic to reconcile their differences and compromise 
druzic compared their clash to a train being pulled in opposite 
directions by two locomotives 
milosevic rejected this assertion without indicating any 
willingness to compromise 
vukasin micunovic a central committee member from montenegro 
said the intolerance shown at this meeting is a result of the 
struggle for power under way in the party leadership 
milosevics supporters at the session criticized suvars opening 
speech monday when he said the country faces a stark choice between 
more democracy or neostalinism 
yesterdays speech without a trace of selfcriticism does 
not offer answers to any of the key questions said serbian member 
tomislav radovic 
milosevic is supported by yugoslavias poorer regions which fear 
that marketoriented economic reforms will cause layoffs at 
lossmaking statesubsidized enterprises 
suvar is supported by slovenia and his native croatia which 
favor increased political pluralism more democracy and radical 
marketoriented reforms

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan called 
president bush a very good and old friend tuesday and said the 
two have only minor differences concerning the conduct of economic 
policy 
greenspan played down reports of a rift between the federal 
reserve and bush which surfaced last week after bush said in an 
interview he did not believe the central bank should be trying to 
slow economic growth because of a fear of inflation 
whatever differences do exist and i think they are minuscule 
have been exaggerated greenspan said during an appearance 
before the congressional joint economic committee 
in an interview bush had cautioned the central bank against 
overreacting to the threat of inflation following testimony the 
previous day by greenspan in which the fed chairman said the risk of 
higher inflation was serious enough that fed policy should err more 
on the side of restrictiveness than of stimulus 
in his comments bush said i dont want to see us move so 
strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth on 
friday bush said during a press conference he didnt believe the 
differences between the new administration and the central bank were 
that great 
sen paul sarbannes dmd said he was concerned that 
disagreements between bush and greenspan were being aired publicly 
rather than being worked out in private he questioned greenspan 
about his access to bush and the role he has had in making 
suggestions on what should be in the budget bush will submit to 
congress next month 
greenspan said he had not met with bush since december but that 
he was meeting on a regular basis with treasury secretary nicholas 
brady bushs top economic spokesman greenspan said he expects to 
be consulted on the contents of bushs budget before the president 
unveils it in a joint address to congress on feb 9 
i have no problem communicating with president bush he is a 
very good and old friend of mine greenspan said i am not the 
least bit concerned about what is going on i think the press is 
trying to make this a cause celeb where none exists 
many private economists have said the new administration which 
needs robust economic growth to drive the budget deficit down could 
be on a collision course with the fed which since last march has 
been pushing interest rates higher in an effort to slow the economy 
and keep inflation from getting out of hand 
in his comments tuesday greenspan sought to minimize any 
differences he might have with the new administration 
greenspan said the economic predictions used by the reagan 
administration to construct its final budget were optimistic but 
were well within the range of reasonableness especially if 
congress and the bush administration agree on significant spending 
cuts that will meet the grammrudman deficit reduction targets 
those targets call for reducing an expected 161 billion deficit 
this year to 100 billion in the fiscal year which begins oct 1 
bush budget director richard darman has indicated the new 
administration will base its own budget revisions on the optimistic 
forecasts contained in the reagan budget 
greenspan said that while he expects that the current economic 
recovery which has lasted a peacetime record of six years will 
some day end in a new recession he said the imbalances that 
normally preceded a downturn were not now in evidence 
greenspan said that rather than pushing the economy into another 
downturn he believes the feds efforts to boost interest rates 
would extend the length of the recovery by keeping inflationary 
forces under control 
on another matter greepspan said the huge us trade deficit 
which has shown little improvement over the past six months would 
begin improving again this year without the need for a further drop 
in the value of the dollar

john f kennedy international airport has become 
the first airport in the country to install traffic lights on its 
runways and taxiways to reduce chances of a ground collision 
officials said tuesday the experimental system is working well 
the red lightgreen light system initiated jan 15 is intended to 
backstop the air traffic controllers who direct the movement of 
about 500 airplanes a day on the airports nine miles of runways and 
28 miles of taxiways 
so far the feedback has all been positive said jack gartner 
manager of aeronautical services for the port authority at jfk 
they pilots are apparently pleased to see this as a supplement 
to the verbal commands when they cross the runways 
similar systems are functioning at londons heathrow and 
frankfurts main airports and have been recommended by the 
international civil aviation organization to guide airplanes and 
ground equipment in bad weather 
the 600000 cost of the system was shared by the federal 
aviation administration and the port authority of new york and new 
jersey which operates the airport 
the system is being tested at 15 of the most critical 
intersections where taxiways cross runways in all there are about 
75 places where taxiways cross runways gartner said 
the need for such a system has been underscored by the increasing 
number of ground collisions at airports around the world the worst 
such collision occurred in 1977 at tenerife on the canary islands 
and killed 583 people 
the traffic lights are radio controlled from the tower said faa 
spokesman duncan pardue 
in the tower a person called the local controller instructs all 
aircraft on the ground with the new system a second controller 
monitors conversations between the local controller and the pilots 
and operates the red and green lights accordingly 
it will remove a chance for error where the pilot and the 
controller do not understand each other or dont communicate for 
some reason or where the pilot hears clearance for a plane that he 
think is his but isnt pardue said 
voice control will still govern however if the light is red 
the pilot has to ask about it pardue said 
he said it was too early to say whether the faa would eventually 
mandate such systems as busy airports

with little more than 1370 days until the next 
presidential election the democrats have a frontrunner to 
challenge president bush according to the first 1992 campaign poll 
the leader is sen edward m kennedy 
the midjanuary abc news survey which an abc polling analyst 
termed just a fun read on what people think underscored the 
massachusetts senators standing as the most familiar name among 
democrats 
as my family keeps reminding me ive been elected president 73 
times in the past 20 years in polls like this quipped the senator 
kennedy emerged as the top 1992 presidential choice among 
democrats or independents leaning democratic 
youre kidding said andrew kohut president of the gallup 
organization when told of the poll 
at this point premature understates the case by a lot said 
kohut 
kelly hanley a polling analyst at abc news said the survey was 
just a fun read on what people think and we found ted kennedy at 
the top which weve found in the past never turns out to be true 
kennedy is familiar with the role of early frontrunner 
in july 1985 kennedy held a 15point lead over gary hart in a 
gallup poll measuring democrats preferences for the 1988 
presidential nomination kennedy remained the frontrunner through 
dec 19 1985 the day he announced he would not run for president 
in the new survey kennedy was the choice of 26 percent of people 
shown a list of seven prominent democrats and asked which of the 
following persons do you think would be the best candidate for the 
democrats to run in 1992 
ms hanley said the survey was done because we were interested 
in seeing what type of support michael dukakis had at the moment 
the 1988 democratic presidential nominee has announced he will 
not seek another term as governor of massachusetts but has refused 
to rule out a 1992 presidential run 
the abc poll had him tied for third place with jesse jackson in 
second place was gov mario cuomo of new york 
the top four finishers in the survey were bona fide democratic 
liberals a political species supposedly headed for the endangered 
list after landslide defeats in the last three presidential 
elections 
trailing the four leaders were sens albert gore jr of tennessee 
and bill bradley of new jersey and rep richard gephardt of missouri 
abc polled 781 people who described themselves as democrats or 
independents who lean toward favoring democrats they were contacted 
between jan 12 and 16 and the results had a 4point margin of 
error meaning they could be off as much as four percentage points 
up or down 
kennedy was the first choice of 26 percent and cuomo of 19 
percent dukakis and jackson were named by 15 percent each while 
gore had 6 percent bradley 5 and gephardt 4 
one prominent democrat not included on the abc list was texas 
sen lloyd bentsen who received highly favorable reviews as the 
partys vice presidential candidate in 1988

natan sharansky prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
choice to represent israel at the united nations is a short 
balding man who spent nine years in soviet prisons but seems never 
to lose his sense of humor 
i will say only what i want to say i have enough experience 
with interrogations and i know how to give answers sharansky 41 
told a radio interviewer who pressed him to comment on the reported 
appointment 
in the early 1970s sharansky a mathematician by profession was 
a member of a human rights watchdog organization headed by physicist 
andrei sakharov a nobel prize laureate 
sharansky gained prominence as a spokesman for the group he had 
wide contacts with foreign journalists in moscow and emerged as a 
champion of the soviet jewry emigration movement 
sharansky married in 1974 a day after the wedding his wife 
avital left for israel hoping that he would soon follow 
but sharansky was denied exit visa in march 1977 he was 
arrested and in 1978 convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13 
years in prison 
he spent nine years in soviet prisons and labor camps and became 
a symbol of the soviet jews plight thanks to the efforts of 
avital who tirelessy campaigned on his behalf in the west 
freedom came on feb 11 1986 when sharansky was released in a 
dramatic eastwest spy swap on berlins glienicke bridge 
in israel sharansky first kept a low profile devoting himself 
to family life he and avital now have two daughters 2yearold 
rachel and hannah born in november 
avital became an observant jew during the years of sharanskys 
forced absence but sharansky has defines himself as nonreligious 
newspapers have speculated the marriage may fail apart because of 
religious differences 
sharansky for whom unity is a prime value responded angrily to 
the reports 
i feel like my own bald pate has been conscripted into israels 
kulturkampf or culture war he said in a recent interview 
people here concentrate too much on their differences instead 
of principles and common aims 
sharansky has successfully defeated attempts by many of israels 
parties to lure him into their political embrace 
but besieged by his former compatriots he emerged last year to 
found a lobby group that seeks to improve conditions for thousands 
of soviet immigrants plagued by shortages in jobs and housing 
unity again was the key and soviet jewry activists said only 
sharansky could unite about 10 groups representing the immigrants

if the city of such hostelries as the waldorf 
the pierre and the plaza doesnt have enough truly firstclass hotel 
rooms architect im pei has a solution a 50story hotel where 
singles start at about 400 a night 
its an expensive piece of property its going to be expensive 
to build and its going to be expensive as hell to live in 
robert burns of regent hotels which will run the regent of new 
york said tuesday at a news conference 
the 400room hotel which will be on 57th street in the heart of 
manhattan is to open in 1991 it is expected to cost 300 million 
according to the developer eie international of japan 
burns said nightly rates would be nearly 400 to 700 for suites 
the developers say some international travelers especially 
business people on expense accounts already are paying as much as 
400 a night in many of the worlds largest cities and will happily 
do the same in new york 
peis design calls for a tower of honeycolored limestone that 
steps back gradually from its base rising to a crown marked by four 
lanterns 
the regents 600squarefoot standard room will be the size of 
many onebedroom apartments in manhattan and about 40 percent 
larger than the average new york hotel room its developers said 
according to a regent hotels description each room will feature 
walkin closets separate dressing areas three telephones and two 
telephone lines two or three color television sets connections for 
computers and fax machines and a videocassette recorder and compact 
disc player 
in a touch borrowed from asia regent is based in hong kong 
each floor even upper ones with as few as six rooms will have a 
steward to attend to guests needs according to a news release 
these might include having a button sewn flowers delivered a 
limousine ordered 
the most expensive hotel in new york city is probably the plaza 
athenee on the upper east side where single rooms cost about 300 
others according to the convention and visitors bureau include the 
pierre at 250340 the plaza at 215290 or 450 for a central 
park view and the peninsula 210365 relative bargains include 
the hilton at 155200 the marriott marquis at 210235 and the 
waldorfastoria at 180240 
business has been good with an occupancy rate of about 76 
percent 10 percentage points higher than the national average 
according to the bureau 
but as staffer kathleen astrom noted now things are going to 
spread out several luxury hotels have opened in manhattan in the 
past year and six more are under construction

the federal home loan bank board on tuesday 
announced new restrictions on savings institutions investments in 
socalled junk bonds which pay high interest rates but carry 
more risk than investmentgrade bonds 
the agency which regulates about 3000 federally insured sampls 
barred insolvent institutions from making new investments in junk 
bonds and generally will require them to sell junk bonds they 
already own 
exceptions to the rule are permitted if bank board examiners 
believe holding the junk bonds is in the nearterm interest of the 
government insurance fund backing sampl deposits 
solvent but shaky institutions that dont meet capital 
requirements will be required to get government approval before 
buying junk bonds 
existing regulations permit the purchase of junk bonds but 
institutions can invest no more than 5 percent of their portfolios 
in a single junk bond mutual fund 
over the last several years junk bonds have been a profitable 
investment for many sampls analysts worry however that if the 
issuing companies default during an economic downturn sampls will be 
stuck for a loss 
at the end of last june junk bonds accounted for 13 billion or 
1 percent of the industrys 129 trillion in assets the bank 
board said

oranges dropped to 620 per box from 650 in december but were 
up from 564 a year earlier grapefruit declined to 372 per box 
from 471 in december and 563 in january 1988 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 48 
billion to 58 billion this year compared with a nearrecord of 57 
billion in 1988 that is the difference between cash receipts and 
cash expenses during the calendar year 
department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise 
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier 
production items 
food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 37 percent and 
usda analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is 
likely in 1989

the bush administration will propose a round of 
tax breaks reflecting campaign promises in its feb 9 budget 
rewrite but disagreement has surfaced over a major component a 
reduction in the capital gains tax officials said tuesday 
administration budget writers have not reached a consensus on 
whether the lower rates urged by bush during his campaign should 
apply equally to the sale of homes stocks and other assets said 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
treasury officials hope to minimize any adverse effect on the 
budget deficit that might result from lowering the tax on certain 
assets such as private real estate and art objects 
sources said it is likely that the budget plan bush unveils at 
the time of his address to a joint session of congress next week 
also will include 
a childcare tax credit of up to 1000 per child that would be 
available to lowincome families generally those earning less than 
10000 a year 
new tax incentives for oil and gas exploration likely coupled 
with a call for removal of remaining price controls on natural gas 
now affecting about 40 percent of production 
a proposal for taxfree enterprise zones to be established 
in some inner city areas to promote commercial growth a program 
championed on bushs nominee for housing and urban development 
secretary former rep jack kemp rny 
in addition administration officials are still wrestling with 
terms of a package to help bail out troubled savings and loan 
institutions and it appeared likely that some variation on a 
proposal for an increased fee for deposit insurance would be part of 
the new bush budget plan 
bush said even before he took office that his campaign vow to 
propose a reduction in capital gains tax rates would be part of the 
budget revisions he makes to the 115 trillion spending plan for 
fiscal year 1990 that former president reagan submitted jan 9 
and bush reiterated his support for such a plan in a news 
conference last friday 
however sources say there is still disagreement over exactly 
what form the tax cut should take 
capital gains profits from the sale of real estate stocks and 
other assets are currently taxed at the same level as other 
income at 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent depending on 
overall income 
bush would lower the rate to a maximum of 15 percent 
he claims that such a move would be an incentive to investment 
generating up to 4 billion a year in new revenues however many 
leading economists including the bipartisan congressional budget 
office argue that lowering the tax would have the opposite effect 
reducing revenues and further worsening the budget deficit 
to make sure the proposal does have the potential for spurring 
investment administration budget writers are trying to finetune it 
for instance while it could be argued that a lower capital gains 
rate for the sale of coprorate stocks and commercial properties 
might spur additional investment it might be more difficult to 
argue the same for the sale of private homes and objects of art 
analysts suggest 
the package of tax breaks to be included in bushs budget plan 
all reflect promises he made during last years presidential 
campaign 
however white house officials say it seems unlikely that all of 
bushs promises will make it into the document budget constraints 
being what they are 
bush must propose a plan that will get the federal budget 
deficit currently hovering at about 150 billion down to below the 
grammrudman target of 100 billion for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 
and he has repeatedly vowed he will do it without proposing new 
taxes 
obviously well be setting priorities i think youll see 
education environmennt child care said a senior white house 
official insisting on anonmymity 
on education the official said the budget plan would highlight 
a few guiding principles such as excellence and achievement and 
accountability and choice of schools 
however some of bushs campaign promises on education 
including a 500 million national merit scholarship program an 
expansion of the head start program and a 50 million increase in 
school experimentation may be considerably pruned back sources 
said 
the sources also said bushs campaign proposal to expand medicaid 
coverage to more lowerincome americans and to allow lowpaid 
workers to purchase it was being given a low priority in budget 
preparation talks 
theres no question george bush wants to make this a kinder 
gentler nation but he also wants to reduce the federal deficit the 
two have to be reconciled said the senior white house official 
budget director richard g darman and treasury secretary nicholas 
brady have been meeting almost daily to discuss key budget 
decisions according to white house aides

a federal judge said tuesday he 
probably will allow the immigration and naturalization service to 
return to a policy of restricting political asylum applicants to 
southern texas pending reviews 
us district judge filemon vela extended until feb 20 an order 
blocking the procedure but added at that time unless im 
persuaded otherwise the restraining order will be lifted 
were pleased with the results said william joyce associate 
general counsel for the ins who traveled from washington for 
tuesdays hearing the judge was fair 
ins critics cited a sharp increase in homeless central americans 
living in squalid conditions in the area after the procedure took 
effect dec 16 a group of immigration attorneys sued the ins over 
the matter here on jan 6 and on jan 9 vela issued a temporary 
restraining order blocking the procedure 
under the procedure the district began requiring asylum 
applicants to file their claims in harlingen and await decisions 
there in 30 days a period in which they were not allowed to work 
the most visible effect of the travel restriction was a rugged 
campsite east of brownsville where more than 300 central americans 
camped out on the ground under discarded cardboard and sheets of 
plastic 
huge case backlogs in cities such as miami and los angeles made 
it necessary to keep the immigrants near their points of entry while 
the government sorted out thousands of unfounded asylum claims the 
government maintains 
the only issue vela agreed to consider in the classaction 
lawsuit on behalf of central americans and other asylumseekers in 
the ins harlingen district was whether the ins instituted the 
change without allowing time for public comment as required in the 
federal administrative procedures act 
i am somewhat inclined to believe that probably what was taking 
place here would not require a notice and comment was more 
procedural than substantive vela said 
robert rubin one of the attorneys suing the ins said the 
plaintiffs still hope the judge will rule against the ins after a 
closer examination of the suit 
the judge certainly indicated that he was not happy with the 
situation as it existed and strongly admonished the government that 
he would be concerned if conditions ever returned to the state that 
existed prior to his issuance of a temporary restraining order 
said rubin with the san francisco lawyers committee for urban 
affairs 
before dec 16 the ins allowed asylumseekers who voluntarily 
presented themselves to the harlingen district to travel on to their 
us destinations where they often were allowed to work while 
pursuing their claims for refugee status 
hundreds of central americans left the area on northbound buses 
and other vehicles after vela made it possible for them to travel 
again jan 9 
many headed for miami but officials from the miami area visited 
southern texas to tell the refugees they had no shelter for them 
and joined officials in texas in calling on the federal government 
for help 
vela said he was concerned with past asylum statistics showing 
that of the thousands who traveled into the us interior 75 
percent never showed up at ins offices to legally pursue their cases 
more than 30000 central americans about half of them from 
nicaragua passed through the harlingen district in 1988 most 
having crossed the rio grande illegally in the vicinity of the 
border city of brownsville according to the ins

the man whose conviction for killing a police 
officer was questioned in the movie the thin blue line has 
gotten the backing of the district attorney in his quest for a new 
trial 
a brief filed by district attorney john vances office in the 
texas court of criminal appeals on monday said perjured testimony 
may have tainted the conviction of randall dale adams for the 1976 
slaying of robert wood vance said however he still believes adams 
is guilty of the murder 
the officer was shot at least five times during a traffic stop 
adams 40 has spent 12 years in prison consistently maintaining 
his innocence 
a key witness changed his testimony last month and said adams 
wasnt even in the car stopped by wood a judge ruled adams did not 
get a fair trial and should either be granted another or set free 
evidence has surfaced that at least four other trial witnesses 
lied authorities have said last fall the documentary the thin 
blue line examined the case 
in the brief filed with the appeals court vances office said it 
has no objection to the finding that adams is entitled to a 
new trial 
district court judge larry baraka who heard three days of 
testimony in december concluded adams was probably innocent that 
key witnesses had committed perjury and that former assistant 
district attorney doug mulder suppressed crucial evidence that might 
have cleared him 
vance told the dallas times herald he had not read the brief his 
office filed he had instructed assistant prosecutors to send it to 
the appeals court if they felt the evidence supported adams claims 
i told them to do whatever was right on the thing if thats 
the way it was thats the way it was said vance 
the prosecutor said that if adams is granted a new trial he will 
try to charge adams again 
its obviously a radical shift in their position said 
defense lawyer randy schaffer at least on the surface it appears 
theyre doing the honorable thing 
he added he plans to use vances brief in his efforts to persuade 
the texas board of pardons and paroles to free adams while the 
appeals court considers the case

treasury secretary nicholas brady gave a 
qualified endorsement tuesday to limiting tax deductions for 
interest payments on debt incurred in leveraged buyouts if the 
resulting revenue were used to reduce taxes on stock dividends 
if youre going to make a change and clearly were not 
suggesting one we would suggest that you look in the area of 
perhaps limiting interest deductions and using that money to give a 
break to corporate owners of stock brady told the house ways and 
means committee 
echoing his testimony last week before the senate finance 
committee brady said the bush administration would prefer congress 
wait a little to see if the trend of leveraged buyouts which 
approached 100 billion in 1988 begins to diminish on its own 
we have a habit of correcting things just as they are about to 
correct themselves brady said if we wait a little longer this 
thing is not going to gobble us up we cant prove at this point 
that the economy has been damaged 
congressional democrats however made it clear theyre under 
pressure to rein in junkbondfinanced corporate takeovers 
particularly because insurance companies and other holders of 
longterm investmentgrade bonds are beginning to be hurt in the 
deals 
for example owners of some 5 billion in longterm bonds in 
rjrnabisco co saw the value of those securities drop by a 1 
billion to 4 billion almost overnight upon the announcement of its 
pending takeover by buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
last fall for 25 billion 
i have a feeling that were looking at a richter scale thats 
showing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale and 
its too late said rep thomas j downey dny using a major 
earthquake with widespread heavy damage as a metaphor 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the panels chairman said the 
outcry for congressional action has become deafening in the 16 
months since thentreasury secretary and now secretary of state 
james a baker iii tried to blame the 1987 stock market crash on an 
attempt then to curb leveraged buyouts through tax law changes 
brady agreed that the driving force behind the buyout 
phenomenon is that companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate income 
tax rate by raising their capital through debt rather than stock 
sales 
he said the treasury department also has been attempting to find 
a way through internal revenue service regulations or a legislative 
proposal to make the tax treatment of stockequity and bonddebt 
financing more equal saying the buyout problem would disappear with 
a level playing field 
so far we havent been able to come up with one he said 
adding that the financial communitys response to his appeals for 
suggestions has been disappointing 
rep jj pickle dtexas likened bradys qualified endorsement 
of reducing the tax deductibility of interest on junk bonds in 
exchange for a corporate tax credit on dividends to a kiss through 
a veil and criticized him for not coming up with specific 
suggestions

american teenagers scored dead last in math 
and well below the mean in science in an international survey whose 
results pose a serious challenge to our position in the world 
community the educational testing service said tuesday 
the us youngsters were outperformed in math by their 
counterparts in four other countries and four canadian provinces and 
were among the worst science achievers in the assessment of 24000 
13yearolds 
the obvious conclusion is that unless were careful the buck 
rogers of the 1990s is going to be living in seoul korea instead 
of chattanooga or chicago said former tennessee gov lamar 
alexander now president of the university of tennessee 
how many times must this nation be reminded of its educational 
deficit education secretary lauro cavazos asked in a statement 
referring to repeated findings that us children perform poorly in 
math and science 
cavazos called the situation a national tragedy while other 
educators termed the survey results frightening and devastating 
ets officials tried to put a lesspessimistic face on their 
findings noting that almost all of the us teenagers demonstrated 
mastery of basic math skills and knowledge of everyday science facts 
we are making improvements on our own terms we are educating 
every child in america said archie lapointe executive director 
of the ets center for the assessment of educational progress 
everyone is talking now about higherorder skills higher 
standards im very confident that this is going to happen 
lapointe added if we articulate what we want to do the schools 
will deliver 
but albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said elementary school teachers wont be able to deliver 
unless they are required to take math and science courses to qualify 
for their licenses 
weve got a long way to go before we turn it around shanker 
said the next generation of elementary school teachers has 
already been educated without math or science youve got a terrible 
pipeline problem 
the assessment financed by the national science foundation and 
the department of education was based on tests of students in 
ireland south korea spain the united kingdom the united states 
and canadas british columbia new brunswick ontario and quebec 
the last three were divided into french and englishspeaking 
samples 
korean students demonstrated the highest overall mathematics 
achievement while those from the united states and frenchspeaking 
ontario showed the lowest youths in south korea and british 
columbia turned in the best science performance the united states 
along with ireland and frenchspeaking ontario and new brunswick 
perform well below the mean the report said 
among the specific findings 
seventyeight percent of the korean 13yearolds can use 
intermediate mathematics skills to solve twostep problems such as 
computing the average age of five children that compares with only 
40 percent in the united states and frenchspeaking ontario the 
report called the us performance a matter for grave concern 
forty percent of the korean students understand measurement and 
geometry concepts and can solve more complex problems such as 
figuring out the radius of a circle that compares with under 10 
percent in the united states and frenchspeaking ontario 
despite their poor performance twothirds of us students said 
they considered themselves good at mathematics only 23 percent 
of korean students the highest achievers shared that attitude 
more than 70 percent of the youngsters in korea and british 
columbia can use scientific procedures and analyze scientific data 
compared with only 35 percent to 40 percent in the four bottom 
nations and provinces 
the united states has traditionally thought of itself as 
technologically innovative and in the forefront in science the 
report said these results are sobering and pose a serious 
challenge to our position in the world community 
many educators said us performance could be improved if 
teachers and parents expected more of students and showed more 
enthusiasm themselves about science and math and they said 
international comparisons are helpful in determining how high 
expectations should be

amnesty international said at a un human rights 
commission meeting tuesday that israeli soldiers have fired tear gas 
into hospitals and homes during the palestinian uprising causing up 
to 60 deaths 
israel denied the charges 
an envoy of the palestine liberation organization in an apparent 
reference to the accusation told the 43nation meeting palestinian 
children had died in israeli gas chambers 
amnesty spokeswoman ingrid kircher read a statement saying the 
israeli forces fired tear gas into hospitals and homes a 
deliberate misuse because manufacturers instructions say the 
gas can kill in confined places 
she said about 60 people were reported to have died in tear 
gasrelated incidents some of them as a direct result of its 
misuse 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said in 
jerusalem its all a great lie israel has certainly not shot 
into hospitals 
an army spokesman said israeli troops in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip act in accordance with the international law and 
judicial procedures 
the spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the army will 
provide a detailed response to the allegations after a careful 
study of the report 
the plo observer nabil ramlawi made the reference to israeli 
gas chambers in his remarks to the un meeting in geneva 
many of the 6 million jews who died in the nazi holocaust were 
killed in nazi gas chambers 
ramlawi also accused the israelis of beating pregnant women to 
cause them to miscarry burying people alive to save ammunition 
instead of shooting them and stealing organs from wounded 
palestinian patients to be used in transplant operations on israelis 
the statement of londonbased amnesty expressed grave concern 
over what it called extensive human rights violations by israel 
despite growing domestic and international protests it said israeli 
authorities appear so far to have condoned if not encouraged 
the excessive use of force 
more than 365 palestinians and 15 israelis have died in the 
13month revolt the palestinians are protesting occupation by 
israel which seized the lands from neighboring arab states in the 
1967 middle east war 
amnesty said about 300 civilians have been shot to death by 
israeli soldiers 
the groups statement also said thousands of palestinians 
including children elderly people and wounded patients have been 
forcibly removed from hospitals and beaten by israeli army and 
security forces it said at least eight of the victims died 
amnesty urged the israeli government to crack down on excessive 
use of force and prosecute those guilty of abuses

north koreas capture of the uss pueblo and its 
83man crew who were held prisoner for 11 months in 1968 would not 
have occurred if the navy had acted properly the ships former 
commander said 
the story of the pueblo in a nutshell is one of a naval 
officer his crew and his ship set to do a job things went bad 
and the navy abandoned them retired comm lloyd m bucher said in 
a letter published this week in two naval magazines 
in an interview tuesday bucher said he was speaking out two 
decades later because i was still an emotional nervous wreck and i 
could not concentrate on doing a job of presenting a good solid 
case at an investigation after the incident 
i would say this article is a more frank account than i have 
given before he said not because i didnt try to give an 
accurate account before but because i have a much clearer 
understanding of the event than i had at the time of the inquiry in 
196869 
bucher 61 who retired from the navy in 1973 described the 
incident in a book bucher my story published in 1970 he is 
now an artist in poway calif 
buchers letter appeared in proceedings and naval history 
magazines published by the us naval institute in annapolis a 
professional society for sea services personnel 
to mark the 20th anniversary of the pueblo incident the 1988 
fall issue of naval history published the reflections of five flag 
officers who were involved in the incident 
buchers letter was an unsolicited response to that article said 
paul stillwell editorinchief of naval history 
i was surprised when i saw the initial article ninety 
percent of what was in that article was never mentioned during the 
pueblo inquiry it was filled with misinformation bucher said 
the pueblo lacked the proper equipment to repel an attack navy 
admirals knew the mission was risky yet approved it anyway and 
pueblo officers were not kept properly informed of world events 
affecting the ship bucher charged in his letter 
the pueblo under the guise of a technical research ship was 
commissioned to seek intelligence including pinpointing radar and 
other defense installations the north koreans captured the vessel 
on jan 23 1968 keeping its crew hostage until dec 22 1968 one 
sailor died in captivity 
rear admiral frank l johnson thencommander of naval forces in 
japan wanted two 50caliber machine guns stowed below the decks of 
the pueblo when bucher argued that the guns should be available for 
use topside johnson ordered that they be covered by tarps to 
disguise them 
bucher has been widely criticized for not having fired a shot to 
protect the ship 
retired admiral john j hyland thencommander in chief of the 
pacific fleet levied sharp criticism against bucher in the initial 
article 
he never manned the guns he didnt go to general quarters 
until hed already been fired upon and sustained some casualties 
bucher got a completely failing grade he said 
bucher wrote that the pueblo was surrounded by four korean 
torpedo boats and one gunboat and there was no possiblity of 
manning our machine guns or getting to the ammunition the tarps 
were frozen and the gun positions totally exposed 
from the outset navy officials knew that it was risky to send an 
essentially unarmed ship into international waters off north korea 
bucher said he also said he had been told that there was no 
probability of an attack but that navy officials promised 
retaliation just in case bucher said 
in fact no us forces came to the pueblos aid despite a call 
for help he said

more than 160 senators and representatives put 
their names on a proposed resolution tuesday seeking a oneyear 
moratorium on cuts in medicare payments to hospitals 
reductions in medicare payments to health care institutions will 
accelerate the growing rate of hospital closures putting the health 
care of the elderly disabled and even entire communities at risk 
the lawmakers said 
though they acknowledged the nations budget pressures the 
sponsors said congress also needs time to analyze the impact of the 
payment policies of the 87 billion federal health insurance program 
for the elderly and disabled 
one year from now i think were going to be in a position to 
make a better judgment about where we should go and what we should 
do said sen paul simon dill a chief sponsor of the 
nonbinding resolution but to devastate hospitals further today 
to put the squeeze on the poor and elderly of this nation is 
unwise 
former president reagan before he left office last month sent 
congress a proposed budget for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
that trimmed 24 billion from medicare part a the section of the 
program that pays hospitals he also proposed cutting about 1 
billion from medicare part b which pays physicians 
reagan called for a total 10 percent growth in total medicare 
spending which would hold the programs budget to 949 billion 
next year 
president bush is due to send congress his budget proposal next 
week and according to rep pete stark dcalif chairman of the 
house ways and means subcommittee on health the medicare portion is 
expected to be about the same as reagan proposed 
stark told reporters that bush budget director richard darman 
told him last week that his budget proposal wont be much 
different from the reagan proposal relative to medicare and my 
guess is the house budget committee will come out at somewhere 
between 2 billion and 5 billion cut in medicare 
i cant really see that well do anything different from what 
weve done in previous years and that means well take some out of 
the hospitals and some out of the doctors and will try to give some 
assistance in that to the inner city hospitals and rural 
hospitals he said 
members of the american hospital association are in washington 
this week for the groups annual meeting and they have been visiting 
the lawmakers on capitol hill about issues of interest including 
the resolution for a oneyear reprieve from cuts 
this resolution is very important to say wait we simply 
cannot make further reductions without cutting into the quality of 
care said sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
the lawmakers noted that more than 80 hospitals closed last year 
more than 400 have closed since 1982 and many others are losing 
money particularly rural and inner city hospitals medicare 
cutbacks are largely to blame they said 
fifty percent of hospitals are losing money on every medicare 
patient said rep nancy johnson rconn we cannot costcut 
with blindness to the consequences of that policy 
meanwhile sen lloyd bentsen dtexas introduced legislation 
designed to save faltering rural hospitals by boosting government 
reimbursements for patient care and improving physican recruitment 
bentsen blamed inequities in the medicare prospective payment 
system for contributing to the problems of rural hospitals under 
the program hospitals are reimbursed for the average costs of their 
elderly medicare patients and not on actual costs

william reilly picked to head the 
environmental protection agency said tuesday his chief 
antipollution priority will be acid rain and he promised to produce 
a legislative proposal for the problem as soon as possible 
acid rain for our point of view is first out of the box he 
told the senate environment and public works committee the panel is 
expected to vote later this week on reillys nomination as head of 
the federal governments top agency dealing with the environment 
its ahead of everything else reilly said at another point 
when asked by sen joseph lieberman dconn if he believed acid 
rain was a serious problem 
for more than six years congress has been grappling with 
legislation to curb acid rain but tough national legislation didnt 
gain white house support under former president reagan and last year 
became bogged down in congress 
acid rain blamed for polluting vast areas of vegetation streams 
and lakes along the countrys northern tier and in canada is caused 
primarily by emissions from fossil fuel burning plants in the 
midwest and ohio valley 
reilly said president bush is committed to the substantial 
reduction of acid rain by the end of this century and the epa is 
working to develop proposed changes in the federal clean air act to 
deal with the acid rain problem 
during the 2hour hearing both republicans and democrats 
including senators who are often on opposite sides praised reilly 
who for 16 years has been executive director of the conservation 
foundation and the president of world wildlife fund 
sen quentin burdick rnd committee chairman called reilly 
a person who appreciates that a great nation must be a good 
steward of its land its air its water and its natural resources 
im pleased to join the chorus of admirers and welcomers 
said sen frank lautenberg dnj noting reilly was introduced to 
the panel by no fewer than five senators from three states 
sen steven symms ridaho objected to what he called the epas 
often heavy handed approach to enforcing environmental laws but 
he praised reillys nomination 
reilly promised to enforce such laws aggressively and timely 
whenever it is warranted to safeguard public health and 
environmental quality but said he also hopes to deal with 
environmental problems through consensus and cooperation 
denouncing the bitterness the polarization the wasted 
resources and other excesses that have marked conflicts between 
environmentalists and industry in the past reilly said he is 
convinced the country can both protect its environment and have 
economic growth 
several senators noting reillys desire for consensus expressed 
concern that the approach might lead to inaction on part of the epa 
will you conciliate mediate negotiate away our environmental 
laws asked sen max baucus dmont who supported reilly 
lieberman urged reilly to be an environmental advocate in the 
bush administration and not allow the epa to be a reluctant 
combatant as it often has been in the reagan administration 
you can count on me being an advocate replied reilly

national park service staffers in yellowstone 
national park fought last summers forest fires so 
unenthusiastically that critics might well charge them with illegal 
use of funds according to an internal memo given to congress on 
tuesday 
the aug 15 memo was written for the western regional director by 
sequoia national park fire specialist howard nichols who paid a 
oneweek visit to yellowstone starting last july 28 to help project 
the courses of the fires 
on july 21 interior secretary donald p hodel ordered the 
service to drop its let it burn policy and fight all fires by 
the time snow arrived in late september more than 700000 acres a 
third of the park had been burned over though the service says 
almost all of that will quickly rejuvenate 
under the let it burn policy fires that met certain 
conditions were supposed to be allowed to burn themselves out but 
fires that threatened lives or developed areas or areas outside the 
park were supposed to be fought 
the forest service part of the agriculture department conducts 
commercial timbering on most land adjacent to yellowstone and 
fights all fires there 
the tactics used for these fires might well result in the 
suggestion that yellowstone was using suppression dollars to achieve 
natural resource benefits a patently illegal use of these funds 
said the nichols memo 
rep ron marlenee rmont submitted the memo at a joint hearing 
of the national parks subcommittee of the house interior committee 
and the forests subcommittee of the house agriculture committee 
on the memo another official bruce kilgore chief of resource 
management and research in the western region of the service had 
written perhaps not circulated widely at this time until we 
get our act together 
projections made on july 3 by the yellowstone staff showed as 
we did that the fan fire would eventually leave yellowstone and 
burn forest service lands yet no firm suppression action was taken 
until the fire was within a mile of the boundary nichols wrote 
the memo said the yellowstone staff often seemed to be 
satisfied to call the park boundary the confinement line 
corresponding to natural boundaries that could be relied on to check 
fires although few natural barriers could be found there 
after hodels order in spite of millions being spent and 2000 
fires yellowstone staffers were bemoaning the fact that new starts 
as mandated by the secretary had to be fought the memo said 
despite his criticisms nichols said the fires had improved the 
ecosystem of the park 
marlenee said the memo showed that hodels policy was not being 
carried out though it did not make specific allegations that the 
secretarys order was disobeyed 
denis galvin deputy director of the park service said points 
raised in the memo would be absolutely checked out by an 
internal investigations team 
marlenee and other members of the congress have accused the park 
service of disregarding the interests of residents dependent on 
tourism through the let it burn policy

wind damage to land in the great plains is up 
sharply reflecting the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation in 
the spring and summer the agriculture department said tuesday 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said nearly 22 million acres were reported damaged in 
november and december up more than 80 percent from 12 million 
acres in the same two months of 1987 
a lot of the damage is a result of drought scaling said 
the reasons vary by area but major factors are lack of crop 
residue and poor vegetative cover both caused by a lack of 
moisture 
scaling said more than 80 percent of the land reported damaged 
was cropland the remainder primarily rangeland 
texas accounted for more than 30 percent of the erosion damage in 
november and december with 664128 acres 
scaling said that in addition to the damaged land in november and 
december nearly 19 million acres were in condition to blow 
with five months still remaining in the critical wind season 
november and december are the first two months of an annual 
sevenmonth season when winds are highest and the soils are driest 
in the great plains surveys were made in 541 counties of the 
10state region 
although the 198788 season began with relatively light damage 
it picked up as moisture conditions worsened when the season ended 
last may 31 more than 13 million acres had been damaged the 
secondlargest acreage since the agency began records in 1935 
the most widespread was in 1955 when about 16 million acres of 
great plains land were damaged by wind another bad year was 198081 
when 125 million acres were damaged 
according to the survey the statebystate breakdown comparing 
damaged acres in november and december with the damage during the 
same two months of 198788 included 
colorado 28795 acres damaged this season and 17070 in 198788

three years after stepping out of soviet prison 
human rights activist natan sharansky appears headed for a new 
career as israels ambassador to the united nations 
an aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir and another senior 
government official tuesday confirmed radio reports that shamir 
chose sharansky for the post which will have to be approved by the 
cabinet 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman said the prime minister hopes the 
former refuseniks worldwide popularity will be a boon to israels 
public image that has taken a beating during the palestinian 
uprising 
we hope he could help improve our image pazner said this 
is definitely the consideration 
later however pazner said in a statement that sharansky had not 
yet been officially nominated such an idea was indeed raised but 
there is no decision yet on that nomination he said 
the report that sharansky was chosen took many israelis by 
surprise and prompted concern among some diplomats about angering 
the soviet union at a time when moscow has ended a 20year 
diplomatic break to improve ties with the jewish state 
sharansky 41 served nine years of a 13year sentence in soviet 
prisons and labor camp on charges of antisoviet espionage before 
being freed in a dramatic eastwest spy swap on berlins glienicke 
bridge on feb 11 1986 
sharansky was an outspoken activist for the emigration movement 
of soviet jews and belonged to a human rights committee headed by 
nobel peace prize laureate andrei sakharov that sharply criticized 
soviet treatment of prisoners and national minorities 
sharanskys case was made famous largely by the efforts of his 
wife avital who waged a tireless campaign during their forced 
separation of 12 years 
sharansky did not answer his telephone tuesday and declined 
direct comment when interviewed by israel army radio saying he had 
not been formally appointed 
pressed by the interviewer sharansky added i will say only 
what i want to say i have enough experience with interrogations and 
i know how to give answers 
a government official said sharansky also was the choice of 
israels russianborn foreign minister moshe arens his appointment 
will need approval from finance minister shimon peres under his 
labor partys coalition agreement with shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc it also will need cabinet approval 
one government official said on condition of anonymity that the 
approval may be delayed over fears of offending the soviet union 
which has warmed ties with israel recently the soviets broke 
relations after israel occupied arab land during the 1967 middle 
east war 
now that were on the eve of renewing diplomatic ties on such 
a delicate time in our relations with moscow it could take some 
time to determine whether this would not offend them said the 
official 
sharansky has kept a low profile in israel last year he founded 
a lobby group that seeks to improve conditions for thousands of 
soviet emigres plagued by shortages in jobs and housing 
he has stayed out of politics and said in a recent interview with 
the associated press that he had not found his place in any of the 
parties 
he was critical of the divisiveness in israels 120member 
parliament that has 15 parties and said he would like to see the 
electoral system changed im concern that everything in israel is 
partisan id like to see more mutual values and consensus in party 
politics sharansky said 
at the united nations sharansky may find himself being called on 
to defend israels strong tactics in trying to quell the nearly 
14month palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
arab groups once sought his support in vain he said to say 
that because sharansky was against the soviet union this should also 
make him against the israeli government this isnt true there is 
no parallel between them he said 
sharansky said he investigated complaints about israels behavior 
in the territories and defended the stance of his new homeland 
for a country in a state of war you cannot have the same rules 
as for a country not at war but it is important to keep 
democracy sharansky said

selling rocket guidance equipment to libya west german television 
reported 
earlier tuesday a governmentowned company said it found 
evidence that it was duped by another west german firm into 
providing plans for a suspeted poison gas factory in libya 
believing the technology was being used for a hong kong 
pharmaceutical plant 
the ard television network said customs officials in stuttgart 
gave munich investigators documents linking the company globesat to 
the alleged sale of rocket guidance equipment to libya 
the report gave no additional details but said officials suspect 
west german export laws and regulations governing the sale of 
military technology may have been violated 
globesats munich offices were closed tuesday night and company 
officials could not be immediately reached for comment 
another bavarian company is under investigation by prosecutors in 
munich in connection with allegations that it helped libya develop 
the ability to refuel its warplanes in flight 
meanwhile the governmentowned salzgitter industriebau gmbh said 
in a statement that a review of company records revealed that were 
were deceived in its transactions with imhausenchemie a company 
suspected of playing a larger role in the suspected chemical weapons 
plant in libya 
salzgitter said that among its records was a letter from 
imhausenchemie that mentioned rabta site of the plant south of the 
libyan capital of tripoli the statement did not reveal further 
contents of the february 1985 letter but said it was turned over to 
prosecutors investigating possible violations of export laws 
salzgitter officials have acknowledged doing business with the 
lahrbased chemical concern but have said it was contracted to 
produce engineeering designs for a pharmaceutical plant in hong kong 
employees who were working on the hong kong project at the time 
did not assign any importance to the mention of rabta in the 
letter the statement said 
the company said it had also sent experts to hong kong to inspect 
the factory it was contracted to design and found that our work 
had not been put to use there 
it also said switching equipment salzgitter supplied was not 
installed there 
salzgitter officials said the company is considering legal action 
against imhausenchemie 
us officials contend the plant in libya is designed to produce 
chemical weapons libya says it is a pharmaceutical factory 
imhausenchemie is the target of a criminal investigation to 
determine if export laws were broken in connection with deliveries 
for the libyan plant 
several companies have admitted doing work for imhausenchemie 
but deny knowledge that their equipment and blueprints were destined 
for libya

federal subsidies totaling almost 13 billion 
are being paid to cotton and rice farmers for taking part in 1988 
acreage programs the agriculture department said tuesday 
milton hertz executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said eligible producers of upland cotton 
will receive final deficiency payments of 725 million under the 
1988 program 
the rice payments total 570 million he said 
deficiency payments are made under a formula to make up the 
difference betwen a target price for a commodity and an average of 
market prices or the government price support loan rate whichever 
is higher 
in the case of cotton for example the market price average was 
565 cents per pound or higher than the support level of 518 
cents the target was 759 cents thus the deficiency payment 
is 194 cents per pound 
for rice the target was 1115 per 100 pounds the market price 
average of 684 exceeded the loan rate of 663 so the deficiency 
payment is 431 per hundredweight

first lady barbara bush on tuesday helped make 
sandwiches for the homeless and read to children at a daycare center 
for poor children as she visited a druginfested area of the 
nations capital to laud the work of volunteers 
arriving at marthas table about 20 blocks from the white house 
mrs bush put on a red apron to make salami and cheese sandwiches

facilitys daycare center gathered around quietly munching cookies 
she had brought from the white house 
mrs bush the mother of five and grandmother of 10 read from 
the book how fletcher was hatched 
at one point a dog in the book was described as howling mrs 
bush looked at the childrens upturned faces and asked who can 
howl like a dog 
that produced a cacaphony of yelping with little resemblence to a 
howl but mrs bush smiled and said you got it 
the book proved to be longer than she had anticipated this is 
the longest book she exclaimed at one point so she deftly 
summarized and improvised to avoid reading page after page 
the children seemed to take her visit in stride when she had 
finished one girl asked her to quiz the audience on what theyd 
just heard 
mrs bush merrily complied asking about the name of the 
protagonist dog and the storys plot as the children chorused the 
answers

a special project she noted that she is also involved in fighting 
illiteracy and said anybody who needs help and i can help them 
im planning to try to help

americans realize how important volunteers are what a job they do 
and how really important it is to help people who need a little

the opposition accused the government 
of a coverup after prosecutors issued a report tuesday that did not 
link former president chun doohwan to corruption and power abuse 
in the southern city of kwangju dozens of students demanding 
punishment for chun and the withdrawal of american troops threw 
firebombs at a us cultural center for the second time this month 
the three main opposition parties said they will jointly seek to 
appoint a special prosecutor to make a thorough investigation of 
alleged wrongdoing involving chun his family and associates during 
chuns sevenyear rule 
in a report wrapping up nearly a year of investigation the 
prosecution said 47 people have been arrested including 13 members 
of chuns family a former intelligence chief two excabinet 
ministers a governing party lawmaker and a former seoul mayor 
senior prosecutor park chongchul said 20 others have been 
indicted but not detained no dates for trial were given 
those arrested or indicted were charged with embezzlement and 
abuse of authority for personal gain but none was accused of 
raising illegal political funds for chun a major charge raised by 
the opposition 
prosecutor general kim kichoon said the prosecution conducted 
its investigation in a neutral and independent manner 
rep lee sangsoo spokesman for the largest opposition group 
the party for peace and democracy said the report showed the 
prosecution took its cue from president roh taewoo and did not look 
into alleged wrongdoing by chun 
roh who has carried out broad reform and sought to distance 
himself from chun has opposed punishment for the authoritarian 
former president saying it would amount to retaliation 
suh chungwon spokesman for the no 2 opposition group the 
reunification democratic party also accused the government of a 
coverup and called for the appointment of a special prosecutor 
chun 58 who left office last february denied any personal 
corruption but he surrendered 24 million in political funds before 
going into rural exile in november 
radical students and dissidents have demonstrated frequently in 
recent months demanding that chun be punished on charges of 
corruption and human rights violations 
about 50 radical students shouting antichun and antius 
slogans hurled dozens of firebombs at the us cultural center in 
kwangju an opposition stronghold 180 miles southwest of seoul 
the us embassy in seoul reported no casualties or property 
damage local news reports said about 100 south korean riot police 
guarding the center fired tear gas and chased the attackers away in 
a few minutes 
earlier tuesday the us embassy in seoul denied reports it 
decided to close the kwangju center but said it could be shut down 
after more attacks of which there were 26 since 1981 and six last 
year alone 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said the 
united states has been seeking promises from south korean 
authorities that they would provide adequate protection for the 
kwangju center and its staff

the judge in oliver norths irancontra trial 
chose seven people for possible jury duty during tuesdays long 
opening day but said there could be problems with the triability 
of the case because so many potential jurors had seen or read of 
norths testimony in congressional hearings 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said only 16 of the first 
54 prospective jurors indicated on questionnaires that they werent 
exposed to norths congressional appearances in which he supplied 
details about misleading congress and shredding documents the 
former white house aide testified to house and senate investigating 
committees in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity from 
prosecution 
norths lawyers who contend an impartial jury cannot be 
empaneled objected as gesells picked the first seven people for a 
pool from which the jury might eventually be chosen the selection 
process will continue wednesday 
defense lawyers also filed a motion asking that in the event a 
jury can be empaneled it should be sequestered immediately to 
minimize the potential for exposure to immunized testimony and to 
protect lt col norths constitutional rights 
one of those in the pool of prospective jurors a retired postal 
clerk said she paid as much attention to norths televised 
testimony as she paid to the three stooges she said her house 
had burned down and she was occupied at the time of norths 
congressional testimony with itemizing household items that had been 
lost in the blaze 
still norths lawyers objected to her selection noting she said 
she turned on a tv set during norths testimony but said in her 
questionnaire she had seen none of the hearings 
another ordered into the jury pool was an unemployed man looking 
for work as a security guard who said he saw north on television 
during the congressional hearings but knew nothing about him 
attorney barry simon objected to the selection saying that if he 
heard even one small portion of norths testimony which he very 
easily could have he should be disqualified 
gesell also heard arguments on how exposure to norths earlier 
testimony should affect qualification or disqualification of other 
potential jurors 
john keker the head of the prosecution team argued that the 
question should be whether a potential juror can be fair and 
impartial not whether the person was exposed to norths testimony 
in that testimony north detailed instances of misleading congress 
and altering and shredding documents as well as other matters for 
which he is now charged with crimes 
north attorney simon said anyone who was exposed to norths 
testimony should be disqualified even if the person remembers 
nothing about it simon said jurors could experience sudden 
recall as the trial progresses and details of the case against 
north are presented and that therefore all the work is for 
naught in attempting to select a fair and impartial jury 
as proceedings began north dressed in a dark suit sat at the 
defense table he had testified to congress in his ribbonbedecked 
marine uniform but has since retired from the service 
norths trial on charges of lying to congress shredding evidence 
and conspiring to commit tax fraud arises following a period of 
fairly intense publicity on television newspapers magazines 
which will continue gesell said 
he quickly excused the first five prospective jurors after all 
said they had been exposed to norths 1987 testimony in which he 
detailed activities in connection with which he is now accused of 
crimes 
norths attorney brendan sullivan also sought to rule out as 
jurors anyone who in recent days had seen norths congressional 
testimony replayed in news reports as the trial start neared 
keker who heads the prosecution team for independent counsel 
lawrence walsh said he wanted to present arguments on the process 
of automatically disqualifying prospective jurors because they 
thought they might have been exposed to norths testimony 
the judge said he wanted to consider how were going to deal 
with this problem this relates to the triability of the case 
gesell wants to find 50 people out of a pool of 300 who have not 
been exposed to the congressional testimony of north or other 
witnesses at the congressional hearings 
indicted last march the retired marine lieutenant colonel and 
decorated vietnam veteran is the first figure in the irancontra 
affair to come to trial 
he could face up to 60 years in prison and 3 million in fines if 
convicted of all 12 crimes with which he is charged 
north is accused of lying to congress about his role in funneling 
money to the nicaraguan contra rebels when congress had banned us 
aid to them he is accused of lying to the attorney general about 
his role in giving the contras millions of dollars in profits from 
the reagan administrations secret arms sales to iran 
he also is accused of shredding national security council records 
and participating in a tax fraud conspiracy in which wealthy donors 
would get tax breaks for contributions to the contras 
former national security adviser john poindexter and arms 
suppliers richard secord and albert hakim also face criminal charges 
in the case but are to be tried separately later

bill schreiber wasnt warning motorists about 
just any chuckhole in the street outside his office 
to prove it he and others stood in the downtown street lowering 
a 10foot pole completely into the opening as startled motorists 
veered away 
city workers barricaded three of four lanes of boulder avenue 
south of downtown tuesday morning after officials were informed of 
the two manholesized holes that opened into a cavern big enough for 
a car 
a storm sewer cavein apparently was to blame officials said 
schreiber a systems analyst at midcontinent casualty co said 
he saw a car hit one of the holes monday evening 
he then walked into the street to divert traffic at times 
lowering his briefcase into one of the holes to demonstrate its 
wheeldamaging potential 
someone else found a 10footlong pipe to illustrate the problem 
for motorists 
that was kind of fun schreiber said wed hold the pipe up 
standing on the pavement and then drop it when it all disappeared

in the battle to sell military hardware 
a small texas company is about to fire a most unusual shot an ad 
that features a whiff of war 
bei defense systems is promoting its extraordinarily lethal 
flechette rockets with scratchandsniff advertisements in trade 
publications 
the ads emblazoned with the slogan the smell of victory 
release the smell of cordite the aroma that follows a rocket 
explosion 
george coutoumanos director of us government programs for bei 
came up with the idea in an effort to draw attention to his firm 
which is small by defense industry standards last year the rocket 
and electronics manufacturer handled about 47 million in defense 
contracts 
coutoumanos said he believes the ads to be reproduced next 
month will be a first among defense contractors although perfume 
manufacturers make regular use of such ads 
my advertising usually gets lost in magazines coutoumanos 
said i usually get buried by the big guys the boeings and the 
general dynamics whos going to read my ad when they can look at a 
beautiful f16 going over the countryside 
coutoumanos said defense advertising is a tough line to develop 
because everything tends to look the same he says posing pretty 
women alongside sleek rockets doesnt impress those looking to buy 
military hardware 
specifically coutoumanos is trying to persuade us military 
buyers and other defense hardware shoppers that his 400800 
rockets are a better value than other more highprofile missiles 
such as the stingers 
id really like to hire a major star and get them to sing and 
dance but it doesnt work that way coutoumanos said and 
shooting off rockets on television isnt really appropriate i 
think 
coutoumanos said the ad will appear first in the feb 1 
international editions of the armed forces journal then later run 
in janes monthly magazine in time for the paris air show 
next year im going to do the sound of victory youre going 
to run your thumbnail across some kind of strip and you will hear 
the explosions

critic says hes seen tower inebriated with other women 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a conservative activist testified tuesday he 
has on a number of occasions seen defense secretarydesignate 
john tower publicly inebriated and in the company of women other 
than his wife 
but members of the senate armed services committee said after a 
closed session with the witness that he failed to provide specifics 
to support his allegation 
i have made enough personal observations of this man here in 
washington to have serious reservations about his moral character 
paul weyrich told the senate panel which is conducting towers 
confirmation hearing 
weyrichs comments prompted quick criticism from sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo who complained about innuendos and 
insinuations against the former texas senator 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman suggested any further 
discussion of towers personal fitness take place in a previously 
scheduled afternoon session that was closed to the public 
senators emerging from that session sounded unimpressed 
a number of allegations prove to be wrong said nunn who 
added that the committee is continuing to pursue all allegations 
i heard nothing that you didnt hear in the open session i 
didnt hear anything persuasive to me wallop said 
sen alan dixon dill said as an old trial lawyer i would 
have to say that most of what i heard has to fall into the hearsay 
category even given the high motives of the witness 
weyrich was unclear if tower was married on the occasions he saw 
him according to dixon 
beyond statements of seeing senator tower on a couple of 
occasions carrying a little more alcohol than he should have he 
hasnt been able to add anything specific that wasnt hearsay 
said sen pete wilson rcalif 
tower refused to comment on the allegations or executive session 
as he left the committee office 
the committee has been expected to approve tower to head the 
defense department and there was no immediate indication that 
weyrichs remarks would change that 
a closed session is scheduled wednesday morning followed by an 
open session on conflict of interest nunn said asked if the 
committees work would be completed nunn responded i hope so 
the committee chairman said he was unsure if they would vote this 
week on the nomination sen james exon dneb said he expected a 
vote next week 
tower was not present when weyrich took the witness chair and 
uttered in public the allegations that had simmered for several 
weeks while president bush was deciding on a candidate to head the 
pentagon 
over many years i have encountered the nominee in a condition 
lacking sobriety as well as with women to whom he was not married i 
recognize senators wives because i worked here in the senate for 
many years weyrich said 
i did encounter this on a number of occasions 
other witnesses also spoke out against the nominee questioning 
towers support for the star wars defense proposal and his ability 
to institute pentagon reforms in light of his past ties to defense 
contractors 
but it was weyrich head of the free congress foundation and a 
longtime proponent for the most conservative of republican causes 
who got the most attention 
he contended that bushs transition team received hundreds of 
letters criticizing tower some containing specific allegations of 
moral impropriety against the nominee but did not bring the letters 
to the presidents attention but weyrich said he never saw the 
letters 
tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before 
his nomination was announced in divorce papers filed by his second 
wife lilla burt cummings tower was accused of marital 
misconduct 
bush has defended tower saying an fbi background check found 
nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary 
when he announced the nomination he dismissed a lot of rumors that 
proved to be groundless 
tower a 63yearold texas republican served 24 years in the 
senate including a tenure as chairman of the armed services 
committee from 198184 
weyrich also criticized towers record on the strategic defense 
initiative saying that the nominee sees star wars as a bargaining 
chip for negotiations 
tower said last week he does not believe that we can devise an 
umbrella that can protect the entire american population from 
nuclear incineration i think thats unrealistic he said a more 
limited system might work but cautioned that it remains to be seen 
whether that is a realistic objective 
william g phillips president of the national council for 
industrial defense questioned towers commitment to pentagon reform 
in the wake of last years pentagon procurement scandal and the 
former senators ties to defense contractors 
his confirmation would signal to the defense contractor 
community that they have little to fear from any meaningful reform 
of defense procurement procedures phillips said 
it would signal that the revolving door of pentagondefense 
contractors relationships was still in vogue he said 
tower said last week in two days of testimony that he received 
fees of more than 1 million for consulting work for seven defense 
contractors including such industry giants as rockwell and 
martinmarietta 
he promised to implement reform recommendations of a presidential 
commission and the goldwaternichols act 
william e jackson jr senior fellow at the fulbright institute 
of international relations at the university of arkansas accused 
tower of stonewalling pentagon reforms and said the former senator 
never met a weapons systems he didnt like 
i do not see the need for someone associated with a fire hose 
approach to the defense budget and someone who is mired in the 
revolving door culture jackson said

the senate voted unanimous approval tuesday 
evening of samuel k skinner as president bushs transportation 
secretary 
skinner whose confirmation came only hours after a senate 
committee swiftly approved the nomination said i will work hard 
to make all modes of transportation safer more efficient and less 
expensive for the american consumer 
he also pledged to work with congress the public transportation 
industries and all interested groups to develop a new national 
transportation policy for the 1990s and beyond 
both democrats and republicans on the commerce science and 
transportation committee praised skinner as an excellent nominee 
the panel took less than five seconds to give unanimous voicevote 
approval to the former federal prosecutor who flies airplanes and 
has been running the nations secondlargest transit system in 
northern illinois 
sen jay rockefeller dwva praised all of bushs cabinet 
selections saying he was deeply impressed by the openness 
integrity and the smarts of both skinner and robert mosbacher 
whose nomination as commerce secretary also was approved by the 
committee 
on one controversial issue in written response to a committee 
question submitted after last weeks hearing skinner said he would 
review the mileage standards required of automakers for 1990 
unless the national highway traffic safety administration acts 
the standard would increase from 265 miles per gallon for 1989 to 
275 for 1990 the auto industry opposes the tougher standard set 
under a federal fuel conservation law 
skinner 50 also promised during his confirmation hearing to 
support mandatory drug testing for transportation workers in 
safetyrelated jobs to combat air terrorism and to push for 
fairness to us airlines abroad even if it means putting him at 
odds with the state department 
he said he would work to build up the coast guard and the 
maritime industry 
skinner nicknamed sam the hammer gained a reputation for 
toughness as he headed up a special investigative team that 
successfully prosecuted former illinois gov otto kerner for bribery 
in 1973 
his nomination faced no opposition after the committee cleared 
away a brief controversy over skinners failure as us attorney to 
prosecute a major drug manufacturer 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio had questioned skinners failure 
to prosecute gd searle co on allegations that it falsified test 
results on its nutrasweet artificial sweetener 
metzenbaum withdrew his objections after talking with skinner 
however and announced his support for the nomination skinner told 
the committee the decision not to prosecute was made by his 
successor but he acknowledged making minor mistakes as he recused 
himself from the case and joined the law firm that had represented 
searle 
metzenbaum and other committee members said they were convinced 
skinner had acted honorably and honestly in the matter 
skinner has been a close associate of illinois gov james r 
thompson and headed bushs 1980 and 1988 presidential campaigns in 
illinois

a koreanamerican businessman charged with 
trying to export nerve gas also held classified documents revealing 
the united states capability to intercept enemy communications the 
government disclosed tuesday 
papers filed in us district court by prosecutors fighting the 
release of juhwan yun on 2 million bail gave new details on the 
documents which assistant us attorney anne singer earlier said 
were found on a desk at yuns importexport business 
revelation of the information would not only compromise 
specifics of our ew electronic warfare capabilities but would also 
reveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat said a memorandum 
written by navy capt m oetinger vice director of the pentagons 
joint electronic warfare center to the us customs service 
yun was arrested jan 12 by us customs agents when he arrived 
for a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an arms 
dealer 
after a hearing monday us district judge h lee sarokin 
ordered yun released saying the government failed to demonstrate 
that yun was a risk to flee but he stayed his order to give the 
government time to appeal the decision 
after the government filed the new information tuesday sarokin 
refused in a late afternoon court hearing to reconsider his 
decision but again stayed the order until 330 pm wednesday to 
give the government time to take the matter to the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals 
ms singer has argued that yun apparently had contacts with 
several foreign governments which would prefer he not stand trial 
in the case 
the government previously has said yun may have had contacts at 
us military installations the documents filed tuesday reveal that 
those contacts may have been at us bases in other countries 
pentagon spokesman lt col arnie williams said he had reviewed 
the government disclosures but declined comment 
the new information filed alleges that koreanlanguage documents 
marked secret and found in yuns office show how much is known 
about an unidentified enemys electronic signals and gives details 
of specialized warfare systems expected for use in the years 1992 
and beyond 
the governments new filings do not say if the documents were 
from the south korean government or if the enemy mentioned was north 
korea 
the koreanlanguage documents also discussed electronic 
countermeasures the jamming of enemy signals and the deposition 
numbers and locations of enemy forces according to the court papers 
yun is charged along with a briton for allegedly plotting to buy 
the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for export 
authorities have said the nerve gass possible destination was iran 
richard cimusz an fbi counterintelligence agent said in a new 
affidavit filed tuesday that yun had been investigated previously 
for allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment including 
nightvision equipment fighter planes and tank parts 
the government has said yun boasted of highlevel military and 
civilian contacts with yugoslavia the peoples republic of china 
and south korea 
cimusz said that yun has had contact with officials of two 
different countries that are of counterintellgnece interest to the 
fbi and that he had official documents from a third country of 
counterintelligence interest to the fbi

authorities say they smashed a drug and 
weapons operation by the sicilian mafia and rightwing extremists 
that included plans to sell french warplanes to guineabissau in 
west africa 
newspapers said tuesday at least 48 people had been arrested 
at a news conference monday authorities said 72 arrest warrants 
were issued on charges of criminal association and trafficking in 
arms and drugs for suspects in italy and abroad including the 
united states and switzerland names of suspects living outside 
italy were not disclosed 
la stampa a turin daily said the investigation also extended to 
argentina brazil canada chile and nigeria 
judge alba dova issued the warrants in massa carrara a tuscan 
coastal city where the investigation was coordinated for more than a 
year 
dova said the link between the mafia and rightwing terrorists 
leads one to think of the existence of an international extremist 
right wing political organization that finances itself through 
illegal financial operations and ties with organized crime 
much of the illegal traffic was said to have been arranged 
through two italian importexport companies 
other illegal activities included trafficking in stolen art cars 
and foreign currency some of the money was allegedly recycled 
through coded swiss bank accounts 
a key figure in the warrants is marco affatigato a reputed 
leader of nuova ordine new order which is accused of several 
terrorist attacks in italy in the 1970s and early 1980s 
affatigato is believed to be in france whether he had been 
arrested was not known 
among mafia suspects caught in raids monday were members of the 
corleone family considered sicilys most powerful mafia clan and 
of the minore family from trapani a port in western sicily linked 
to clandestine drug and arms shipments 
the man thought to be the corleone cashier michele cillari 
was among betterknown figures arrested 
judge dova said the investigation stemmed from the discovery of 
arms and drugs in 1987 on a lebanese ship off italys adriatic 
coast the ship from beirut carried heroin hashish an antitank 
bazooka soviet grenadelauncher and other arms authorities said 
police initially linked the shipment to alleged smuggling of arms 
between italy and the middle east including clandestine delivery of 
mines to iran several italian industrialists and arms manufacturers 
were arrested but they were freed later and the charges dropped 
on monday officials said documents seized in connection with the 
ship including false certificates of a dummy canadian credit 
bank of detroit put them on the trail of the mafiaterrorist 
operation 
the gang allegedly plotted to deliver french mirage jets to 
guineabissau acting as middlemen in return for kickbacks 
an italian representative of the african country and an official 
of the french manufacturer dassaultbreguet identified only as mr 
covanschi also were said to be involved whether planes were 
delivered was not clear

somali prime minister mohamed ali samater said 
tuesday his government has taken a series of steps designed to 
achieve peace and prosperity internally and to improve relations 
with its neighbors 
samater spoke in an interview at the outset of a visit partly 
aimed at refuting allegations that somalia has engaged in widespread 
human rights abuses while attempting to put down an insurrection in 
the northern part of the country 
the united states has imposed sharp cutbacks in aid to somalia as 
has the united nations and great britain an australianbased aid 
agency pulled out of somalia three weeks ago citing political 
repression 
but samater said our position is that we have not committed 
human rights abuses 
samaters visit is part of a diplomatic offensive the somali 
government has initiated in an effort to bolser its international 
image he will meet with assistant secretary of state chester 
crocker on wednesday and also plans consultations on capitol hill 
as evidence of somalias new approach samatar said all political 
prisoners numbering between 200 and 250 are being released and 
that steps have been taken to ensure that persons detained on 
suspicion of criminal conduct have a prompt judicial proceeding 
he also said that state controls over the economy are being eased 
in order to revitalize the countrys productive capacity in 
addition he said the government is willing to move toward a 
political settlement with the northernbased insurgency 
somalia has enjoyed close political and military ties with the 
united states for years but many in congress were appalled last year 
over a reported dramatic increase in human rights abuses under 
congressional pressure the administration placed a hold on about 
55 million in economic assistance 
holly burkhalter who monitors the rights situation in somalia in 
her role as associate director of human rights watch a private 
group disputed samatars account about the situation in somalia 
its very very serious indeed she said the fact that 
nearly half a million somalians left their country for the dubious 
privilege of refuge in ethiopia says more than anything else about 
human rights conditions in somalia 
in addition the united nations last month decided to withhold 
food aid from an estimated 400000 ethiopian refugees in somalia 
contending that somalian authorities were using the ethiopians for 
military activities a us official said the un finding had been 
corroborated in interviews with eyewitnesses 
but samatar said the uns own figures show that 77 per cent of 
the ethiopian refugees are women or children and that the rest are 
too aged to fight 
only a small percentage is able bodied he said

the londonbased amnesty international which monitors human 
rights on monday called for international efforts to pressure iran

the occasion of the birthday of fatima zahra the daughter and only 
child of prophet mohammed the founder of islam

mohammad hashemi on sunday demanding that those responsible for 
airing saturdays episode of a daily program called family be 
sacked and punished

adminstrative body of the radio and television will be severely 
punished

president richard l trumka had harsh words for pittston management 
and said he was not overly optimistic an agreement would be 
reached in the next 30 to 60 days the extension period requested by 
the governors of virginia west virginia and kentucky 
trumka accused pittston officials of failing to bargain seriously 
and of trying to break the union 
pittston thanked the union for its action and meeting a 
longstanding umw request said its chief executive officer paul 
douglas would accept trumkas invitation for a facetoface 
meeting umw officials have sought the meeting because they contend 
company negotiators do not have the power to make concessions 
pittston coal group president michael odom suggested the two 
sides ask the federal mediation and conciliation service to 
intervene in the talks and promised the company would exert every 
effort to assure that the time during the cooling off period is 
utilized effectively to achieve a settlement 
govs gaston caperton of west virginia and wallace wilkinson of 
kentucky hailed the decision to postpone a strike and urged both 
sides to reach agreement on a contract virginia gov gerald 
baliles through a spokeswoman expressed similar sentiments 
trumka said crestars decision to give pittston a loan in 
december 1987 amounted to helping the company build a strike fund 
the unions contract expired less than two months later and the 
miners have been working without a contract since then 
union action against the bank trumka said began with the 
withdrawal of 297 million 23 million by the bakery and 
confectionary union and industry international pension fund and 67 
million by the umw 
crestar spokesman neil cotiaux said the bank regretted the union 
action and considered it to be unfair crestar has no dispute with 
union or its members cotiaux said in a statement our 
participation in the credit arrangement with pittston is an 
extension of previous credit arrangements 
pittston coal group based in lebanon va is a subsidiary of 
the pittston co of greenwich conn pittson last february refused 
to sign a wage agreement the miners union negotiated with other 
major eastern coal producers 
over the past week the company has been considering a union 
offer made a week ago in response to an offer pittston made in 
november pension and health benefits are the major sticking points 
in the talks union officials said 
pittston has said it planned to operate its mines in the event of 
the strike and possibly would hire permanent replacements

an argentine ship which ran aground off the 
antarctic peninsula has floated free and a leak of diesel fuel that 
was threatening penguins and other wildlife has stopped national 
science foundation spokesman jack renerie said tuesday 
but the ship from which all passengers and crew members have 
been evacuated is in danger of sinking 
renerie said the vessel is taking on water is down at the stern 
where water is up to the first deck and is heeled over 25 degrees 
two argentine vessels were headed to the vessel to try to pump 
the remaining fuel from the ship and salvage it if possible but it 
remained in danger of sinking and had drifted against a nearby 
island he said 
in argentina the government news agency telam reported that the 
ship the bahia paraiso would probably be towed to rio gallegos 
argentina to be repaired 
telam quoted argentine navy sources as saying the fuel it 
carried both for itself and the antarctic stations was in steel 
drums so a spill is practically impossible 
the ship a 400footlong doublehulled vessel ran aground 
saturday about two miles from palmer station a us research 
facility which is located about 600 miles south of cape horn the 
tip of south america 
the 316 people aboard including 82 passengers and 234 crew 
members were rescued by power boats and taken to palmer station 
the passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the 
south shetland islands from which they were airlifted to the south 
american mainland sunday but 104 crewmen remain at the station 
said renerie 
because the station is equipped for only 40 people food has been 
rationed to two meals a day said a nsf statement 
the crewmen will remain until the two argentine salvage vessels 
are expected arrive thursday or friday the statement said 
the ship sustained a 35footlong gash in its hull and some of 
the 250000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking washing ashore 
near palmer station 
the fuel killed some krill a tiny shrimplike creature that is a 
vital part of the antarctic food chain and has affected penguins 
sea gulls and giant petrel birds the statement said 
there were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the 
wildlife in the pristine surroundings 
scientists are concerned that some research search projects may 
already have been affected by the leak the nsf statement said 
the ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel gasoline and 
canisters of compressed gases to the argentine esperanza station 
near the tip of the antarctic peninsula it said

a jury at the old bailey criminal court will decide 
whether earrings made of human fetuses are art or obscenity 
exhibit one in a glass case is a mannequins head with a black 
curly wig a scarf and a pair of human fetuses of three to four 
months gestation and freezedried attached to its ears 
police seized the head dec 1 1987 opening day of an exhibition 
of 40 items at the young unknowns art gallery in waterloo south 
london the show was called in animal 
canadian sculptor richard gibson 36 the creator and gallery 
owner peter sylveire 43 were charged with outraging public decency 
and causing a nuisance 
they pleaded innocent and this week a jury of 10 women and two 
men began listening to lawyers argue whether the work is art or 
outrage 
geoffrey robertson who represents sylveire and sees the case as 
an important test of obscenity laws said in court monday one 
purpose of art is to shock and jolt the public from its 
complacency 
he said the fetal sculpture could be seen as demonstrating that 
women wear abortions as lightly as they wear their earrings 
prosecutor michael worsley said tuesday the issue was not 
artistic merit or lack of it but whether the earrings would shock 
disgust or revolt a decent member of the public 
he declared the fetuses which were obtained from a pathology 
lecturer to be an outrage to public decency 
sylveire was said to have told a journalist at the gallery he did 
not think the earrings were any more immoral than sculptors using 
human hair 
gibson said he found the police reaction over the top too 
extreme 
worsley told the jury gibson saw nothing wrong with his work 
but said that some people might have a moral objection to it 
britain legalized abortion in 1967 and the law allows abortions 
up to the 28th week of pregnancy

the bush administration has told congress it 
may seek permission to sell more than 100 fa18 fighter jets to 
saudi arabia if the saudis want the planes sources said tuesday 
the possibility was raised in a cover letter to a classified list 
of proposed foreign arms sales submitted to the senate foreign 
relations committee last month 
the annual list details possible us arms sales for each 
largescale sale capitol hill must be notified and congress then 
has 60 days to block the deal 
the letter left open the possibility the administration will 
notify congress during the coming year of its intent to sell saudi 
arabia the f18s but the letter doesnt commit the united states to 
such a sale 
the list was compiled by the reagan white house and could be 
changed by the new administration 
the list includes the sale to saudi arabia of m1a tanks and 
multiple rocket launchers most of those items are not expected to 
be controversial said the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
saudi arabia has told the united states it is still shopping 
around europe for alternatives to the f18 such as the french 
mirage 2000 or a fighter jet produced by a joint britishfrench 
venture the sources said 
the saudi decision may only come next year once all the european 
models are available they said the saudis are not in a rush to 
make the decision because the new jets are designed as replacement 
for its current us fleet of f5s and f15s which is good at least 
until 1995 
while the europeans are offering the saudis better financial 
terms than the united states the saudis are still attracted by the 
quality of us aircraft which have been the mainstay of their 
arsenal and the pilot training program offered by the united 
states the sources said 
the saudis are also seeking to avoid an embarrassing fight with 
congress over such a sale which many on capitol hill oppose 
sen dennis deconcini dariz last month put the administration 
on notice he would try to block an f18 sale on the grounds it 
endangers israel the two nations are technically still in a state 
of war 
the reagan and bush administrations have both argued that 
persistent congressional rejections of such aircraft sales have 
driven the saudis to look elsewhere at the expense of us 
businesses and foreign policy interests

democrat bernard aronson has been chosen by 
secretary of state james a baker iii for the key post of assistnat 
secretary for interamerican affairs congressional sources said 
tuesday 
a democratic senate source who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said aronson was picked because he is a moderate who can 
appeal to both democrats and republicans on divisive central 
american policies particularly nicaragua 
but the appointment may provoke controversy among some 
congressional liberals because aronson once helped lobby congress on 
behalf of a military aid package for the contra rebels fighting 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
i think its more than just a trial balloon said sen nancy 
kassebaum rkan a member of the senate foreign relations 
committee 
aronson emerged from a group that included at least two other 
contenders to succeed elliott abrams in the job abrams became the 
lightning rod for the reagan admistrations nicaragua policy the 
longestrunning dispute with congress of reagans presidency 
baker had reportedly also been considering robert c helander a 
new york attorney and deane r hinton us ambassador to costa 
rica but both were objectionable to conservatives who saw them as 
not sufficiently devoted to the contras 
aronson had met in recent days with both house speaker jim 
wright dtexas and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine and paid courtesy calls to other congressional leaders on 
tuesday 
aronson a former speechwriter for walter f mondale now is a 
member of a council on foreign relations study group on central 
america 
when the reagan administration was trying to sell a contra aid 
package on capitol hill in 1986 aronson joined a group of other 
liberals to help and wrote a speech for reagan that admitted contra 
human rights violations and sought to condition military aid for the 
rebels on improving their human rights record 
im cautiously optimistic that well be able to work 
together said rep david bonior dmich who visited with 
aronson and said the appointee spoke in support of the regional 
peace plan drawn up by costa rican president oscar arias

archbishop desmond tutu offered a public vote 
of confidence tuesday for james a baker iii saying the new 
secretary of state is open to new ideas and not dogmatic in 
discussions with church leaders pressing for sanctions against the 
whiteruled government of south africa 
i dont want to be euphoric but we certainly have been 
impressed said the nobel peace prize winner who flew to 
washington for the earlyevening meeting between baker and a 
delegation sponsored by the world council of churches 
tutu said baker made no promises but indicated the new 
administration is reviewing its policy toward south africa 
asked to compare his first meeting with baker and past sessions 
with former secretary of state george shultz tutu said 
i was very impressed by the fact that he was not dogmatic he 
actually was discussing with the group and was interested in any 
initiative that the united states might actively take to pressure 
the south african government to the negotiating table 
they are involved in a review process he did not dismiss 
us he listened to us with very considerable interest tutu said 
after the halfhour session at the state department 
tutu joined a delegation that has been on a threeweek tour of 
the united states several west european capitals and japan to 
convince government officials to take a stronger stand against south 
africa and its policy of apartheid 
the archbishop said the delegation asked baker to consider the 
imposition of more economic sanctions against south africa as a 
means of pressuring the whiterule government to abolish apartheid 
tutu stressed however the real appeal to baker was made as an 
appeal against racial injustice 
more than anything else the call of the delegation was that 
the united states had to take a moral leadership in what is a moral 
issue facing the world tutu said 
in 1986 congress imposed sanctions against south africa despite 
a veto by thenpresident reagan putting in place a ban on new loans 
and investments a prohibition of the importation of south african 
coal and other materials and halting direct ussouth african air

jerusalem and decided that their consulate in paris would issue a 
tourist visa for kogan a standard procedure for every jew who asks 
to immigrate to israel 
immediately afterwards officials of the jewish agency ordered a 
plane ticket for kogan again a customary procedure regarding a jew 
who cannot fund a ticket the television said 
there was no immediate response from the soviet union which cut 
diplomatic ties with israel following the 1967 middle east war 
israel has demanded the right of free emigration for every jew 
wishing to live in the jewish state

the soviet embassy on tuesday denied 
allegations by swedens naval chief that soviet submarines continue 
to intrude into swedish waters 
embassy spokesman anatoly novikov was quoted by swedish radio as 
saying soviet captains have been ordered not to come any closer to 
swedish territorial waters than 30 kilometers about 19 miles 
sweden says it has evidence of about 40 violations of its waters 
a year but efforts to catch an intruder or force a sub to the 
surface have failed 
admiral bengt schuback charged monday that soviet submarines from 
secret baltic bases keep violating swedish waters 
they cant come from anywhere but hidden bases in the baltic 
and we know western countries have no such bases he said at a 
military seminar 
but his superior torsten engberg chief of the defense staff 
told the seminar that there is not enough evidence to identify any 
nationality 
last week the navy said it had indications that a submarine 
had penetrated waters outside stockholm indications usually 
refer to tracks on the seabed left by minisubs sightings of a 
periscope by fishermen or sonar signals 
sweden has not officially accused any nation of violations since 
1983 when the government protested soviet incursions to moscow two 
years earlier a soviet submarine ran aground a naval base in 
southern sweden

minor

witnesses said a daughter of actor john 
wayne is a loving but emotionally immature parent so a judge plans 
to award custody of the late actors 1yearold granddaughter to the 
girls father 
orange county superior court judge ronald e owen announced his 
tentative ruling in a memorandum issued monday 
owen said aissa wayne 32 is unfit for custody of anastasia 
wayne 
the various mentalhealth professionals that testified seemed 
to have one common thread running through their testimony owen 
said in his ruling that is that the mother although loving 
lacks familiarity with the child is emotionally immature and lacks 
direction herself 
the judge said he would grant custody of anastasia to dr thomas 
a gionis a pomona orthopedic surgeon while allowing ms wayne to 
visit every other weekend beginning feb 10 
ive spoken to aissa several times already gionis said 
im sure we will always remain close for the mutual benefit of the 
child 
ms wayne shares custody of two children by a previous marriage 
gionis attorney george l stephan called private 
investigators psychologists and family counselors to testify during 
a lengthy hearing to show that ms wayne spent little time with 
anastasia when the girl was home for visits often leaving the child 
to the care of housekeepers 
in an unrelated development the spacious newport beach estate 
where ms wayne and a friend financier roger luby 52 were bound 
and pistol whipped by two intruders last october has been put on the 
auction block to pay off the mortgage the attackers were never 
caught 
the minimum bid on lubys 7000squarefoot sixbedroom house 
must be nearly 12 million cash in order to pay off the mortgage

the government tuesday proposed the biggest shakeup 
in britains free health system boosting private health insurance 
and allowing big hospitals to charge fees 
prime minister margaret thatcher in a statement introducing a 
government policy document called the plan the most farreaching 
reform of the national health service in its 40year history 
the opposition labor party which introduced free health care 
after world war ii accused her conservative government of setting 
out to wreck the system 
the changes will be drafted later as a parliamentary bill that is 
assured of passage by the conservativedominated parliament they 
are expected to be in operation within the next three years 
the plan was seen by some as an attempt to borrow from the 
american health system with its emphasis on private care without 
increasing spending 
in other words excellent care eventually for perhaps as much 
as threetenths of the population but deteriorating health care for 
the remainder said dr david owen a physician who leads the 
centrist social democratic party 
government officials said the reforms would streamline the health 
bureaucracy and give the public wider choice while denying no one 
access to free treatment 
it was a change of pace rather than a change of direction 
said health secretary kenneth clarke 
the national health service is and must remain open to all 
regardless of income financed mainly out of general taxation he 
told the house of commons 
under the plan the 320 biggest and most sophisticated of the 
2000 staterun hospitals in britain can become selfgoverning in 
1991 taking feepaying private patients and billing local 
authorities for the others 
breaking another postwar tradition the selfgoverning hospitals 
will charge patients for extras such as choice of meals private 
telephones or television 
for the first time too private health insurance for the 
elderly who are the biggest burden on the state system will be 
taxdeductible allowing the staterun hospitals to take in 
feepaying patients also will have the effect of boosting private 
health insurance 
selfgoverning hospitals will be able to attract higher quality 
staff from consultants to cleaners by setting their own pay scales 
other changes planned over three years include fining general 
practitioners who resort too readily to prescibing medicines 
family doctors with big practices will get separate state budgets 
to buy drugs and hospital treatment from private state or 
selfgoverning hospitals for elective surgery they will be allowed 
to keep half of any savings on the drugs budget 
consultants and general practitioners will have their costs 
independently audited and like hospitals will be encouraged to 
compete for patients 
labors parliamentary spokesman on health robin cook said the 
plan was the work of people who will always put a healthy balance 
sheet before healthy patients 
leftwing health workers unions were outraged 
rodney bickerstaffe leader of the biggest health union the 
national union of public service employees described the proposals 
as a cynical charter to replace the nhs with a commercial 
circus 
treatment will be pricetagged leaving the poor the 
chronically sick and the elderly out in the cold sick people will 
be shunted round the country in a scramble for the cheapest care 
said bickerstaffe 
the national health service which with a staff of 1 million is 
second only to the soviet army as the biggest employer in europe 
has been a major frustration for mrs thatcher since she won power 
in 1979 
mrs thatcher insists on her right to private health treatment 
at the time i want and with the doctor i want she argues it is 
pointless to throw more money at the national health service without 
increasing its efficiency 
the service used by 90 percent of the population is popular 
with voters and mrs thatcher has held back from exposing it to her 
strategy of rolling back the frontiers of socialism 
instead spending has increased in real terms by nearly onethird 
since 1979 to 387 billion a year 
but the enduring public image is of a system subjected to budget 
cuts by the thatcher administration in which children die waiting 
for heart surgery 
waiting lists persist partly because demand is limitless and 
treatment evermore expensive and sophisticated britain spends 6 
percent of gross national product on health compared with an 
average of 9 percent in other industrialized countries 
the service is funded out of general taxes and a compulsory 10 
percent deduction for health and state pension contributions from 
each employees salary which employers have to match

a lawyer for convicted child killer joel 
steinberg said tuesday he will appeal his clients firstdegree 
manslaughter conviction on the ground the judge allowed evidence 
that inflamed and prejudiced the jury 
attorney ira london said state supreme court justice harold 
rothwax prejudiced the case by letting the jury see a videotape of a 
seriously beaten hedda nussbaum the defendants former livein 
companion and by his instructions to the jury on intent 
the lawyer objected to rothwaxs statement at a pretrial bail 
application that seconddegree murder defendant steinberg was 
probably guilty probably would be found guilty and probably would 
be sentenced to life in prison 
i think that statement the judge made is something he may 
regret in view of the appellate issues we are going to raise in the 
case and we will include that london said 
steinberg 47 was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter monday 
in the death of lisa the 6 year old he obtained at birth and raised 
but never legally adopted 
the jury found steinberg guilty after eight days of deliberations 
following a 12week trial steinberg faces up to 25 years in prison 
there is no question in my mind from the length of the 
deliberations and from talking to the jurors there is no 
question that joel got a fair shake from the jurors london said 
but it is a serious issue whether joel got a fair trial because of 
the judges rulings 
london said the judge hurt steinberg unfairly when he refused to 
answer no to the jurors question about whether they should 
infer intent on the basis of the victims injuries even though they 
had been unable to find intent 
we felt a simple oneword answer would have answered the 
question the lawyer said he noted that the jury came in a short 
time later 
he chose not to say no and he chose to go into some long 
explanation which later according to what the jury has told us led 
to the conviction on manslaughter in the first degree london said 
and allowing the jury to see the tape of ms nussbaums injuries 
inflicted by steinberg was a prejudice that i dont know any 
criminal defendant could recover from

opposition leaders and businessmen said 
tuesday they were puzzled and dissatisfied with the leftist 
sandinista governments austerity plan for 1989 and will not support 
it 
president daniel ortegas speech outlining the inflationfighting 
plan is rather nebulous said ramiro gurdian president of the 
union of nicaraguan agricultural producers and vice president of the 
nicaraguan democratic coordinate an opposition coalition 
he ortega did not mention he had the backing of the producers 
because he simply doesnt have it gurdian said in an interview 
ortega in a speech before the national assembly on monday 
outlined a 1989 economic plan that includes budget cuts of more than 
40 percent a decrease in capital investments and restricted credit 
the budgetary cuts will mean laying off about 35000 government 
workers ortega was quoted as saying in an interview published 
monday in the venezuelan newspaper el nacional 
the plans aim is to curb rampant inflation which reached 20000 
percent last year and is projected to run at 300 percent a month 
through may 
it also seeks to increase productivity in this central american 
country ortega said exports plummeted from 450 million in 1980 a 
year after the sandinistas took power to 267 million in 1988 
the sandinistas have been meeting with labor groups and 
businessmen to seek their support for the plan which ortega said 
would cause an economic downturn initially 
the measures have an element of a recessive character ortega 
said in his speech this is inevitable although temporary 
the president said idle workers could be absorbed into 
agriculture including 10000 needed in coffee harvesting 
gurdian said the coffee harvest was about to end and doubted an 
office worker could be very effective as a field hand 
maybe they can be employed for a month but when its over 
then what what are you going to do with those people gurdian 
said 
ortega said his government is trying to apply a capitalist 
policy different from the other countries which have been held up to 
us as models but he added that we as sandinistas marxists 
marxistleninists are trying to develop socialism within 
nicaraguas reality as a central american country 
ive been trying to find messages of political economy and i 
must confess that im lost said enrique bolanos a cotton grower 
and former president of the superior council of private enterprise 
hes cutting investments nearly to zero and if theres no 
investment theres no growth if theres no growth there are no 
new jobs bolanos said ortega also said production costs will be 
strictly controlled because they cannot be higher than in the 
central american markets 
gurdian and bolanos blamed high production costs on the state 
which sets the price of raw materials and buys products from growers 
at a set price 
they government tell you heres the raw materials heres 
your tractor and these are going to be your profits gurdian said 
angrily i am not going to work so the state can tell me how much 
im going to earn i work to earn money 
the nicaraguan democratic coordinate includes four political 
parties three labor unions and the superior council of private 
enterprise 
the opposition newspaper la prensa said ortegas speech left 
nicaraguans disillusioned and it called for reforms that would let 
them elect a new government that is more efficient and 
advantageous for the people 
meanwhile venevision a private television station in caracas 
venezuela said ortega has asked venezuela for economic aid 
ortega met with venezuelan presidentelect carlos andres perez 
after his arrival in caracas for perez inauguration scheduled for 
thursday 
venezuela and mexico provide cheap oil to some caribbean and 
central american nations under the san jose accord begun in 1975 by 
perez during his first presidency but since 1982 venezuela stopped 
providing oil to nicaragua because managua did not pay its bills

unionized attendants at a staterun 
hospital temporarily halted their sickout tuesday after they were 
threatened with dismissal and national guard troops were called in 
to feed wash and dress patients 
eighty of the 91 workers scheduled to work the 3 pm shift 
showed up and the guard was sent home said hospital administrator 
james benedict 
the union and the state will negotiate their disputes over 
staffing scheduling and overtime during a twoweek coolingoff 
period said robert k vincent a governors aide who met with union 
officials for 1 hours 
if they cant agree theyll shake hands and agree to disagree 
but theyll address that disagreement through the normal procedure 
of grievances and arbitration vincent said 
union officials were not at the union hall and did not return 
telephone calls seeking comment 
gov edward d diprete called out the guard to fill in for absent 
workers after talks collapsed monday between local 1350 of the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees and 
thomas d romeo director of the state department of mental health 
retardation and hospitals 
vincent said diprete had warned the workers that any who did not 
show up for tuesdays third shift beginning at 11 pm and could 
not prove they were ill would risk being fired 
were kind of out of our element but we seem to be doing ok 
said sgt dean mansfield one of about 60 guardsmen who rolled up 
the sleeves of their fatigues and went to work tuesday morning 
the staterun hospital provides longterm care to 425 patients 
about 75 percent of whom are elderly 
romeo under heavy pressure from diprete to cut overtime costs 
ordered changes in the hospital workschedules that angered the 
union 
the changes will remain in place during the coolingoff period 
vincent said he said the hospitals overtime budget has been 
55000 for each twoweek pay period but actual spending has been 
closer to 95000 the changes are aimed at bringing that figure 
down to 85000 per two weeks vincent said 
eightyfive of the 106 workers scheduled for tuesdays first 
shift reported for work said joan m wilkicki the hospitals 
administrative coordinator 
the absentee rate has varied greatly from shift to shift on 
monday most of the first shift reported for work but well over half 
of the secondshift workers called in sick 
the guard pitched in to perform nonskilled care such as 
feeding washing and dressing patients and changing their linens 
under the direction of medical staff said capt john loughlin ii

the navy on tuesday reversed its 
position and said the tourist boat that sank on new years eve 
killing 55 people was overcrowded and not fit to venture into sea 
waters 
a twoweek examination of the boat which was hauled from the sea 
floor in midjanuary showed the bateau mouche should have carried 
not more than 62 when it capsized and sank with at least 150 
revelers aboard a navy report said 
the report said the popular sightseeing craft was badly 
maintained had a waterline above the basement portholes had a 
secondfloor addition that affected the boats stability and was 
full of loose heavy tables and chairs 
the boat sank while on a midnight excursion to watch fireworks 
off copacabana beach 
days later the navy ministry released a report that declared the 
boat was fit for 153 people and seaworthy according to port 
authority guards 
but the navy and police investigating criminal responsibility in 
the sinking have been under constant pressure from civic groups 
comprised mostly of friends and relatives of victims 
the navy said tuesday it would open an investigation to determine 
why naval engineers approved the boat for large tourist excursions 
the navy said it also would investigate why port authority guards 
allowed the midnight sail despite obvious overcrowding and severe 
rocking of the boat in high waves 
the owners of the boat and the tourist agency that organized the 
excursion were imprisoned briefly last week and released on bail 
police have not yet determined criminal responsibility

the feuding family of braindamaged 
singercomposer barry sadler has agreed to allow a judge to name an 
independent guardian to handle his affairs another judge said 
tuesday evening 
cuyahoga county probate judge john j donnelly said sadlers 
family has gotten together and agreed to let probate court judge 
james everett in nashville tenn name an independent guardian 
under the agreement the guardian must consult with family 
members before making major decisions for sadler said donnelly who 
said relatives indicated a preference for naming as guardian a 
vietnam veteran like sadler 
sadlers mother bebe and son thor 24 had made competing 
appeals to be named guardian for sadler who was interviewed monday 
night by donnelly at southwest general hospital in suburban 
middleburg heights 
the responses were confusing said donnelly sadler 
repeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told the 
correct date the judge said 
sadler 48 could name only two of his three children donnelly 
said 
sadler is best known for his ballad of the green berets 
which was a hit in 1965 he reportedly lost 30 percent of his brain 
when he was wounded by gunfire last fall in guatamala city where he 
had lived for five years 
the nature of the attack has never been disclosed 
a psychiatrist and psychologist both of whom interviewed sadler 
at the hospital testified tuesday at the guardianship hearing and 
were split on whether he was mentally competent 
gintautas z sabataitis a psychologist from parma heights said 
sadler was competent but severely limited in his abilities and 
needed a guardian to look after his affairs 
joel s steinberg a lyndhurst psychiatrist said he had not 
determined whether sadler was competent 
i didnt reach a conclusion about that he said i had to 
leave it in the air 
steinberg said sadler had suffered profound neurological loss 
but said he was surprised by sadlers capacities 
sadlers mother who moved to cleveland from denver to be close 
to her son filed for guardianship after thor sadler was appointed 
guardian for his father by a judge in nashville 
sadler was treated there for two months before coming to the 
cleveland veterans administration hospital nov 8

president bush intends to nominate michael h 
armacost currently under secretary of state for political affairs 
as the new us ambassador to japan a us official said tuesday 
armacost is the highestranking career foregin service officer at 
the state department he succeeds former sen mike mansfield who 
has retired 
armacosts pending nomination was confirmed by us sources who 
declined to named 
he is a former us ambassador to the philippines and is also the 
ranking asian specialist on the national security council staff 
bush is due to visit japan for the feb 24 funeral of emperor 
hirohito us relations with tokyo are at a crucial stage with 
pressure building in congress to have the japanese increase their 
contribution to the countrys defense 
another problem in the relationship is the us trade deficit of 
57 billion caused by an influx of japanese products 
but mansfield announcing his retirement late last year said he 
was leaving with our heads high because the deficit had been 
narrowed as a result of hard bargaining to open japanese markets and 
efforts to get japan to boost its domestic consumption as well as 
imports 
japan is also beset with domestic problems including allegations 
that top politicians or their aides profited from shares in a real 
estate development firm by buying them before the firm was publicly 
traded 
prime minister noboru takeshita will hold talks thursday and 
friday with bush secretary of states james a baker iii and 
congressional leaders 
under former secretary of state george p shultz armacost played 
a key role in dealing with soviet authorities on regional disputes 
in afghanistan southwest africa cambodia and central america 
an imposing 6footer armacost has a quiet demeanor and lowkey 
style 
twenty years ago he served in tokyo as a visiting professor of 
international relations at the international christian university in 
tokyo 
armacost 51 is a graduate of carleton college and columbia 
university he is married and has three children 
he is expected to be succeeded in the job of under secretary of 
state by robert kimmet a washington lawyer bush is breaking 
precedent by not naming a career diplomat to the post but lawrence 
eagleburger another former foreign service officer is to be 
nominated deputy secretary of state 
in another move bush is expected to name richard t mccormack 
former ambassador to the organization of american states to the 
post of under secretary of state for economic affairs 
late tuesday congressional sources said bush is expected to pick 
bernard aronson a democrat as assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs 
a democratic senate source who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said the choice had been made because aronson was a 
moderate who could appeal to both democrats and republicans on 
divisive central american policies and nicaragua in particular 
aronson would succeed elliott abrams in the post abrams became 
the lightning rod for the reagan admistrations nicaragua policy 
which was the longestrunning dispute with congress of his tenure 
meanwhile a white house source said president bush is expected 
to name john negroponte deputy national security adviser as 
ambassador to mexico negroponte a former ambassador to honduras 
also has served in a variety of foreign postings including in hong

abba eban israels former foreign 
minister on tuesday rebutted accusations by a senior plo official 
that the jewish state is using nazi methods to suppress the uprising 
in its occupied territories 
the monday statements by bassam abu sharif a senior aide to 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat were 
intellectually ridiculous and morally outrageous eban told 
reporters 
abu sharif and eban spoke outside a privately sponsored 
conference on the israelipalestinian problem in european 
perspective which involves prominent figures from both israel and 
the plo 
but both mens public addresses to the threeday gathering which 
opened tuesday reflected a far more conciliatory mood and called 
for direct israeliplo talks to end the mideast conflict 
abu sharif told a monday news briefing that even the nazis did 
not dare to implement several of the measures being used by 
israeli troops to stop the 14month uprising in the israelioccupied 
territories 
so far the uprising has cost the lives of at least 370 
palestinians including 47 killed by supposedly nonlethal israeli 
plastic bullets and of 15 israelis 
our people and our organization are suffering under organized 
state terrorism abu sharif said he charged that israel had set 
up concentration camps for palestinians that he compared to nazi 
germanys auschwitz death camp of world war ii 
eban told reporters on tuesday that sort of rhetoric is going 
to be an obstacle to peace it is a stupid thing to say 
but he also noted that i notice that neither he abu sharif 
nor his colleagues used such language in our presence here today 
instead the plo official said in his conference address we 
hope the future developments in the mideast will help to convince

real events are so outrageous these days that it 
sometimes seem satire and parody arent possible then along comes 
the kathy amp mo show parallel lives at the offbroadway 
westside arts theater proving that oblique looks at life can be 
surprising and hilarious 
kathy najimy and mo gaffney write and perform an evening of duet 
vignettes much in the way that lily tomlin has done a series of 
solo character portraits 
the show which opened tuesday night is subtly feminist it 
begins with the two women as angels deciding at the creation how to 
organize the human race they pick skin colors and worry that white 
people may feel inferior they give men egos so they wont feel 
deprived while women bear the children 
we check back with the angels at the start of act 2 about the 
white people kathy says dont ask she reports that the male 
ego thing certainly took off 
the two women are expert at every character they present young 
and old women and men 
sometimes their sketches are deeply felt and poignant one 
concerns the daily meeting in a texas bar of a married drunk who 
keeps proposing and a gallant lonely woman who fears shell never 
get what she needs to make her feel complete because she doesnt 
know what it is 
kathy does one tender solo turn as a woman whose favorite nephew 
admits hes homosexual she gives up her wish for him to have a wife 
and children and decides to remain his doting aunt 
some sketches are holdovers from the further adventures of 
kathy and mo presented at the offbroadway second stage in 1986 
one new one in which kathy dreams of being the perfect wife kenny 
rogers sings about with cuts to mo a prostitute talking to 
herself doesnt quite work and the coda in which many of the 
sketches characters return for an instant is more confusing than 
fun 
but we laughed through almost all the evening especially as the 
elderly madeleine and sylvia shift gears adjusting to a meatless 
fishless healthfood restaurant even donating to its cause save 
the fish 
paul benedict directed kenneth f martel and ellen m krass

the communist party chief said in an 
interview published tuesday that a split in the party leadership is 
slowing reform and indicated highlevel personnel changes are 
possible 
karoly grosz reviewing the first 10 months of his tenure as 
party leader said the leadership is waging a battle within 
ourselves which has slowed its ability to implement reform 
differing views are leading to a deterioration of the partys 
ability to implement reform which could be grounds for personnel 
changes in the party elite he told journalists from the government 
daily magyar hirlap and the communist newspaper nepszabadsag 
if the partys policymaking central committee reaches the 
conclusion that the political committee politburo or the general 
secretary cannot fulfill their tasks in this situation it 
should draw the appropriate conclusions grosz was quoted as 
saying 
a leadership and a leader has to reckon with all this he 
said in excerpts of the interview carried by the state news agency 
mti 
in the same interview grosz appeared to criticize imre pozsgay 
a member of the partys 11member ruling politburo 
pozsgay one of the countrys leading reformers said in a 
weekend radio interview that the 1956 anticommunist revolt was not 
a counterrevolution as officially termed for the past 30 years but 
a popular uprising 
grosz said pozsgays statement based on work by a party 
committee he heads that is reviewing the countrys past 40 year 
history was premature 
but in a television interview broadcast monday evening grosz 
said the central committee could reach the same conclusion as 
pozsgay if the facts justify it 
many of the demands voiced in the shortlived revolution such as 
increased democracy a multiparty system and opposition to a 
staliniststyle leadership are reflected in hungarys reform process

one of two obstacles to lowpower testing of 
the seabrook nuclear power plant was cleared tuesday when a federal 
board decided not to hold hearings on workers performance during an 
emergency exercise 
seabrooks owners now can get their longawaited lowpower 
license if they prove that they can come up with 721 million to 
decontaminate and dismantle the reactor if it conducts the atomic 
tests but never operates commercially 
the 58 billion seabrook reactor was completed in july 1986 
after years of delays and cost overruns it remains idle because of 
evacuationplanning and financial obstacles 
in a dec 21 ruling the nuclear regulatory commission set two 
conditions for lowpower testing establishment of the 
decommissioning fund and a decision by one of its licensing boards 
on whether to open hearings on plant workers performance during the 
twoday exercise in june 
seabrook spokesman sean oneill said tuesday plant owners expect 
to submit a decommissioningfund plan within the next couple of 
weeks john eichorn chairman of the seabrook owners executive 
committee said recently the owners are trying to buy a surety bond 
to meet the 721 million commitment 
on procedural grounds the licensing board tuesday dismissed 
massachusetts attorney general james shannons request for the 
hearings nrc spokesman frank ingram said the plant is near the 
massachusetts border and six massachusetts communities lie within 
the plants 10mile evacuation plan 
shannons request was based on an nrc staff inspection report 
dated july 15 but the request was not filed until sept 16 
the licensing board said shannon waited too long to file the 
request 
a spokeswoman for shannon mary breslauer promised an appeal 
obviously we believe we were well within the legal time frame 
for filing the contention she said what we got from nrc 
inspectors in july was an initial report very undetailed we 
did not get detailed backup reports until midaugust clearly until 
then we couldnt file 
the initial nrc inspection report said seabrook controlroom 
support staff displayed questionable engineering judgment and 
other shortcomings during a hypothetical accident under the exercise 
scenario 
the nrc concluded however that plant workers passed the test 
which was part of a federal exercise of seabrooks evacuation plans 
oneill the seabrook spokesman said plant officials also had 
not yet seen the licensing board ruling but it sounds like good 
news 
licensing delays last year forced the key seabrook owner public 
service company of new hampshire to seek bankruptcy protection and 
other owners finances also have become strained

employers and all but the poorest americans 
would be taxed to finance a national health care system extending 
medical insurance to the estimated 37 million who lack coverage 
under a plan proposed by a commission including three former 
presidents 
the proposal encourages continued reliance on private health 
insurance provided through the workplace but calls for a new 
program to provide universal access to basic medical services costs 
would be spread among employers and all americans above 150 percent 
of poverty level 
the plan offered monday is designed to extend medical coverage to 
all americans stem the growth of medical expenses which now stand 
at 550 billion annually and improve the quality of medical care 
nationwide said the national leadership commission on health care 
which worked 2 years preparing its proposal 
if we continue the present trend the 550 billion will double 
in six years and triple in 12 years said paul g rogers a former 
democratic congressman from florida who cochaired the commission

durn just when you write off the whole danged 
network season cbs comes along with a big ol event a fournight 
masterpiece of a western lonesome dove 
the eighthour miniseries begins sunday and runs through 
wednesday 
readers who loved larry mcmurtrys pulitzer prizewinning novel 
can be assured that austin screenwriter bill witliff has transformed 
it into a film that enlightens rather than obscures the heart of it 
for viewers who havent read the novel the movie stands on its 
own its proof that the miniseries is still a worthwhile genre for 
epics like lonesome dove that cant be contained in a twohour 
film 
the cast is virtually unprecedented for a network movie 
oscarwinners robert duvall tender mercies and anjelica huston 
prizzis honor plus tommy lee jones diane lane db 
sweeney frederic forrest robert urich ricky schroder chris 
cooper glenne headly and william sanderson 
witliff wrote raggedy man and country and cowrote the 
black stallion director simon wincers credits include phar 
lap and the network miniseries bluegrass 
but the miniseries belongs to duvall well the book did belong 
to gus mccrae duvall an actor who becomes his role has found in 
cootphilosopher gus a character who becomes the actor just as much 
jones with his hair dyed white holds his own with duvall no 
mean feat he has perhaps a more difficult role as the simmering 
taciturn call 
gus and call are legendary extexas rangers reduced to running a 
downattheheels cattle outfit along the rio grande just outside a 
wide spot in the road called lonesome dove 
when old companero jake spoon urich shows up after 10 years 
running from a fatal misunderstanding in arkansas hes full of 
tales of a cattlemans paradise in a wilderness called montana 
call without indians and outlaws to keep his mind off the ghosts 
of his past figures an adventure is just what he needs and hes 
soon rounded up 2600 head of mexican cattle and an inexperienced 
bunch of hands and headed off on a 3000mile trail drive 
gus is usually satisfied to sit on the porch avoiding work 
swigging whiskey and expounding loudly on any subject that happens 
to come up but he goes along hoping to see his true love clara 
huston who is married to a horsetrader in nebraska jake trails 
along with lorie lane a young prostitute who believes his promise 
to take her to san francisco 
meanwhile arkansas sheriff july johnson cooper embarks 
reluctantly on a mission to bring jake to justice he is soon 
distracted though by the news that his wife headly has run off 
she too is bound for nebraska and an outlaw she still loves 
along the way the cowboys tangle with sandstorms stampedes 
horse thieves and indians lorie is stolen by blue duck forrest a 
vicious renegade who duels with gus and meets an unusual demise 
witliff did an exceptional job of turning mcmurtrys vivid but 
often introspective 840page book into a film preserving the 
dialogue and improving the ending by a simple rearrangement of minor 
events 
much of the violence and raunchiness of the book remains though 
toned down for network tv when gus is under attack by indians on 
the open plains he stabs his horse to death to use him for cover 
wincer occasionally lapses into unnecessary slomo melodrama but 
only occasionally the action sequences are mostly superb 
set designer cary white has turned the lonesome dove of 
imagination into a reality and douglas milsomes cinematography is 
evocative without being too darned purty 
witliff telescopes many events so the miniseries gets going much 
more quickly than the book by the end of the first night the trail 
drive is under way and the first fatality has occurred at the nueces 
river by then any viewer with a pulse should be hooked 
in exchange for the quicker pace the miniseries shucks some of 
the character development of the book theres no way around that 
unless the network stretched the miniseries into a week after four 
nights viewers might wish that they had

the gunfire comes from a passing car 
exploding just after the shouted gang slogans battle cries on the 
urban killing fields where the medics move in to pick up the pieces 
in the darkness sometimes with the gunmen still looking on from 
the sanctuary of a gathering crowd the paramedics move in 
they ignore red and blue gang colors and tattoos tending wounds 
sometimes reminiscent of war radioing ahead to an emergency room 
already overcrowded with the citys poor there an er doctor will 
treat yet another victim of the violence that claimed 351 lives in 
los angeles county last year 
suburban counties are beginning to mount their own tolls 
for los angeles county fire paramedics like mike siefert and joe 
kinney the victims and shootings blur together only the most brutal 
stand out 
for siefert that was a bloody morning at gage and rugby avenues 
in huntington park a primarily hispanic suburb where downtown 
highrises loom in the distance like mirages of prosperity the 
attack was retaliatory the victim was the mother of a gang member 
shot in the stomach with a shotgun 
they assassinate one another siefert said 
sometimes the killers dont flee forcing paramedics to work 
under the eye of gang toughs who kinney said often walk right back 
up and watch see if they killed them or not sometimes paramedics 
must watch victims bleed waiting until police secure the area 
the los angeles city fire department will not even allow its 
paramedics to be interviewed for fear that the attention will put 
them at risk 
in the heart of the violence is martin luther king jrdrew 
medical center near watts amid neighborhoods claimed by the bloods 
and crips black street gangs 
the most common operation at the hospital is an exploratory 
laparotomy to repair damage from a gunshot wound in 1986 there 
were 754 such operations nearly four times the number of 
appendectomies said dr arthur fleming chairman of surgery 
you give it your 102 percent and you patch them up and you send 
them out to start the vicious cycle all over again said brenda 
allmond the hospitals trauma nurse coordinator 
police chief daryl gates has likened street warfare to conflicts 
in lebanon northern ireland and south africa with attackers here 
favoring uzi submachineguns and ak47 assault rifles those on the 
front line know the references to war are not so farfetched 
the trauma is exactly the same said kinney 
doctors say they see more shotgun and smallcaliber handgun 
wounds than those from uzis but they dont diminish the violence 
theyll say to you if their loved one dies youre going to 
get more business tonight and the retaliation sets in ms 
allmond said 
gang members 10 at a time have stormed emergency room doors at 
king to get to the wounded there were times the gang members 
walked in er and our doctors were shaking in their boots said 
fleming 
the violence did not always rate frontpage headlines and 
topofthehour newscasts but on jan 30 1988 karen toshima a 
27yearold long beach woman who could have been anyone from the 
comfortable suburbs was slain by gang crossfire while strolling 
through westwood the upscale district of shops restaurants and 
theaters near the university of california los angeles 
with that began los angeles 1000officer task force nicknamed 
the hammer which rounded up hundreds of reputed gang toughs 
the socalled gang summits with local ministers that brought a call 
for jobs but no end to the shootings and the city under seige 
news stories 
fleming a former military man says the solution is a job corps 
combining work and discipline for gang members but he believes 
police sweeps have had some success quelling violence 
the day after a weekend sweep that netted 870 arrests we had 
one death in one 17yearold and other than that it was relatively 
quiet the teen who died bore the msc tattoo initials of the main 
street crips he was slain by a bullet that clipped the main vessel 
leading into the bottom of the heart 
hundreds survive the violence some come to rancho los amigos 
medical center in suburban downey for rehabilitation 
in the hallway dr lance stone director of the adult brain 
injury unit passes a zombielike young man who shuffles slowly 
eyes focusing loosely when stone says hello the man was a bystander 
to a gang fight bullet fragments hit him in the arm and head 
leaving him with nerve injury and extreme pain he had been 
attending college now he can write but no longer knows how to read 
stone estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of his patients bear 
gangrelated injuries dr douglas garland director of the spinal 
cord injury unit where the primary cause of injury is gunshot 
wounds puts the number near 35 percent 
these men have seen patients unable to move because of 
gangrelated injuries patients who will need wheelchairs the rest 
of their lives but still retain gang affiliations 
weve had patients who have refused a red or a blue 
wheelchair said county social worker wendy ross 
ms ross one success story is an 18yearold who was shot 
during his gang initiation about two years ago the gang provided 
the target and ms ross believes it was a setup the target was an 
undercover policeman who drew his weapon and shot the boy leaving 
him without the use of his legs the teenager has earned his high 
school diploma moved into his own place and is starting community 
college he wrote to thank ms ross for her friendship and help in 
beginning a life without his legs then added but if that is what 
it cost for me to change my ways and find good friend it worth it 
for others there are few bright spots 
dr joe morales director of emergency admitting at los angeles 
countyusc medical center sees more than a dozen gang victims most 
under the age of 25 come through hospital doors each week 
if theyre 7 or 8 we assume theyre innocent morales said 
otherwise we lose all hope

the setting is peaceful on a lake 
surrounded by douglas firs but peace is far from the minds of the 
war veterans who meet here to unload decades of violent and fearful 
thoughts and feelings 
for many its the first time since the war that theyve felt 
free to cry 
some of these people havent felt in years said anne 
gregory manager of nurses for the posttraumatic stress disorder 
program at the veterans hospital at american lake herself a

the fact that some of these people are still sane is 
remarkable ptsd is treatable but it takes time gregory said 
an estimated 470000 of the 314 million vets who served in 
vietnam suffer from ptsd and 80 percent of those never have sought 
mental help said american lake director ray scurfield his is one 
of 14 relatively new programs in this country trying to help ptsd 
victims three percent of its participants served in korea and world 
war ii the rest in vietnam 
in the company of other vets and a professional staff of 23 that 
includes 13 veterans men who never quite left the war behind tell 
of sleepless nights flashbacks guilt over having killed guilt 
over having survived uncontrolled anxiety and rage and the 
isolation they feel 
holding hands they ride in huey helicopters in maneuvers similar 
to those commonly used in the war the sound of the rotors and rush 
of wind was enough for one to tearfully recall his last flight in a 
huey a trip that ended in an ambush and the deaths of 18 of the 35 
men in his squad 
some go on an outward bound trip and push their limits in rapids 
in search of new perspectives on their abilities and their lives 
many vets are hearing for the first time that its human to feel 
what they feel and that anyone who has experienced severe trauma 
the holocaust for example or even major earthquakes can feel the 
same way 
and its the first time many have let go the birth of a long 
period of healing forgiveness learning to live with memories 
trusting themselves and others and hoping for the future 
theyre digging things out of me here that i didnt even know 
were issues said dan collins 42 of tacoma you look at 
somebody and see them blown to hell and theyre not there 
its a convenient way not to make friends because im afraid 
of them dying i avoid people for that and other reasons 
thats the nice thing about this place they confront you on it 
and you have to face whats going on inside of you 
scurfield said any victim of severe trauma can develop chronic 
symptoms that can include intrusive imagery numbing helplessness 
fear that leads to rage fear that leads to grief anger against 
authority and the system inability to control emotions and 
actions broken relationships and work histories depression 
anxiety hypervigilance and sleeping disorders 
they sometimes express those symptoms and other times avoid 
expression altogether as they probably did at the time the trauma 
took place this leads to physical and emotional isolation and 
confusion over personal responsibility selfworth relationships 
work even play 
the 11week program at american lake begun in 1985 has served 
350 so far and has an eightmonth waiting list applicants must 
have served in a war zone have received some counseling already 
and be drug and alcoholfree it costs the veterans administration 
107 per day per patient 
participants learn about controlling anger anxiety and stress 
and about substance abuse and ptsd they also examine prewar 
experiences that may have contributed to their war reaction 
warzone trauma and their postwar years 
they even look at the benefits of trauma intense comradeship 
emotional and spiritual insights and heightened sensitization to 
lifes horrors and to political behavior scurfield said 
by going back to the wound you finally realize that you have 
to feel the pain the grief the loss before the wound is actually 
healed said leonard horst 42 of sequim youll always have 
the scar but at least you have acceptance and forgiveness 
all are encouraged to attend outpatient counseling for six months 
to three years to consolidate gains made while in the program 
scurfield says failure to do that can easily mean backsliding and 
renewed isolation 
vets listen carefully when scurfield explains how their anger 
probably stems from fear how they had to go to vietnam at a time 
when they would have been undergoing a lot of change anyway and so 
were especially vulnerable how theyre the only ones who can change 
the crazy life patterns 
the rage is justified but you still need to let go of it 
scurfield said if how youre going to feel or what youre going 
to do is determined by someone else youre not in control im 
not saying dont fight you must not let the symptoms control 
you open a valve and release some of it without hurting yourself 
the understanding and definition of the disorder continues to 
evolve how successful american lake and ptsd treatment are is 
anybodys guess without a better followup system and more 
coordination among the 14 programs said scurfield a doctor of 
social work who did psychiatric work in vietnam 
a lot more money and programs are needed especially in the west 
scurfield testified before congress last summer special emphasis 
should be placed on professional support for veteran selfhelp 
groups in geographically isolated areas where many choose to live 
because of low fixed incomes 
scurfield lays the delayed response in identifying and treating 
ptsd a disorder professionals now believe has always existed among 
trauma victims to naive psychology trends rightwing beliefs that 
common knowledge of ptsd would undermine the countrys ability to 
defend itself and concerns over the immense potential financial 
strain of treatment 
in a recent survey sent to 180 american lake graduates and 
answered by 85 a majority had been helped in selfesteem 
relationships and understanding they have the responsibility and 
ability to change but a significant minority reported no real 
change in depression and anxiety relationships and intrusive 
symptoms 
i definitely needed another tuneup and more time said 
richard fairfield 39 of rural northeast utah it took me 20 
years to get as screwed up as i was if they had helped me 20 
years ago i wouldnt be here the program should be longer 
ten percent of participants have returned once scurfield said 
despite its admitted weaknesses steve petty a va social worker 
in loma linda calif and a member of a congressionally mandated 
ptsd committee says american lake is considered on the cutting edge 
of treatment 
these people know whats going on said fairfield when i 
wake up at 3 am drenched in sweat and have to talk theyre 
there 
its the only program with a special support group for children 
of vietnam vets and its the only one that incorporates the 
helicopter rides 
i was trying to make sense out of nonsense said jeff 
russell 36 of olympia i felt i was the only person who felt 
that way 
this program gave me a chance to work on issues and stop 
from hitting bottom i have to pick myself up and live

it maybe rosebud was something he couldnt get or something he 
lost anyway i dont think it would have explained everything i 
dont think any word can explain a mans life no i guess rosebud 
is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle a missing piece

if orson welles were alive today he would likely 
be fuming about goats and monkeys 
thats how the celebrated filmmaker of citizen kane often 
referred to hollywood studio executives who tampered with his 
movies it was a line from shakespeares othello and welles was 
indeed a classicist and a genius 
but despite his artistry and the acclaim he received after his 
brilliant work on 1941s citizen kane considered by many to be 
the greatest movie ever made he was never able to direct another 
hollywood film without major interference from the front office 
welles who died in 1985 often boasted that it was the only film 
that was never taken away from him 
but even citizen kane is no longer immune to tampering 
turner entertainment co which infuriated filmmakers and movie 
buffs by colorizing casablanca and its a wonderful life 
among others has announced plans to give welles classic the same 
treatment television entrepreneur ted turner acquired the rights to 
the movie in 1985 when he bought mgmua entertainment corp with its 
massive film library for 15 billion 
directors including woody allen the late john huston and billy 
wilder and such actors as jimmy stewart took their fight against 
colorization to congress pushing for legislation to create a 
national film commission with powers over the colorenhancement 
computerized process they have long argued that the process often 
destroys the original work of art changing mood and intent 
turner has long argued that hes merely protecting his investment 
by tapping into a new audience for old movies of the 1930s and 40s 
young people who grew up on color tv 
i like things in color we see in color turner said im 
colorizing casablanca just for controversys sake once people 
start watching the colored version they wont bother with the 
original 
however while turner presents his color versions on his two 
cabletv networks other commercial networks continue to show the 
blackandwhite originals and attract large audiences 
and colorized films have had only moderate success in video 
sales according to van stevenson of erols inc the nations 
largest independent video chain 
sales figures for 1988 show that the colorized version of its 
a wonderful life by far the biggest seller sold 2000 units at 
the retail price of 895 for the blackandwhite version 10705 
sales retailing at 495 were reported few colorized films are 
available for rentals 
theres a market for both stevenson acknowledged i think 
you have to keep in mind whats out there most of the young people 
grew up in a colored world while film buffs and afficionados want 
the originals 
while two companies are coloring test scenes of citizen kane 
to see if the process is even feasible on the movie critics 
continue to fume 
its nothing short of criminal theyre tampering with a 
masterpiece said director robert wise who helped edit citizen 
kane 
if he welles were alive today he would be at somebodys 
throat he would be bombasting all over the place 
while citizen kane made headlines at first when a brash 
young welles parodied the life of newspaper magnate william randolph 
hearst it is an unchallenged magnificent work of art and 
technology because of its innovative use of lighting camera and 
sound 
while many movies had been made in color by 1941 notably gone 
with the wind the wizard of oz and a star is born welles 
considered blackandwhite essential to setting the proper mood for 
his film 
orson always said a blackandwhite film abstracts reality 
recalled barbara leaming who collaborated with welles on his 
autobiography the words he always used for kane were 
hallucinatory and dreamlike he said it created a mood several 
steps removed from the real world 
for orson blackandwhite was one the things that gave 
citizen kane the possibility of being an art film he said all of 
the elements were conceived in the same way if you change one 
element all of the other elements are going to look wrong 
although welles had never made a feature film before signing a 
contract with rko in 1939 he was already famous in 1938 his 
notorious war of the worlds radio broadcast convinced thousands 
of people that martians had landed in new jersey his innovative 
stage productions with the mercury theatre and his work with 
harlems negro theatre including an allblack presentation of 
macbeth made him the talk of broadway 
he considered several sources for his first film he had 
originally attempted an adaptation of joseph conrads short novel 
the heart of darkness later a source for frances coppolas 
apocalypse now but the start of world war ii in 1939 
endangered the films success in europe a market considered vital 
by rko 
he also looked into making a comedy starring carole lombard or 
lucille ball and a mexican melodrama based on a novel by arthur 
caldermarshall but then came up with on another idea based on 
conversations with his friend ashton stevens a drama critic for 
the hearstowned chicago american 
stevens had intrigued welles with his depictions of hearst whose 
parties at his san simeon castle and extramarital affair with the 
actress marion davies were the talk of hollywood 
welles and herman mankiewicz put together a script that 
chronicled the life of a newspaper tycoon and wouldbe politician 
charles foster kane who dies a lonely man after his attempts to 
make an opera singer out of his wife susan alexander destroy his 
personal and professional life they won the academy award for best 
screenplay 
the films plot centered on a reporters efforts to determine the 
meaning of the dying kanes final word rosebud for those who 
never saw the movie rosebud was the name of his sled 
hearst was the main source for citizen kane but welles also 
drew upon the lives of obert mccormick a wealthy chicago 
businessman who had himself tried to promote an untalented opera 
singer and samuel infull who had built an opera house in chicago 
instead of a straightforward narrative citizen kane jumps 
back and forth in time as the reporter interviews people who knew 
kane and newsreels depict the highlights of his public life it is 
similar in structure to marching song a play welles wrote when 
he was 17 based on a reporters search for the abolitionist john 
brown 
orson was fascinated by a story within a story said leaming 
a professor of theater and film at hunter college citizen kane 
was a logical development

welles cast himself as kane and also used several of the old 
mercury players including joseph cotten everett sloane and agnes 
moorehead to compose the soundtrack he hired bernard herrmann who 
would later work with alfred hitchcock on vertigo north by 
northwest and several other films 
but the most important member of the citizen kane crew was 
cinematographer gregg toland whose credits included wuthering 
heights and how green is my valley toland anxious for the 
chance to try out new techniques had requested to work for welles 
toland was the single greatest cinematographer of all time 
wise said he was a master in every way 
toland and welles made extensive use of deepfocus photography 
which by putting the entire frame of a picture into focus allowed 
several points of view to be shown simultaneously deepfocus had 
been used by silent film director dw griffith but was largely 
discontinued in 1925 when a new type of film stock made the effect 
technically unfeasible 
by the late 30s however the quality of film had improved 
enough to allow again for deepfocus and welles and toland used it 
to stunning effect 
in one scene kanes parents sign an agreement to place young 
charles under the guardianship of walter thatcher a coldhearted 
new york banker kanes father is seen at the left side of the frame 
and his mother is in closeup at the right with thatcher leaning over 
her shoulder in the background charles is seen playing outside in 
the snow because everyone in the frame is shot in focus the viewer 
can appreciate how many people are affected by what has taken place 
in another scene susan is taking a singing lesson from matisti 
a prominent teacher the lesson is obviously going badly and matisti 
is clearly frustrated by susans hopelessly offkey singing 
an increasingly impatient matisti is seen in the left side of the 
frame a clearly uncomfortable susan sings on the right side and in 
the far background kane in sharp focus enters the room and 
angrily advances to the piano again several points of view are 
expressed in one frame 
welles often shot kane from floor level to make him appear larger 
and demonstrate his dominance over other people in one of the 
films final scenes when kanes marraige is rapidly falling apart 
welles uses camera angles to underline the relationship of the 
couple kane is shot from below as he listens to susan scream and 
is viewed from above when he responds making him tower over her 
the shadow he casts obscures her 
ceilings had rarely been seen in a hollywood film until welles 
put them on camera in citizen kane by using extreme upangle 
shots 
i suppose that closing the top of a set was the real revolution 
we caused welles once said its disastrous to let a camera 
light a set without a ceiling its artificial 
before citizen kane filmgoers main exposure to newsreels 
had been hearsts march of time clips which offered hypedup 
versions of current events because of an intricate technical 
process the newsreels in citizen kane had the same grainy 
look as the hearst films 
what i had to do was take all the film orson shot and degrain 
it wise said frank miller manager of public relations for 
superstation tbs said a company to do the coloring has not yet been 
hired and could not determine what would be done with the newsreel 
footage 
shooting for citizen kane began in june of 1940 and was 
completed in late october the film premiered in may 1941 at the 
palace theatre in new york and received rave reviews except from 
papers controlled by the outraged hearst 
on seeing it for the first time one got a conviction that if 
the cinema could do that it could do anything said film critic 
penelope houston 
welles next film the magnificent ambersons was reduced by 
rko from 131 minutes to 88 minutes after a disastrous screening by 
1948 welles was working for republic pictures corp which 
specialized in film vehicles for such cowboy stars as gene autry and 
roy rogers he would have only sporadic success the rest of his life 
i began at the top and have been making my way down ever 
since welles said 
in the mid1970s ralph weinger an electronic equipment designer 
from philadelphia began experimenting with the process of 
converting blackandwhite film to color 
the blackandwhite film is transferred to oneinch 
videotape weinger said a computer operator picks out key 
frames from each individual scene and by using an electronic light 
pencil assigns color values to the actors and objects then the 
computer takes over and colors all the other frames in the scene 
 
a minute of the scene can be colored in one hour a 100minute 
movie can be completed in a day and a half 
the average cost for colorizing a movie is 183000 
the first job for weingers process was the 1978 tv docudrama 
king filmways could find no color footage of the 1963 march on 
washington to interweave with the dramatized martin luther king 
jr story weinger provided four minutes of the march in color 
nbc heard about the process and hired weinger to color a 
halfhour of world war ii newsreels for ike the biography of 
dwight d eisenhower 
turner entertainment issued its first colorized version of a 
hollywood classic in 1986 with yankee doodle dandy 
they go back to the original blackandwhite negative and make 
it sure its in the best possible condition its then transfrerred 
to video tape we never touch the negative said turner 
entertainments miller 
the corporation has a team of researchers who study everything 
available about the film they talk to people around at the time 
they also study the styles of technicolor of the period their 
research is pretty exhaustive 
the colorization of films has also meant that highquality prints 
for the blackandwhite versions are now available in february new 
yorks biograph theatre a leading revival house will be starting a 
tribute to turner entertainment showing brand new prints of 
citizen kane and casablanca among others 
the turner people are very good first class said frank 
rowley program director of the biograph i play the pictures as 
theyre meant to be played 
for welles who was working on an adaptation of king lear at 
the time of his death films were meant to played in 
blackandwhite leaming recalled that even in the 80s he had an 
aversion to filming in color 
he knew that the pressure of the market became too strong that 
people wanted color films leaming said he would say ill put 
a color prolog on king lear and fool them theyll give me the 
money and then ill shoot it in blackandwhite the way it should 
be

americans aftertax incomes shot up 38 percent last year but 
the cost of employersponsored health care jumped 186 percent 
according to new reports 
the commerce department said monday the gain in income adjusted 
for inflation was the best since a 39 percent gain in 1986 and 
more than double 1987s 17 percent some of the extra money went to 
raise the nations personal savings rate from the 40year low of a

analysts said the report stirred some inflationary concern in the 
bond market but was largely shrugged off by wall street where the 
dow jones industrial average edged up 125 points to 232411 its 
highest close since the market crash in october 1987 
the healthcare survey by a foster higgins amp co in new york 
found that costs rose 186 percent per worker last year after 
increases of 77 percent in 1986 and 79 percent in 1987 
the average cost per employee of health care plans was 2354 in 
1988 up from 1985 in 1987 according to the survey of more than 
1600 employers whose plans cover 10 million workers and dependents 
in december personal income totaled 42 trillion with much of 
the 371 billion jump from november resulting from farm subsidy 
payments without those outlays the government said decembers 
total income would have been up 08 percent 
last years income gains spurred both spending and savings 
consumer spending rose 28 percent after adjusting for inflation 
following increases of 27 percent in 1987 and 43 percent in 1986 
in december alone spending rose 09 percent with the biggest 
increase 41 percent posted for durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years 
meanwhile the average personal savings rate rose a full 
percentage point from 32 percent to 42 percent the highest since 
the 44 percent set in 1985 
the 1987 rate was the smallest since a 31 percent rate in 1947 
economists said the figures were a good sign for continued 
economic strength in the coming year 
theres a balanced picture for consumers with a strong 
increase in income a solid increase in spending and some increase 
in savings said allen sinai chief economist for the boston co 
all three of those are quite desirable if the expansion is 
going to keep on rolling along

face to face at last with the big savings and 
loan issue americas private and public leaders will writhe in pain 
as they seek a way out of the mess hoping to disguise the pain or 
dissipate it most broadly 
the fact is however that no such effort can help society avoid 
paying the cost of bailing out insolvent thrifts estimates of which 
seem to be at a rock bottom low of 20 billion and an uncapped high 
of more than 100 billion 
it matters not what you call the vehicle for raising the money 
a tax a fee or an increase in insurance premiums it is inevitable 
that a large number of ordinary americans are going to pay for it 
there is no other way 
it matters not for example who the culprits are or what they 
did or the injustice of it all you can jail the culprits but you 
cannot transform mismanagers into financial geniuses who can earn 
back and pay what they lost 
the pain may be hidden in business assessments but business 
sooner or later passes on its costs to customers theres no way 
uncle sam can pay since he has hardly a dime in his pockets that 
you taxpayers didnt give him 
so testy is this matter that it threatens to end president 
george bushs honeymoon abruptly bushs proposal calls for a 
25cent a year fee for every 100 on deposits at banks credit 
unions and of course savings and loans 
clearly it has flaws it might for instance unfairly penalize 
smaller institutions and their depositors while allowing operators 
of large money market funds to escape conceivably money could flow 
from one to the other 
but any proposal that is offered is likely to be flawed and 
subject to criticism as unfair 
recognizing this william c dunkelberg professor of economics 
authority on savings and loans and dean of temple universitys 
school of business and management offers this defense of bushs 
proposal 
our problem is simply this we failed to accurately forecast or 
anticipate the insurance liability for the sampl systems so we 
charged too low a premium to cover the insurance claims 
now we need a surcharge that amounts to 25 cents per 100 of 
deposits it means that if you have 100 in your local bank paying 5 
percent interest you will get 475 rather than 5 for every 100 of 
savings 
dunkelberg cites state automobile insurance charges as roughly 
comparable 
during the 18 months i have lived in new jersey this has 
happened a number of times to my automobile insurance liabilities 
for uninsured and high risk state insurance program were 
dramatically underestimated 
as a result we were taxed if you wish to use that word to 
make up the shortfall in the past premiums that had been charged 
i may be unhappy with the insurance premium boost incensed 
over rumors of mismanagement poor planning fraud and other factors 
that produced the huge insurance deficit but i cannot solve any of 
those problems by refusing to pay the onetime additional charge 
on my premium to remove the deficit claims now owed by the 
insurance system to thousands of innocent motorists 
the sampl situation he maintains is no different 
many people affected to one degree or another will challenge that 
assertion and the entire proposal might be abandoned for another 
that in turn is likely to be severely criticized 
the issue is basic and painful one that touches on the phrase 
we the people so often cited to express pride in participatory 
government 
most often the reference is in regard to inherent rights the 
rest of the definition defines obligations

the lid on the cost of healthcare plans popped 
off in 1988 as the expense per worker of employersponsored programs 
shot up 186 percent a new survey says 
the jump came after two years of moderate increases 77 percent 
in 1986 and 79 percent in 1987 and there doesnt appear to be 
much relief in sight according to a report released monday by a 
foster higgins amp co a new yorkbased benefits consulting firm 
health insurers swallowed some of the unexpected cost increases 
last year and will pass them along this year ensuring another stiff 
rise said john erb the managing consultant who conducted the 
survey 
the average cost per employee of health care plans was 2354 in 
1988 up from 1985 in 1987 according to the survey of more than 
1600 employers whose plans cover a total of 10 million workers and 
dependents 
the figures include the cost of plans to both employers and 
employees 
the medicalcare component of the labor departments consumer 
price index rose 69 percent last year making it the 
fastestgrowing part of the inflation measure but the cost of 
services is only part of the problem for employers and employees 
erb said 
according to erb these were some of the factors in last years 
big jump 
expensive medical services such as heart and liver transplants 
are becoming more widely available so more people are using them 
the federal and state governments strapped for money are 
holding down how much they pay healthcare providers for medicare 
and medicaid patients that forces the providers to raise their 
prices to other customers 
doctors are raising fees for outpatient services because 
patients tend to be more highly reimbursed for them and are less 
likely to complain the higher reimbursement was intended to 
encourage use of outpatient services which are generally cheaper 
than hospital care 
doctors are requiring more followup visits some of which may 
not be medically necessary 
the providers of care have gotten wise to some of the tricks 
and are compensating for it erb said in an interview 
john j ring chairman of the american medical association said 
in response he did not see any evidence that doctors were reaping 
big fee increases from the shift to outpatient care 
ring a family physician in mundelein ill also said he would 
like to see statistics backing up erbs claim that doctors were 
requiring medically unnecessary followup visits erb said he did 
not have such statistics 
the 1988 increase was smallest 156 percent for companies with 
under 1000 employees which usually pay for their plans through 
insurers insurers did not anticipate the big increase in expenses 
last year and are likely to put through big increases this year to 
compensate foster higgins said 
to illustrate the increased availability of hightech medical 
care erb said there are about 120 us medical centers that can do 
heart transplants up from 30 just two years ago also he said it 
has become common for hospitals to give heartattack patients a dose 
or even two of tpa a clotdissolving drug that costs 2000 a dose 
miraculous cures are becoming more common he said in a 
written statement but miracles cost money 
the cost of providing benefits for mental health and substance 
abuse shot up 27 percent in 1988 to an average of 207 per employee 
and now totals 96 percent of total medical plan costs foster 
higgins said 
at the same time more employees are screening prospective 
employees for substance abuse twentyfour percent screened at least 
some prospective employees last year up from 20 percent in 1987 
the survey found 
erb said health plans that require employees to share costs are 
usually successful in reducing costs to employers but health 
maintenance organizations which were touted as a way to rein in 
expenses apparently have not succeeded as planned he said 
according to the foster higgins survey 59 percent of employers 
said premiums paid to health maintenance organizations hmos were 
as high as or higher than premiums under traditional healthcare 
plans

yugo america inc the importer of 
inexpensive yugoslavmade cars is trying to throw its financial 
problems into reverse by filing for protection under federal 
bankruptcy laws 
yugo its parent company and an affiliated corporation asked a 
bankruptcy judge monday for protection from their creditors their 
petition said more than 300 companies and individuals may hold 
claims against the firms 
yugos sales slipped to 31546 cars in 1988 a plunge of 35 
percent from its 1987 performance 
former company president william prior cited sagging sales and 
the loss of dealerships when he resigned in november 
us bankruptcy judge vincent j commisa signed an order monday 
allowing impex car corp to provide financing and take management 
control of the company said kenneth a rosen a company attorney 
impex is an affilliate of zavodi crevna zastava the yugoslavian 
manufacturer of the yugo car 
the purpose of the financing is to continue the sale of yugo 
automobiles to dealers and to provide the supply of parts to 
dealers said rosen 
yugo was joined in its filing by its parent global motors inc 
and affiliate proton america inc 
toma savic a yugo sales representative from yugoslavia said 
monday after the national automobile dealers association convention 
in new orleans the filing could ease yugos efforts to stay in the 
united states where it has about 250 dealers 
some of those dealers objected to the decision 
dick loehr a dealer in kalamazoo mich who also sells other 
lines of cars said yugo dealers tried to talk company officials out 
of filing the bankruptcy papers 
the dealers thought that the investors group behind yugo was 
a bottomless pit he said adding that the dealers had heard 
rumors about a possible bankruptcy filing for some time 
the filing did not shock industry analysts 
its really not a surprise at all said analyst chris 
cedergren of californiabased jd power and associates 
global motors has had some financial difficulties for a while 
now cedergren said they put a great deal of money into global 
motors hoping they would turn it around 
it really didnt help that much he said 
analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international 
inc said the cars design may have been to blame for the filing 
i just think it wasnt attractive and you might as well spend 
the extra thousand and get something else she said thats what 
happened 
yugo based in upper saddle river touted its boxy subcompact 
cars as the cheapest new auto in the united states when they went on 
sale in august 1985 at 3995 
sales topped 39100 in the first 10 months of 1987 but dropped 
to 26000 in the same period of 1988 according to figures released 
by the company 
several calls placed monday to the company were not answered 
in its filing yugo listed 305 million in assets and the same 
amount in liability and equity global motors listed 274 million 
in each category proton america listed 10000 in each 
mabon nugent and co a new york investment banking company which 
invested 105 million in global motors and owns 33 percent of the 
company said the bankruptcy filing was welcome 
it is appropriate that the yugoslavian manufacturer of the car 
has come forward with support necessary for the company to proceed 
hopefully they will be able to complete a plan of reorganization 
and continue to serve yugo dealers and customers the banking 
concern said 
court papers said the filing was authorized by marcel kole the 
companys chief financial officer and acting chief executive officer 
he said the company is committed to doing business in the united 
states 
in april 1988 yugo had 300 employees and now has 60 kole said

japans government approved tuesday stricter rules 
against insider stock trading defining the practice clearly and 
providing for criminal penalties for the first time 
the new rules approved at a cabinet meeting will be put into 
effect april 1 finance ministry officials said 
amid the ongoing internationalization and popularization of 
securities transactions regulations on insider trading are 
indispensable for a sound development of our countrys securities 
market by increasing the sense of fairness and transparency in the 
stock market finance minister tatsuo murayama told a news 
conference 
murayama said that to protect investors companies should make 
an effort to positively open up their company information while 
establishing a moral climate to prevent insider trading 
in japan largescale insider trading is limited because of the 
infrequency of corporate takeovers analysts say but leaks of 
information about company developments to a limited number of 
investors are believed to be frequent along with stock manipulation 
by some large brokerages financial sources say 
the tokyo stock exchange has become the worlds largest stock 
market exceeding new york and london in terms of market 
capitalization but japanese law previously lacked a clearcut 
definition of insider trading 
under the newly revised securities and exchange law securities 
subject to insider trading regulations are company bonds stocks and 
warrant bonds issued by domestic and foreign companies listed on the 
stock exchange the officials said 
they said the new rules restrict advance leaks of important 
information concerning companies including decisions made by 
board meetings on such matters as mergers and aquisitions 
introduction of new products financing and cooperative agreements 
any person who leaks for example the news of a companys 
merger will face up to six months imprisonment or a fine of 500000 
yen 3900 said a finance ministry official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the new rules say important information will be regarded as 
public 12 hours after it has been released to more than two news 
organizations news organizations include general newspapers news 
agencies and broadcasting organizations 
japans recent major stock scandal involved a different type of 
practice offering selected key politicians and businessmen stock 
shares not yet listed for public trading once public trading did 
begin in the shares of recruit cosmos a real estate company prices 
rose and early buyers made large profits 
the practice was not illegal but raised questions of ethics and 
disguised bribery

shamrock holdings inc has filed a 
lawsuit to block polaroid corps 11 billion stock buyback plan 
which analysts believe was designed to thwart a hostile takeover by 
the television and radio concern 
shamrock the disneyowned company that has been pursuing 
polaroid since last summer filed suit monday in delaware state 
court 
the suit asks the court to prohibit both polaroids buyback 
program and its plan to issue 300 million in convertible preferred 
stock which also were announced on monday polaroid said it 
indicated it had invited two members of the investor group 
corporate partners lp to join its board of directors 
in its suit shamrock alleges polaroids directors breached 
their fiduciary duties by issuing additional dilutive voting 
securities to persons friendly to management in the face of 
shamrocks announced intention to wage a proxy contest at polaroids 
upcoming annual meeting 
since july the instant photography pioneer has been fighting a 
hostile buyout offer from shamrock which is offering 45 a share in 
a tender offer that values polaroid at about 32 billion 
shamrock a television and radio concern owned by the roy e 
disney family also has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for 
control of polaroids board at the companys annual meeting in may 
and if successful would force the sale of polaroid either under its 
offer or a higher thirdparty bid 
shamrock president and chief executive officer stanley gold 
called polaroids actions irresponsible and a sign of entrenched 
management 
the placement of preferred stock together with the proposed 
stock buyback program is clearly a defensive action designed to 
park even more polaroid shares in friendly hands at the expense of 
polaroids public shareholders gold said 
polaroid stock closed monday at 4062 up 62 cents in new york 
stock exchange composite trading 
polaroid spokesman sam yanes denied the planned stock issue was a 
defensive move designed to discourage burbankbased shamrocks 
advances 
its designed simply to deliver a portion of the companys 
current value while enhancing the growth prospects for its values 
yanes said 
companies frequently buy their own stock to reduce the number of 
shares outstanding and to raise the stock price such practices have 
become common among companies seeking to discourage takeovers 
some analysts said polaroids stock buyback was unlikely to 
attract shareholders unless the market price of polaroid stock tops 
shamrocks 45ashare offer 
theres no incentive for people to sell the polaroid stock 
said alex henderson an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
henderson said stockholders would do better to tender their stock 
to shamrock and wait for the market price to rise if the stock 
appreciates he said stockholders could withdraw the tendered 
shares and sell them on the open market 
the catalyst to all this restructuring is shamrock whether 
polaroid officials admit it or not he said 
peter enderlin an analyst with new yorks smith barney harris 
upham amp co predicted polaroids stock price would rise due to the 
repurchase plan he said the company was prepared to pay more than 
the 45 offered by shamrock 
unless shamrock comes back with another increase i think 
definitely the pendulum has swung to polaroid protecting their own 
company said charles k ryan an analyst with merrill lynch 
capital markets 
the preferred stock to be issued to corporate partners a firm 
managed by new york investors lester pollack and ali wambold is 
convertible to common stock at a price of 50 a share 
the group also received warrants to purchase 635000 shares of 
polaroid common stock at 50 a share 
polaroid has 716 million common shares outstanding 
polaroids board of directors last week rejected as inadequate 
shamrocks sweetened 45 offer which includes 97 million shares 
issued under polaroids employee stock ownership plan 
shamrock is appealing a delaware court ruling that upheld the 
polaroid employee stock ownership plan polaroid is incorporated in 
delaware 
shamrock contends the employee stock was issued specifically to 
block a takeover if the plan is invalidated shamrock says it will 
raise its offer to 336 billion or 47 per share

the senate commerce committee voted today to 
recommend that the senate confirm president bushs nomination of 
texas oilman robert mosbacher as commerce secretary 
the committees voice vote came despite a request by the public 
interest lobbying group common cause group to delay action on the 
nomination of mosbacher until more is known about the nominees 
fundraising on behalf of bush 
mosbacher 61 was warmly received at his confirmation hearing 
before the committee last week as he promised to work to increase 
us exports and to vigorously enforce laws designed to protect us 
business from unfair foreign competition 
but common cause said monday the committees vote should be 
postponed until more complete information is obtained on corporate 
donors to the republican national committee the group says it wants 
to ensure against a conflictofinterest between those corporate 
contributors and mosbachers work as commerce secretary 
common cause says the rnc has yet to release a full and accurate 
list of the people and corporations that gave at least 100000 each 
to the team 100 fundraising drive led by mosbacher who was 
bushs chief fundraiser 
the republicans released a list of people who had made 
contributions but said much of the money was given on behalf of 
corporations that were not identified 
common cause president fred wertheimer said the information on 
corporate donors was needed to allow the public to be able to 
identify any possible connections that might arise between the 
softmoney contributions and any direct interest the contributors 
may end up having in issues before the commerce department under mr 
mosbachers leadership 
committee chairman ernest f hollings dsc responded that he 
would not delay the vote because it would be wrong to raise sand 
over conduct that was allowed under federal election law 
hollings did say that he would introduce legislation to limit 
spending in federal elections 
the fault here lies with the congress and not with mr 
mosbacher he said

improved earnings from refining and marketing operations and a 98 
million aftertax gain on the sale of the companys downtown

the company said monday other factors contributing to the rise 
included increased gains from asset sales and improved chemicals 
earnings 
for the fourth quarter aftertax profit totaled 141 million or

its deadline and continue negotiations with the pittston coal group 
averting a walkout by 1700 miners scheduled for midnight tonight 
union president richard l trumka told a washington news 
conference the union would accept a request by the governors of 
kentucky virginia and west virginia to call off the strike deadline 
in favor of continued negotiations 
govs gerald baliles of virginia gaston caperton of west 
virginia and wallace wilkinson of kentucky made the request last 
week asking the union to agree to a 30to60day coolingoff period 
trumka promised to comply with that request 
at the same time however trumka announced the latest 
development in the unions corporate campaign of trying to put 
pressure on pittston through protests and other actions against the 
company and its business partners 
todays target was crestar financial corp one of five banks 
that in december 1987 extended to pittston a 100 million line of 
credit that was one month before the expiration of the miners 
contract they have been working wothout a contract since 
trumka said the crestar boycott began today with the withdrawal 
of 297 million from the bank 23 million by the bakery and 
confectionary union and industry international pension fund and 67 
million by the umw 
i anticipate that millions more will be withdrawn from crestar 
to protest its financial support of pittston trumka said

the strike deadline trumka thanked them for their support and said 
the union for the most part has walked the road alone in its 
search for a fair settlement to the contract squabble with pittston 
and he again called on pittston chief executive officer paul w 
douglas to meet facetoface with him to discuss the negotiations 
the pittston co based in greenwich conn is the corporate

last feb 1 after pittston refused to sign a wage agreement the umw 
reached at other major eastern producers 
the sides met again monday but dd not resolve their differences 
over the past week the company has been considering a union 
contract offer made last tuesday in response to an offer pittston 
made on nov 9 during the year of negotiations each side had 
accused the other of hindering progress by refusing to bargain in 
good faith 
pittston had said repeatedly it planned to operate through a 
strike perhaps by hiring permanent replacement miners the union 
responded with a corporate strategy in which it tried to 
pressure pittston through demonstrations and other actions against 
its business partners

attorney general dick thornburgh flanked by 
the us attorneys from new york chicago and kansas city today 
announced formation of special task forces to target crime in the 
suites primarily securities and commodities fraud 
the securities and commodities fraud task forces including 15 
additional assistant us attorneys will be located in six cities 
new york chicago los angeles san francisco kansas city and 
denver 
us attorney rudolph giuliani in new york and us attorney 
anton valukas in chicago already have undertaken substantial 
investigations of the markets in those two cities 
we are undertaking to bring this additional firepower to bear 
on behalf of investors who might otherwise run the risk of being 
defrauded or lose confidence in the market thornburgh said 
he said the task forces were being formed to combat what can 
aptly be called crime in the suites fraud is being committed 
under the guise of respectability in the financial and securities 
markets he said 
in addition thornburgh said the treasury loses more than 90 
billion a year as a result of tax fraud and whitecollar crime has 
been a factor in many recent business failures including many of 
the bank and savings and loan closings 
there was no immediate word on how much the new effort will cost 
those involved in the task forces will be senior experienced 
prosecutors who will be replaced in their current jobs by new 
attorneys edward sg dennis assistant attorney general in charge 
of the justice departments criminal division said at a news 
conference 
the task forces will concentrate on the most complex and 
difficult frauds including stock loan frauds precious metals 
fraud parking of securities with buyers concealing how much of 
a stake they have in a companys stock and major bank and brokerage 
frauds plus tax evasion obstruction of justice and perjury 
thornburgh said 
these investigations are difficult and require the 
sophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors thornburgh said 
they are not made by breaking down the door and seizing the 
evidence 
agents from the securities and exchange commission the internal 
revenue service the postal inspection service the fbi and the 
commodity futures trading commission also will be involved in the 
probes 
giuliani who is leaving his post today after five years made a 
name for himself in part by attacking insider trading on wall street 
and has long called for additional money to uncover fraud in the 
securities markets 
valukas of chicago supervised a twoyear undercover investigation 
of the nations largest commodity markets resulting in allegations 
that as many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated 
customers and profited themselves in illegal trades 
under the new task forces the us attorneys office in 
manhattan will get six additional assistant us attorneys while 
the offices in chicago and los angeles will get three each and san 
francisco kansas city and denver will get one apiece an 
unspecified number of investigators paralegal workers and other 
support personnel will be added to those offices as well 
in addition to giuliani valukas and dennis thornburgh was 
joined at the news conference by benito romano who becomes interim 
us attorney for manhattan on wednesday after giuliani steps down 
and robert ulrich us attorney in kansas city and chairman of the 
attorney generals us attorneys advisory committee

stockholders than fruehaufs own recapitalization plan varity said 
tuesday 
the total amount of the offer was undisclosed varity and 
fruehauf officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking 
details 
varity called off earlier negotiations on acquisition of fruehauf 
in october citing only its review of fruehaufs records and assets 
varity formerly masseyferguson is a torontobased farm and 
industrial machinery maker 
fruehauf makes truck trailers and automotive and maritime 
products and its kelsey hayes subsidiary is a leading supplier of 
antilock braking systems fruehauf has struggled with debt since a 
1986 leveraged buyout and reported a net loss of 415 million for 
1987 
after varitys earlier offer was called off fruehauf said in 
december it would propose recapitalization deferring some debt and 
increasing cash available for operations it also said it would 
explore other alternatives presented to the company 
the new varity offer came in a letter dated monday from victor 
rice chairman and chief executive officer of varity to tneal 
combs vice chairman and chief executive officer of fruehauf 
rice proposed that varity acquire fruehauf in an exchange of 
varity shares for fruehauf stock holders of fruehauf notes and 
debentures would receive a combination of varity shares and new 
fruehauf debt guaranteed by varity 
the offer would be more favorable for stockholders than 
fruehaufs proposed recapitalization he said they would not be 
dependent for the value of their securities on the future operations 
of fruehauf alone 
rice said the offer would remain open until 5 pm feb 17

facsimile machines the latest office 
rage have made it easier and possibly more fun for workers to work 
stay in touch and even order lunch but they also have fallen prey 
to human goofs and greed 
a presidential candidate used a fax machine to enter the race at 
the last minute a boston radio station accepts contest entries by 
fax and notifies winners the same way 
but a leading retailer recently lost a 73 million lawsuit in 
federal court here partly because a confidential document was faxed 
to the wrong place and irritation is growing as junk fax 
increases 
still once you have one you cant live without it and you use 
it more and more said elliot king coauthor of the book of 
fax an impartial guide to buying amp using fascimile machines 
the machines convert a page of information into an electronic 
format then transmit it via telephone line to another machine on 
the other end where it is decoded and printed the average office 
fax costs 1000 to 4000 
more than 4 million fax machines will be purchased by 1991 and 
sales are expected to grow at 30 percent a year well into the 1990s 
according to kings book 
to a lot of people the fax machine has become a fact of life in 
the office said barbara crouse advertising and promotion 
director for bostons wrorfm 
the radio station has been using the fax to entice office workers 
to listen it has been running a contest asking workers to fax in 
the funniest thing found lying around the office the chuckle of the 
day wins with the victor receiving notification from the station 
via fax 
they not only have to send us the fax but they have to watch 
their fax machines to see if theyve won said crouse 
office workers can also use the machines to place lunch orders at 
fax food restaurants 
we do a lot of delivery and takeout and for them to just fax 
over their order it goes through less hands and it keeps the order 
more correct said evie young manager of maxines seafood cafe in 
los angeles it saves us in tying up phone lines 
she said the restaurant which got its fax machine in october 
gets about half its takeout requests via fax roughly 15 to 20 
orders per day 
the portable fax opens up a whole new world to faxaholics 
i had a guy come in here once who wanted a portable one so he 
could take it golfing said anthony j villaloando owner of 
citifax information systems in northbrook ill 
portable fax machines were used constantly during the 
presidential election said tad devine director of delegate 
selection for michael dukakis democratic primary campaign and 
campaign coordinator for vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen 
both candidates traveled in planes equipped with fax machines 
they also had portable fax for use in their hotel rooms he said 
rep richard gephardt of missouri almost missed his chance to run 
for the democratic presidential nomination when his filing papers 
failed to show up for the primary deadline 
when it was not there late that afternoon his campaign was 
contacted by the secretary of state in oklahoma and gephardts 
campaign sent in a fax said devine 
but fax fiascos can be expensive 
a federal lawsuit that ended in a 73 million judgment against k 
mart corp earlier this month was initiated when a clerk mistakenly 
faxed a confidential document to fashion house a pawtucketbased 
merchandise wholesaler 
the document an estimate of the commissions owed was intended 
for k mart headquarters in troy mich k mart is appealing the 
judgment 
it is a danger agrees king its like mail without an 
envelope and you can make a lot of mistakes 
just like the us postal service junk mail is a problem 
a connecticut legislator recently proposed legislation that would 
ban the unsolicited use of fax machines to send advertising messages 
its a really effective way for people to direct sales and 
services king said explaining the 10 percent return on mass 
faxings is more than double that of bulk mailings 
in addition the fax attacks cost the solicitor less money 
than mailings because there are no printing envelope stuffing or 
postage fees the owners of the targeted telecopier however gets 
stung 3 to 4 for the price of paper printing and manpower said 
king 
daniel fishman kings coauthor envisons another problem 
faxaporn 
some enterprising young person sometime will enter the business 
of pornography he said call up and get a pornographic 
photograph faxed to you

usx corp on tuesday reported profits of 158 
million in the fourth quarter of 1988 saying a rejuvenated steel 
division helped it rebound from a 14 million loss in the same 
period a year earlier 
the nations largest steelmaker said the profit equal to 55 
cents a share came on sales of 44 billion up from 43 billion 
in the last three months of 1987 
usx chairman david roderick attributed the turnaround in part to 
the companys improved steel division uss 
operating income there was 501 million on sales of 58 billion 
four times higher than the 125 million on sales of 37 billion 
reported for 1987 
usx formerly known as us steel also is the parent of marathon 
oil co and texas oil amp gas corp 
for the entire year usx said earnings tripled to 756 million 
or 262 a share on sales of 169 billion that compares to 
profits of 219 million or 54 cents a share on sales of 149 
billion in 1987 
all of our major segments were profitable in 1988 and we 
expect improved profitability in both our steel and energy segments 
in 1989 roderick said in a statement we are stronger 
financially now than in any recent year 
operating income from energy operations rose 7 percent to 475 
million from 444 million in 1987 despite continued trouble at 
texas oil amp gas 
the unit reported losses of 31 million for 1988 and 7 million 
for the fourth quarter compared with operating income of 2 million 
for 1987 and a loss of 4 million for the 1987 fourth quarter 
usx blamed diminished margins on gas gathering and weak crude oil 
prices for the texas oil amp gas losses

it appears that george bush wont give up on his 
idea of cutting the capital gains tax which pretty much guarantees 
an explosive battle in congress 
that battle will erupt because capital gains are seen as 
something that involve the rich but either that notion is false or 
millions of americans now qualify as rich and the list grows larger 
with every year 
in truth capital gains concern anyone who inherited or purchased 
a few shares of stock or a house or who in almost any other way 
built a financial estate through ingenuity hard work or just luck 
under the 1986 tax act the capital gains tax was raised from a 
maximum of 20 percent to 28 percent for all earners of capital 
gains the increase was 40 percent for wealthy taxpayers but 100 
percent for many poorer taxpayers who real capital gains rate was 
only 14 percent or 15 percent 
it brought capital gains taxes in line with taxes on ordinary 
income 
that was bad enough said critics who also observed other quirks 
in the situation that such taxes can be applied to income never 
made to buying power that never existed and to funds a taxpayer 
never got a chance to use 
definition capital gains are profits realized from the sale of 
capital assets such as securities or real estate 
often they involve risk and usually they are the results of 
longterm investments for this and other reasons including the 
nations need for such capital investments gains generally were 
taxed at less than ordinary income 
consider the consequences now of taxing such longterm gains at 
the same rate as ordinary income income that is taxed during the 
same year in which it is earned 
assume an investment of 5000 in stock held for seven years if 
the appreciation averages 10 percent over that time the investor 
will have about doubled his money the capital gains would be 
5000 the tax about 1400 
while it appears the invester earned 10 percent he really earned 
only 6 percent because the value of the dollar changed in that time 
inflation eroded it at a rate of 4 percent a year an assumption but 
a very safe one 
at 6 percent a year money will not double in seven years the 
5000 sum will grow to about 7100 in buying power but the 
investor will pay capital gains taxes as if it had grown to 10000 
he will pay 1400 in taxes 
deducting the taxes from the inflationadjusted total earned 
leaves him with just 5600 or 5700 an average annual gain of 
100 or less for having risked his money and invested his savings in 
the american economy 
the example is a modest one consider for example a person who 
put some money away back in 1970 with the idea of using it for 
retirement the investment has since tripled in value to a very tidy 
sum or has it 
consumer price inflation in 1970 was 59 percent followed by 43 
percent in 1971 33 percent in 1972 not too bad but then it hit 
62 percent in 1973 and 11 percent in 1974 it never fell below 58 
percent through 1978 
thereafter the tale becomes grim three successive years of 
doubledigit inflation hit the worst of these years being 1980 
when official consumer price inflation measured year to year struck 
135 percent 
by the year 1983 the value of the 1970 dollar had been cut in 
half and of course it has been cut additionally since then even 
though inflation has been restrained to an acceptable 3 to 5 
percent a year 
the 1970 investor has allegedly tripled his money assuming an 
investment of 5000 he now has more than 15000 although 
sensible people know that in 1970 dollars it is worth less than half 
that or about 7000 
nevertheless should that investor sell he has a 10000 capital 
gain on which taxes must be paid and that tax will levied at the 
same rate at which money currently earned is taxed that is as if 
it had current buying power 
in short the investor will be liable for 2800 tax on what in 
effect is 7000 in terms of the 1970 dollar he ends up with a net 
loss

control data corp on tuesday reported a fourthquarter loss of 
128 million and annual profits of only 17 million while its 
chairman forecast another disappointing year for 1989 
the fourthquarter results of the bloomington minnbased 
computer maker compared to net earnings in the same period a year 
ago of 108 million or 26 cents a share sales for the quarter of 
933 million were slightly ahead of last years 927 million 
it was the second consecutive quarter of losses after four 
profitable quarters 
for the year control datas net income dropped to 3 cents a 
share on sales of 36 billion from the 1987 level of 193 million 
or 45 cents a share on sales of 34 billion 
the computer maker suffered from poor results in its mainframe 
supercomputer and semiconductor businesses chairman robert price 
said 
although we anticipate the majority of control data businesses 
to be profitable in 1989 the companys overall operating 
performance will continue to be disappointing until we fix the 
problems that undermined 1988 results price said the goal for 
the coming year is to resolve those problems and lay a foundation 
that is the basis of strong performance in subsequent years 
mainframe computer shipments in 1988 were hurt by delays in 
getting critical logic ships from a supplier and by soft demand 
especially in the united states price said 
in july the company temporarily shut down several of its 
mainframe plants and temporarily idled 7 percent of its work force 
in response to the trouble 
the companys new eta systems supercomputer subsidiary had poor 
1988 results and semiconductor revenues were off partly because the 
data storage market continues to be weak he said 
nancy foltz a spokeswoman for the company said layoffs 
attrition and the sale of some businesses in 1988 resulted in a 23 
percent decrease in control datas work force from 34500 employees 
at the end of 1987 to 33700 at the end of 1988 in addition the 
company has told its 27000 us employees that they must take five 
days off without pay in the first quarter of this year 
other changes at control data included changes in top management 
in december including the appointment of lawrence perlman as 
president

an international trade panel has 
recommended the united states amend its tariff act of 1930 to make 
it comply with international trade rules the eec commission said 
tuesday 
it said a disputes panel of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade the world trade body found section 337 of the act violates 
international trade rules 
the section deals with the right of the us international trade 
commission to rule on patent violations by importers 
the disputes panel said by comparison patent violations of 
usproduced goods go to federal court where accused parties have a 
better chance to defend themselves than those before the itc 
the panels finding will be discussed by the full gatt council on 
feb 8 eec commission spokesman nico wegter said 
the commission is of course pleased with the fact that the 
panel shares the view of the commission that the united states 
violates international trade rules 
officials at the us mission to the eec declined to comment on 
the ruling that was issued in december but was not made public 
unitil tuesday 
the panels ruling stems from a 10yearold dispute between akzo 
nv the dutch chemicals group and du pont co of the united states 
over patent rights for aramid fibers these synthetic fibers are 
used in the automotive aerospace defence and construction 
industries 
in november 1985 the itc blocked imports into the united states 
of akzos aramid fibers saying the company had violated du ponts 
patent rights 
akzo complained to the eec commission about the procedure used by 
du pont to seek protection from foreign competitors under section 
337 of the tariffs act 
in 1987 the commission found the us law to amount to an unfair 
trade practice it took the issue to gatt where a special disputes 
panel was formed later that year 
the commission said tuesday if the gatt council which is made up 
of officials of the 100 or so gatt member states adopts the panels 
report the united states must take the necessary measures to 
rectify as quickly as possible the present situation 
a spokesman for the ec chemical federation cefic said akzo and 
du pont had settled their dispute while the investigation was 
continuing 
he welcomed the ruling on section 337 saying it represented was 
increasingly burdensome for eec businesses and said the panels 
ruling was a victory for the eec

frances stock market watchdog agency on tuesday 
recommended a criminal investigation of the insider trading scandal 
that has embarrassed the socialist government but said it could not 
identify individuals guilty of leaking information that led to 
suspicious stock purchases 
the commission des operations de bourse said max theret a 
businessman with close ties to the governing socialist party made 
eminently suspicious purchases of stock in the us company 
triangle industries inc just before it was acquired by the french 
stateowned firm pechiney sa 
the cob in an unusual public report said explanations by theret 
and his associates were contradictory and apparently were made up 
after the fact and it appeared that theret or another official of 
his investment firm the compagnie parisienne de placements 
received an inside tip of the imminent takeover 
the agency recommended a criminal investigation but said it was 
not able to identify who in or out of the government might have 
provided the information for inside trading by theret or others 
the cob has no enforcement or punishment power and has no power 
to investigate outside of france the agency can however 
investigate locally and recommend prosecution to the state 
prosecutors office 
therets investment firm bought 32300 shares of triangle stock 
just before the sale to pechiney and made a profit of 14 million 
theret has said he decided to buy triangle stock based on his 
research into the packaging industry and has denied getting inside 
tips 
the commission also said a close friend of president francois 
mitterrand rogerpatrice pelat was among the investors who 
profited by purchasing triangle stock at about 10 a share in the 
days just before pechineys 56 a share buyout offer on nov 21 
pelat his wife and sons made more than 350000 in the deal the 
commission said but it did not accuse pelat of insider trading or 
any other wrongdoing 
the cob said it found serious precise and concordant 
indications of illegal activity but said it could not identify 
anyone guilty of leaking word of the deal 
commission chairman jean farge acknowledged his investigators had 
been unable to track all the suspicious trading some of which was 
conducted by corporations based in the caribbean or switzerland 
because pechiney is stateowned several high government 
officials were kept informed of the negotiations with triangle and 
government approval was required 
premier michel rocard and other socialist leaders have responded 
to the burgeoning scandal in recent weeks by saying previous 
conservative governments were involved in more serious scandals than 
this one while promising to bring out the truth and punish any 
wrongdoing 
the affair led earlier this month to the resignation of alain

the population boom appears headed for a bust 
in the united states with census bureau experts projecting tuesday 
that the number of americans will stop growing in 50 years and then 
begin to shrink 
the prime reason a decline in births as the postworld war ii 
baby boom matures 
the aging of that giant generation means that never again will 
america have as many women in the prime childbearing ages of 18 to 
34 as it now does census demographer gregory spencer said 
after 1995 the population may grow more slowly than ever before 
more slowly than even during the great depression of the 1930s 
spencer said 
his study estimated that the nations population could rise 
gradually from the current 247 million to a peak of nearly 302 
million by the year 2038 and then begin to decline 
that is the middle projection of a series of some 30 different 
possibilities included in the study 
the lowest growth estimate would have the population peak at 
2645 million in the year 2020 before starting to decline while the 
highgrowth scenario would have the nation at 501 million and still 
growing in 2080 
while wary of calling one series most likely spencer said 
that in general when people ask what the population will be like in 
the future he gives them the middle series of projections 
the bureau compiles 30 sets of estimates however in an attempt 
to account for varying possibilities in birth rates death rates 
differences between races and ethnic groups immigration and so 
forth 
according to the middle series the us population will climb 
for 50 years peaking in 2038 and then begin a modest decline 
during that coming halfcentury the overall increase is expected 
to total about 56 million nearly the same amount the us grew 
during the last 25 years 
after that peak shrinkage should occur although it will be 
really quite modest spencer said with the population falling 
by only about 10 million over the subsequent 42 years 
so obviously it wouldnt take very much to make this not 
happen he added 
the projection for slower growth followed by decline stems from 
the fact that we have had fertility in this country below 
replacement level since the mid1970s spencer said 
currently each women has a lifetime average of about 18 births 
while it takes 21 to keep population stable 
the main thing keeping the number of births up is the sheer 
enormous number of women of childbearing age spencer said 
but those baby boomers are now heading into older age groups that 
tend to have fewer children while a much smaller group of young 
women is coming along into the childbearing ages 
already the number of women aged 18 to 34 has begun to decline 
the study said peaking at 353 million in 1985 it slipped to 352 
million by 1987 and is expected to drop to 347 million by 1990 and 
by 2080 to be below 30 million 
spencer noted that the population projections assume that 
fertility will become slightly higher in the next few years 
this is based on the expectation that many women who have 
postponed families while attending school and launching careers will 
decide to have children before they become too old to reproduce 
the report also says the nations elderly population which has 
attracted so much attention in recent years is expected to grow 
more slowly after the mid1990s and then accelerate again after 
2010 
that slowing is expected because the small generation born in the 
depression and war years of the 1930s and 1940s will be moving into 
this age group 
but once the postwar baby boom reaches that plateau the elderly 
segment will resume the rapid growth it has seen in recent years 
other findings of the new report include 
the share of the population under age 35 may never again be as 
large as it is now 55 percent that percentage is expected to drop 
to 48 percent in 2000 46 percent in 2010 and 41 percent in 2030 
the white population may begin to decline in 40 years while the 
black and other races population is expected to continue increasing 
by the year 2030 the population could include as many as 32 
million immigrants who entered the country after 1986 and their 
descendants 12 percent of the population 
here is a rundown of the projected us population in coming 
years based on the middle set of estimates the census bureau 
estimated the us population at 246879546 as of jan 1 of this 
year

british petroleum plc shareholders on tuesday 
approved a 42 billion buyback of more than half the 132 billion 
bp shares owned by the government of kuwait 
approval of the repurchase followed a british government order 
earlier this month that the kuwait investment office the 
londonbased investment arm of the kuwaiti government reduce its 
2168 percent ownership in the petroleum company to 99 percent 
an unexpectedly large turnout at the special meeting and the 
number of proxy votes cast show small shareholders have had an 
interest in what weve been doing and approve bp chairman peter 
walters said after the vote 
kuwait had been ordered by the british government to dispose of 
its bp interest above 99 percent within three years but bp said 
the buyback would remove the element of uncertainty over the pending 
disposal and ultimately aid the performance of the companys shares 
the british governments order to the kuwaitis came after a 
ruling in october by the monopolies and mergers commission that the 
big kuwaiti holding could operate against the public interest 
because of kuwaits membership in the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
the kuwait investment office built up its holding by buying 
partly paid bp stock in the months following the governments 72 
billion pound or 132 billion public offering of bp shares in 
october 1987 
the sale by the conservative government under its policy of 
privatization coincided with the stock market crash the offering 
which included the governments remaining 315 percent stake in bp 
was seriously undersubscribed 
although the price bp will pay the kuwaitis amounts to 305 pence 
for each of the 790 million shares owned by kuwait bp will 
effectively pay 247 pence a share because of tax credits 
walters said the repurchase would be completed by midmarch

borden inc said tuesday its fourthquarter 
profit rose 154 percent despite droughtrelated costs that severely 
affected the companys dairy products earnings 
for the threemonth period ended dec 31 bordens net income 
totaled 939 million or 127 a share up from 813 million or 
110 a share in the yearearlier period revenue rose 99 percent 
to 198 billion from 18 billion in the 1987 quarter 
for all of 1988 the giant food producer posted a 168 percent 
increase in aftertax profit to 3119 million or 422 a share 
from 2671 million or 362 a share in the previous year the 
companys revenue for the year totaled 72 billion up 11 percent 
from 65 billion in 1987 
borden chairman rj ventres attributed the latest gains to 
internal business growth spurred by the benefits of 
acquisitions including the purchase a year ago of the prince co 
which makes pasta products 
strong performances by the companys snacks and international 
consumer products division and the grocery and specialty products 
division including eagle brand products were largely responsible 
for bordens yearlong gains the company said 
but droughtrelated costs resulted in a 12 percent slump in 
operating income for the companys dairy sector to 1023 million 
in 1988 from 1163 million in 1987 
borden said profit margins were squeezed especially in the 
second half by unprecedented cost jumps for raw milk 
fierce competition at the retail level delayed cost recovery in 
product pricing borden said

the volume of helpwanted advertisements in major 
newspapers rose slightly in december indicating little change in 
employers hiring plans a business research group said tuesday 
the conference board said its help wanted advertising index rose 
to 161 last month from 157 in november and 156 in the yearago 
month the board said the index fluctuated in a narrow range 
throughout the year 
the seasonally adjusted index equaled 100 in 1967 
the index measures volume of classified ads in 51 major 
newspapers nationwide and is sensitive to changes in the demand for 
labor and general business conditions 
conference board economist ken goldstein said the monthly 
survey data show no change in the labor market conditions that have 
prevailed for the last year or so but a change may not be that far 
off 
goldstein predicted there may be a slowing in the job market in 
1988 following a year in which unemployment hit a 14year low

church labor and business organizations opened 
a campaign tuesday to inform millions of lowincome working families 
that government checks of up to 874 a year may be theirs for the 
asking 
money for me from the irs youre kidding read posters 
and ads aimed at spreading the word about the earnedincome tax 
credit if youre thinking about not filing a federal income tax 
return because you dont owe any income tax think again they 
may owe you 
we are concerned that millions of lowincome working families 
with children may miss out on a valuable benefit they have earned 
robert greenstein told a news conference in announcing the drive 
greenstein is director of the center on budget and policy 
priorities a nonprofit washington organization that tracks 
government actions affecting low and middleincome americans the 
center is coordinating the campaign to make sure that all the 11 
million families eligible for the tax credit get it 
dozens of organizations are participating in the campaign 
ranging from vietnam veterans of america to the edison electric 
institute to the childrens defense fund 
about 63 million families claimed the credit on returns filed in 
1987 if all those eligible claimed it this year it would cost the 
treasury about 6 billion 
greenstein said the special effort to educate poorer families is 
necessary because many are simply unaware the tax credit exists 
although the 1986 tax overhaul expanded the credit and made it 
available to more families the new law also removed up to 6 million 
poor people from the tax rolls and exempted most of them from 
withholding and from even having to file a tax return 
greenstein fears and the internal revenue service supports his 
conclusion that because they had no tax withheld millions of 
lowerincome families will not file a return they thus would miss 
the credit 
the taxrate reductions in the 1986 law became fully effective 
for the first time in 1988 and many lowincome workers are 
receiving for the first time a w2 form indicating they had no tax 
withheld 
the credit is available to working families who have at least one 
child living at home and had 1988 income of less than 18576 the 
credit is for 14 percent of the first 6240 of earnings chiefly 
wages and tips the maximum credit of 874 is allowed until income 
exceeds 9840 the credit then decreases until income reaches 
18576 when it disappears 
the benefit is unique because it can exceed a familys total 
incometax liability even if the liability is zero for example a 
woman with one child could have earned 6200 last year had no tax 
withheld and owed no tax if she files a return the irs will mail 
her a check for 870 
we think it is almost a crime if the people who are entitled to 
these benefits dont obtain them kenneth young executive 
assistant to the president of the aflcio told the news conference 
the labor federation and several of its union are participating in 
the campaign 
young noted that both spouses in a family could earn the minimum 
wage about 6900 each and the family could still qualify for a 
substantial credit 
sharon daly head of domestic social policy for the us catholic 
conference said each of the nations 189 dioceses will be asked to 
spread the word about the credit including using inserts in church 
bulletins 
the campaign also seeks to inform eligible families that they can 
receive the credit in their paychecks throughout the year rather 
than having to wait until the end of the year for a lumpsum 
payment fewer than 1 percent of the families eligible for the 
credit receive the advance payments 
greenstein also noted that a person who was eligible for the 
credit before 1988 but failed to claim it may be able to file 
retroactively and receive the benefit for up to three years in the 
past

comments today by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
analysts said among other things greenspan told congress joint 
economic committee that the potential threat of inflation still 
persists in the economy 
the fed chairman had made similar statements last week but the 
stock and bond markets were unruffled by them at that time 
after the market tested lower levels however it bounced back 
late in the day and again showed the strength characterizing its 
recent rally as the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell toward 
the 2300 level a massive buying surge was said to be triggered 
this is a market that shows resilience said monte gordon 
director of research at dreyfus corp 
the comeback reinforced market players belief that many foreign 
investors and us institutions are poised to jump on the rally 
bandwagon

the office of fair trading said tuesday it was 
investigating a complaint alleging anticompetitive practices by a 
londonbased diamond cartel controlled by south africas giant de 
beers diamond organization 
the watchdog body said de beers appeared to have a monopoly 
on diamond trading in london and it was interested in establishing 
whether there had been an abuse of the monopoly 
consolidated gold fields plc a british mining concern with no 
diamond interests acknowledged that it filed the complaint as a 
defensive move against a stalled takeover bid by luxembourgbased 
minorco sa 
minorco is 601 percent owned by anglo american corp of south 
africa ltd and de beers consolidated mines ltd the gold and 
diamond mining interests controlled by the oppenheimer family of 
south africa 
the british government is expected to rule in the next few weeks 
whether to allow minorco to proceed with its 29 billionpound 
about 51 billion bid for consolidated gold following an 
investigation by the monopolies and mergers commission 
a consolidated gold spokesman commenting on condition he was not 
identified said the company wanted to point up the monopolistic 
tendencies of south africas angloamerican group of companies 
de beers central selling organization which controls 80 percent 
of world diamond trading has been based in london for 60 years 
as well as selling the stones mined by de beers and other south 
african companies the organization trades on behalf of diamond 
producers including zaire australia botswana and the soviet union 
the office of fair trading said it would first have to establish 
whether it had jurisdiction over the central selling organization 
because although it is based in london de beers is a south african 
company 
there is no time limit on the offices investigation after it is 
completed the office of fair trading may decide to refer the 
complaint to the monopolies and mergers commission 
a spokesman for the central selling organization said the office 
of fair trading notified the organization about the inquiry but 
hadnt yet requested any information 
its still early in the investigation said the spokesman 
commenting on condition he was not identified 
de beerss shares were unchanged tuesday on the london stock

automakers are discriminating against the 
nations automobile dealers who must unite to make buying and 
selling cars a fairer game in the united states the president of a 
dealers group said tuesday 
we dealers are swivelnecked from turning the other cheek and 
it simply has to stop said ron tonkin the 1989 president of the 
national automobile dealers association 
we want automakers to be healthy and profitable but not by 
wreaking havoc on the best most loyal friends they ever had their 
dealers said tonkin a dealer with 10 stores holding 14 
automobile franchises in the portland ore area 
in his speech to about 20000 peopel attending nadas annual 
convention tonkin singled out the subsidies from automakers to 
companies that buy fleets of cars 
he said he wanted the makers to simply tell us we will sell to 
no one for less than we sell to our franchised dealers 
but company officials for the big three automakers said their 
fleet brokers are franchised dealers 
cn moore general motors corp vice president for customer 
sales and service said from his office in detroit that all gms 
fleet sales are through franchised dealers except for sales to the 
federal government 
these people that ron tonkin was talking to today are the 
people who deliver all these cars to fleet customers moore said 
ford motor co spokesman ray windecker and chrysler corp 
spokesman tom houston each said their companies fleet sales are 
arranged through dealers chryslers cars for the federal government 
must go through dealers houston said 
ford sells directly to the federal government and the red cross 
but tonkin said dealers who handle fleet sales frequently handle 
only the paperwork associated with them not the vehicles themselves 
while technically what theyre saying is correct tonkin 
said after you go out beyond the dealer thats doing the 
paperwork there are dealers who are damning it 
automaker officials declined to say how much a subsidy might be 
worth to a dealer 
around 20 percent of the industrys sales roughly 16 million 
cars a year are to fleet customers the companies said 
on other matters tonkin 
called on automakers to pay for space in their showrooms like 
food and beverage makers pay for shelf space in grocery stores 
said he was forming a task force to meet with manufacturers 
hoping to find a way to make customer satisfaction indexes more 
uniform tonkin said the indexes sometimes discriminate against 
dealers and should be standardized for the industry 
simplify warranties to make them more understandable for car 
buyers and sellers

the onslaught of colder weather and an expected drop in meat 
demand during lent influenced futures prices for some farm 
commodities tuesday analysts said 
grain and soybean prices were up sharply on the chicago board of 
trade 
prices were bolstered by unexpectedly high weekly export 
inspection figures and a report from sparks commodities a private 
crop analyst that pegged argentinas soybean crop lower than us 
agriculture department estimates said victor lespinasse a trader 
in chicago with dean witter reynolds inc 
a weather forecast calling for bitter cold temperatures in 
wheat growing areas supported the wheat prices said mickey luth 
a chicago analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
wheat settled 3 cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in march at 440 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 7 cents 
higher with march at 274 a bushel oats were 6 cents to 6 cents 
higher with march at 221 a bushel and soybeans were 4 cents to 
12 cents higher with march at 772 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures prices were mostly higher on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
cash prices were helpful for both cattle and hog futures said 
jerry gidel general analyst with gh miller but enthusiasm was 
limited by the propect of diminished consumer demand for meat during 
lent a 40day religious period which begins feb 8 
the cold weather forecast has been a factor in the 
marketplace said gidel in chicago there should be less farmer 
movement of animals to market once the colder temperatures set in 
cattle settled 10 cent to 42 cent higher with the contract for 
delivery in february at 7472 cents a pound feeder cattle were 08 
cent to 30 cent higher with march at 8447 cents a pound live

a pound and frozen pork bellies were 25 cent lower to 100 cent 
higher with february at 3952 cents a pound 
precious metal prices were lower for the fourth straight session 
on the commodity exchange in new york 
the further declines were in response to strong dollar gains 
which were accomplished by federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspans antiinflationary statements to congress today said 
jim steel an analyst with refco inc in new york

the dollar surged to threemonth highs tuesday 
after federal reserve board chairman said the us trade deficit 
would shrink in coming months without a decline in the dollars 
value 
gold prices meanwhile fell to their lowest level in two years 
continuing the downward trend that began last friday when they broke 
below 400 an ounce 
greenspan also said that the federal reserves efforts to boost 
interest rates would not lead to a recession but would extend the 
current expansion by keeping inflation under control 
currency dealers took the remarks to mean that the us central 
bank was unconcerned by the dollars recent rise and was willing to 
keep interest rates tight something that would make 
dollardenominated investments attractive 
it was greenspan today said kathryn curtin assistant 
treasurer of the national australia bank ltd in new york 
testifying before the joint economic committee of congress 
greenspan also reiterated his statement of last week that the 
current rate of inflation is too high and said he expects a further 
substantial contraction in the us trade deficit 
dealers have been focusing on firm us interest rates this year 
rather than the budget and trade deficits that preoccupied them last 
year

adjusted their positions on the last day of the february contract 
analysts said

prices since novembers agreement by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
the accord which took effect jan 1 and extends for six months 
set an oil production quota of 185 million barrels a day for the 13 
opec members

set by opec

xerox corp dissatisfied with its earnings on 
tuesday announced a 275 million streamlining program under which it 
will cut 2000 jobs trim its electronic typewriter business and 
stop selling medical imagemaking equipment 
the stamford connbased copier giant said a charge to cover 
costs of the program was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1988 
resulting in a 77 million loss for the quarter 
without the pretax charge of 275 million profit in the quarter 
would have risen 8 percent xerox said 
xerox stock rose 37 cents a share to 6237 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading 
xerox lost money last year in electronic typewriters document 
workstations and medical imagemaking which uses an unusual 
copying process called xeroradiography according to david kearns 
xeroxs chairman and chief executive 
we are not moving as rapidly toward our objectives as we feel 
we must kearns said in a news conference explaining the 
streamlining program 
the losses were partially offset by a good reception for its new 
50 series of copiers and healthy profits in the financial services 
business which accounts for 30 percent of xerox revenue the 
company said 
xerox said its loss in the fourth quarter contrasted with a 
profit of 155 million or 143 a share a year earlier without 
the charge it said profit would have been 167 million revenue 
rose 6 percent to 44 billion from 415 billion a year earlier 
for all of 1988 xerox said its earnings fell 33 percent to 388 
million or 350 a share from 578 million or 535 a share a 
year earlier without the fourthquarter charge profit would have 
risen 9 percent to 632 million revenue rose 9 percent to 164 
billion from 151 billion 
the biggest portion of the fourthquarter charge 140 million 
comes from writing off excess manufacturing capacity at its 
electronic typewriter plant in fremont calif and disengaging from 
the xerox medical systems business which is based in monrovia 
calif 
xerox will continue to provide service and supplies to existing 
customers of its medical equipment 
another 100 million of the charge comes from the cost of 
reducing overhead and employment kearns said the company could not 
yet say how many of the 2000 job cuts would have to be achieved by 
layoffs vs retirements or voluntary resignations 
the jobs that are being eliminated are in staff rather than in 
sales or manufacturing kearns said the cutbacks in fremont and 
monrovia calif will not involve big job cuts because employment 
has already been reduced there xerox said 
the company said the market for cheaper and mediumpriced 
electronic typewriters has shrunk much faster than expected leaving 
the industry with excess capacity 
xerox said it hopes to cure the losses in its document 
workstation business by gradually dropping its own workstations and 
switching its software over to industrystandard workstations made 
by sun microsystems inc 
separately xerox said it was reorganizing its management it 
said wayland r hicks an executive vice president will head a new 
marketing and customer organization william c lowe who was hired 
from international business machines corp in december will head 
development and manufacturing and jay h nussbaum will head a new 
unit integrated systems operations

the price of houghton mifflin co stock soared 
tuesday after a group led by wealthy texan robert m bass disclosed 
it recently increased its stake in the publisher to 56 percent 
the bass group said in disclosing its holdings that its latest 
purchase was for investment purposes and the company pointed out 
that bass had been an investor in houghton mifflin for some time 
nonetheless wall streeters remembered that it was the bass 
groups bid last may that led to the takeover of another publishing 
giant macmillan inc at a price about 80 percent higher than the 
companys stock had been trading 
in new york stock exchange trading houghton mifflin shot up 
887 a share to 4525 at that price the companys 14 million 
shares are valued at about 633 million 
the bass disclosure follows two years of sweeping changes in the 
publishing business that has seen macmillan fall to british 
publisher robert maxwell harper amp row publishers inc yield to 
rupert murdochs news corp and grolier inc sell to hachette sa of 
france 
harcourt brace jovanovich inc another publishing giant 
underwent a costly recapitalization in 1987 to avoid being acquired 
by maxwell 
alan kassan who follows publishing companies for shearson lehman 
hutton inc said bass demonstrated his interest in the publishing 
business with his initial macmillan bid and his earlier acquisition 
of bell amp howell co an information services and publishing concern 
based near chicago 
i dont know what his intentions are but he has the interest 
and the deep pockets to acquire the whole thing if he so chose 
kassan said 
bert boksen who follows media companies for raymond james amp 
associates in st petersburg fla said houghton mifflin could 
command a price in the mid50 a share range should a buyout effort 
be made 
a woman answering the telephone at basss offices in fort worth 
texas said it was company policy not to comment on its business 
plans 
bostonbased houghton mifflin is a leading educational publisher 
and also publishes general interest books and educational and 
wordprocessing software 
it ranked fourth in the nation behind harcourt gulf amp westerns 
simon amp schuster and macmillan based on 1987 educational revenue 
according to the trade newsletter educational marketer published by 
knowledge industry publications inc in white plains ny 
shearsons kassan said houghton mifflin has been a wellrun 
company with a fair earnings performance over the past two years 
hougton mifflin earned 241 million or 170 a share on 
revenue of 3683 million in 1988 
nonetheless kassan said the company is vulnerable to a takeover 
because it has a relatively small amount of its stock in the hands 
of company insiders and is clearly a leader in the elementary 
school reading market 
the elementary school market stands to improve over the next few 
years industry analysts believe as a growing number of children 
reach school age 
in its filing with the securities and exchange commission the 
bass group said it purchased 161200 shares of houghton mifflin 
stock between jan 10 and jan 27 at a prices ranging from 3421 to 
3680 a share 
it said the purchase leaves it with 790200 common shares of 
houghton mifflin or 56 percent of its 14 million shares 
in its statement houghton mifflin said we do not see anything 
unusual in the bass groups filing houghton mifflin has other large 
stockholders most of whom have been investors for a long time 
paul d weaver secretary for the company declined comment when 
asked if the companys board had met to discuss the matter 
the company adopted as poisonpill takeover defense plan in 
december 
last may the bass group prpoosed to acquire macmillan for 64 a 
share at a time when the companys stock had been trading at about 
50 a share maxwell acquired macmillan last fall at a price of 
9025 a share or about 25 billion

utility customers who dont pay by mail will soon 
be able to pay their bills at some 7eleven stores 
national payments network of paramus nj said southland 
corps 7eleven was the first national chain that had agreed to let 
the company install computer terminals to handle its electronic 
payment system 
national payments network caters mainly to poor and elderly 
people who pay their utility bills with cash in person rather than 
sending checks by mail according to bill coleman vice president 
for sales and marketing 
utility companies in 18 states already accept bills paid through 
more than 2000 locations where the national payments network has 
outlets those are mostly mom n pop stores or small regional 
chains coleman said 
four 7eleven stores in the los angeles area have already tested 
the national payments network system other markets will be added as 
time goes on he said 
since 7eleven stores are franchised some may choose not to 
participate 
although many supermarkets and other retail outlets accept 
payment of bills the national payments network gets money to 
billers faster because it is electronic that can make a difference 
if a utility customer is threatened with cutoff 
in some areas 50 to 60 percent of all customers pay their 
utility bills in person national payments network said in a news 
release

carlyle group a washingtonbased investment 
partnership on tuesday made a new higher offer for fairchild 
industries inc the chantilly vabased defense and space 
electronics contractor 
carlyle made what it called a friendly offer to purchase all 
outstanding shares of fairchild industries at 1630 per share or 
more than 230 million assuming 144 million shares are outstanding 
fairchilds stock fell 25 cents a share to 1475 in consolidated 
new york stock exchange trading 
the new price per share is the same as fairchild said monday it 
had agreed to pay to acquire the 25 percent stake held by its 
largest shareholder group 
fairchild attempting to stave off a takeover threat by the 
carlyle group announced monday that it intended to buy back 75 
million worth of stock and securities held by the big shareholder 
group which is headed by george soros 
carlyle countered with its offer tuesday it said that if the big 
shareholder group was getting 1630 a share for its block the rest 
of fairchild shareholders were also entitled to get that much per 
share 
we request that you weigh this proposal in light of your 
fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders not management 
carlyle said in a statement 
fairchild said monday it planned to sell the common stock it will 
acquire from the soros group to its employee stock ownership plan 
fairchild said that step could make an acquisition that is not 
approved by the board of directors more difficult 
a partnership controlled by the carlyle group owns 999 percent 
of fairchild common shares its original offer was 1550 a share 
which amounted to a little more than 220 million for the common 
stock the total acquisition cost to carlyle under the original and 
new offers would be higher because of the cost of acquiring other 
securities or taking on fairchild debt

inside trading in a major fraud scandal will pay back more than 
127000 in illegal profits under an agreement approved tuesday by a 
federal judge

30000 in profits from illegal information supplied by wang in a 
separate scheme

reflect its status as the largest producer of us crude oil 
the us subsidiary of the londonbased british petroleum plc now 
operates retail stations in 26 states under sohio boron gulf and 
bp logos 
i think bp is in many ways the invisible giant of corporate 
america said james h ross bp america president and chief 
executive officer 
we are the major player in us upstream oil one of the most 
successful and innovative oil companies here and indeed worldwide 
we are far bigger than houshold names in ohio like trw goodrich and 
sherwinwilliams he said 
upstream refers to the exploration and production side of the 
oil business in contrast with downstream operations which 
refer to refining and marketing 
ross said bp america also has changed the names of its us 
exploration refining and marketing and chemicals businesses to 
reflect the bp label 
bp america operates about 750 service stations in the northeast 
which are identified by the bp logo with its green shield and two 
bright yellow letters in addition it has 1100 sohio stations in 
ohio 600 boron stations in michigan and western pennsylvania and 
5000 gulf stations in the southeast bp america acquired the gulf 
stations from chevron corp in 1985 after chevron purchased gulf 
corp and sold assets to avoid antitrust problems it also recently 
acquired mobil stations in three west coast states that will convert 
to the bp brand 
bp america said it plans to redesign some of the service stations 
according to a new format 
ross said the company conducted extensive research both 
nationally and internationally before deciding to unify its 
businesses under one name 
he said use of the name bp in the united states would provide 
the company with a consistent identity 
bp america based in cleveland moved its headquarters from new 
york after the company purchased controlling interest in 
clevelandbased standard oil in 1987

du pont co has received a patent on a 
compound blend that could accelerate the replacement of halogenated 
chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs which damage the earths ozone layer 
a spokesman said tuesday 
the company said the threecomponent blends of environmentally 
acceptable compounds will have no adverse effects on the 
environment compared to cfc12 one of the products suspected of 
depleting the ozone layer 
du pont is the largest maker of cfcs in the world and has said it 
will cease making the chemicals by the end of the century 
scientists say cfcs have the potential to damage the environment 
including decreasing the ozone layer a shield that protects the 
earth from ultraviolet light 
under the montreal protocol treaty countries producing cfcs have 
agreed to reduce cfc production by 50 percent by 1998 the united 
states has signed the agreement 
the new blends could be used for existing mediumtemperature food 
display cases vending machines water coolers home refrigerators 
and freezers and automobile air conditioners all of which make up 
about 30 percent of the cfc market in the united states 
the new blends would gradually be placed in items that use cfcs 
as they wear out otherwise we would not be able to phase out 
production of cfcs until all the equipment was off the market 
said tony mccain du pont manager of the alternative development

we will still work to find an alternative for new equipment 
this would go in parallel with it he said 
we have received a patent on the technology which says the 
blend works but it will take a couple of years to test it in 
operating systems to define all the changes that might be required 
in a refrigerator or car and then we have to finish the process 
development mccain said 
the new technology was made public monday at a meeting of the 
american society of heating refrigeration and air conditioning 
engineers in chicago 
candidate components for the blends include hcfc22 hfc152a and

mccain said hcfc124 is a new product 
mix those three together and you get something very close to 
what we had with cfc12 as far as performance he said 
mccain said the blends were more energy efficient than hfc134a

car dealers from both sides of the world have 
some straightforward advice for their us friends learn how to 
sell used cars 
more than 100 auto dealers and manufacturers representatives from 
16 foreign countries were among thousands of us automobile dealers 
who attended the 72nd annual convention of the national automobile 
dealers association which ended tuesday 
visiting dealers from australia and england with almost the same 
words said they were struck by how little attention us dealers 
paid to selling cars that have some miles on them 
you have no idea how to sell a used car said bruce white a 
nissan dealer from melbourne australia i think we can teach the 
americans how to sell them 
i think we can sell a used car better than you can said 
ashley winter a ford dealer from newcastle england 
in separate interviews white and winter said usedcar sales make 
up half or more of their dealership volumes and speculated that the 
difference may be because us drivers dont treat their cars as 
well 
nada figures show that usedcar sales accounted for 63 percent 
of all vehicle sales in the united states in 1987 the latest year 
for which figures are available 
two us auto dealers said the proliferation of usedcar auction 
houses and usedcar businesses not affiliated with a franchised 
operation is probably the reason 
john bayer of dudley mass who sells pontiac cadillac and 
oldsmobile cars said there was discussion at the nada convention 
about preparing a car for resale 
bayer and steve grindstaff owner of grindstaff chevrolet in 
elizabethton tenn said in interviews that the condition of a 
tradein is a major consideration of whether the car is kept on the 
dealers usedcar lot or sold elsewhere 
prices also are a big difference in cars sold in the united 
states and overseas the dealers said governmental regulations and 
duties jack up the prices of cars in australia sometimes by 100 
percent white said 
he added the regulations also make some vehicles too expensive 
for him and his fellow dealers to handle 
wed love to have these vans white said after seeing some of 
the customized van conversion displays on the nada show floor but 
you cant get them in

percent in december marking a departure from the general 
sluggishness of 1988 according to a report tuesday 
despite its strong finish 1988 was a year of generally 
softening construction activity as the value of all newly started 
work fell 2 percent short of the 1987 peak george a christie 
vice president and chief economist of fw dodge group said in a 
statement 
christie said the 1988 decline ended a fiveyear period of 
continuously expanding construction contracting he predicted the 
market would decline again this year 
the big factors in the drop were overbuilt commercial properties 
and limited public funding according to fw dodge a unit of 
mcgrawhill inc an additional factor this year is higher interest 
rates christie said 
construction of highways and other public works projects 
contributed to an 18 percent increase in the nonbuilding category 
in december over november for the year the category fell 1 percent 
from 1987 
residential building rose 7 percent in december but was about 
even for the year 
contracting for nonresidential buildings rose 4 percent in

the billionaire bass brothers are often 
described as classic passive investors but their business ventures 
have kept them among the nations 400 richest people 
the bass dynasty traces its roots to the forays of wildcatter sid 
richardson who made a series of successful oil strikes in west 
texas upon his death in 1959 he willed most of his money to his 
partner and nephew perry bass 
after vastly expanding richardsons holdings perry retired in 
the late 1960s and left the family empire to his four sons who each 
inherited 28 million they combined assets to form bass brothers 
enterprises which was managed by eldest son sid bass 
with bold moves from the oil patch into stocks and real estate 
the brothers added to their collective and individual fortunes 
among their most lucrative ventures the basses netted an 850 
million capital gain after helping to thwart a 1985 takeover fight 
for walt disney co also that year the family liquidated bass 
brothers enterprises its primary investment vehicle and divided 
the assets four ways freeing the brothers to cut some individual 
deals 
since then robert bass has focused much of his energy on the 
information sector in 1985 he led a group that made a 205 million 
investment in cincinnatibased taft broadcasting co that was worth 
718 million two years later he and two other shareholders divided 
tafts assets with the bass group getting 1575 million in cash a 
television station in columbus ohio and two large cable television 
properties 
in 1988 robert bass was instrumental in prying away the westin 
hotel chain from allegis corp for 153 billion in march he sold 
the plaza hotel in manhattan to fellow billionaire donald j trump 
for 410 million 
last may 17 he reached an agreement to purchase bell amp howell 
co a publishing information services company in skokie ill 
on the same day a group that he led proposed to buy macmillan 
inc the move put the publishing giant in play and it was acquired 
last fall by british publisher robert maxwell for 25 billion and 
gave the bass group a gain of about 75 million on its holdings 
before expenses 
most recently the bass group put up 350 million for the bailout 
of insolvent american savings and loan association of california a 
subsidiary of financial corp of america 
the brothers zealously guard their privacy persistently refusing 
interviews and shunning transactions that would require much 
financial disclosure 
they have been described as atypical texas tycoons with their 
conservative style and reserved manner in fort worth they are 
universally revered for their civic investments 
sid is director of the generous sid richardson foundation ed 
often described as the family maverick has been more interested in 
arts and environmental projects lee is working with sid while 
robert has taken an interest in some political projects 
the big difference in the basses and most people like the 
basses is that theyre really not looking for any credit for what 
they do they do it because they think its what they should do and 
whats good said dee kelly a fort worth lawyer and longtime 
family friend 
despite their financial muscle the basses arent the 
strongarming type preferring to work with the management of target 
companies as they did in the disney situation checchi noted

foreign investment in the united states which 
soared to a record of 581 billion reported in 1987 is set to go 
even higher for 1988 according to richard apcar director of 
investment analysis at the commerce department 
how much the increase will be depends on the data were still 
collecting for the last few months of the year he said in an 
interview tuesday 
it was about 30 billion for the first half of 1988 and id 
guess about 20 billion for the first half of 1987 
actual investment figures are much larger for more than half the 
deals reported the department could not find any figure at all 
the biggest takeover in 1988 was the acquisition of federated 
department stores the fifth largest us retailer by campeau corp 
of toronto canada that was about 66 billion 
in 1987 british petroleum co spent nearly 8 billion for the 45 
percent of standard oil co that it did not already own that put 
the total of british acquisitions for the year at 212 billion 
figures were identified for only 117 of the 249 transactiona 
as has been the case for the past three years japan was the most 
active investor with 490 separate deals of these 235 carried 
idenifiable prices totalling 13 billion 
while japan will continue to be the source for most asian 
investments for the foreseeable future it is interesting to note 
that other asianpacific investors especially from australia and 
new zealand have increased their activity here the number of 
transactions doubled and the value quadrupled in 1987 said the 
commerce departments report 
it was issued last friday 
foreign investment makes an important contribution to the us 
economy michael boskin named by president george bush as his top 
economic adviser said last week 
by helping to build productive plant and equipment in the 
united states foreign investment contributes to current and future 
increases in jobs productivity and growth 
concerns about foreign ownership are somewhat exaggerated by 
the end of 1987 measured net foreign assets in the united states 
amounted to some 31 percent of us netwealth on an historical cost 
basis 
the commerce departments report said the trend toward the growth 
of foreign investment began in 1983 with the recovery from the 
recession of the previous two years the total number of deals had 
peaked at about 1200 in 1981 and then dropped sharply in 1987 the 
total was 1328 with values reported for 588 of them that was an 
increase of 26 percent over the year before 
the report attributed the big rise since 1983 to 
the drop in the international price of the dollar after 1985 
which made it cheaper for foreigners to buy in this country 
eagerness by many american firms to become more profitable and 
avoid takeovers by getting rid of divisions and subsidiaries they no 
longer wanted 
tthe belief by foreign investors that they must invest in the 
worlds largest consumer market in order to stay competiive in the 
world 
boskin said that although the united states has become a debtor 
country with larger assets owned here by foreigners than 
americans own in other countries us direct investment in actual 
property and equipment remains greater than foreign direct 
investment in the united states the figures are reversed when 
indirect investments such as stocks and bonds are tasken into 
account

general motors corp and lawyers representing 
thousands of black employees in michigan ohio and indiana announced 
tuesday they had tentatively settled a bias suit against the 
automaker that could give the plaintiffs payments totaling 3 
million 
the two sides agreed upon a proposed consent decree to end the 
case but gm did not admit it had discriminated against blacks in 
promotions and pay raises company spokeswoman patricia j molloy 
said 
the proposal provides for distribution of 16 million to about 
2800 former gm employees and raises averaging 1000 a year for 
about 1000 current employees plaintiffs attorney dennis d james 
said 
james told a news conference the proposed decree also requires 
five years of monitoring to ensure that black salaried employees get 
their fair share of promotions and pay increases 
sheldon miller another attorney for the plaintiffs said the 
tentative agreement reaffirms the importance of classaction civil 
rights litigation especially in the current unfriendly political 
climate towards civil rights in general 
the suit filed in 1983 by four employees was a class action on 
behalf of 10000 salaried black employees who worked for gm between 
1982 and 1986 in michigan indiana and ohio 
those states were chosen for the suit because gm employees there 
made a manageablesized group for the legal action and because gm 
plants and offices in those states account for 75 percent of the 
companys salaried employees james said 
members of the class will be notified of the proposed agreement 
over the next two weeks and be given a chance to lodge any 
objections they may have us district judge john feikens then will 
schedule a hearing on whether the decree should be approved james 
said 
the decree was submitted to feikens about two weeks ago and 
feikens gave his preliminary approval tuesday james said 
this will help blacks to achieve a more equitable position in 
upper management and also middle management said the rev james 
kennedy one of the four original plaintiffs 
kennedy now pastor of mount carmel baptist church in flint was 
employed at gms ac sparkplug subsidiary in flint

sales engineer at gms allison transmission subsidiary in 
indianapolis and larry kitchen an employee of gms 
chevroletpontiacgm of canada group in detroit who both reported

federal aviation officials ordered airlines 
tuesday to inspect all of four types of boeing airliners built in 
the last eight years after wiring mixups were found on four more 
planes 
in its most farreaching order to date on the possibility of 
crosswiring and crossplumbing in airline safety systems the 
federal aviation administration gave airlines 25 days to complete 
the testing of both engine and cargo hold safety systems in 741 
aircraft 
this will easily affect most airlines said faa spokesman 
fred farrar the inspections were ordered for 472 boeing 737s 33 
jumbo 747s 123 757s and 113 767s manufactured after dec 31 1980 
previous faa orders prompted by the discovery of fouledup wiring 
or plumbing in several boeing aircraft throughout the world were 
limited only to plumbing and wiring on individual types of airliners 
wiring and plumbing problems became the subject of faa orders 
after british authorities speculated the pilot of a british midland 
airways 737 was deceived into shutting down his only good engine in 
a crash that killed 44 people in england jan 8 
authorities have not concluded what caused both engines to be 
shut down in the british plane but since the crash crosswiring of 
engine or cargo hold fire warning systems has been found in other 
planes 
inspections ordered earlier by british authorities covered airbus 
a320s as well as boeing 737s but faulty wiring has been found only 
in boeing aircraft all of which are built in seattle 
boeing spokesman david jiminez said the aircraft builder had no 
immediate comment on the latest order officials of boeing and 
several airlines had said they agreed with previous orders as 
prudent measures to ensure safety 
the newly ordered tests are not expected to disrupt airline 
schedules and can be completed anytime over the next 3 weeks while 
the airliners are undergoing routine maintenance 
under the airworthiness directive issued by the faas seattle 
office airlines are ordered to repair and report any defects to the 
faa 
farrar said the four additional problems were found either during 
work done under previous directives or in independent testing by 
airlines 
they included faulty wiring on three 757s he said including one 
case of an incomplete circuit that would have kept a fire 
extinguisher from operating and two cases of crosswiring one would 
have indicated the wrong engine was overheating and the other would 
have set off the fire extinguisher to the wrong engine farrar said 
the fourth case involved crosswiring that would have indicated 
fire in the wrong engine of a 737 he said 
farrar said that while foreign airlines flying boeing aircraft 
are not required to follow the directives most of them will conduct 
the tests

implicated in the ivan boesky insider trading scandal testified for 
the government at the first trial which began in december

centaur partners stymied in its 765 million 
effort to buy pennwalt corp said tuesday that holders of more than 
34 percent of pennwalts stock have called for a shareholders 
meeting at which centaur hoped to replace the chemical companys 
board 
centaur said it had delivered to pennwalt proxies from 
shareholders owning approximately 346 percent of pennwalts 
outstanding stock under pennsylvania law a special meeting must be 
called if one is requested by the holders of at least 20 percent of 
a companys outstanding voting stock 
state law requires the company to call the meeting within two 
months of the request centaur said 
pennwalt officials said they were in the process of reviewing 
the demands to determine whether they have been submitted by the 
requisite shareholders and whether they are in a form that would be 
effective 
at the meeting centaur said pennwalt shareholders would be 
asked to remove the directors reduce the board from 11 to five 
members and eliminate the requirement that directors also be 
shareholders 
in addition the shareholders would be asked to elect five new 
directors proposed by centaur 
candidates nominated by centaur would likely be more sympathetic 
to the partnerships offer 
centaur whoise principals are new york financiers abbey j 
butler and melvyn j estrin launched a 100ashare bid in 
middecember for the 698 million shares of common stock it did not 
own at the time the group owned about 127 percent of pennwalts 
shares 
in an effort to thwart the bid pennwalt spent 4038 million to 
buy 475 million shares or about 40 percent of those outstanding 
pennwalt stock closed tuesday at 106 a share up 25 cents in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
pennwalt is fighting the centaur bid in court claiming 
disclosures made by the group in its tender offer and the 
solicitation of proxies from pennwalts shareholders were false and 
misleading

banks and savings institutions were braced 
tuesday for a possible proposal from the bush administration to 
raise their insurance premiums as a way to rescue the government 
fund that insures savings and loan associations 
a white house official said tuesday night the prevailing thought 
in the administration is that such an approach is one of the more 
attractive solutions 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
increased risk for the insurer should translate into higher premiums 
for the institutions 
white house officials were convened in a meeting late tuesday by 
chief of staff john sununu in a meeting that focused on what 
recommendations to make to bush on the sampl situation 
things are a little scary to us said kenneth a guenther 
executive vice president of the independent bankers association of 
america 
guenther said he interpreted comments over the weekend by sununu 
as indicating the administration was backing away from its 
controversial suggestion that depositors pay a fee of about 25 cents 
on every 100 in their accounts 
meanwhile several members of the senate banking committee called 
for a quick infusion of 2 billion into the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp so that regulators could liquidate more insolvent 
sampls while congress debates proposed reforms 
sununu responding to questions in a sunday television interview 
had defended the deposit fee idea as if he were talking about an 
increase in the premium that institutions have been paying since 
1934 
he seemed to be moving away from a deposit fee to an increase 
in banks premiums guenther said in an interview 
senior administration officials are saying they will urge 
president bush to propose a premium hike rather than a fee aid by 
depositors according to tuesdays editions of the new york times 
which cited unidentified sources and nbc news 
bush intends to present at least an outline of his sampl plan when 
he addresses congress on feb 9 so far he has indicated no 
preference among the many options 
if i were to make a prediction my guess is those premiums are 
going up said sen phil gramm rtexas somebodys going to end 
up having to pay them my guess is it will probably be the 
institutions but the depositors will pay them indirectly 
well bury this deposit fee proposal on the one hand and dig 
it up through another hole he said 
the administration has told members of congress it likely will 
propose selling bonds for about 45 billion the difficulty comes in 
raising the 7 billion to 9 billion needed each year to pay off the 
bonds 
the sampl industry and many members of congress advocate using tax 
money an alternative the bush administration is trying to avoid 
guenther said an increase in premiums for both banks and sampls 
would be unfair because about twothirds of the money generated for 
sampls would come from banks 
he estimated that a 25cent increase in banks 83cent premium 
would push as many as 750 profitable banks into the red to the 
extent that banks and sampls pass on the cost to their customers 
through lower interest rates on deposits it would encourage 
depositors to put their money in uninsured money market mutual funds 
offered by brokerage firms he said 
the us league of savings institutions the largest sampl trade 
association has said it cannot pay more toward the fslics problems 
and at the same time raise more capital from investors as a buffer 
between losses and insured deposits 
at the congressional hearings sen christopher dodd dconn 
noting an estimate that insolvent sampls are losing 1 billion a 
month said congress should give regulators about 2 billion 
immediately so they can liquidate some institutions rather than 
rescuing them with promissory notes and loss guarantees 
i have to believe that an immediate infusion of about 2 
billion for the next six months or so would save us money in the 
long run he said 
sen alfonse damato rny agreed saying its probably 
going to be six seven eight months at best until congress acts 
on a reform package 
sen alan cranston dcalif while not specifically backing 
dodds proposal said i think we have to consider acting more 
rapidly 
the committee chairman sen donald w riegle dmich is 
against spending any money on the problem without tying it to 
reforms needed to prevent the problem from reoccurring but he said 
regulators were free to ask congress for more money 
william fulwider a spokesman for the federal home loan bank 
board said the agency would wait until the bush administration 
presented its proposal before deciding whether to ask congress for 
interim financing 
the bank board has already advocated that congress allow it to 
speed up the sale of the remaining 5 billion in previously 
authorized bonds rather than spread the borrowing through 1990 as 
now required
