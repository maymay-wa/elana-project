moderator andrea mitchell has a question for you governor 
dukakis 
dukakis i beg your pardon 
moderator andrea mitchell has a question for you sir 
q while were talking about issues so lets return to 
something you said earlier about the modernization of landbased 
missiles you said that you didnt rule it out but that there are 
limits to what we can spend and then you went on to talk about a 
much more expensive part of our defense strategy namely 
conventional forces do you somehow see conventional forces as a 
substitute for our strategic forces and in not talking about the 
landbased missiles and not committing to modernizing do you 
somehow believe that we can have a survivable nuclear force based 
on the air and sea legs of our triad 
dukakis i think we ought to be looking at modernization i 
think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on 
land and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and 
strong and credible nuclear deterrent but we also need 
wellequipped and welltrained and wellsupported conventional 
forces and every defense expert i know including people in the 
pentagon itself will tell you that given the level of defense 
spending and the level of defense appropriations which the congress 
has now approved and the president has signed theres no way that 
you can do all of these things and do them well thats why tough 
choices will be required choices im prepared to make mr bush is 
not prepared to make 
but andrea i think we can go far beyond this as well because we 
have opportunities now step by step to bring down the level of 
strategic weapons and get a test ban treaty negotiate those 
conventional force reductions i would challenge mr gorbachev to 
join with us in limiting and eliminating regional conflict in the 
middle east in central america lets get him working on syria 
their client state and see if we cant get them to join israel and 
other arab nations if at all possible and arab leaders in 
finally bringing peace to that troubled region and i think thats 
one reason why we need fresh leadership in the white house that can 
make progress now in bringing peace to the middle east 
lets go to work and end this fiasco in central america a 
failed policy which has actually increased cuban and soviet 
influence the democratic leaders of central and latin america want 
to work with us ive met with them i know them ive spent time 
in south america i speak the language so does senator bentsen we 
want to work with them and build a new relationship and they with 
us but not a one of those key democratic leaders support our 
policy in central america and weve got to work with them if were 
going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for 
the people of this hemisphere and go to work on our single most 
important problem and that is the avalanche of drugs that is 
pouring into our country and virtually destroying those countries 
those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for 
foreign policy that i want to pursue mr bush and i have major 
differences on these issues 
moderator governor 
dukakis and i hope very much to be president and pursue them 
moderator mr vice president you have one minute 
bush in terms of regional tensions we have now gotten the 
attention of the soviet union and the reason weve gotten it is 
because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of 
unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the 
discredited freeze my opponent had trouble criticized us on our 
policy in angola it now looks because of steady negotiation that 
we may have an agreement that will remove the cubans from angola 
we see the russians coming out of afghanistan that wouldnt 
have stopped if we hadnt been willing wouldnt have even 
started the soviets coming out if we hadnt even been willing to 
support the freedom fighters there and the policy in central 
america regrettably has failed because the congress has been 
unwilling to support those who have been fighting for freedom 
those sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution 
they said it was about democracy and they have done nothing other 
than solidify their marxist domination over that country

moderator anne compton for governor dukakis 
q governor nuclear weapons need nuclear material replenished 
on a regular basis and just this week yet another nuclear 
manufacturing plant was closed because of safety concerns some in 
the pentagon fear that too much priority has been put on new 
weapons programs not enough on current programs and worry that 
the resulting shortage would be amounting to nothing less than 
unilateral nuclear disarmament 
is that a priority that you feel has been ignored by this 
administration or are the pentagon officials making too much of it 
dukakis well its a great concern of mine and i think of all 
americans and perhaps the vice president can tell us whats been 
going on this is another example of misplaced priorities 
the administration which wants to spend billions on weapons 
systems that we dont need and cant afford and now confronts us 
with a very serious problem in plants that are supposed to be 
producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary 
materials for existing weapons 
yes if we dont do something about it we may find ourselves 
unilaterally if i may use that term dismantling some of these 
weapons whats been going on whos been in charge whos been 
managing this system why have there been these safety violations 
why are these plants being closed down i dont know what the 
latest cost estimates are but its going to be in the range of 
twentyfive fifty seventyfive one hundred billion dollars now 
somebody has to bear the responsibility for this 
maybe the vice president has an answer but im somebody who 
believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first 
before you start new stuff and thats something which will be a 
priority of ours in the new administration because without it we 
cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent 
we must have 
moderator mr vice president you have one minute 
bush that is the closest ive ever heard the governor of 
massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear 
thats about as close as ive ever heard him yes this savannah 
river plant needs to be made more safe will he join me in 
suggesting that we may need another plant maybe in idaho to take 
care of the requirements nuclear material requirements for our 
defense department i hope he will 
this sounds like real progress here because weve had a big 
difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base i 
believe that we must use clean safe nuclear power i believe that 
we the more dependent we become on foreign oil the less our 
national security is enhanced and therefore ive made some 
proposals to strengthen the domestic oil industry by more 
incentive going in to look for and find and produce oil made him 
some incentives in terms of secondary and tertiary production but 
were going to have to use more gas more coal and more safe 
nuclear power for our energy base so i am one who believes that 
we can and must 
moderator mr vice president 
bush do what hes talking about now

both george bush and michael dukakis recounted 
poignant stories about children they had lost as they sought during 
thursday nights debate to justify their opposing views on abortion 
bush was asked why a woman should be forced to carry a fetus to 
term if she knows it will be born with an illness that consigns it 
to a brief pained existence 
bush who opposes abortion except in cases of incest rape or 
when a mothers life is endangered began his answer by cautioning 
i hope it doesnt get too personal or maudlin bar and i lost a 
child you know that we lost a daughter robin 
the child died of leukemia before she turned 4 
bush said that if the baby were alive today that child could 
stay alive for 10 or 15 years or maybe for the rest of her life 
and so i dont think that you make an exception based on medical 
knowledge at the time i think human life is very very precious 
dukakis in his response to bushs answer said he and his wife 
kitty had very much the same kind of experience that the bushes 
had we lost a baby lived about 20 minutes after it was born 
but dukakis went on to say that isnt the real question that 
we have to answer who makes the decision who makes this very 
difficult very wrenching decision 
he continued i think it has to be the woman in the exercise 
of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that 
decision who are we to say well under certain circumstances 
its all right but under other circumstances it isnt 
mrs dukakis who became pregnant early in 1964 believes she 
must have had german measles during the first trimester of her 
pregnancy the day after a checkup during her seventh month of 
pregnancy she went into premature labor the baby girl who lived 
just 20 minutes was anencephalic and would have been gravely 
handicapped had she survived

q anne compton has a question for you 
q mr vice president as many as 100 officials in this 
administration have left the government under an ethical cloud 
some have been indicted some convicted many of the cases have 
involved undue influence once they are outside of government if 
you become president will you lock that revolving door that has 
allowed some men and women in the government to come back and lobby 
the very departments they once managed 
bush yes and ill apply it to congress too ill do both ill 
do both because i think you see i am one who i get kidded by 
being a little old fashioned on these things but i do believe in 
public service i believe that public service is honorable and i 
dont think anybody has a has a call on people and their 
administrations going astray his chief education advisor is in 
jail hes in jail because he betrayed the public trust the head 
of education 
and yet this man the governor equated the president to a 
rotting fish he said that a fish rots from the head down as 
he was going after ed meese look we need the highest possible 
ethical standards i will have an ethical office in the white house 
that will be under the presidents personal concern i will see 
that these standards apply to the united states congress i hope i 
will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record 
with no conflicts of interest in his own public life as has the 
governor to exort young people to get into public service 
but there is no corner on on this sleaze factor believe me 
and its a disgrace and i will do my level best to clean it up 
recognizing that you cant legislate morality but i do believe 
that with my record in congress having led the new congressmen to a 
code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full 
disclosure that ive got a good record and there are more if you 
want to talk about percentage appointments more members of 
congress who have been under investigation percentage wise than 
people in the executive branch and so it isnt want state 
governments have had a tough time his some of his college 
presidents arent exactly holier than thou so lets not be 
throwing stones about it lets say this isnt democrat or 
republican and it isnt liberal or conservative lets vow to work 
together to do something about it 
q governor you have one minute to respond 
dukakis well i would agree that integrity is not a republican 
or a democratic issue it is an american issue but here again i 
dont know which george bush im listening to wasnt this the mr 
bush that supported mr meese called james watt an excellent 
secretary of the interior provided support for some of these 
people supported the nomination of robert bork to the supreme 
court of the united states weve had dozens weve had dozens and 
dozens of officials in this administration who have left under a 
cloud who have left with a special prosecutor on their arm 
theyve been indicted convicted 
this isnt the kind of administration we need and one of the 
reasons our selection of a running mate is so important and is such 
a test of the kinds of standards well set is because it tells the 
american people in advance of the election just what kind of people 
were looking for i picked lloyd bentsen mr bush picked dan 
quaid dan quayle i think that says a great deal to the american 
people about the standards well set and the quality of the people 
that we will pick to serve in our administration

moderator to each of you candidates regrettably i have to 
inform you that we have come to the end of our questions thats a 
pity before i ask the candidates to make their closing remarks on 
behalf of the commission on presidential debates i would like to 
thank all of you for joining us this evening governor dukakis 
yours is the first closing statement sir 
dukakis twentyeight years ago as a young man just graduated 
from law school i came to this city came clear across the country 
to watch john kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the united 
states right here in los angeles 
i never dreamed that someday i would win that nomination and be 
my partys nominee for president thats america thats why im 
proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country 
twentysix days from today you and millions of americans will 
choose two people to lead us into the future as president and vice 
president of the united states our opponents say things are 
okay dont rock the boat not to worry they say we should be 
satisfied 
but i dont think we can be satisfied when were spending 150 
billion a year in interest alone on the national debt much of it 
going to foreign bankers or when 25 percent of our high school 
students are dropping out of school or when we have two and a half 
million of our fellow citizens a third of them veterans who are 
homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country or 
when mr bushs prescription for our economic future is another tax 
giveaway to the rich 
we can do better than that not working with government alone 
but all of us working together lloyd bentsen and i are optimists 
and so are the american people and we ask you for our hand for 
your hands and your hearts and your votes on the 8th of november so 
we can move forward into the future kitty and i are very grateful 
to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that youve given 
to us in your homes and communities all across this country we 
love you and were grateful to you for everything that youve 
given to us and we hope that well be serving you in the white 
house in january of 1989 thank you and god bless you

moderator vice president bush your closing statement sir 
bush sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat 
than light and so let me repeat i do have respect for my 
opponent for his family for the justifiable pride he takes in his 
heritage 
but we have enormous differences i want to hold the line on 
taxes and keep this the longest expansion in modern history going 
until everybody in america benefits i want to invest in our 
children because i mean it when i say i want a kinder and gentler 
nation and by that i want to have child care where the families 
the parents have control 
i want to keep our neighborhoods much much better in terms of 
anticrime and thats why i would appoint judges that have a 
little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for 
the criminals thats why i do feel if some police officer is 
gunned down that the death penalty is required i want to help 
those with disabilities fit into the mainstream 
there is much to be done this election is about big things and 
perhaps the biggest is world peace and i ask you to consider the 
experience i have had in working with a president who has 
revolutionized the situation around the world america stands tall 
again and as a result we are credible and we have now achieved a 
historic arms control agreement 
i want to build on that id love to be able to say to my 
grandchildren four years after my first term id like to say 
your grandfather working with the leaders of the soviet union 
working with the leaders of europe was able to ban chemical and 
biological weapons from the face of the earth 
lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth 
and he was right then and we still are the last best hope of man 
on earth and i ask for your support on november 8th and i will be 
a good president working together we can do wonderful things for 
the united states and for the free world 
thank you very very much

politicians from both parties said the rival presidential 
candidates seemed more at ease in thursdays debate than in their 
first encounter but most agreed that michael dukakis failed to 
deliver the knockout he needed against vice president george 
bush 
in the debate itself there was no clear winner but in the 
continuing war bush continues to lead said republican rep john 
rowland of connecticut this was dukakis chance for a knockout 
blow and he merely danced in the ring 
democratic sen alan dixon of illinois said dukakis won on 
issues answers about social security gun control and the 
environment 
but dixon also said there was no youre no jack kennedy 
tonight referring to a remark seen by many as a telling blow 
that texas sen lloyd bentsen made in his debate with republican 
vice presidential candidate indiana sen dan quayle 
one democrat who gave the edge to bush was former sen thomas 
eagleton of missouri who was george mcgoverns running mate in 
1972 until he withdrew from the ticket after it became known he had 
undergone shock treamtents for psychiatric problems 
the one home run i heard was bushs said eagleton when 
they asked who their heroes were dukakis was wandering all over 
the stage bush with two minutes to think about it came up with 
some solid candidates and ended up with the president 
jack richardson hawaii state democratic party chairman agreed 
there was no knockout blow by governor dukakis but the governor 
definitely won 
and a knockout blow was just what some observers said dukakis 
needed with predebate polls giving bush a narrow lead among 
voters nationwide and a strong lead for electoral votes analysts 
had seen thursdays final facetoface contest as perhaps dukakis 
best chance to change voters minds before the election nov 8 
dukakis had to do something dramatic and i dont think he did 
it i dont think he laid a glove on bush said ellen sauerbrey 
gop state delegate from maryland i think barring some unforeseen 
gaffe in the next couple weeks or a major worldshattering event i 
think the election is over this was dukakis last chance to really 
turn public opinion 
its over the election is over agreed claibourne darden 
an atlantabased political pollster bush did extremely well 
much better than he did last time which wasnt real good 
dukakis also did well attempting to add and was successful to a 
moderate extent a human feeling and sense of emotion to his 
character both were successful and consequently the odds of 
george bush losing have become extremely little 
most republican observers were clearly delighted about bushs 
performance and even found room to praise dukakis 
let me pay my respects to michael dukakis for a very fine 
debate but on the political points i think bush clearly won 
said rep jack kemp rny 
said gordon durnil chairman of indiana republican party that 
was the absolute best debate performance by anyone ive sever seen 
by george bush it was a home run for him 
both candidates were more relaxed and perhaps more confident 
than before said massachusetts republican state sen david 
locke the state bush cochair however governor dukakis 
despite performing well failed to provide the american people with 
any reason to change the direction in which were going 
but some elected officials were not excited by what they saw 
from either candidate 
montanas democratic gov ted schwinden said i honestly dont 
know who the winner is but i know who the loser is the ones of 
us who watch 
its getting to the point of whos the best actor on stage and 
thats a long way from answering who will be the next president 
schwinden said

police using federal and local laws to create 
drug free zones around schools swept through neighborhoods 
thursday and arrested 83 people and confiscated drugs and guns 
including an ak47 assault rifle 
the 12hour sweep was conducted by 250 police officers who posed 
as drug buyers near 15 elementary and junior high schools 
people are shocked to learn that most heavy drug trafficking 
areas in los angeles are around our schools said district 
attorney ira reiner after the sweep 
the youngest person arrested was 14 and perhaps the craftiest 
was a 17yearold alleged drug dealer who had adults working for 
him said deputy chief glenn levant 
ten guns including the assault rifle were seized along with 
155 grams of rock cocaine the smokable form also known as crack 
levant said 
us attorney robert bonner said 29 of those arrested during the 
action will be investigated for violating a federal law against 
selling illegal drugs within 1000 feet of a school the charge 
carries a minimum sentence of one year in prison and a maximum of 
40 years 
the remaining cases will be investigated by the district 
attorney he said he estimated that about 35 percent of the 
suspects are gang members 
this is a program designed to foster and create drugfree 
zones around our schools bonner said

presidential rivals george bush and michael 
dukakis thursday night gave american voters a review of familiar 
themes providing little drama in a debate that apparently went the 
republican way 
drama was not what bush needed to protect his lead in the polls 
it was dukakis who needed a high voltage performance to propel his 
democratic candidacy it never happened 
as in their first debate the republican vice president was more 
animated and smiled more easily than did his democratic rival a 
fact that polls suggested tilted viewers his way during their sept 
25 confrontation 
abcs instant poll following this second televised confrontation 
indicated a lopsided preference for bush and an associated press 
panel of debate experts likewise delivered a verdict for the 
republican the first time around the same judges decided for 
dukakis 
in a sense it was clear the two candidates had learned from the 
first debate that they would be judged on two levels not only on 
what they said but how they said it on such intangible factors as 
body language 
bush rarely looked directly into the television camera and as a 
result appeared looser and more relaxed in contrast dukakis 
consistently stared directly into the camera which made him appear 
stiff 
both campaigns moved to take the initiative on the issue field 
before the candidates ever stepped on stage 
an hour before the first question was posed bush aides passed 
out among the press seven pages of material anticipating some 
dukakis points and attempting to refute them 
they were followed soon after by dukakis aides who passed out 13 
pages entitled the record of vice president bush missions 
assigned missions failed 
once the debate began the candidates were on familiar terrain 
liberal liberal liberal was bushs favorite way of 
referring to his democratic rival 
if i had a dollar george for every time you used that label 
id qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want 
to give away said dukakis getting off one of his best lines of 
the evening 
the first question to dukakis concerned his opposition to the 
death penalty and he quickly shifted the subject to drugs and made 
his familiar pledge to wage a real war and not a phony war 
against drugs 
and of course the debate no sooner ended than the partisans of 
both candidates swarmed into the press room to declare their 
favorite the winner and to claim the liability factor about 
which much was made after the first debate 
democratic sen alan cranston of california said dukakis 
overcame the impression some people have had that hes too cold 
hes not a cold guy hes a warm guy 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman who played the 
role of dukakis during bush debate preparations said that on the 
question of likability he thought dukakis didnt help himself 
tonight probably that he hurt himself a little bit 
how people judge smiles body language gestures and tone of 
voice and how it affects their decisions on how to vote is one of 
the great mysteries of politics 
before the final debate dukakis claimed victory for his ticket 
in the first two confrontations his own with bush and the meeting 
between democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen and his 
gop rival dan quayle 
but if that were correct the opinion polls were suggesting that 
despite democratic victories in the debates republicans were 
gaining in the polls 
quayle is viewed by the dukakis campaign and its supporters as 
one of their strongest assets an issue of great concern to voters 
but quayle didnt prove to be a compelling issue in the final 
debate 
the first question to bush dealt with his choice of a running 
mate and he responded with a strong defense of his choice that 
echoed some of the words he used to defend the indiana senator 
during the first debate

george bush won his second and final debate 
with michael dukakis by hammering at foreign policy issues an 
associated press panel of debate judges said thursday night 
some 639 voters polled by abc news immediately after the debate 
also gave the nod to the vice president with 49 percent saying 
bush won and only 33 percent giving the edge to dukakis 18 percent 
called it a tie the survey had a 4 point margin of error 
the ap panel scored it a 145141 win for bush reversing the 
outcome of the first presidential debate which the ap judges 
scored 144141 for dukakis five of the six judges called bush the 
winner one sided with dukakis 
abc also asked its survey group before and after the debate who 
they planned to vote for beforehand they favored bush 5343 with 
4 percent undecided afterwards they backed bush 5444 with 2 
percent still undecided 
among the ap judges donn parson director of graduate study in 
the university of kansas department of communication studies 
said dukakis did a very poor job in answering the foreign policy 
issues bush made good use of dukakis support for a nuclear 
freeze 
james j unger director of the national forensics institute at 
american university in washington and chairman of the ap panel 
said george bush won it dukakis concern for an election 
breakthrough too often led to a debate breakdown on issues such as 
deficit control defense policy and social programs 
william southworth director of forensics and professor of 
speech at the university of redlands calif said it was 
catastrophic that dukakis could not counter bushs argument 
that you must negotiate out of strength with the russians the 
question was raised about six different ways and dukakis 
still had no answer southworth said 
melissa maxcy wade the director of forensics at emory 
university in atlanta said bush was playing a foreign policy 
theme a world peace theme that went through the whole thing 
bush is not an organized debater but tonight his confidence made a 
difference 
steven p mancuso director of intercollegiate forensics for the 
university of michigan the sole judge to pick dukakis said he 
thought the massachusetts governor successfully countered bushs 
use of the label liberal and painted bush as being 
complacent 
james m copeland national executive secretary of the national 
forensic league in ripon wis said at the end of the debate 
whether you liked it or didnt like it you knew what bushs 
position was dukakis just seemed to lack focus 
copeland added the whole debate was truly a mess as a debate 
coach for 25 years im sorry to say that bush certainly spoke the 
truth when he said there should be no more debates there certainly 
should be no more like this last one 
the ap judges last week called democrat lloyd bentsen the 
winner 148125 over republican dan quayle in their vice 
presidential debate 
the judges watched the debate on television using a scorecard 
modeled after the american forensic association debate ballot for 
collegiate and scholastic debates 
they awarded one to five points in each of six categories 
reasoning evidence organization refutation crossexamination 
and presentation a 1 was poor 2 fair 3 average 4 excellent and 
5 superior 
each judge could award a maximum of 30 points a perfect score 
would have been 180 
here are the candidates combined scores

ian smith rhodesias last white prime 
minister remains convinced nearly a decade later that he was right 
to fight a futile and bloody battle to avert black rule in what is 
now zimbabwe 
you think just because i havent been killed theres a 
democracy smith says of his southern african homeland 
zimbabwe is widely regarded as a black african success story 
under president robert mugabe the guerrilla leader who took over 
in 1980 in a britishmediated settlement granting independence to 
its last african colony 
smith once grabbed world headlines but now lectures to small 
audiences in brighton a few hundred white rhodesian emigres and 
members of prosouth african lobbies gathered at a fringe meeting 
organized by rightwing legislator john carlisle during this weeks 
annual convention of prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative party 
mugabes permission of his old archenemy to stay in zimbabwe 
with his wife and children is seen as a sign of magnanimity 
maybe theres a certain amount of reciprocity says smith 
according to our laws mugabe and exguerrilla leader joshua 
nkomo and the rest of them should have been killed by us and i 
didnt kill them 
smith was born in rhodesia and grew up staunchly loyal to 
britain he served as a royal air force fighter pilot in world war 
ii his face is still partially paralyzed by war wounds 
but when britain began dismantling its african empire and 
pressure mounted for black majority rule in rhodesia smith led his 
country to secede from britain the price for rhodesias 67 
million blacks and 275000 whites was 15 years of punitive 
international sanctions and a sevenyear civil war that cost 30000 
lives 
now the gaunt graying figure has sallied out from his farm in 
central zimbabwe to add a personally risky footnote to his 
oftwritten political obituary 
a year ago smith was suspended from zimbabwes parliament where 
he held one of a handful of seats reserved for whites these have 
since been abolished and smith has resigned 
he was suspended for making supportive remarks about neighboring 
whiteruled south africa some of mugabes associates are calling 
for a ban on him returning home from his present lecture tour in 
the united states and britain 
in his speech the sense of grievance the certainty of being 
right in a hostile world is unshaken smith denounces sanctions 
against south africa recalls ruefully embargoes against rhodesia 
and talks about communist subversion and terrorist incursions 
the audience rises in an emotional ovation and admirers surge 
forward to shake his hand just for a moment nothing seems to have 
changed for the politician who once said rhodesia would not have 
black rule in a thousand years 
at 69 smith is a man with no visible signs of selfdoubt 
but twothirds of the white minority he led have left the 
country while some of his close white political associates now 
belong to mugabes governing party 
perhaps it was convenient he says 
lord carrington who as british foreign secretary devised the 
peace settlement wrote in memoirs published last month that during 
the negotiations he told an impatient smith perhaps you might 
recollect that but for you nobody in rhodesia would be being 
killed 
smith denies carrington said it but even if he had said it i 
would have reminded him that the first terrorist incursions across 
our border were in 1961 and they killed innocent civilians and 
children 
as he turns to leave theres a hint that smith suspects he may 
not end his days in the country where he was born 
its my country theres been five generations of my family in 
zimbabwe i hope i can go on living there but there may be 
circumstances of course which preclude that i love the country

after a week of riots that left hundreds 
dead president chadli bendjedid has unveiled a series of reforms 
that he says will allow algerians to change the constitution and 
bring this restless nation closer to democracy 
bendjedid announced the measures including a nov 3 referendum 
that could end the only legal political partys grip on power 
after lifting a sixday state of emergency and curfew imposed as 
riots swept the country 
despite wednesdays announcement however new reports said at 
least 10 people were killed during demonstrations in tiziouzou 
the provincial capital of kabylie in the berber region about 10 
miles east of algiers 
an estimated 176 people have been slain during six days of 
rioting according to information minister bachir rouiz but 
unofficial totals set the number of dead at more than 500 with 
more than 1000 injured 
more than 3000 demonstrators and agitators rounded up by police 
were being held in temporary detention centers 
the french news agency agence francepresse reported that about 
10 people were slain wednesday following a clash between pro and 
antibendjedid demonstrators in tiziouzou 
the agency said antibendjedid demonstrators joined a march by a 
group supporting the president then moved toward a police station 
where police were gathering it said shots were fired shortly 
before 4 pm and 10 people were slain 
the district governor of tiziouzou amara ahmed salah denied 
there were casualties and said security forces fired only warning 
shots afp said 
algerias ambassador to france messaoud aitchaalal also 
denied on french television that people were killed any injuries 
he said were the result of groups of demonstrators among 
themselves 
the reports came as bendjedid set forth a threepoint plan for 
greater democratization according to algerias official news 
agency 
the first step calls for a nov 3 referendum for voters to 
consider a constitutional change making the prime minister named 
by the president answerable to algerias parliament 
the prime minister would have enormously increased power 
without interference from the sole legal party the national 
liberation front 
currently the prime minister has no specified duties under the 
constitution and the parliament is widely regarded as a 
rubberstamp assembly the current premier is the fronts abdelhami 
brahimi 
as a second step bendjedid announced measures for a greater 
democratization of political action to be placed before the 
congress of the ruling party before the end of the year he did not 
elaborate 
as a final step algerians would be asked to approve in another 
referendum modifications these changes would bring to the nations 
constitution no date was announced for this referendum 
the reforms were announced two days after the president promised 
the nation in a televised address that demands would be met with 
economic and political reforms 
bendjedid predicted major changes in the algerian leadership to 
rid the nation of people who were not at the height of their 
duties but he gave no details 
the unrest which began oct 4 was spurred by algerias 
economic crisis demonstrators protested food shortages and rising 
prices and demanded an end to bendjedids austerity program 
algerias hobbled economy was further weakened by the fall in 
oil prices more than 95 percent of the countrys exports come from 
oil and natural gas 
in addition government officials have admitted that a 
demographic explosion does not augur well for this nation of 25 
million people 60 percent of whom are under 20 years of age

the third fire to hit the downtown central 
library in less than three years was a freak accident caused by 
construction materials ignited by a welding torch during 
renovation a fire department official said wednesday 
the fire late tuesday afternoon occurred as the 62yearold 
library was undergoing a 152 million renovation following two 
disastrous arson fires that destroyed hundreds of thousands of 
books in 1986 
the material was cut by a welding torch on the fourth floor and 
dropped through a hole into the basement where it ignited a large 
rubbish pile said inspector ed reed 
the fire department termed it a freak accident reed said 
all precautions were being observed by the company on the site 
its highly unlikely that it will occur again 
the fire was confined to the northwest corner of the basement 
but smoke spread throughout the building reed said there did not 
appear to be any structural damage the extent of potential damage 
to the librarys huge murals which were being cleaned of the smoke 
damage from the 1986 blazes was being determined 
except for the murals all the librarys books and other 
valuables had long since been removed for the renovation

a woman who used her retirement money to 
buy thousands of defective rubber gloves in an attempt to exploit 
the growing concern over aids admits her business judgment was full 
of holes 
today 60yearold justine spiros has 600000 latex gloves in 
her basement and apparently no way to get rid of them let alone 
recover her 61000 outlay to buy them in the first place 
the grandmother of five said she first realized her business 
venture might be getting out of hand when she started looking for 
samples to send to prospective customers 
i found gloves with fingers off with big holes tears 
stains streaks and lumps ms spiros recalled recently 
things went downhill from there 
ms spiros cant sell the gloves because huge numbers are 
defective and the seller wont give her a refund 
she cant even throw them away because the us food and drug 
administration is investigating her problem and may impound them 
i wake up at 330 in the morning worrying she said its 
such a horrible situation 
ms spiros got into the business because with growing concern 
about bloodtransmitted diseases especially aids demand for 
gloves was high and supply was short 
she already was marketing disposable electrodes out of a home 
office that features a washerdryer alongside a copying machine 
and sanitary gloves looked like a hot new area 
everyone wanted gloves ms spiros recalled no one could 
get enough i figured theyd sell immediately 
she borrowed 41000 from her own retirement account to cover 
part of the cost of her first shipment of 600 cartons 
after having problems finding enough good samples to use in 
drumming up business ms spiros was forced to recall the one and 
only shipment that ever left the basement 2000 gloves sent to a 
san franciscoarea ambulance company 
she hasnt considered her next step but shes certain no more 
gloves will leave her door 
i have my reputation to think of ms spiros said

it was a simple stinging campaign ad a pair 
of hands tearing up a social security card 
that was 24 years ago and barry goldwater still recalls it with 
anger saying in his memoirs that it was a repellent lie for 
the democrats to charge he would have destroyed social security if 
he had been elected president in 1964 
theres a somewhat milder reprise of that television ad in this 
campaign as democrat michael dukakis tries to cast vice president 
george bush in the goldwater role 
it shows a social security card with pieces disappearing while 
republican bush is accused of favoring benefit cuts vote for the 
man you know will protect social security and make sure its there 
when you need it the dukakis campaign commercial urges 
the issue is back with the volume relatively low so far but 
with the democrats likely to turn it up in the waning days of the 
campaign a push on social security hardly would qualify as an 
october surprise it has become an october habit 
dukakis raised the social security flag in his first debate with 
bush on sept 25 asserting that if hes serious about what hes 
saying then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to 
raid the social security trust fund and he tried that in 1985 and i 
think hes going to try it again 
the topic may come up again tonight as bush and dukakis meet in 
their second and final campaign debate 
both presidential nominees have declared social security off 
limits in budgetcutting efforts bush specifically exempts it from 
his proposed flexible freeze budget plan 
but that fits the tested democratic theme which is to argue 
that republicans always say they are solidly behind social security 
before the election and renege afterward 
democratic sen lloyd benten spelled that out in the vice 
presidential debate i know too well what their track record is 
and we should be concerned about that kind of an effort once 
again after the election is over 
bentsen accused sen dan quayle bushs running mate of voting 
eight times to cut social security benefits quayle replied that 
what hed voted for and what bentsen himself had twice voted for 
was to delay costofliving increases 
bush voted in 1985 to break a senate tie and impose a oneyear 
freeze on increases in social security benefits in the end 
nothing was frozen 
dukakis supported a 1985 national governors association policy 
statement that included a freeze in social security costofliving 
increases the dukakis campaign says the massachusetts governor 
first voted for an amendment that would have exempted social 
security but his side lost none of it was binding anyhow 
so there is enough history and enough ambiguity on both sides 
to push most other topics off the campaign agenda not this one 
bush is trying to anticipate and undercut the longtested 
democratic issue by calling it more of the same here again my 
opponent is using what can only be described as irresponsible scare 
tactics the same shopworn ones his party trots out every time 
they fall behind usually about three weeks before an election 
he said in seattle on monday 
it may look shopworn but is also is shopproven after the 
republicans lost control of the senate in 1986 sen bob dole of 
kansas blamed the loss of the majority he had led on the democrats 
chorused campaign on the social security issue 
the republican administration had sought to slow costofliving 
increases and had recommended reductions in ancillary benefits 
rearming democrats on the issue it has been a troublesome topic 
for president reagan since he came to national politics after 
calling social security the flagship of the liberal cause and 
siding with 1964 goldwater suggestions that it be made voluntary 
writing about his own campaign in his new book goldwater 
the former arizona senator said the point he tried to make was that 
social security was not actuarily sound a point reagan repeated 
during his 1976 and 1980 republican campaign that argument was 
better mathematically than politically 
goldwater also warned that social security taxes would 
inevitably escalate and would one day rival the burden of federal 
income taxes for many americans that seemed improbable in 1964 
but not now 
president ford took on the issue in 1975 proposing ceilings 
that would have curbed social security costofliving increases by 
almost half and telling congress that it would have to restrain 
that and other transfer payments programs in which the government 
makes payments to individuals he got nowhere 
a month ago robert strauss cochairman of a bipartisan 
commission that will offer economic advice to the incoming 
president said that if deficits really are to be eliminated we 
have to go to social security medicare and entitlements 
generally along with defense spending curbs strauss is a 
veteran democratic campaigner and fundraiser and a former party 
chairman 
he later said that wasnt a commission idea but rather his own 
view of the cold hard truth 
the hard political truth is that neither candidate is going to 
permit let alone propose any talk of significant curbs or changes 
in social security its a given 
quayle made that point after accusing debate rival bentsen of 
trying to scare the elderly on the issue 
this program is not a republican program its not a 
democratic program quayle said its a program for older 
americans that program is actuarily sound to the turn of this 
century

a 77yearold woman spent eight days 
trapped in a ravine beside her dead husband after their vehicle 
plunged off a highway but she managed to survive the ordeal 
helen heinrich was listed in critical condition wednesday three 
days after she was rescued by three men who were looking for 
crayfish in a nearby creek 
heinrich was driving home from breakfast in santa cruz with her 
husband of 55 years rudolph when the brakes failed and their car 
plunged off the highway into a wooded ravine she told highway 
patrol officers in a bedside interview 
rudolph heinrich 83 died of massive internal injuries shortly 
after the crash authorities said 
before she was rescued helen heinrich managed to survive 
without food or water for eight days lapsing in and out of 
consciousness 
one of three men who stumbled upon the wreck said the woman 
seemed paralyzed when they found her 
her eyes were open and blinking and the fingers on her right 
hand were moving said mike schaffer 19 otherwise she was 
doing nothing 
i dont think anyone would have found them for a long time if 
we hadnt just happened to go down there he said 
no one could see the car from the road because of heavy brush 
said police officer william waterhouse 
officers initially thought the woman had lain injured for only 
one day next to her dead husband but an investigation and 
interview with heinrich who first remembered the crash tuesday 
revealed the extent of her ordeal 
after the car plunged 120 feet sunday it tumbled rolled and 
came to rest on its wheels waterhouse said 
heinrich who suffered internal injuries cuts and bruises and a 
fractured elbow crawled out of the wreck and collapsed said 
waterhouse when she was found she was weak and extremely 
dehydrated 
shes a strong woman and she just hung on he said a 
spokesman at san jose medical center said heinrichs most serious 
medical concern is kidney trouble related to the dehydration

church officials angered by news leaks about 
lab tests on the shroud of turin will announce results that 
reportedly show the linen revered by many is only about 600 years 
old and cannot be the burial cloth of christ 
for months news reports in britain and the united states have 
said carbon14 tests conducted by three laboratories determined the 
shroud was made in the 14th century 
professor luigi gonella scientific adviser to the cardinal of 
turin said late last month he was told the news reports were 
correct 
but he said at the time that roman catholic church officials 
still had not seen the results and were angry because they were 
being accused of trying to hide the results accused of taking 
part in a conspiracy to hide the truth of being afraid of the 
truth 
the archdiocese in turin said cardinal anastasio ballestrero 
will release the results of the tests at a news conference today 
attended by vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
the shroud 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide 
bears a faint yellowish negative image of the front and back of a 
man whipped speared nailed to a cross and crowned with thorns 
for centuries it has been revered by some as the burial cloth of 
jesus and dismissed by others as a clever forgery 
the roman catholic church never claimed the shroud was a holy 
relic but treated it with respect because of the possibility it 
could be 
laboratories at the university of arizona the swiss federal 
institute of technology at the university of zurich and oxford 
university conducted the carbon14 tests on postagestamp size 
pieces of linen snipped from the shroud in april 
the tests give a scientific basis for the age of the shroud but 
do nothing to solve the enduring riddle of how the image was 
created 
american scientists who subjected the linen to its most rigorous 
chemical computer and photographic analysis concluded in 1981 that 
it was a real human form of a whipped and crucified man and not 
the product of an artist 
they speculated it resulted from chemical changes in the linen 
while it was in contact with a body such changes could be 
duplicated to a degree in the laboratory they said but they added 
no method could adequately explain the shrouds image 
gonella bristled last month at news reports that a medieval date 
for the shroud meant it was a fake or a fraud 
it could be a genuine work of christian art he said 
the carbon14 tests were supposed to be conducted as a blind 
study each of the three laboratories was given one piece of the 
shroud and one piece of linen with a known date the labs were not 
to know which was which but the distinctive herringbone pattern of 
the shroud could have given its sample away 
scientists have said the triple carbon dating should reveal the 
age of the cloth within a 200year range 
the first mention of the possible existence of christs shroud 
came from french crusader robert of clari who wrote that he saw it 
in 1203 in the imperial palace in constantinople 
but the first actual records of the shroud of turin trace it 
only to lirey france in 1354 
the shroud was bequeathed to the pope by former king umberto ii 
of italy upon his death in 1983

military bases built to protect stagecoach 
routes from attacking indians or the nations east coast from 
british gunboats may finally be closed under legislation which the 
pentagon says could save up to 5 billion a year 
congress handed begrudgingly the administration an axe they 
shouldnt hesitate to cut the dead wood from our domestic basing 
structure said rep dick armey rtexas chief author of the 
bill 
the measure easily cleared the house and senate on wednesday and 
was sent to president reagan who is expected to sign it 
the pentagon estimates that 2 billion to 5 billion a year can 
be saved if it is permitted to pare down the list of 3800 us 
military installations 
the bill sets up a complicated procedure which essentially cuts 
through the thicket of laws enacted by congress legislators 
loathe to permit the loss of jobs which accompanies base closings 
have blocked any facilities from being shut in the last 11 years 
its been 28 years since weve had a twoterm ollozogreater than 
leaving the white house while the other party 
controlled congress said armey only under this political 
configuration could a baseclosing bill like this get through 
congress 
the bill endorses a pentagonappointed commission which has been 
meeting for months trying to put together a list of bases to be 
closed the current panel would be expanded to 12 members by the 
bill 
the panel will make its recommendations by dec 31 and defense 
secretary frank c carlucci would have until jan 15 five days 
before he leaves office to either accept or reject the entire 
list if carlucci approves congress would have until midapril to 
overturn the proposal but only by approving a resolution which 
could then be vetoed by the incoming president 
no base closures would begin before 1990 
among the bases long cited by critics as facilities which should 
be closed are fort douglas utah built more than a century ago to 
protect stagecoach routes fort monroe va built inside a moat to 
defend against the british invasion in the war of 1812 and fort 
sheridan ill where the major features are a golf course and two 
beaches on lake michigan 
another potential facility which may be closed could be loring 
air force base in northern maine a strategic air command base 
which the air force proposed closing in 1975 
it was that proposal which prompted congress to erect stiff 
hurdles against base closings none of maines fourmember 
congressional delegation voted for the bill wednesday as the senate 
approved it 827 and the house voted for it 37031 
before the plan to close loring aroused congressional opposition 
in 1977 the pentagon generally was allowed to do as it pleased in 
trimming the mobilization stemming from world war ii between 1961 
and 1977 the defense department closed 3600 installations 
we are addressing one of the great sacred cows in this country 
and in this body said sen phil gramm rtexas 
there is something in the heart of every politician that loves 
a dam or a harbor or a bridge or a military installation 
gramm said though they may hate the purpose though they may 
vote against defense they want the money coming into the area and 
they defend to the death the continuation of a base 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said we know we cannot afford excess bases that we dont need 
but we all also understand the reality and the sensitivity of the 
communities in america that are so dependent in some cases on 
these bases at least in the short run and we know that reflects 
itself here in the congress 
armey said the beauty of this bill is that it protects 
individual members of congress from political punishment at home 
and from political intimidation from the administration 
im sure the list will include bases in democrat districts 
republican districts conservative and liberal districts he said 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee said i have no idea whether the commission 
will recommend the closing of any of the numerous bases in virginia 
but warner pledged that im willing to take the heat if it 
becomes a matter of necessity in my own state if one of these 
installations has to be closed in order to cut the waste from the 
national defense

president reagan plans to summon congress into 
a special session to vote on renewed military aid to the nicaraguan 
contras if he believes the sandinista government is moving to mop 
up remnants of the rebel forces 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking with reporters 
wednesday evening confirmed earlier reports by sources that reagan 
had settled on a special session as his conditional plan for 
seeking new military aid for the contras 
fitzwater described it as a fallback position to ensure the 
contras survival into the next us administration should 
nicaraguas leftist government attack the remnants of the rebel 
movement in an effort to eradicate it 
the white house spokesman acknowledged that there is no chance 
to obtain further money for the rebels before the 100th congress 
adjourns lawmakers are eager to return home to campaign and hope 
to complete their regular session by the weeks end 
reagan has the power under the constitution to call congress 
back to washington after adjournment if he thought it necessary to 
save the contras he would ask congress to release 165 million in 
stockpiled weaponry now stored in honduran warehouses fitzwater 
said 
reagan is expected to make the threat in a statement as early as 
today according to wellplaced sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity they said it is intended as a dual message to congress 
and to the sandinistas that the president will be scrutinizing 
activities in nicaragua during the remainder of the year when 
congress will not be in session 
the point is to send the message dont you try anything 
cause i aint leaving town said one source familiar with white 
house planning 
under a pentagon money bill reagan signed earlier this month a 
procedure was established for expedited congressional consideration 
of a new request for military aid for the rebels 
despite the gestures support for the contras remains at a low 
ebb in congress and even their strongest supporters question 
whether the rebels could ever be regrouped into an effective 
fighting force 
from a peak of nearly 18000 rebel troops inside nicaragua early 
this year the number has dwindled to fewer than 2000 according 
to intelligence estimates 
they are now reduced to refugee status said rep henry 
hyde rill 
many of the rebels have fled to camps just inside neighboring 
honduras and others have scattered elsewhere 
reagans hope is to keep up contra morale and preserve the 
potential for reviving the rebels if vice president george bush 
wins his presidential campaign and wants to continue to make the 
contras an arm of his central america policy according to the 
sources democratic nominee michael dukakis opposes use of the 
contras as a foreign policy tool 
the contras have been without us military support since 
february when it was ended in deference to efforts to forge a 
longterm ceasefire between the two sides the rebels now are 
receiving some 27 million in humanitarian aid under the pentagon 
appropriations measure 
under the law reagan could trigger an expedited vote on the 
stockpiled weaponry if he certifies to congress that two of three 
conditions are met that the soviet union continues to funnel 
unacceptable levels of military hardware to the sandinistas that 
the leftist government is violating terms of a regional peace 
accord or that the sandinistas have launched an unprovoked attack 
on the rebels 
administration officials maintain that the first two of those 
conditions already exist the president will say if anything 
approaching the third condition occurs i will call congress back 
into session said one source familiar with the white house 
planning 
the idea is to send as strong a warning as he possibly can 
the source said 
sen john mccain rariz a contra supporter is expected to 
offer an amendment to an antidrug measure now before the senate 
that would reiterate the warning to the sandinistas and express 
congressional willingness to go along with new military aid if 
developments warrant capitol hill sources said 
its the right kind of signal to send to nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega and the democrats wh3vtra aid said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan the issue hasnt gone 
away the president is right to insist that it stay a priority on 
the national stage

sundstrand corp has agreed to plead guilty to 
federal fraud charges and pay a 115 million settlement for 
overbilling the pentagon for airplane parts over seven years 
federal prosecutors said wednesday 
us attorney anton valukas said the settlement includes tens 
of millions of dollars in penalties against the rockfordbased 
aerospace contractor 
you have a company that set out to defraud the government 
he said at a news conference the only way that type of activity 
can be deterred is through swift legal action 
valukas would not estimate the cost of sundstrands actions to 
the government 
a further investigation of individuals at sundstrand will be 
completed in two or three months he said noting the plea 
agreement calls for the company to cooperate in that probe 
evans w erikson sundstrand chairman and chief executive 
officer said the plea agreement was a major step toward putting 
this unfortunate chapter behind the company 
a letter from erikson distributed to sundstrand employees 
wednesday explained the agreement and told them every employee is 
reponsible for conducting business activities in a manner that does 
credit to sundstrand 
sundstrand makes flightdata equipment engine startup systems 
and other electronic equipment for military and commercial aircraft 
the defense department accounts for 42 percent of the companys 
14 billion in annual sales 
sundstrand has provided a goodquality product for a long 
period of time unfortunately weve been paying too much for it 
francis holland regional commander of defense contract 
administration services said at the news conference 
sundstrand may be barred from further contracts with the defense 
department pending an investigation spokesman larry wilson of the 
departments defense logistics agency said from washington 
wilson said before the company would do business with the 
government again the defense department would check changes in 
sundstrands accounting system that would prevent a recurrence 
also he said any highranking officers involved in the defraud 
should be suspended 
sundstrand has agreed to plead guilty to a fourcount criminal 
information produced by a federal grand jury in rockford 
the document accuses the company of submitting intentionally low 
bids on contracts from 1980 to 1986 and then concealing the extra 
costs in general overhead costs 
in essence if sundstrand had a 100 million bid on a contract 
that cost 150 million and had a fixed price for that bid the 
additional 50 million in overruns were hidden in the overhead 
account and billed improperly back to the government in a concealed 
fashion valukas said 
the company also was accused by the grand jury of conspiring to 
undermine the contractbidding process by spending more than 
100000 on defense department personnel buying liquor meals 
theater tickets and related items in efforts to gain greater access 
to them 
some government employees are being investigated for allegedly

this falls corn harvest is expected to total 
455 billion bushels or 2 percent more than the agriculture 
department had forecast last month 
the newest estimate is still 36 percent below last years crop 
total reflecting the fierce drought that hammered the midcontinent 
over the summer 
soybean production should be about 15 billion bushels the 
agriculture departments agricultural statistics board said 
wednesday 
that also represented a 2 percent upturn compared to last 
months estimate the latest figures were based on surveys made 
oct 1 
a month ago usda estimated corn production at 446 billion 
bushels and soybean production at 147 billion bushels 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown by american 
farmers and as a feed is essential to meat poultry and dairy 
production 
soybeans which provide highprotein meal and quality vegetable 
oil used in food processing also are vital to us food production 
wheat production was reported at 18 billion bushels about the 
same as last month 
the average yield for corn was estimated at 802 bushels per 
acre that represented a steep drop from last years figure of 
1194 bushels per acre 
the report said the all crops production index as of oct 1 
averaged 89 percent of the base year of 1977 up 1 percent from 
september 
crop production averaged 106 percent of the base last year the 
record was 117 percent reached in 1981 1982 and 1985

a new coalition of farm and environmental 
groups is calling for reduced spraying of chemical pesticides on 
crops 
we are drenching our food and drowning the nation in an ever 
increasing amount of ag chemicals said john oconnor director 
of the newly launched national toxics coalition 
the coalition whose supporters include the american agriculture 
movement and the national farmers union is placing special stress 
on supply management in crop production as a prelude to scaling 
back pesticide use 
under a supply management system limits would be placed on how 
much each farmer could take to market farm prices would go up and 
offset production losses resulting from cutbacks in pesticide use 
sen tom harkin diowa is probably the best known capitol hill 
advocate of a supply management system which would mark a sharp 
departure from most current farm programs the idea was shelved 
early in this session of congress but most likely will get another 
airing after lawmakers return in january 
environmentalists have been campaigning for 26 years for curbs 
on the use of pesticides citing among other things evidence that 
more than 50 of the basic ingredients in pesticides cause cancer in 
laboratory animals 
a barebones pesticide bill won approval last month but even 
supporters of the measure say more needs to be done in the next 
congress 
coalition members call the joining of forces by farm and 
environmental groups in the pesticide battle a major step forward 
not taking part however are the american farm bureau and most 
traditional farm groups as well as politically influential producer 
groups such as the corn soybean and wheat grower associations 
the coalition issued a 35page report which reviewed the 
problem and called for integrated pest management programs 
involving scouting fields to make sure spraying does not take place 
unnecessarily reduced spraying and tilling procedures designed to 
reduce damage from pests 
meanwhile the us public interest research group distributed a 
report saying congressional candidates received 4 million in 
campaign contributions from pesticide manufacturers over the last 
five years 
it said heavy contributions were received by members of the 
senate agriculture committee and suggested a strong correlation 
between chemical company contributions to a politician and that 
politicians vote on regulation of the chemical industry 
group spokesman rick hind said the companies were applying 
agricultural techniques to capitol hill they sow campaign 
contributions and reap legislation that allows them to operate with 
minimal government oversight

a tobaccostate congressman is calling for an 
fbi investigation of tobacco exports wrongly certified as 100 
percent american and then sent overseas under government credit 
guarantees 
the harm that this corrupt blending practice has caused the 
american tobacco farmer is inestimable rep robin tallon 
dsc said in a letter wednesday to attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
the credit guarantees are supposed to be available only for 
american tobacco exports under the program the government would 
pay if the overseas purchaser failed to provide the exporter with 
his money 
congressional and usda investigators found that 14 of 19 
exporters monitored sent shipments under the program that were 
certified as 100 percent american but which actually were blends of 
us and foreign tobaccos 
tallon acknowledged in an interview that the us attorneys 
office in raleigh nc which already is investigating the case 
most likely could call on the fbi for help if needed but he said 
he was unsure if there was a sizeable enough staff in raleigh he 
said it was important to call on thornburgh for a fullscale probe 
the question begs to be answered whos trying to cover up 
what tallon said im saying bring in the fbi and see if 
anyone else gets caught in the loop

american living standards and world influence 
will decline unless the next president sets ambitious national 
goals to boost savings and investment a group of leading 
economists said today 
the seven economists led by nobel prize winner robert solow 
called for a a new investment economics to replace the 
supplyside economics of the reagan years 
such an economics would for the first time see america set 
the great national goal of matching our competitors savings and 
investments rates by the year 2000 the economists said in a 
white paper on americas future 
if current trends continue into the 1990s america could at 
best face a great britainlike scenario of generations of gradual 
decline in relative living standards and national influence the 
economists wrote at worst our present path could provoke a 
financial crisis and dramatic reduction in domestic and global 
wellbeing 
the economists said the mountain of debt the country has run up 
in the 1980s both as a result of the federal budget deficits and 
the huge trade deficits threatened americas future standard of 
living 
we are unaware of any historical precedent that has seen a 
nation indefinitely borrow and consume its way to prosperity and 
we note that the world today is filled with the descendants of 
oncegreat powers that tried this path and failed the economists 
said 
they said their proposal should be seen as an alternative to 
supplyside economics which attempted to boost investment 
indirectly by cutting marginal tax rates or older economic 
theories which tried to boost investment indirectly through 
boosting demand 
the national agenda the economists recommended would set a goal 
by the year 2000 of matching the 11 percent national savings rate 
of the united states biggest economic competitor japan in 1986 
net savings in the united states hit a low in the postworld war ii 
period of 17 percent onetenth of the japanese rate it edged up 
only slightly to 2 percent of total economic output last year 
the economists said it was critical to boost total savings to 
provide the capital american businesses need to invest in new plant 
and equipment and boost us productivity 
one primary way to boost savings is to reduce the federal budget 
deficit since the deficits represent a large drain on financial 
markets the economists said 
they said the budget deficit which totaled an estimated 150 
billion in the fiscal year which ended sept 30 should be reduced 
by 40 billion in the current fiscal year with similar reductions 
in following years 
the economists also called on policies to boost business 
investment increase savings by individuals and increase government 
spending on education to upgrade the quality of the american 
workforce 
in addition to solow other economists who worked on the report 
were lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a private 
economic consulting firm pat choate top economist at trw paul 
krugman massachusetts institute of technology economics professor 
robert reich harvard economics professor lester thurow dean of 
the mit business school and laura tyson economics professor at 
the university of california at berkeley 
a book published wednesday by the council on foreign relations 
also pinpointed the critical need for the next president to reduce 
the federal budget deficit saying any delay could threaten 
disastrous results for the united states on world financial markets 
the next president will face more difficult constraints and 
more difficult choices than any of his predecessors over the last 
40 years said c michael aho one of the authors of after 
reagan confronting the changed world economy 
if he doesnt have a credible economic policy markets could 
react sending the dollar plunging and interest rates soaring 
aho told reporters at a briefing 
aho and his coauthor marc levinson pointed to the worldwide 
collapse of stock markets last oct 19 as a warning of what can 
happen if investors lose confidence 
we are going to have to slow down our excess consumption and 
start servicing our debt he said 
the authors recommended cutting the federal budget deficit over 
the next four years through a combination of tax increases and cuts 
in defense spending and benefit programs such as social security 
and medicare

a houseapproved government ethics bill 
contains the firstever restrictions on lobbying by former members 
of congress and the bills sponsor says senate approval is likely 
the restrictions are contained in legislation to tighten federal 
rules against influence peddling by former top officials of the 
government 
the house passed the measure 37419 on wednesday sending it to 
the senate approval in that chamber is 90 percent likely said 
rep barney frank dmass the bills author 
frank said some of the senior members arent too excited about 
the bill but there is a sense that it is not right for congress to 
apply laws to others from which it is exempt 
for the first time conflictofinterest rules would be applied 
to members of congress and their top staff members 
former members and their staffs would be banned for one year 
from contacting the legislative house in which they served the 
bill would cover lobbying along with any communication done for 
pay to influence federal decisions including writing letters 
filing motions or seeking grants 
the legislation also proposes a lifetime ban on former executive 
branch members from advising anyone on a matter in which the 
employee was personally and substantially involved 
the changes are aimed at closing the revolving door through 
which government employees leave for higherpaid civilian jobs 
based on access to their former government colleagues 
the most oftencited example is that of michael k deaver 
president reagans former chief of staff who began lobbying the 
white house for his clients shortly after he resigned from the 
government 
deaver was convicted of lying about his lobbying activities but 
never was charged with substantive violations of the current law 
restricting postemployment lobbying in the executive branch he 
was sentenced to three years probation and 1500 hours of 
community service and fined 100000 
this is a very collegial place we work with each other every 
day frank said i dont want to go from working with someone 
one day to being lobbied by them the next day were talking about 
a coolingoff period a transition time before we change 
relationships 
opponents said the restrictions were too broad and argued that 
there had been no examples of abuses or improper influence being 
wielded by former lawmakers 
the bill would create exemptions from the lobbying ban for 
former lawmakers who make speeches or offer personal advice to 
former colleagues

arms dealer albert hakim is trying to invoke 
attorneyclient privilege to bar a genevabased lawyer from 
testifying against him and three codefendants in the irancontra 
case 
defense lawyers are seeking a court hearing to determine if any 
of the information that lawyer and financial adviser willard zucker 
gave irancontra prosecutors violated his attorneyclient privilege 
with hakim according to papers ordered unsealed wednesday by us 
district judge gerhard a gesell 
a us citizen zucker operates a swiss company called compagnie 
de services fiduciares sa csf that helped move thousands of 
dollars generated by the usiran arms sales through offshore 
shell companies and bank accounts to prevent the funds from being 
traced 
zucker a former internal revenue service attorney received 
immunity from prosecution in return for cooperating with the 
investigation of independent counsel lawrence e walsh according 
to the court papers 
in the motion ordered unsealed by gesell hakim contends that 
his longstanding business relationship with zucker is protected not 
only by attorneyclient privilege but by confidentiality imposed on 
zucker by swiss privacy laws 
the defense is trying to force walsh to detail the information 
he received from zucker so defense lawyers can determine if zucker 
breached the privlege 
the information is meant to provide the basis for further 
action by the court that may well result in the suppression of any 
effort by the government to introduce at any trial either the 
testimony of mr zucker or any information derived directly or 
indirectly from government contacts with mr zucker 
production of such information may lead mr hakim to request 
that the court impose sanctions upon the government for 
prosecutorial misconduct the defense said 
while hakim is reluctant to make allegations of improper 
behavior against prosecutors or zucker his lawyers said the 
sequence of known events however raises a spectre of impropriety 
that merits full illumination through the courts process 
the defense also threatened to try to suppress any testimony by 
zucker at the trial of former national security council aide oliver 
l north the first defendant scheduled to be tried on the 
irancontra conspiracy charges 
no date has been set for norths trial 
hakim is charged with conspiring with his former business 
partner retired air force maj gen richard v secord north and 
former national security adviser john m poindexter to illegally 
divert proceeds from the armsforhostage deals to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
additionally hakim and secord are charged with conspiring to 
pay illegal gratuities to north including an offer to create a 
fund to finance the college education of the retired marine 
officers children zucker is an unindicted coconspirator with 
hakim and secord according to the court papers 
the aim of the conspiracy was to give things of value to 
north to encourage him to stay on the national security council 
staff and help ensure that hakim and secord would continue to 
receive opportunities for substantial revenues and profits in 
connection with lucrative activities referred to them by north 
said the indictment 
according to the indictment zucker traveled to philadelphia in 
march 1986 to discuss the plan with norths wife elizabeth 
hakim told the congressional committees last year that he 
suggested the meeting relating that zucker had told mrs north an 
anonymous admirer of her husband wanted to help out with the 
university and educational expenses of the children 
the congressional committees said they found no evidence the 
fund was ever set up though 15000 was transferred to an account 
the transmittal order bore zuckers handwritten notation mrs 
bellybutton 
hakims lawyers said that they protested in writing to walsh and 
zucker after learning late last year that the genevabased attorney 
was talking to prosecutors but neither zucker nor prosecutors 
acknowledged such cooperation the defense said 
zuckers cooperation came to light earlier this year in 
pretrial hearings following the indictment 
mr hakim has long utilized the services of mr zucker and csf 
in the conduct of his legal and business affairs defense lawyers 
said in so doing he has often entered into confidential 
communications with mr zucker for the purpose of security both 
opinions on law and legal services 
mr hakim has insisted that all communications with respect to 
those services remain confidential defense lawyers n richard 
janis and lawrence h wechsler said in their pleading 
the defense claimed that as a swiss fiduciary zucker owes 
certain duties of loyalty and confidentiality to mr hakim the 
abrogation of which might render him subject to prosecution in 
switzerland

yale university researchers working with the 
national institutes of health say they are optimistic that a 
methadone substitute they discovered will prove more effective in 
getting heroin addicts off all drugs 
if true it could have a significantly help curb the spread of 
aids among drug abusers and their sexual partners 
thomas r kosten and associates at the universitys school of 
medicine are conducting a sixmonth study with 120 subjects to see 
whether they can duplicate the promising results from a onemonth 
pilot study involving 41 addicts 
i think this can be a major treatment advance for us in 
working with these drug addicts who are spreading aids on the 
streets kosten said wednesday at a seminar 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
it is now spreading faster among intravenous drug abusers than 
any other segment of the population because of their tendency to 
share needles that have traces of another persons blood on them 
the presidents aids commission concluded that curbing 
intravenous drug abuse and having a federal law barring 
discrimination against people with the aids virus are the two 
main keys to fighting the epidemic that threatens to kill a million 
or more people already believed to be infected 
the drug kosten is working with is buprenorphine which has been 
used in europe for about 10 years as a prescription pain reliever 
although not in drug treatment programs 
the pilot study by kosten and herbert d kleber financed by the 
national institute on drug abuse found that buprenorphine was as 
effective as methadone at blunting the subjects craving for heroin 
but unlike heroin or methadone buprenorphine appears to be 
virtually nonaddicting and does not pose the risk of overdose 
said kosten 
the biggest potential payoff however is that the pilot test 
subjects did not experience the severe withdrawal symptoms common 
to users of heroin and methadone when either drug is stopped 
what we are going for eventually is to get people drug free 
and that is a problem with methadone said kosten 
a longstanding criticism of methadone treatment is that it 
essentially switches one addiction for another albeit to a legal 
one normally administered in a controlled setting 
but kosten noted that the potential for methadone abuse is 
not nil 
although methadone is normally dissolved and taken in liquid 
form under observation at drug treatment centers it also sometimes 
is illicitly injected as a street substitute for heroin 
although it is possible buprenorphine could be injected in 
nonclinical settings it appears to open a new avenue to weaning 
addicts from the physical trauma of withdrawal from either heroin 
or methadone 
the idea is to eliminate the withdrawal hurdle making it easier 
for addicts to get off all injectable drugs and eliminate their 
continued exposure to aidscontaminated needles

a properly functioning 40 million navy 
trident test missile was destroyed by mistake last month when a 
range safety officer incorrectly concluded it was veering out of 
control according to the chairman of the house armed services 
committee 
theres always someone who doesnt get the word and in this 
instance it was the man with his finger on the destruct button 
said rep les aspin dwis 
aspin said that although the missile was following the intended 
flight path after its sept 19 launch from the air forces eastern 
space and missile center at cape canaveral fla it appeared to 
the safety officer that it was about to leave the range safety 
corridor 
aspin said the missile was properly functioning and that the 
safety officer destroyed it through what amounted to a 
misunderstanding 
vernon guidry a spokesman for the armed services committee 
said the missile was valued at 40 million 
the incident occurred during the 15th in a series of 19 
landbased tests of the missile which is designed to be fired by 
the us trident submarine fleet aspin said the air force is 
working to prevent a recurrence 
with 15 tests accomplished the series shows two outright 
failures and one only partial success aspin said all other 
flights went as planned 
the destruction of the 15th missile by mistake was counted as a 
no test because the missile itself did not malfunction aspin 
said 
aspin said a review of the trident test program showed that the 
13th flight on july 7 was a failure and the missile was destroyed 
in flight 
the cause of this failure is under review aspin said 
the next test on aug 20 was a success 
aspin said the july 7 launch and other earlier malfunctions had 
different causes now believed to be corrected 
overall test results indicate the missile is still meeting 
its objectives aspin said

a prolonged delay in restarting nuclear 
weapons reactors could jeopardize national security say pentagon 
officials who expressed relief at an energy department announcement 
that it planned to resume production of tritium early next year 
obviously the sooner the better as far as we are concerned 
a pentagon official said wednesday tritium is absolutely 
essential for the production of warheads on modern thermonuclear 
weapons said the official speaking on condition that his name not 
be used 
if the reactors are not started for several years then we 
might begin to have trouble said the source officials at the 
defense and energy departments said that for security reasons they 
could not specify the exact amount of tritium that the government 
has and needs or when a shortage would become critical 
in a related development energy department spokeswoman gail 
bradshaw said tests showed no health threat to three workers 
exposed to radiation at a nuclear weapons facility the rocky flats 
plutonium processing plant in golden colo on sept 29 the plant 
has been closed by the government for safety reasons 
energy secretary john s herrington seeking to defuse criticism 
of lax safety standards at nuclear facilities announced tuesday 
that one of three tritiumproducing reactors at the energy 
departments savannah river plant in aiken sc will begin a 
phased startup in december culminating in january 
the three reactors at savannah river first brought into 
operation in 1954 have been closed down since august for safety 
and maintenance checks and herrington announced new operating 
procedures to reduce the danger of a mishap 
the energy department manufactures nuclear warheads for the 
pentagon and its savannah river reactors are the sole source of 
plutonium and tritium for bombs 
herrington told a congressional panel last feb 23 that we are 
awash in plutonium 
a delay of several years in renewing the production of tritium 
is possible because of problems at savannah river the government 
does not plan to start construction of a new generation of nuclear 
weapons reactors until the early 1990s for completion around the 
turn of the century 
due to safety problems the savannah river reactors will be 
operated only at half power energy officials say 
tritium a radioactive form of hydrogen is used to increase the 
efficiency of nuclear warheads allowing engineers to produce 
smaller and lighter weapons said tom cochran a physicist and 
coauthor of the nuclear weapons handbook a detailed analysis 
of the us arsenal 
tritium however has a short halflife half of any quantity of 
tritium will degrade in 123 years meaning that 55 percent of the 
sample will degrade per year 
that means the government needs to replenish the tritium modules 
on each of its estimated 22000 warheads to assure that they have 
the anticipated explosive power said cochran 
the tritium module on each warhead is replenished every eight to 
10 years said a pentagon source 
tritium is so important for modern thermonuclear weapons that a 
group of physicists recently suggested banning its production as a 
means of forcing arms cuts by the united states and the soviet 
union 
tritium is unique among nuclear weapons materials in its 
potential to drive nuclear arms reductions if both sides agreed to 
a halt in its production said the proposal which appeared in 
the sept 2 edition of science magazine 
the proposal was written by j carson mark former leader of the 
theoretical division of the los alamos national laboratory in new 
mexico and thomas d davies milton m hoenig and paul l 
levanthol 
neither the soviet union nor united states has accepted the 
proposal to cease tritium production and wg sutcliffe a 
scientist at lawrence livermore national laboratory wrote in the 
same edition of science that banning tritium production could 
leave the united states in a vulnerable position because it is 
not known exactly to what degree the soviets depend on it

the veterans administrations chief medical 
officer denies a published report that he ordered changes in a 
study of death rates at va hospitals to avoid bad publicity 
that is not only grossly inaccurate but is a totally 
outrageous accusation john a gronvall said of the report in the 
washington post on tuesday 
gronvall the vas chief medical director said the results of a 
sophisticated statistical analysis were and are intact the va 
said the methods in the analysis were praised by the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
the post accuses me of directing researchers to produce a 
smaller number of questionable hospitals gronvall said in a 
statement issued by the va i personally initiated this study so 
that if we found problems in vas quality of care we could correct 
them 
the post said the initial study had found that as many as 12 
percent of va facilities had excessively high death rates and that 
the rate was dropped to just 35 percent by using a more rigorous 
statistical standard in a revised study 
the post said gronvall acknowledged in an interview that he 
ordered va officials to come up with a lower percentage because he 
feared the va could not withstand the criticism that would follow a 
comparison with mortality rates at private hospital 
terry l thomas a va epidemiologist who directed the study was 
quoted by the newspaper as saying she wasnt too happy with it 
the va said however that she was misquoted 
there was absolutely no pressure applied to me to change 
results she is quoted by the va i never made the remark 
attributed to me that i wasnt too happy or that i saw too

federal officials are investigating the 
possibility that an air traffic control error led a commuter plane 
to fly too close to air force one while president reagan was 
traveling from philadelphia to newark nj 
white house and federal aviation administration officials 
stressed that the president was in no danger during the incident 
wednesday afternoon with the faa saying the two planes came no 
closer than two miles horizontally and 500 feet vertically 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president was 
not aware of the incident until later 
fitzwater said the faa had indicated to white house officials 
that the operational error was related to the air traffic control 
system 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn said the incident occurred at 235 
pm edt northwest of trenton nj 
were investigating a possible operational error with a bar 
harbor airlines aircraft buckhorn said we are not talking 
about a near miss preliminary reports indicate there may have been 
an operational error 
buckhorn said the error involved a separation violation in 
that particular area the separation should have been three miles 
and it was allowed to close to two miles 
weinberg said air force one pilot col robert ruddick felt that 
no one aboard the presidential plane was endangered 
bar harbor airlines spokesman steve mason said continental 
express flight 3494 an atr42 aircraft was en route from 
baltimore to newark with 33 passengers and three crew members 
aboard when the incident occurred 
its our understanding that our airplane was in its normal 
flight path when it passed a little over a mile from air force one 
which was making some sort of change in routing to allow another 
aircraft to pass first said mason the airline is based in 
bangor maine 
in september 1987 an escort helicopter in reagans entourage 
headed from new york city to newark international airport flew 
within 500 feet of a private plane after a communications mixup 
kept the copters pilot from contacting air traffic controllers 
earlier this year an army private was convicted of lying to 
officials investigating an august 1987 incident in which the pilot 
entered prohibited airspace and flew too close to a helicopter 
carrying reagan to his ranch near santa barbara calif

czechoslovakias new premier 
sworn in a day after the most sweeping leadership changes in 20 
years displayed less enthusiasm than his predecessor for reforms 
sweeping the soviet union 
premier ladislav adamec was sworn in wednesday along with his 
cabinet he replaces lubomir strougal 64 who resigned monday 
after 18 years as premier and also gave up his seat on the ruling 
communist party politburo 
president gustav husak replaced as party chief in december by 
milos jakes administered the oath husak had led the party since 
1968 when alexander dubcek was ousted and his liberal prague 
spring cut short 
we must carry out the program of restructuring adamec said 
in an acceptance speech according to a report by the official news 
agency ctk but he added we have no magic wand with which we 
could change things overnight 
adamecs remarks appeared to confirm expectations that he would 
not have strougals enthusiasm for the perestroika or 
restructuring being promoted by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in 
his country 
czechoslovakia has paid lip service to gorbachevstyle reforms 
but has not attempted an extensive overhaul of its economy or 
social structure one of adamecs first jobs will be to work out a 
program for submission to the next session of parliament 
the country has fared well in comparison to hungary and poland 
whose large foreign debts and stagnant economies have reduced 
living standards but economic growth has slowed recently 
adamec a 62yearold former premier of the czech republic and 
deputy federal premier often has criticized poor economic 
performance he said wednesday the government wants to function as 
a unified economic center with firm control over all branches 
of the economy 
jakes said tuesday the politburo membership had been increased 
from 12 to 15 temporarily to aid in restructuring 
ideological work itself he spoke to the closing session of the 
twoday central committee meeting at which the personnel changes 
were made 
his speech as reported by ctk emphasized the need to strengthen 
the leading role of the party he said the leadership must 
fight shortcomings bureaucracy inertia and conservatism and 
cooperate more closely with the soviet union 
jan fojtik the partys new chief ideologist said personnel 
changes were necessary to change the governments style overcome 
inertia and revamp the sluggish national economy 
last april the cabinet was reduced from 26 members to the 
current 20 by combining several ministries 
ten members of adamecs government are new to the federal 
cabinet including jaromir johanes who replaced veteran bohuslav 
chnoupek as foreign minister johanes had been chnoupeks deputy 
since july 1987 and previously served as ambassador to canada and 
the united states 
the czech and slovak parliaments chose new premiers wednesday 
frantisek pitra replaced adamec in the czech republic and ivan 
knotek was named in slovakia to succeed peter colotka who resigned 
his government and party posts monday along with strougal 
pitra and knotek automatically become deputy federal premiers

the source of a 13yearold prank in stained 
glass at the university of washington has been uncovered the 
architect did it 
university spokesman tom griffin says architect david wright is 
responsible for a portrait of george washington at the schools 
health sciences cafeteria that bears the inscription num me 
vexo 
for nonlatin scholars that means what me worry and yes 
it was inspired by alfred e neuman the grinning bigeared symbol 
of mad magazine 
wright was the designer of the south campus center where the 
stained glass portrait of washington hangs 
griffins research answered questions raised by a weekly 
newspaper story that called num me vexo the strangest latin 
inscription in seattle griffin said the inscription came about 
because students who paid for the building in the 1970s wanted a 
picture of a revolutionary there 
washington was selected and num me vexo was wrights 
contribution he asked a friend for the latin translation and had 
artist michael kennedy add it to the portrait griffin said 
wright said wednesday that no questions were raised at the time 
of installation although a university official did ask him about 
the windows significance about six months later 
wright said he got rid of the official by explaining the 
portrait was taken from a 1 bill while the latin inscription was 
meant to convey confidence in the currency 
wright also said he was pleased his joke was finally discovered

few know precisely what was said when the 
great communicator sat down with the green candidate 
but one can imagine what happened when president reagan sat down 
to talk privately with embattled vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle 
to hear white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein tell it 
the president did most of the talking and the senator running 
nationwide for the first time did most of the listening 
duberstein said quayle had sought out reagan to get a few tips 
he said the president obliged with delight inviting the senator to 
the white house on the saturday before his debate with democrat 
lloyd bentsen 
i dont think its so much that hes reagan a mentor but 
sen quayle wanted to talk to the president who had done so well in 
debates the great communicator to get his advice on techniques 
camera angles he said 
they talked generally about what the president had done in his 
debates more so than what sen quayle should do but what worked 
for reagan duberstein said declining to elaborate 
when quayle gave a less than dazzling performance last week few 
in public life were more in a position than reagan to spring to his 
defense the president can look back to the political firestorm he 
created in his initial 1984 debate with democrat walter f mondale 
by giving erratic and stumbling answers to several questions 
reagan has been dropping quayles name incessantly since the 
omaha neb debate before that the president had barely alluded 
to the young indiana senator since he lauded vice president george 
bushs choice during a campaign rally on aug 24 in los angeles a 
week after quayle was selected 
white house officials sought to minimize notions that reagan 
began speaking out more fiercely for quayle only after the omaha 
debate but the presidential speech record and reagans own 
offthecuff remarks show otherwise 
reagan for instance was quick to assail as a cheap shot 
bentsens putdown of quayles statement comparing himself with john 
f kennedy 
when quayle boasted wednesday that i am my own campaign 
handler and said he was breaking away from bush campaign 
managers reagan noted that very often in a campaign theres got 
to be debate about whats the right thing to do 
a similar break occurred after reagans spotty performance four 
years ago 
both reagan and quayle emerged from their initial debate tests 
with supporters complaining that they had been overprogrammed by 
their campaign handlers reagan broke away from his handlers four 
years ago as quayle says he has done now 
what have you done to ronnie the washington post quoted 
nancy reagan as saying to white house aides when the president left 
the louisville ky stage reagans close friend and confidant 
paul laxalt said that the next time around we will let reagan 
be reagan 
that 1984 faceoff also had stirred up the age issue the 
flip side of an issue that has dogged quayle 
in reagans case the question was whether the president was too 
old for another term rather than whether he was mature enough to 
shoulder this responsibility 
quayles youth seems to intrigue reagan who so often has spoken 
to audiences of young people as he stumps for bush and quayle 
perhaps he sees quayle as the ultimate heir to the reagan 
revolution 
reagan seems to be fascinated with quayle said democratic 
campaign consultant robert keefe hes reagan just a pleasant 
nottooserious kind of guy and that description also fits quayle 
i can see that he and reagan would get along well 
as for quayles fondness for reagan keefe said remember that 
he came in to the senate on reagans coattails in the presidents 
landslide election in indiana in 1980

leaders of black organizations are kicking off 
a coasttocoast tour in an effort to boost the minority vote and 
halt reagan administration policies that they believe have hurt 
blacks 
minorities can have an effect on the presidential and 
congressional elections nov 8 if our people recognize our stake 
in protecting ourselves from the train that is coming down the 
track walter fauntroy a democrat who is the nonvoting delegate 
from the district of columbia said at a news conference wednesday 
the campaign is expected to center on at least 15 states and 44 
cities he said adding that the aim is to convince blacks to 
vote now as never before 
although many of the black leaders activities will be 
nonpartisan the group has received 50000 from the democratic 
national committee and includes members from former democratic 
presidential candidate jesse jacksons national rainbow coalition 
said fauntroy who heads the national black leadership roundtable 
if black voters cannot get excited about voting for democratic 
nominee michael dukakis lets get angry about what policies have 
been implemented by the reagan administration in the past eight 
years fauntroy said 
blacks must vote if for no other reason than to slam the door 
on eight years of reaganbush policies that would be continued by a 
bushquaylereagan administration fauntroy said 
martin luther king iii said church leaders would be involved in 
local efforts to back up the black leaders tour which is expected 
to begin friday in baltimore and end nov 7 in san diego calif 
black leaders are being asked to join the tour that also is to 
stop in pennsylvania new jersey new york michigan ohio 
illinois tennessee virginia georgia north carolina alabama 
louisiana and texas other states could be added later 
comedian and political activist dick gregory said his message to 
black voters would be simply you dont got no choice but to 
vote

dan quayles public break with some of 
his handlers in the george bush camp may be more a matter of style 
than substance but the republican vice presidential candidate 
clearly is exhibiting some independence these days on the campaign 
trail 
the indiana senator declared wednesday that he was fed up with 
the rigid control and anonymous sniping from bush aides and is now 
my own handler 
it was a very controlled environment i dont operate very 
well in a controlled environment quayle told reporters on his 
campaign plane en route here 
but whether therell be any real changes in his campaign or 
whether as the democrats are suggesting this new tack is the 
ultimate in handling by master strategist james a baker iii is 
not yet clear 
as quayle travels to oklahoma and arkansas today his campaign 
is being watched closely to see what if any changes the candidate 
has to offer 
quayle has been much more relaxed and accessible to the press 
this week than at any previous time in his campaign chatting with 
reporters on his plane and allowing himself to be questioned on an 
impromptu basis at campaign stops but he still has not had a 
formal news conference in more than a month 
on wednesday quayle even started shouting back at hecklers in 
rapid city sd calling them sdi naysayers when they objected 
to his support for the strategic defense initiative 
on his plane quayle cited his sdi comments as an example of his 
new controlled spontaneity 
and he kept up his goodnatured jabs at the press waving a 
lethallooking pick ax he was given at the rally and saying ive 
got a few targets for this wheres the media when im looking for 
them 
such freewheeling gestures would not have been seen on this 
campaign in the past but they do not necessarily mean true 
independence 
his schedule is still determined by bush strategists and even 
quayle said he would continue to read the speeches prepared for 
him those are cleared at least in early draft form by the bush 
campaign 
his aides many of them baker intimates are openly delighted 
that quayles declaration of independence has become news 
they reject the suggestion from michael dukakis camp that the 
new dan quayle is yet another baker ploy to prop up a weak 
candidate 
coming from the campaign that has used every ploy in the book 
to prop up their own weak candidate at the top of the ticket they 
should know said quayles spokesman david prosperi 
quayle seems delighted at the new turn of events 
im going to have fun and im going to say whats on my 
mind he said 
he said he was not mad at anybody in the bush campaign but 
he has previously expressed irritation at published reports quoting 
unidentified bush aides as calling him a liability for the ticket 
over the weekend he complained to baker about the sniping 
quayle told reporters he will still coordinate with bush 
officials and stay in close communication with them 
theyre going to suggest things that i say suggest things 
that i do and im going to take that under consideration he 
said 
ive done it their way this far and now its my turn he 
added 
he stressed that he had cordial relations with baker the 
campaign chairman the two men spoke at length on tuesday night 
baker said he understands why he quayle would be steamed over 
the sniping by bush aides 
baker also said that anyone caught criticizing quayle will be 
fired 
if i could find out who was putting them out wed have fewer 
people working in the campaign the bush campaign chairman said 
were going to make a little effort to find out who on the 
staff provided those anonymous criticisms to the news media 
quayles unhappiness with the sniping came to a head last 
friday two days after the debate when anonymous bush aides were 
quoted as saying he had not done well in the debate with democrat 
lloyd bentsen and was a liability to the ticket 
i think there is a snapping point that everyone goes through 
and it snapped about friday sometime last friday quayle said

president reagan is urging those 
democratic voters who put him in the white house to vote again for 
the republican candidate and even consider joining the ranks of the 
grand old party 
reagan campaigned at a 20aplate italianamerican dinner on 
wednesday pitching the cause of george bush and dan quayle to 
several thousand voters in an area where many democrats crossed 
party lines to vote for the gop candidate in 1980 and 1984 
the president munching on pasta and salad beamed amid the rows 
and rows of diners as dozens stood to snap his picture and one man 
leaped to his feet and boomed out president reagan we love 
you 
the president never one to shy away from a good audience 
confided in his speech that he wanted to tell you something i 
have never said before you know i am a former democrat 
the president loves to regale his fans particularly those he 
hopes to snare for bush with his own conversion from a follower 
of franklin d roosevelt to leader of the nations conservative 
forces 
and it is often said that the onceproud democratic party of 
fdr and harry truman is dead and gone that the democratic 
party has been taken over by the left but there is something 
you should know the party of fdr and harry truman couldnt be 
killed reagan said 
the president argued that the party that represents people 
like you and me that represents the majority of americans this 
party hasnt disappeared the fact is we are stronger than ever 
you see the secret is that when the left took over the 
democratic party we took over the republican party reagan said 
evoking a round of hearty cheers and lengthy applause from his 
audience 
reagan boasted that due to this revolution the republican party 
has become the party of working people the family the 
neighborhood the defense of freedom and yes the american flag 
and the pledge of allegiance to one nation under god 
the party that so many of us grew up with still exists except 
today its called the republican party and im asking all of you 
to come home and join me reagan said 
reagans trip took him to two hotly contested northeastern 
states pennsylvania and new jersey where bush and democrat 
michael dukakis are slugging it out for a combined total of 41 
electoral votes 
after urging a group of high school students to help get out the 
vote for nov 8 in suburban philadelphia earlier in the day reagan 
attended a republican fundraising reception and had lunch with 
archbishop anthony j bevilacqua of philadelphia 
he then flew to new jersey for another fundraiser in newark 
before attending the italianamerican event in west orange 
asked at one point how important the bushdukakis debate tonight 
will be the president replied i think we have to wait and see 
the debate i know who the winner is already 
federal aviation administration officials said that as reagan 
was en route to new jersey air force one and a commuter plane may 
have flown too close to one another but the president was in no 
danger 
the presidents plane and a bar harbour airlines plane came no 
closer than two miles horizontally and 500 feet vertically but 
should have been three miles apart said faa spokesman bob 
buckhorn the faa is investigating the incident he said

information ministers from 43 
islamic lands met for two days at this red sea port with the 
objective of removing barriers to the nonmoslem world and of 
improving the exchange of news among themselves 
the director general of the islamic educational scientific and 
cultural organization professor abdelhadi boutaleb told the 
ministers that the worlds estimated 800 million moslems must be 
educated against outside influences that included foreign media 
characterizations of backwardness ignorance and fanaticism as 
the main features of our peoples 
however the communique issued at the end of the conference 
attended by representatives from all the nations within the islamic 
conference organization except iran and the maldives barely noted 
concern over antimoslem sentiment 
it endorsed instead known moslem views on palestinian 
selfdetermination lebanon afghanistan south african apartheid 
an iraniraq peace accord and other issues 
the communique without mentioning iran by name singled out 
that country for harsh criticism for activities detrimental to 
islams image 
it said the meeting expressed its opposition to extremism and 
violence which have projected islam as though it were a religion of 
bloodshed war dissension and violation of mosques and other 
peaceful places of worship 
the reference in part appeard to be to the riots last year 
involving iranian pilgrims to mecca in which more than 400 people 
died 
sharifuddin pir zadeh the pakistani secretarygeneral of the 
organization of islamic conference complained at a closed session 
on tuesday that reports from western news agencies ignore or 
deliberately distort islamic issues 
saudi arabia does not as a rule grant entry to foreign 
journalists western news agencies appeared to be the only outside 
media allowed to cover the conference except for a us television 
crew from cairo

the lecterns stage and backdrop were 
familiar fixtures for george bush and michael dukakis as they made 
their separate ways today around pauley pavilion the ucla 
basketball arena quickly turned into a forum for a presidential 
contest 
the two candidates were each visiting the hall today for about 
90 minutes the length of tonights second and final presidential 
debate to get acquainted with the surroundings and the doubly 
backedup sound systems 
moderator bernard shaw and the three panelists whose 
microphones had only one backup were also holding a practice 
session of their own and were counting on having time enough to 
fire off at least 22 questions 
to make sure that the television lighting was uninterrupted 
along with the sound organizers of the event made sure that every 
fixture aiming a tv spotlight had a backup light said ed fouhy 
executive producer of the bipartisan commission on presidential 
debates 
fouhy said wednesday that preparations had gone fairly smoothly 
since ucla was selected last friday for the debate site because it 
was a big time university with a big time staff 
the 34000student university is accustomed to megaevents 
having hosted gymnastic competition for the 1984 olympics as well 
as serving as the olympic village to house the athletes last 
years visit by britains visiting prince andrew and the duchess of 
york was another exercise in tight security and logistics 
the sprawling palm treedotted university of california campus 
was chosen after the league of women voters withdrew as debate 
sponsor in a dispute with the bush and dukakis campaigns the 
league had planned to hold the debate in the old shrine auditorium 
the debates commission established by both campaigns to handle 
the first presidential debate in winstonsalem nc on sept 25 
and the vice presidential debate last week was asked to sponsor 
the los angeles event 
with the commission sponsorship came the redcarpeted stage the 
deep blue backdrop and oak lecterns that were inaugurated in 
winstonsalem the fixtures were trucked in straight from omaha 
neb where they were used for the debate between lloyd bentsen and 
dan quayle 
on wednesdady the los angeles city council voted 112 to give 
25000 to help fund the debate among those dissenting was 
councilman ernani bernardi who said i would have supported it if 
it was open to the public 
as it stands the audience of 1500 people in the 12000seat 
arena will consist of selected republicans and democrats as the 
debate is played out for the more important television viewers 
the basketball court was carpeted in blue and partitioned off to 
create a cozier atmosphere and better tv look 
debate commission director janet brown said wednesday she has 
collected at least 350000 in private donations to help offset the 
500000plus cost of the debate the largest commitment was 
100000 from the timesmirror corp

chiles interior minister went on 
television calling for unity among rightwing backers of a failed 
referendum on president augusto pinochet who want another candidate 
in next years election 
we repeat our call on those who supported the government in 
the referendum to remain united because that is the basis of our 
strength which will be decisive for the future of our nation 
interior minister sergio fernandez said wednesday 
he insisted the government has no plans to negotiate with the 
opposition which is proposing to change the constitutional 
timetable to allow an earlier open presidential election and 
pinochets departure from power 
national renewal the largest rightwing party said tuesday 
night a pinochet candidacy in the open election scheduled for next 
year has no chances whatsoever of success 
the independent democratic union a farright party that was 
among pinochets staunchest supporters in last weeks plebiscite 
also dismissed a possible candidacy for the 72yearold president 
and army commander 
on oct 5 chileans were asked to vote yes if they supported 
pinochet remaining in power until 1997 and no if they favored 
open elections on dec 14 1989 the general took power in a bloody 
1973 coup that deposed an elected leftist government 
last weeks plebiscite resulted in 39 million votes for the 
opposition and 31 million for pinochet 
legal experts disagree on whether the 1980 constitution allows 
pinochet to be a candidate they contend that presidents cannot 
succeed themselves 
the general who remains secluded at an army retreat near 
santiago has not commented on the issue but he also has not 
discouraged nationalist groups and military and government officers 
who have suggested he should run 
those supporting a pinochet candidacy point at the strong 
personal support he received from voters in the referendum 
pinochets wife lucia was quoted by a progovernment newspaper 
as urging her husbands supporters to form a movement so that the 
president will change the constitution and can be reelected 
defense minister adm patricio carvajal said pinochet could 
easily become a candidate if he resigned shortly before the 
election in favor of an interim president 
pinochet is to remain in power until march 11 1990 when the 
winner of the open election takes office 
but opposition leaders strengthened by their victory in the 
referendum want the constitution changed to move up the election 
and pinochets departure

league and the united peace democracy party registered with the 
election commission bringing the number of new parties to 14

have been fighting the central government for more than four 
decades

hardliner gen saw maung suppressed antigovernment demonstrations 
but declared it would allow the formation of political parties and 
general elections in about three months 
western diplomats in rangoon say the sudden emergence of small 
weak opposition parties rather than one united group may spell 
defeat for prodemocracy forces 
the opposition groups will face the national unity party which 
under a different name has ruled for 26 years saw maungs 
government says the party is no longer synomymous with the state 
and arrangements are reportedly being made to transfer stateowned 
buildings funds and vehicles once held by the party back to the 
government 
western diplomats and some opposition leaders say they doubt 
free and fair elections can be held under current circumstances by 
the governments own admission about 450 people have been killed 
since sept 18 in saw maungs drive to quell demonstrations 
the nationwide uprising against the repressive government began 
in late july and involved massive street protests a general strike 
and a bloody backlash in which army troops killed hundreds 
while rangoon has remained relatively calm in recent days 
thousands of students have fled to the thaiburmese border seeking 
refuge and military training from the karen and other ethnic 
minorities up in arms against the rangoon government 
the minorities have been fighting for greater autonomy from the 
central government and have announced their support for the 
prodemocracy side 
rebel officials say about 9000 students and others have joined 
their side and some are being given basic guerrilla training at 
bases along the frontier 
karen leader gen bo mya has said his insurgent group the karen 
national union has 17000 troops

investigating the former mayor of portauprince for allegedly 
masterminding the massacre of worshipers during a sept 11 church 
service

shortly before a coup by rankandfile soldiers against the 
government of lt gen henri namphy who was forced into exile 
franck romain the mayor of this capital city sought refuge in 
the dominican embassy during the purge 
coup leaders said they were revolted by the massacre and accused 
romain and namphy of engineering it st jean boscos pastor was a 
frequent critic of the namphy government 
hospital officials say at least 12 parishoners were killed and 
70 wounded when thugs armed with knives and guns randomly shot and 
stabbed parishioners the government and radio stations have put 
the number of dead at 13 
yves barbot secondincommand at the ministry of justice said 
wednesday that the government had initiated penal action against 
franck romain and his accomplices but he said it was premature 
to say whether romain would be tried

decide to indict romain

on jan 17 during the 29year duvalier family dictatorship romain 
served as police chief and army colonel

summoned to appear in court but he did not say when 
president joaquin balaguer of the dominican republic said 
earlier this month that the haitian government has refused to issue 
an exit visa to romain 
arnold antonin head of the national network for the defense of 
human rights said wednesday that indictment of romain would be the 
first step toward demanding his extradition from the dominican 
embassy haiti and the dominican republic share the caribbean 
island of hispaniola

brazilian officials vowing not to be 
pressured by economic interests have promised to stem the 
widespread burning of amazon jungle that already has destroyed an 
area larger than california 
president jose sarney has unveiled a plan aimed mainly at 
stopping uncontrolled forest burning by farmers and ranchers 
we must create nationwide consciousness that we are all 
passengers in the adventure of man on earth sarney said 
wednesday in a ceremony announcing the program the era of 
unlimited natural resources is over 
the program called our nature calls for a temporary end to 
government tax and financing benefits for largescale cattle 
ranching in the northern amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessed 
tropical timber 
environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast amazon 
tracts by the primitive slashandburn method has released hundreds 
of tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere 
they say this is contributing to the greenhouse effect the 
gradual warming of the earths atmosphere by a concentration of 
pollutants that act like a blanket trapping the suns warmth 
brazils governmentrun space research institute said about 
77000 square miles of land were cleared by the slashandburn 
method in 1987 and forecast a similar amount for this year 
the program also includes a recommendation to brazils congress 
to cut mercury imports freelance gold prospectors throughout the 
amazon use the highly toxic element to separate gold from river 
silt and then throw the waste into the water 
this program is going to shake up powerful economic 
interests said antonio jose guimaraes president of brazils 
federal forest service but the government is resolved to carry 
it out 
earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the impoverished 
amazon basin which covers an area equal to roughly twothirds of 
the continental united states permitted land developers to burn 
off 50 percent of their properties the fastest and cheapest way 
to clear land and then gave them tax deductions for doing so 
the world bank has estimated that since 1978 this type of 
landclearing in the brazilan amazon has destroyed 240000 square 
miles of natural tropical rainforest cover an area larger than 
california 
interior minister joao alves said the tax break suspensions were 
temporary because the government is working out a plan to 
determine which parts of the amazon can be used for farming and 
ranching and which must be left alone 
private developers complained about the plan even before it was 
announced 
orlando mariutti who has three projects on a total of 136000 
acres in the western state of mato grosso told the newspaper folha 
de s paulo that cutting tax incentives will hold back 
development of the amazon 
large developers in the region he said generally preserve 
more than the 50 percent of the land required by law

the house completed congressional action on 
legislation to control the kind of infectious medical waste that 
fouled atlantic coast beaches this summer 
the bill sent to the white house by a voice vote wednesday 
would require the environmental protection agency to develop a 
system for tracking such waste from its creation in medical 
facilities to its final disposal 
initially the system would apply only to 10 states 
connecticut new jersey new york pennsylvania and the great lakes 
states of ohio indiana michigan illinois wisconsin and 
minnesota 
the program however could become national in scope because any 
other state could decide to have its medical waste covered by the 
plan and gain authority to act against incoming waste not meeting 
the tracking requirements 
the senate approved the measure last friday after making several 
minor changes to an earlier house version 
congress acted after waves of used syringes vials of 
aidsinfected blood and other hospital waste that washed up on 
beaches along the east coast lake michigan and lake erie during 
the summer the waste became a health problem closing some beaches 
because of the threat of hepatitis and other diseases 
under terms of the bill the epa would have to set up a system 
to track dangerous waste from hospitals labs and clinics to its 
disposal 
included in the papertrail tracking system would be blood 
hypodermic needles scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that 
had been in contact with infectious agents they would have to be 
segregated from other medical waste and tracked to make sure they 
reached a proper disposal facility 
lawmakers had accused the epa of failing to use its regulatory 
authority to resolve the problem 
in 1978 the epa announced plans to regulate medical waste but 
six years later said it lacked evidence those wastes were causing 
enough harm to justify regulations 
instead the epa released a package of advice to hospitals on 
handling and disposal since then the agency has formed a task 
force to reexamine the issue

hundreds of people some clutching 
rosaries have been visiting a woman who says the crossshaped 
marks that suddenly appeared on her body were drawn by the virgin 
mary 
lina karabashi 18 said wednesday she fasted for three days at 
marys request because she promised me she will give me communion 
today 
the iraqi woman said the virgin mary drew three crosses on her 
body saturday as she rested at hussein medical city where she 
underwent foot surgery oct 2 she has had 19 operations since her 
left foot was crushed in an accident when she was 6 
scores of people visited mrs karabashi in her hospital room 
her jordanian husband samir said hundreds more have come to their 
home since her release tuesday some brought rosary beads for her 
to bless 
mrs karabashi said the virgin mary has visited her 10 times 
since saturday and has has had long conversations with her 
this is really amazing terrifying said elham azar who 
visited her wednesday at the stonebuilt house in the citys jebel 
webdeh neighborhood 
miss azar 30 said the crosses look real to me i am sure 
it is a miracle 
roman catholic church officials in amman were more cautious 
we cannot yet determine if this phenomenon is sacred 
pending further investigation said a church official who insisted 
on anonymity

hospital on sunday saw reddish crosses on the left side of her 
neck left arm and upper chest the biggest on her chest measured 
6 inches by 6 inches and the others 2 inches by 2 inches

new ones had appeared on the right side of her neck and right arm 
the crosses darkened and faded in color as visitors watched 
a doctor who had treated the woman but refused to give his name 
said the crosses were not external or caused by any scratches 
he declined to say what could have made the crosses appear 
church officials have said that if medical examinations cannot 
provide a scientific explanation then a specialized team from 
the vatican would examine the case 
mrs karabashi said she had a similar experience when she was 7 
a light appeared from a portrait of the virgin mary as she was 
praying but she said the light faded when she went to touch it

the 100th congress the reluctant congress 
isnt quite ready to go home 
despite growing election pressures to get home and campaign 
congress may have to remain in town into next week to deal with the 
years hottest campaign topic drug abuse and the war against it 
house majority leader tom foley dwash delivered the bad news 
to anxioustocampaign colleagues wednesday night it is doubtful 
the drug bill will be ready to be voted on before next tuesday or 
wednesday he told groaning house members at a night session 
over in the senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva 
tried late wednesday night to get agreement on how to proceed with 
the bill his plan wasnt even out of his mouth before sen william 
armstrong rcolo interrupted to say he would be dumbfounded 
if byrd could get everyone to agree to any single plan of attack 
republican leader bob dole of kansas warned that at the rate the 
senate was moving were going to need a week and half more on 
the drug bill 
im not running this year ill be right here dole added 
the best thing we can do for the country is to shut the 
congress down and go home and make the people safe until next 
january said sen jake garn rutah 
even if the senate passes the massive bill by friday foley said 
it would take days to iron out differences between the senate and 
house versions that would propel the congress into the third week 
of october 
election day for all 435 house seats and 33 senate seats will 
be only three weeks away next tuesday members of the house and 
senate had hoped to be back home by early october or this coming 
weekend at the latest 
instead with the weekend approaching the senate spent much of 
the day in repeated recesses and timeeating quorum calls that 
left the senate floor free for senators to come in and talk about 
issues dear to their hearts their states or both 
in fact congress could have gone home at midnight friday sept 
30 the end of fiscal 1988 at that time it finished work on the 
13 appropriation bills needed to keep the government operating 
through fiscal 1989 no mustpass legislation remained 
but the session resumed the following week working on what 
members refer to as cats and dogs nonpressing bills of 
particular interest to individual members this week the senate 
passed a tax bill but even that faces a tough battle in 
negotiations with the house 
looking at the 100odd amendments to the drug bill byrd told 
his colleagues he understood the proclivity on the part of 
senators to try to load everything onto these lastminute trains 
that are leaving the station 
i hope we will not let this debate on the drug bill 
deteriorate into a political sideshow where we will all be taking 
political potshots where we will be trying to indicate who can be 
the toughest and who can be the john wayne of the drug war byrd 
said 
he urged fellow senators to try to limit amendments then say 
no more amendments just debate this bill and go home 
across the capitol foley told reporters we are watching with 
interest what the senate is doing

the government says it will fire up mexicos 
first nuclear power plant next week but critics are demanding a 
national referendum on the twinreactor project 
jose luis alcudia the assistant energy secretary told the 
chamber of deputies on wednesday that the laguna verda reactor is 
ready for lowlevel operational testing 
officials maintained that the plant poses no threat to the 
environment and that testing would begin next week

guaranteed assistant ecology secretary sergio reyes lujan told 
the chamber 
but opposition lawmakers disputed their testimony and called on 
the government to hold a national referendum on the plant 
the plant 200 miles east of mexico city in veracruz state has 
been ready for the loading of radioactive fuel since december 
according to the federal electricity commission 
but president miguel de la madrid postponed the startup in an 
apparent attempt to calm protests by environmental groups and to 
minimize the issue during veracruz states municipal elections 
the elections held oct 2 were largely won by the ruling 
institutional revolutionary party newspapers have since carried a 
flurry of unconfirmed reports that the loading is imminent 
officials of the energy department stateowned federal 
electricity commission and urban development and ecology department 
spoke to senators on tuesday and testified in the chamber of 
deputies on wednesday 
alcudia said the plant is part of a longrange plan to diversify 
energy sources 
the first of the two 657megawatt reactors is ready for 
lowlevel power tests and that there are no technical obstacles to 
loading fuel he said 
sen porfirio munoz ledo of the leftist national democratic 
front and leaders of the group of 100 an ecological group of 
artists and intellectuals walked out of tuesdays session the 
newspaper la jornada said 
munoz ledo questioned the economics of the plant considering the 
decline in income from oil exports he also questioned the safety 
of the plant 
why the rush to load the reactor he asked 
construction on the plant began in 1973 the second of the two 
reactors is to be ready by 1991

unlike the first presidential debate on sept 25 when 
candidates and aides tried to set low expectations dukakis was 
predicting a win 
were ahead 20 and were going to make it a clean sweep 
dukakis said referring to his debate with bush and bentsens 
confrontation with quayle 
bush also expressed confidence heading into the debate telling 
reporters on wednesday we do seem to be looking a little 
stronger politically these days 
quayle campaigning in montana advised his running mate to 
hit it over centerfield and added hell do very well 
bentsen said dukakis should hang loose 
the vice president said he would cite fewer statistics in the 
debate and talk more about how i would like to lead this country 
where id like to see us be in the 90s if im elected president 
bush then headed off to dodger stadium where he watched the los 
angeles dodgers defeat the new york mets 60 to capture the 
national league pennant and win a spot in baseballs world series 
great night ill tell you once in awhile you luck into 
something really fun bush told reporters who accompanied him to

the military is shutting down the biggin hill air 
base in southern england which played a key role in repelling nazi 
air attacks during the battle of britain 
on wednesday roger freeman a junior undersecretary at the 
defense ministry said the royal air force will close the base in 
the next few months 
the raf stopped flying at biggin hill in 1959 and turned it into 
an officer and aircrew selection center freeman said the center 
would move to the raf college at cranwell in eastern england as 
part of our continuing search for economy and efficiency 
from july to october 1940 nazi germany tried but failed to wipe 
out british air defenses ahead of an anticipated seaborne invasion 
despite major losses heavily outnumbered british fighters from 
biggin hill and other bases wore down the germans in daily battles 
over southern england as crowds on the ground gathered outdoors in 
bright summer sunshine to watch the savage dogfights overhead 
the british backed by an early warning system based on the 
newly discovered principle of radar had 700 fighters against 
germanys 2800 planes

michael dukakis debates presidential rival 
george bush for the second and final time tonight in what could 
prove the crucial test of whether the democrat can reassert himself 
in the race for the white house 
dukakis was spending most of today in final preparation for the 
showdown taking a brief afternoon break to visit the university of 
california at los angeles auditorium where he and the republican 
vice president will meet facetoface at 9 pm edt in a nationally 
broadcast encounter 
dukakis has been loose and upbeat heading into the debate 
despite the widely held belief that a strong performance is vital 
to his hopes of overcoming what polls show is a close horserace but 
a strong bush lead in the electoral college count 
were going to win period was the massachusetts governors 
optimistic assessment wednesday when asked if he thought it 
possible that he would win the popular vote but lose the presidency 
to bush in the electoral count 
that comment came during a game of catch with press secretary 
dayton duncan during which dukakis using baseball metaphors 
joked about his planned repertoire for the debate 
fastball curve slider maybe a knuckler he said when 
asked what he planned to throw at bush tonight 
candidates and aides generally try to lower their expectations 
going into a debate but dukakis predicted a win 
were ahead 20 and were going to make it a clean sweep he 
said claiming victory in his prior debate with bush and the recent 
matchup between the vice presidential nominees democrat lloyd 
bentsen and republican dan quayle 
quayle the conservative indiana senator will be a prime 
dukakis target in tonights encounter with the democratic nominee 
looking to both question quayles qualifications to step in as 
president and bushs judgment in selecting the 41yearold senator 
gingerly dukakis said with a broad grin when asked how bush 
should handle debate questions about quayle 
aides said dukakis also planned aggressive responses to any 
questions about the massachusetts prison furlough system a 
favorite bush target in his effort to paint dukakis as soft on 
crime 
dukakis aides believe their candidate has gained some momentum 
in recent weeks particularly through the vice presidential debate 
and hope a strong performance tonight will give dukakis a boost to 
carry him through the final 25 days of the campaign 
in that period dukakis will target the northeast the industrial 
heartland the west coast and selected southern border and midwest 
and rocky mountain states in hope of breaking the gops electoral 
lock 
i think you see a scenario a very reasonable rational 
scenario that indicates this thing is nowhere near over said 
senior dukakis adviser ron brown who said most targeting decisions 
would be made within a few days after the debate 
dukakis was attending a rally with supporters after the debate 
and also attending two private receptions he was campaigning 
friday in california and washington state including a joint 
appearance with bentsen in sacramento

gov madeleine kunin couldnt ask for a 
better backdrop as she seeks a third twoyear term the nations 
lowest unemployment rate surging revenues and a doubling of state 
aid to schools in four years 
yet kunins reelection next month is not assured 
the democratic incumbent is favored to defeat republican michael 
bernhardt for the twoyear post but a poll for bernhardt last 
month found onethird of the voters undecided with kunin leading 
bernhardt 3832 percent 
of even greater concern to kunin was the fact that according to 
the survey the number of people who disapproved of her performance 
had climbed to 38 percent 
the governor has belatedly acknowledged that the challenge by 
bernhardt is more serious than first anticipated i think this is 
going to be closer than what most people think kunin said 
recently 
close elections are nothing new for kunin the states first 
female governor was elected in 1984 narrowly defeating the 
thenattorney general by gaining 5002 percent of the vote 
two years ago she gained 47 percent of the vote in a threeway 
race and forced the election into the legislature as the 
constitution requires when no one receives a majority of the 
popular vote 
kunin believes bernhardts inroads have come through negative 
campaigning it has an effect in every race she said i 
think we have seen that nationally i dont think i am immune 
but bernhardt believes his campaign is catching on because 
vermonters are tired of being told what to do by the state the 
centerpiece of his campaign is a pledge to erase many of the rules 
and regulations drawn up during the kunin administration 
the role of state government is a helping hand not an iron 
fist said bernhardt as he and kunin met last week in their first 
televised debate 
to bernhardt the election is a referendum on what vermonters 
want as a form of government do we want a continuation of the 
direction you have taken us in state control big state spending 
more mandates or do we want a government founded on people 
this is bernhardts first bid for statewide office a 
businessman from londonderry he has served in the vermont house 
for eight years most recently as the republican leader 
kunin says she is proud of what her administration has 
accomplished and believes she will do well if she can get the 
word out on what we have done especially in the area of the 
environment and education 
i am glad i am a strong environmentalist that i have put my 
neck out on these laws and i am going to fight to put them there 
and not backtrack she said 
chief among the environmental successes cited by the governor is 
a highly controversial law adopted this year designed to ease 
development pressures in this state of 548000 people 
passage of the law stemmed from growing fears among many that 
development primarily vacation homes and resorts was threatening 
to destroy the smalltown simplicity of the nations most rural 
state 
bernhardt although supportive of the growth law in concept has 
tried to tap vermonters love of the small town by painting the 
kunin growth bill as an attempt to rob local governments of their 
powers 
he says the law gives too much say over local planning to 
regional planning commissions and the state kunin disputes that 
saying towns can elect whether or not to participate in the 
planning 
kunins greatest asset is the strength of vermonts economy 
vermont with its small population has always had a very high per 
capita tax burden new englands recent economic boom has changed 
that raising income and lowering tax burden even so state 
coffers are so full that aid to education has doubled in four years 
the latest unemployment rate was 17 percent the lowest ever 
recorded by a state under the present calculation system and the 
nations best 
im proud of what we have done said kunin we have gone 
from deficit to surplus we have a record low unemployment rate 
and we have done it all while protecting our environment

as george bush readies for his second and 
final debate with michael dukakis the republican presidential 
nominee is voicing optimism about his chances in the primetime 
confrontation and on election day 
we do seem to be looking a little stronger politically these 
days the vice president said wednesday as polls suggested he 
held a solid electoral vote lead over his democratic opponent 
an abc newswashington post 50state poll showed bush leading 
firmly in 21 states with 220 electoral votes 50 shy of the total 
needed to win the presidency dukakis led in three states and the 
district of columbia for 30 electoral votes 
bush planned no public appearances today before the debate he 
was planning a morning walkthrough of pauley pavilion on the 
university of california at los angeles campus and then was 
spending the rest of the day preparing for the debate with aides 
on wednesday bush said that in the debate he would seek to 
make it clearer to americans what my heart beat is what i really 
care about 
aides to the republican nominee said they expect a surprise 
assault from dukakis 
hes the one who has to figure out some way to get his 
campaign started hes not been able to do it desperate men do 
desperate things bush adviser james lake said of dukakis 
lake head up a team of bush aides and advisers in los angeles to 
put a favorable spin on the vice presidents performance and he 
was warming up even in advance of tonights event 
dukakis is not able to break out of the rut he is in lake 
said wednesday 
bushs campaign chairman james a baker iii told reporters 
that the campaign will be prepared against any possible surprise 
tactic by dukakis 
added baker i think that if the vice president does what he 
did the first time that is appear presidential and draw the 
contrast between himself and governor dukakis thats what wed be 
looking for 
bushs press spokeswoman sheila tate said hes pretty good 
at dodging and weaving i dont think well worry too much about 
unexpected blows 
today we expect more batting practice with his team of 
debate advisers including baker media consultant roger ailes and 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman according to ms 
tate 
on wednesday night bush took time out to attend the final game 
of the national league championship series between the los angeles 
dodgers and the new york mets the dodgers defeated the mets 60 to 
win the pennant and a berth in the world series 
great night ill tell you once in awhile you luck into 
something really fun bush told reporters who accompanied him to 
the game cant say that once in awhile we dont get a break in 
life 
bush watched the game with his wife barbara and campaign 
chairman baker in a box belonging to dodgers owner peter omalley 
the abcpost poll of 9778 likely voters was conducted from 
sept 21 through monday margins of error ranged from five to 10 
percentage points in each state where 100 to 500 voters were

a cancer that causes pink to dark purple spots 
on the skin of some people with aids may be triggered in part by a 
single gene of the aids virus according to a study published today 
researchers who added the virus gene to the genetic material of 
mice found that the animals later developed a skin disease that 
resembles the cancer called kaposis sarcoma 
the study may help in developing new therapies for kaposis 
said study coauthor gilbert jay chief of the cell physiology 
section of the national cancer institute 
since kaposis appears in some people not infected with the aids 
virus the virus does not seem to play a role in all cases he said 
in a recent telephone interview 
jay reports the work in todays issue of the british journal 
nature with researchers from the institute and the university of 
california davis 
kaposis sarcoma is a generally uncommon cancer that appears 
with unusual frequency in acquired immune deficiency syndrome with 
about 95 percent of aidsrelated cases among homosexual men 
scientists have not explained those patterns nor an apparent 
recent decline of kaposis in new aids cases 
current treatment controls kaposis but does not cure it and 
the disease itself only rarely kills aids patients said alvin 
friedmankien professor of dermatology and microbiology at the new 
york university medical center 
he called the study exciting but said it still does not explain 
the concentration of aidsrelated kaposis in homosexual men since 
all infected people are exposed to the aids virus 
the mouse study focused on the tat gene of the virus which 
normally switches on other viral genes to speed reproduction 
researchers injected fertilized mouse eggs with the gene plus the 
genetic switch that normally activates it the eggs were then 
implanted in female mice 
many of the resulting newborn carried the gene in every cell of 
their bodies but it appeared to be active only in skin cells 
thirtythree of 37 male mice with the gene developed patches of 
extensive cell proliferation in the skin and about 15 percent of 
the male mice developed skin tumors 
the patches and tumors resembled kaposis sarcoma which is 
generally not seen in mice researchers said no female mice showed 
the lesions or tumors just as human kaposis is concentrated in 
men researchers said 
tumor cells showed no evidence of an active tat gene perhaps an 
active tat gene induces a cell to produce some kind of substance 
like a growth factor that encourages cancer in a second cell jay 
said 
so the cancerous cell itself would not have an active tat gene 
and the virus would have caused the disease indirectly he said 
late last month dr robert gallo of the cancer institute 
confirmed press reports that institute researchers had found a 
protein they called growth factor x that may let kaposis 
spread 
aids researcher jay levy of the university of california san 
francisco said the mouse study will offer a direction in terms 
of understanding the way a potential cancer can occur without a 
virus being directly present or expressed in the cancer 
in a second nature paper researchers from the national 
institutes of health reported that a protein found on the outside 
of the aids virus killed mouse brain cells in the test tube such a 
process in people may help account for mental troubles such as 
memory loss and dementia often seen in people with aids they said

the dollar plunged against the japanese yen and 
most major currencies in tokyo on thursday while share prices 
dipped on the tokyo stock exchange 
after opening at 12790 yen sharply down from the previous 
days close of 12965 the dollar moved in a range of 1277512835 
yen it closed at 12798 yen down 167 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the main index 
in the tokyo stock exchange lost 13607 points or 050 percent 
to close at 2727330 
exchange dealers attributed the dollars decline to market 
perceptions that the us economy was slowing down and to 
nervousness over the august us trade report scheduled to be 
released later thursday in washington 
the market appears to be overreacting a bit but there were 
various elements since last week which could push the dollar 
down said toshikazu kotoge a dealer at yasuda trust bank in 
tokyo 
kotoge cited the lowerthanexpected level of us employment 
rates released last week and growing speculation that the us 
trade deficit was worsening as negative elements affecting the 
market last week 
kyodo news service quoted finance minister kiichi miyazawa as 
saying the yens appreciation had been somewhat too steep 
if the fluctuation is too wide for one day it better be tamed 
down miyazawa was quoted as saying 
miyazawa denied speculation that the united states had changed 
its policy of favoring a dollar stronger than the current levels 
kyodo reported 
but dealers said it was unlikely the dollar would dip below the 
125yen level as market players were likely to start buying the 
dollar at that rate 
the dollars opening thursday morning was the lowest since june 
22 when the currency opened trading at 12670 yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange securities dealers said 
uncertainties in the foreign exchange market sidelined investors 
most exportoriented shares are down because of the strong 
yen but domestic shares are doing all right said ichitaro 
watanabe of nikko securities co but either way the market is 
not going to move too much today thursday ahead of the release of 
us trade numbers

a defense contractor agreed to a 115 million 
fine in the largest pentagon fraud settlement after admitting it 
billed the defense department for things like babysitting country 
clubs and servants for its executives officials said 
in agreeing to plead guilty to defrauding the pentagon by 
overbilling for airplane parts sundstrand corp also said its 
employees wined and dined defense department officials and then 
submitted those expenses for reimbursements us prosecutors said 
wednesday 
no company or pentagon employee has been charged in the 
overbillings which spanned from 198086 but sundstrand agreed to 
cooperate with investigators said us attorney anton valukas the 
investigation should be completed by january said valukas who 
declined to estimate how much sundstrands actions cost the 
government 
it was the object of the conspiracy to improve sundstrands 
ability to market hardware to the defense department by giving 
gratuities to defense department personnel and their spouses while 
concealing their identity the government said 
sundstrand employees gave an estimated 100000 worth of liquor 
meals motel rooms golf outings and tickets to the theater 
hockey football and baseball games the government said they then 
submitted expense reports identifying the defense department 
workers they entertained only as a customer or government 
employee the complaint said 
some government employees are being investigated for allegedly 
accepting the gratuities said larry wilson a spokesman for the 
departments defense logistics agency 
the company also admitted it submitted fraudulent claims to the 
defense department for what it called general and administrative 
costs on its contracts 
these claims included millions of dollars in unallowable costs 
for such things as liquor babysitting gifts travel by 
executives spouses cigarettes candy saunas golf tennis 
country club dues movies jewelry clothes snowplowing at 
executives homes radar detectors entertainment and 
servants for executives and their spouses the government said 
evans w erikson sundstrand chairman and chief executive 
officer said in a statement the agreement to plead guilty at an 
undetermined date was a major step toward putting this 
unfortunate chapter behind the company 
sundstrand makes flightdata equipment and other electronic 
equipment for military and commercial aircraft it also makes the 
black box equipment installed on aircraft to preserve flight 
information in the event of a crash 
rockfordbased sundstrand had set aside 130 million in 
anticipation of settling the federal investigations said company 
spokesman claude vernam 
sundstrand said it already had paid or agreed to pay a total of 
1273 million to settle overbillings in illinois and washington 
state 
the defense department accounts for 42 percent of sundstrands 
14 billion in annual sales and sundstrand acknowledged that it 
could be suspended or barred from future work on federal contracts 
what you have in a sense is a tragedy valukas said at a 
news conference you have a company that set out to defraud the 
government 
the only way that type of activity can be deterred is through 
swift legal action valukas said 
the penalty set for the company is the largest single pentagon 
fraud settlement ever valukas said 
the previous record was in march when bell helicopter textron 
inc agreed to return 90 million to the government to settle 
allegations it fraudulently overcharged the army on helicopter 
spare parts according to the pentagon

the philippines will file criminal 
charges against ferdinand marcos for alleged offenses committed in 
office but no specific time had been set president corazon aquino 
said today 
mrs aquino also said marcos who was president of the 
philippines for 20 years but fled to exile in hawaii in 1986 will 
be allowed to return to the philippines to answer the charges 
mrs aquino issued a statement to reporters one day after a 
filipino official indicated the government might delay filing 
charges against the ousted president until us authorities decide 
whether to prosecute him 
sometime in the future we will file a criminal case or cases 
against mr marcos mrs aquino said at that time we will 
have to allow him to return to face the trial no definite time 
frame can be given as of now for this 
the philippine government alleges marcos and his associates 
stole up to 10 billion before his administration was toppled in 
the 1986 uprising that swept mrs aquino to power 
filipino officials have filed no criminal charges against marcos 
for fear he would demand his right to return home for trial 
philippine law bars criminal trials in absentia 
on tuesday the los angeles times said the us state 
departments legal officer abraham sofaer recommended marcos be 
offered a deal to avoid prison by surrendering millions of dollars 
allegedly embezzled during 20 years in power 
the newspaper said us officials feared marcos would seek to 
embarrass american and filipino authorities by disclosing improper 
or illegal conduct if he were indicted 
the plea bargain proposal reportedly involves an investigation 
of marcos by us attorney rudolph giuliani in new york into 
alleged illegal money transfers and other activities 
on wednesday mateo caparas chairman of the presidential 
commission on good government said the aquino administration would 
not seek to obstruct justice in other lands or permit filing of 
charges here to be used as an excuse by mr marcos to escape his 
indictment abroad 
caparas said efforts by marcos to return were either an excuse 
to get out of america or a part of his campaign to destabilize the 
present government the official said marcos could face charges 
here even if he accepted a us plea bargain 
caparas commission is in charge of recovering money allegedly 
taken by marcos he told reporters that mrs aquino had asked him 
to issue the statement 
mrs aquino has repeatedly refused to allow marcos to return to 
the philippines citing national security 
today mrs aquino said she was confident that her government 
would be able to handle the return of mr marcos when the time 
for it comes

president richard von weizsaecker 
is urging fellow west germans to recall the horrors of auschwitz 
rejecting attempts to compare the nazi holocaust with other 
atrocities in human history 
what is it supposed to mean for us whether auschwitz can 
stand up to a comparison of the horrifying destruction of other 
peoples weizsaecker said in the northern bavarian city of 
bamberg on wednesday 
auschwitz remains unique it happened in the name of the 
germans by germans this truth is irrefutable and it wont be 
forgotten he said 
in recent years west germans have come to use the name of the 
nazis auschwitz death camp synonymously with the holocaust 
weizsaecker addressed a national conference of prominent 
historians as towns and cities across west germany plan solemn 
ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the infamous 1938 
crystal night violence aimed against jews 
the comments by the highly popular west german president on 
wednesday marked the first time he has entered a bitter public 
debate over whether the nazi killings of 6 million jews and 
hundreds of thousands of others stand alone in history 
conservative historians led by ernst nolte of west berlin argue 
the holocaust can be relativized by comparisons with 
stalinistera atrocities and other masskillings in history 
jewish leaders angrily claim the conservative historians 
ultimate goal is to diminish the horrors of adolf hitlers nazi 
regime in the eyes of future generations 
speaking of the nazi era the 68yearold president said it 
germany was led by criminals and it let itself be led by 
criminals 
it the german people knows this especially where it would 
rather not know he said in a copy of the speech distributed to 
the news media by his office in bonn 
during the nazi era weizsaeckers father ernst von 
weizsaecker was the no 2 official in the foreign ministry and was 
sent to prison for his conviction at one of the nuremberg war 
crimes trials however the president often has defended his father 
in public saying he did his best to head off world war ii 
the west german president spoke exactly four weeks before the 
50th anniversary of crystal night when hundreds of jewish 
synagogues were burned down thousands of jewish homes and 
businesses plundered and 30000 jews sent to concentration camps 
it took the name crystal night because of the shards of 
broken glass during the action nov 910 1938 german jewish 
leaders have begun referring to it as the pogrom night saying 
that is a more appropriate word for it 
commemorative plaques are being erected at important jewish 
buildings panel discussions are being held and a major ceremony is 
scheduled in frankfurt to mark the 50th anniversary

south and north korean delegations met 
for the first time since the olympics today but failed to make 
progress in their efforts to find ways to reunite their divided 
land 
each side accused the other of blocking progress during the 
twohour meeting but agreed to resume talks on nov 17 
the northern side took an insincere stand throughout and 
there was no progress lee handong a south korean delegate 
told a news conference 
the souths position was basically the same as before and they 
made no concessions at all said the chief north korean 
negotiator chon kum chol 
todays meeting was aimed at arranging formal talks between the 
two koreas legislatures on reuniting the peninsula 
north korea slightly revising its earlier stand suggested that 
the proposed legislative talks include onethird of the lawmakers 
from the north or 218 people and onehalf of the souths 
lawmakers or 150 people 
south korea came up with a new proposal calling for largely 
ceremonial opening and closing ceremonies attended by all members 
of the two sides legislatures and a smaller select committee 
charged with actual negotiations 
previously north korea had called for a joint meeting of the 
nearly 1000 members of the two sides parliaments south korea has 
sought a smaller meeting saying it would allow for more practical 
negotiations 
the nations first began discussions on aug 21 on possible 
formal talks between their parliaments but made no major progress 
in four meetings in the fourth session on aug 26 each accused 
the other of blocking agreement but they agreed to resume the 
discussions after the olympics 
south korean delegates elated by their countrys success 
hosting the games said just prior to todays talks that they would 
be more willing to compromise 
but afterward south koreas senior delegate park joonkyu told 
reporters the north koreans remain unchanged for the past 30 
years my feeling is that they need time to study our proposals 
park said he thought that the atmosphere of todays meeting 
is a little better now after the olympics he said the north 
might have sensed our sincerity 
but bitterness over the games was still evident today 
the olympics are supposed to be a festival of peace and 
goodwill chon said by hosting the olympics alone he said south 
korea had split the nation 
north korea had demanded that it cohost the olympics but the 
international olympic committee rejected the bid saying the 
olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot be shared 
the peninsula was divided in 1945 into communist north korea and 
capitalist south korea they fought the bloody threeyear korean 
war in 195053

demonstrations in burma but were driven underground by saw maungs

refuge and military training from ethnic minorities including the 
karens who are also fighting the central governemnt

during the past week the black police 
chief who faces a paternity suit by a white employee was fired and 
two officers and a judge resigned but officials say the worst may 
be yet to come 
this oncequiet rural northeast oklahoma towns city council is 
seeking a grand jury investigation into months of claims of 
misconduct by expolice chief charles crawford and counterclaims of 
racial bias 
im sure that this thing is not over yet said mayor steve 
tilley whose town of 3000 residents includes about 150 blacks 
it may drag on for years 
crawford who has been married 11 years said city officials who 
opposed having a black chief conspired to oust him using 
allegations that he had affairs with white police dispatchers to 
raise the ire of the city council 
the only difference in these days and the old days is that 
people dont use ropes anymore said crawford referring to 
lynchings in the old south they use a lot of trickery and 
politics to keep you exactly where they want you 
no criminal charges have been filed against crawford who was 
police chief for nine years but allegations in testimony to city 
investigators included sexual involvement with dispatchers sexual 
harassment of other female employees preferential treatment for 
some residents and harsh handling of others 
city manager paul okeefe who serves at the councils 
discretion fired crawford last thursday saying only that he did 
it for the good of the service okeefe is out of town and 
unavailable for comment until friday officials said 
a day after crawfords firing police lt dave pillars and 
officer randy walling were forced to resign leaving a police force 
of two tilley said the resignations were accepted because they 
went along with what their chief said and did 
both officers said they were shocked when asked to resign if 
someone had told me six years ago my career was going to end like 
this i wouldnt believe them pillars said 
on monday municipal judge bill hall resigned after 
acknowledging he had signed blank warrants later used by police in 
arrests blank warrants were found during the councils 
investigation of crawford 
hall denied wrongdoing saying the crawford controversy that led 
to his resignation was the result of a gross misunderstanding of 
certain facts 
osage county district attorney larry stuart is reviewing the 
councils 350page investigative report and said state 
investigators may be called in if necessary 
the council requested that a grand jury review its report but 
tilley said he does not believe a panel will be called district 
judge jr pearman said he does not expect to rule on the grand 
jury request before next month 
crawford 45 has denied all the allegations saying disgruntled 
fired employees unidentified accusers and jealous women are making 
the charges 
tilley denies anyone on the fivemember council all white 
conspired against crawford because he is black but said at least 
two council members who initially called for the investigation and 
his resignation have not hidden their dislike for crawford 
tilley said testimony presented to city investigators accusing 
crawford of sexual relationships with four unidentified juvenile 
women led to his firing but the claims which came in interviews 
with city investigators were supported by little evidence he said 
its kind of like why have your house fireproofed if youve 
never had a fire tilley said when your dealing with the 
public with a man in his position you have to take every 
precaution 
crawford said city officials have refused to identify his 
juvenile accusers so that he can disprove their claims 
crawford who grew up in hominy along with 18 brothers and 
sisters was suspended with pay sept 6 two weeks after former 
dispatcher becky rulo 27 contacted a tulsa newspaper and 
councilman foster johnson with claims that she is carrying 
crawfords baby she filed her paternity lawsuit against crawford 
on monday saying she is four months pregnant 
two taped telephone conversations between crawford and miss rulo 
prompted the councils call sept 8 for an investigation of the 
department tilley said crawford who has two children and has 
served as a foster parent for 10 years to dozens of children said 
he will take a blood test to prove he is not the father of miss 
rulos child

kidnappers in lebanon have increasingly fewer 
reasons to hold british hostages and the prospects for their 
release continue to improve foreign secretary geoffrey howe said 
today 
howe said an easing of tensions in the middle east should 
improve the climate for the release of the hostages 
i think that if we continue to see progress towards a calmer 
state of affairs in all the troubled areas in the middle east then 
the reason and there is no justifiable reason that people are 
being held hostage begins to disappear howe said 
howe met four former french hostages wednesday in brighton 
where his conservative party is holding its annual convention he 
spoke today on british broadcasting corp television 
there are reasons to believe that the prospects of release 
are getting better rather than worse he said but i dont want 
to raise false hopes i have no news today or tomorrow of any 
significant change in the position 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals believed 
held in lebanon by proiranian islamic fundamentalists anglican 
church envoy terry waite journalist john mccarthy and teacher 
brian keenan keenan from belfast northern ireland has dual 
british and irish nationality 
howe reiterated that while britain continued to press and 
probe and search in every way possible to secure their release 
it would not be right to engage in deals or bargains or surrender 
to blackmail 
nine americans are among the foreign hostages missing in lebanon 
the longest held hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped on march 
16 1985

officials of cities cited by psychology today 
magazine as the most stressful in the country reacted angrily to 
the ranking while the mayor of the nations least stressed burg 
state college pa was pleased 
thats ridiculous responded little rock ark chamber of 
commerce president paul harvel on wednesday to his citys ranking 
as the fifth most stressful place 
fort lauderdale fla assistant city manager pete witschenhe 
said ive lived in other areas of the country my impression is 
there isnt any more stress here than any other urban area the 
fort lauderdale area was ranked 12th most stressful joining 
several other florida cities on the list 
the article written by robert levine a california state 
university psychologist in fresno calif ranked 286 metropolitan 
areas based on rates of crime suicide alcoholism and divorce 
the study published in the magazines november issue provided 
instant celebrity status to state college 
i think people got a charge out of this said state college 
mayor arnold addison he attributed the lowstress rating of the 
small city known by its residents as happy valley to the fact 
that its the home of penn state university 
reno nev was portrayed as the stress capital of the nation 
sgt karl schmidt of the reno police department said the 
divorce capital of the world was being unfairly penalized for a 
high burglary rate resulting from tourists leaving valuables in 
cars or hotel rooms 
levine said the 10 loweststress places were state college 
grand forks nd st cloud minn rochester minn 
mcallenpharredinburg texas altoona pa bloomington ind

the 10 most stressful were reno las vegas nev miami 
lakelandwinter haven fla north little rocklittle rock panama 
city fla odessa texas jacksonville fla san 
franciscooakland and los angeleslong beach calif 
levine and fellow researchers kuni miyake and marta lee said the 
criteria they used to rank the cities are both causes and effects 
of social stress clearly an important element in psychological 
wellbeing he said 
previous studies unfairly assume that people who live under 
better environmental economic and cultural conditions are more 
satisfied with their lives he said 
but psychologists he said have long recognized that 
favorable living conditions dont always produce subjective 
wellbeing 
he noted that the west and south known for their mild 
climates and easy living ranked highest and second highest 
respectively on all four types of pathology 
art ellick executive director of community service council of 
broward county fla a human service umbrella agency said parts 
of florida have earned the stressful ranking many whose lives are 
on the brink of crisis are lured to south florida by its of mild 
climate and economic prosperity he said 
but when they arrive without the support of family or friends 
their problems explode he said 
others agreed that south floridas mix of new arrivals low 
wages high housing costs and rootlessness add up to trouble for 
many and could lead to higher rates of alcoholism divorce crime 
and suicide 
its really different down here and i can understand why 
there are suicides and alcoholism said todd barton who moved to 
the fort lauderdale area from alabama six months ago 
there are so many pressures down here he said it forces 
people into social disorder and deviant behavior 
darlene bowling 18 a restaurant cook in altoona which was 
ranked the sixth leaststressful city said a little more stress 
might do the western pennsylvania town good 
i dont like it she said of altoonas relaxed atmosphere 
i want something more wild

senior leader deng xiaoping said today china and 
the soviet union are likely to hold a summit next year according 
to diplomatic sources it would be the first such meeting in 30 
years 
deng in a meeting with finnish president mauno koivisto also 
expressed confidence that longstrained relations between china and 
the soviet union will improve sources in the finnish delegation 
said 
chinas foreign minister qian qichen is to travel to moscow 
later this year to discuss the proposed summit between soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and chinese leaders and it is 
generally believed gorbachev will visit beijing next year 
dengs statement was the first by a chinese to predict that the 
summit the first since nikita khrushchev came to china in 1959 
will likely take place next year 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said at a briefing today 
that it was still too early to name a time or place for the summit 
the timing for the meeting between the top leaders of the two 
countries depends on whether the conditions are ripe or not she 
said now is the time for the creation of the conditions 
she said deng and the foreign ministry held similar views on the 
summit but declined comment on dengs prediction that the meeting 
would take place next year 
the finnish sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
deng also brought up the three obstacles china has cited as 
holding up the normalization of sinosoviet relations and said 
soviet support for vietnams invasion of cambodia remains the most 
serious 
the other two are the soviet military presence in afghanistan 
and the heavy soviet troop concentration on the sinosoviet border 
the two sides met to discuss the cambodian question in beijing 
in august and qian is expected to take up the issue again in 
moscow in a bid to narrow differences on how to bring peace to 
cambodia 
the sources said deng did not say whether qian will set a date 
for the summit during his talks in the soviet union 
a xinhua news agency report on the meeting today made no mention 
of the summit 
it only quoted deng as saying political and economic relations 
between china and the soviet union will never be the same as those

premier li peng criticized reports that china 
faced with soaring inflation and economic turmoil has abandoned 
the modernization of its economy the official news media reported 
today 
li denied at a meeting of the state council or cabinet that a 
recently announced program to cool off the overheated economy is a 
setback for chinas marketoriented reforms 
he said some domestic figures and members of the foreign 
press have suggested that chinas decision to improve the 
economic environment and rectify the economic order over the next 
two years means a halt in the reforms 
all these doubts or hesitations show that such people have not 
yet arrived at a full understanding of the relationship between the 
key tasks of creating economic stability and bolstering reform 
he said 
lis comments were made tuesday and carried today by the 
official xinhua news agency 
the agency quoted him as saying soaring prices have made many 
people uneasy and are affecting social security and peoples 
confidence in reform and that a period of stability is needed to 
keep the reforms on track 
li told the ministers they must change their work style and 
establish a strict responsibility system the council and its 
departments must take the lead in reducing construction of office 
buildings hotels and meeting halls controlling consumer funds and 
rooting out corruption in government 
he told the state planning commision to take charge of cutting 
investment the finance ministry to control financial deficits and 
purchasing by government groups and the materials ministry to 
punish governmentbacked companies profiteering in hardtoget 
materials 
last month the communist party central committee outlined the 
twoyear period of belttightening to bring under control an 
economy hit by overspending serious shortages of raw materials and 
consumer goods and an inflation rate of at least 20 percent 
lis warning to the state council comes after past failures by 
the central government to reduce the frantic pace of construction 
around the country that has far outstripped the nations financial 
capabilities 
capital investment has grown at a rate of 188 percent over the 
past three years a major factor in shortages and inflation that 
threaten to disrupt senior leader deng xiaopings 10year program 
of reducing the role of central planning and running the economy 
based on market principles

the armys exclusion of homosexuals from 
service is unjustified and caters to private bigotry a lawyer 
for a discharged gay soldier told a federal appeals panel in a 
historic discrimination case 
but the government defending the ban said the army had the 
right to follow societys moral judgments against homosexuals 
in a packed courtroom an 11judge panel of the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals heard more than an hour of arguments wednesday in 
reconsidering a decision by a smaller panel of the court that the 
armys ban on homosexuals was invalid 
the 11member panel did not issue any decision wednesday 
in its 21 decision the threejudge panel declared that 
homosexuals as a historically persecuted group were entitled to 
the same strict constitutional protections against discrimination 
given to racial and religious minorities it was the first federal 
appellate court to reach those conclusions 
the lawyer for former soldier perry watkins of tacoma wash 
told the 11 judges wednesday that the army has no more 
justification in barring homosexuals than it did in locking up 
japaneseamericans in world war ii 
there was no evidence to support the armys assertion that all 
japaneseamericans were not loyal there is no evidence to support 
the armys assertion that all homosexuals cannot effectively serve 
the military said james lobsenz an american civil liberties 
union lawyer 
the armys goal in excluding homosexuals lobsenz said is to 
cater to private bigotry 
but justice department attorney e roy hawkens said the army had 
the right to follow societys moral judgments against 
homosexuals 
congress has given the military broad authority to determine 
what is appropriate conduct he said the confined military 
environment provides the opportunity for homosexual conduct 
which is disruptive hawkens argued 
hawkens also contended that a 1986 us supreme court ruling 
upholding a georgia antisodomy law had foreclosed broad 
constitutional protections for homosexuals an argument lobsenz 
disputed 
in its february ruling the threejudge appellate panel said the 
georgia sodomy case had only denied constitutional protection for 
homosexual acts and had not ruled out protections based on sexual 
orientation 
but the legal effect of that ruling was set aside when an 
11judge panel of the court agreed to hear the governments appeal 
watkins now 40 and unemployed told reporters he would be happy 
to return to the army if he won the case a personnel sergeant with 
high job evaluations he was four years short of pension 
eligibility when he was discharged in 1984 
lobsenz argued that the army had made a binding promise to 
watkins by letting him reenlist repeatedly after he informed 
authorities of his homosexuality when he was drafted 
during that time defense department regulations prohibited the 
enlistment or reenlistment of homosexuals but did not require 
immediate discharge of a soldier whose homosexuality was discovered 
while in the service lobsenz said 
but the regulations were changed in march 1981 to require 
discharge of homosexuals in service watkins applied for 
reenlistment soon afterward and was rejected he was discharged 
after an initial federal court ruling in his favor was reversed

the daughter of a judge charged with conspiring 
to fix bess myersons lovers divorce said she tried to wreck her 
car out of despondency during a 1year job search before the 
former miss america hired her 
more than 100 spectators crowded into the courtroom wednesday to 
see sukhreet gabel testify for the prosecution at the conspiracy 
trial of her mother former state supreme court justice hortense 
gabel 75 miss myerson 64 and her lover carl andy capasso 
43 
ms gabel 39 speaking about her 18month job search said she 
was despondent despairing and depressed until being hired in 
august 1983 by miss myerson the citys thencultural affairs 
commissioner 
prosecutors claim miss myerson circumvented normal city hiring 
procedures to give ms gabel the 19000ayear job as her special 
assistant in return they charge ms gabels mother cut capassos 
temporary alimony and child support payments to his estranged wife 
nancy 
miss myerson also is charged with obstruction of justice for 
allegedly trying to get ms gabel to lie to a federal grand jury 
calm and relaxed at first ms gabel appeared grim under 
questioning by assistant us attorney david lawrence as she 
described her depression during her prolonged job hunt 
ms gabel said she dropped out of a doctoral program in 
sociology at the university of chicago in march 1982 
a year later still unemployed ms gabel said she deliberately 
drove recklessly from new york to chicago 
i purposefully drove over the speed limit in miserable 
weather said ms gabel adding i drove in hopes i would meet 
with an unfortunate accident 
ms gabel said she later admitted herself to a hospital for 
evaluation and treatment for severe clinical depression and 
stayed there for about seven weeks 
ms gabel said she met miss myerson at a dinner party at her 
parents manhattan apartment in june 1983 and unsolicited miss 
myerson offered to find her a job in her department a few weeks 
later 
ms gabel said that she testified before the grand jury in march 
and may of 1987 with immunity from prosecution but called federal 
prosecutors in june 1987 because she felt there were certain 
things that had not come up before the grand jury 
she said she waived her immunity from prosecution and agreed to 
let the fbi tape her phone conversations with her lawyer 
during that period she said she taped conversations with her 
mother twice once when she called home trying to locate the 
lawyer and once completely inadvertently 
ms gabel also said she took about four shopping bags of her 
mothers documents to federal prosecutors 
she said she had her mothers permission to show the documents 
to lawyers but it was unclear from her testimony whether her mother 
understood she was going to show them to prosecutors 
last summer mrs gabels lawyer tried to suppress the evidence 
gleaned from the documents claiming it constituted an illegal 
search but us district judge john f keenan ruled against that 
argument

a grave discovered on a small uninhabited atoll 
in the marshall islands was believed to contain the remains of one 
of five hawaii fishermen who disappeared nearly 10 years ago 
authorities said 
the grave and what remained of the mens 17foot fiberglass 
boat the sarah joe were found on sibylla island last month by a 
us national marine fisheries worker and an archaeologist studying 
green turtles and sea birds coast guard capt jim cushman said 
wednesday 
two forensics experts and a 27member coast guard shore group 
were sent to the island located 2054 nautical miles from hawaii 
after officials in honolulu were notified late last month cushman 
said 
it the grave was located some yards above the high water 
mark he said it was a cairn of rocks with a crude cross on 
top of it 
the partial remains comprising about 60 percent of a skeleton 
including a lower jawbone were found in the shallow grave cushman 
said a skull was not recovered he said 
a 2day search of the island measuring about three miles by 
less than half a mile and nearby islands turned up no other human 
artifacts cushman said 
the island was described as uninhabitable with no water or 
vegetation he said 
the remains were transported last week to the armys central 
identification laboratory in honolulu where an attempt to make a 
positive identification will be made once medical records of the 
five men are obtained said capt paul bethke it is possible the 
remains might not be associated with the sarah joe he said 
the sarah joe was reported missing feb 11 1979 after it 
failed to return from a oneday fishing trip off hana maui 
a search for the boat was suspended after five days following a 
56000squaremile search involving aircraft from the coast guard 
navy marine corps civil air patrol and commercial and private 
aircraft 
registration numbers on the boats hull and the boats 
manufacturers number were used to identify the sarah joe said

defense attorneys in the abruptly reduced 
mcmartin preschool molestation case welcomed the prosecutions 
reduction of charges and said they will push for dismissal of 60 to 
70 per cent of the allegations 
superior court judge william pounders acting on a prosecution 
request on wednesday dismissed 27 counts nearly a third of the 
charges against raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin 
buckey 
those counts were based on claims of molestation made by three 
child witnesses who failed to testify prosecutors also sought 
dismissal of eight other charges linked to children who did testify 
the prosecution said the absentees were too traumatized to come 
to court the defense contended the youngsters were purposely 
excluded because their testimony was too bizarre to be believable 
it was the second time in the tumultuous fiveyear history of 
the mcmartin case that prosecutors moved to substantially diminish 
the scope of their charges 
in 1986 after a twoyear preliminary hearing district attorney 
ira reiner moved to dismiss charges against five former teachers 
originally arrested he said evidence against them was incredibly 
weak 
instead of alleging that 41 children had been molested the 
prosecutors then scaled it down to 14 children wednesdays 
alteration reduced it yet again to a total of 11 children only 
nine of those testified at the trial 
deputy district attorney lael rubin said the eight pending 
dismissal requests are based on a review of the evidence 
indicating an apparent finding of insufficient proof 
we conformed the pleadings to what was testified to in 
court he said 
defense attorney danny davis said he and cocounsel dean gits 
will urge pounders today to throw out more charges claiming the 
acts of molestation alleged by at least four children occurred 
beyond the sixyear statute of limitations for prosecution 
if the statute of limitations argument holds well see 60 to 
70 per cent of the case thrown out he said we have a little 
math game to play 
pounders recessed the case until this afternoon in order to 
study law on the subject 
buckey 30 and his 61yearold mother had been charged with 100 
counts of molestation and conspiracy until wednesday then 
prosecutors unveiled a new complaint which contained only 65 counts 
52 accusations against buckey and 12 against mrs buckey as well 
as one joint charge of conspiracy 
the move came after the last witnesses had testified in the 
17month prosecution case the defense is scheduled to begin monday 
ms rubin and deputy district attorney roger gunson asked 
pounders to approve substitution of the new complaint he did not 
immediately accept it but dismissed 27 of the original charges and 
delayed ruling on the eight others until arguments are heard 
some children who had been toddlers when they attended the now 
defunct mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach were preteenagers 
by the time they testified davis and gits based their statute of 
limitations challenge on the four oldest witnesses who they contend 
were at the school before raymond buckey worked there

premier ciriaco de mitas coalition today won a 
crucial vote to abolish most secret balloting in parliament de 
mita had threatened to resign if the measure failed 
the chamber of deputies voted 323 to 58 in favor of the measure 
during balloting that itself was secret the main opposition 
communist party said it would abstain 
the proposal needed 316 votes to pass 
the christian democrat leader staked his 6monthold coalition 
on the reform measure which is aimed at eliminating one of the 
principal causes of italys government instability 
de mita indicated last week that he would resign if the measure 
was rejected socialist leader bettino craxi whose party is the 
second largest in the coalition after the christian democrats 
pushed hard for passage 
the senate will now take up the reform measure 
italy was one of the few western democracies where most 
parliamentary votes were secret and citizens had no certainty about 
how their representatives voted on issues 
the open vote is expected to strengthen the executive system and 
create a more stable political climate in a country that has had a 
succession of revolingdoor governments de mitas is italys 48th 
postwar government 
previously governments have been plagued by lawmakers who used 
the secret ballot to vote against their party line particularly to 
ensure passage of pet spending projects 
de mitas predecessor giovanni goria resigned after his 
government was repeatedly defeated in attempts to trim italys 
budget deficit which now stands at 87 billion 
the communists who had wanted to limit open voting to financial 
measures said they would abstain in an attempt to show up 
government party deputies who vote against their own coalition 
the five parties have 377 seats in the 630seat chamber of 
deputies 
under the chambers reform voting still will be secret when 
dealing with special government bodies such as the organized crime 
commission when the vote involves a specific person or when it 
deals with such issues as abortion or personal liberties proposed 
substantive changes to the constitution also be would excluded from 
open ballots 
but the majority of chamber votes especially on financial 
issues such as the annual budget will be open

a federal suit charges that the state has allowed 
water pollution to endanger and possibly destroy federal wildlife 
areas in the everglades and lake okeechobee 
the everglades system is an international environmental 
treasure said us attorney dexter lehtinen the degradation 
over a number of years is a tragedy they will be lost to future 
generations 
the suit filed by lehtinen wednesday charges the state 
department of environmental regulation and the south florida water 
management district with allowing the operation of pumps without a 
permit failing to maintain water quality standards and violating 
contracts to supply clean water to everglades national park 
dan thompson general counsel to the state department of 
environmental regulation said he hadnt seen the suit but added 
we dont know what to make of it we are strongly supportive of 
trying to improve the environment 
the suit is an attempt to force the state and the water district 
to end a nineyear standoff with dairy farmers and sugarcane 
growers whose agricultural runoff is polluting rivers and canals 
that feed the environmentally sensitive everglades which covers 
much of south florida 
thompson disputed lehtinens contention that his agency has the 
legal authority to make farmers comply with water quality standards 
lake okeechobee at 700 square miles the nations largest 
freshwater lake outside of the great lakes has for years been 
receiving pollution 
levels of phosphates and nitrates as much as 120 times higher 
than natural levels are pouring into the area producing 
fishkilling algae blooms in the lake and changing the face of 
everglades national park according to park superintendent michael 
finley 
this action is a preemptive strike what we are talking 
about without action is ecological collapse finley said he 
described the damage already done as almost irreparable 
the park provides sanctuary to rare and endangered wildlife 
such as the florida panther southern bald eagle woodstork 
american crocodile and cape sable sparrow 
finley said the agricultural pollutants are slowly moving south 
through rivers and canals in a cancer descending on the park 
and the adjoining loxahatchee national wildlife refuge 
water district officials said that others including federal 
agencies are part of the pollution problem 
both the state and federal governments were involved in the 
development of lake okeechobee and the rest of south floridas 
surface water and drainage system said john wodraska executive 
director of the district who is also named in the suit he added 
that the district is working on an antipollution plan

actress robin givens doctor has released a 
letter stating that she suffered a miscarriage in early june when 
she was in her second month of pregnancy 
but the letter from dr sheldon cherry a manhattan 
gynecologist did not address the question of whether givens was 
pregnant when she married world heavyweight boxing champ mike tyson 
in february 
givens filed for divorce oct 7 however tyson is reportedly 
considering seeking an annulment on the grounds that he married 
givens believing she was pregnant when she was not 
the letter was released wednesday through divorce lawyer raoul 
felder who is representing givens 
felder had said tuesday he would get a medical report from 
cherry that would prove givens was pregnant when she married tyson 
but on wednesday felder denied that givens had told tyson that she 
was pregnant before april 
however tyson announced in tokyo in march that givens was 
pregnant 
felder a prominent manhattan divorce lawyer and his california 
associate neal raymond hersh said they were hired by givens on 
sunday she was originally represented by celebrity divorce lawyer 
marvin mitchelson who won the palimony case against the late 
actor lee marvin 
on tuesday givens lawyers said they will seek an outofcourt 
property settlement but indicated there is still a chance the 
marriage can be saved 
felder insisted that givens is not a gold digger seeking tysons 
assets which are valued at about 40 million 
givens divorce suit was filed in california because felder 
said the couple spent 70 percent of their eightmonth marriage 
there 
california is a community property state which means a 
divorcing couples assets are divided evenly but hersh said that 
a settlement out of court in a community property state can be 
anything two people want

the national geographic society after a 
century of recording the world is changing it 
the society announced today that its world maps will be changed 
to a new projection that is a new way of looking at the earths 
surface 
for more than a halfcentury the groups wall maps have been 
produced in the van der grinten projection an arrangement based on 
a circle that gives the proper shape and size to land near the 
equator but distorts land at the far north and south 
in the future the group will use the robinson projection based 
on an ellipse which is less distorted at the poles 
its a more realistic view of the world we believe that its 
balances of size and shape are the most reasonable for a general 
reference map said john b garver jr chief cartographer for 
the society 
both projections are compromises since any flat map distorts 
some part of the earth mapmakers point out 
in developing a map projection cartographers try to find the 
best compromise between the relative size and shape of continents 
their relationships with one another and the oceans separating them 
the popular mercator projection for example is based on a 
rectangle and distorts northern and southern areas much more than 
either the robinson or van der grinten methods mercator has been 
popular however because it can be used by navigators to plot 
their travels as straight lines no other map allows that 
national geographic maps however are not used as navigational 
charts thus that group strives to find better ways to portray the 
world 
a poorly chosen map projection can actually be harmful we 
tend to believe what we see and when fundamental geographical 
relationships such as shapes sizes directions and so on are badly 
distorted we are inclined to accept them as fact if we see them 
that way on maps the american cartographic society has commented 
robinsons map is considered superior to the van der grinten 
because it is less distorted at areas distant from the equator 
for example on van der grinten maps greenland appears to be 
554 percent larger than it really is while it is distorted by only 
60 percent on the robinson projection 
on van der grinten maps the societ union appears 223 percent 
too large and the united states seems to be 68 percent bigger than 
it really is on the robinson maps the soviet union is just 18 
percent larger than it should be while the united states is 3 
percent smaller 
the van der grinten projection was adopted by the society in 
1922 it was patented in 1904 by alphons van der grinten an 
american engineer arthur h robinson one of this nations leading 
cartographers developed his projection while writing a textbook in 
the 1950s but says the ideas were first developed while working in 
the map division of the office of strategic services during world 
war ii

the patriarch of a nomadic backwoods 
texas family responsible for some of the nations first serial 
killings hanged himself with an extension cord in his prison cell 
authorities said 
sherman ramon mccrary 62 died sunday at the fremont 
correctional facility just an hour after he spoke with guards 
making their rounds at the mediumsecurity prison 
im just old and tired and tired of doing time he said in a 
suicide note to the prison superintendent that was left in his cell 
mccrary was serving a life sentence for the 1971 murder of a 
lakewood doughnut shop employee he would have been eligible for 
parole in 1997 
he and his family were suspected in 21 other murders mostly of 
young women in a series of doughnut shop killings primarily in 
colorado and utah nearly two decades ago the slayings were 
considered among the nations first serial killings 
seventeen years ago police from florida to oregon were battling 
to get mccrary into their courtrooms on murder charges by the time 
he was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of 20yearold leeora 
looney of thornton 
mccrary and his soninlaw carl taylor were serving time in 
californias folsom prison in 1972 when colorado authorities 
implicated them in looneys death looney a waitress at a lakewood 
doughnut shop was kidnapped strangled raped and shot in the head 
looneys death matched a string of rapemurders committed by the 
family lakewood police detective joe fanciulli said mccrarys wife 
carolyn son danny and taylors wife ginger all watched quietly as 
looney was raped and killed 
he also recalls mccrarys and taylors attitudes when they 
confessed theyd consider killing a person the same way you and 
i would consider stepping on an ant they were classic sociopaths 
absolutely no regard for human life fanciulli said 
for the next five years fanciulli now a lakewood police 
sergeant made the looney murder and the mccrary clan a fulltime 
job he worked with other departments around the country and 
coauthored a book on mccrary death roads 
mccrary confessed to lakewood police of murdering three women in 
texas but the statements were not admissible under texas law sgt 
al morris of the potter county texas sheriffs department 
visited mccrary a year ago hoping to persuade the 62yearold to 
confess again but mccrary refused 
lou hesse superintendent of the fremont correctional facility 
where mccrary was housed described him as a good inmate 
he didnt have any disciplinary problems and had a good 
relationship with the staff and inmates hesse said

city officials hope they pulled the plug on 
much of the drug dealing at venice beach this week by disconnecting 
25 pay telephones used almost exclusively by local traffickers 
it was a significant problem police capt jan carlson said 
some dealers tied up two to four phones at a time 
city councilwoman ruth galanter who represents venice asked 
general telephone co to remove all but six of the 31 phones along 
a onemile stretch of ocean front walk after residents complained 
i dont think drug dealers want to stand in line to make their 
calls said the councilwomans spokesman rick ruiz and with 
so few lines available maybe theyll go away 
the tactic appears to be working residents and merchants said 
james hoyt who works at an ocean front walk art gallery said 
the drug dealers are starting to disappear 
you should see the looks on their faces he said its 
like hey where are the phones theres no place for anybody to 
hang out anymore 
the phones were yanked out after a previous plan to shoo away 
the pushbutton pushers didnt work 
general telephone had tried to placate residents and police last 
month by replacing the regular phones with models equipped to allow 
only outgoing calls 
but it turned out that most dealers wear beepers and have little 
need for incoming calls 
duane nightingale a gte district manager said the company went 
along with the second plan because we wanted to be good 
citizens even though the phones made a lot of money 
he foresees only one problem that the thousands of venice beach 
tourists will have a hard time finding a phone 
people are going to want telephones and theyre not going to 
be there he said

the head office of the bank of credit and 
commerce international has denied any involvement in laundering 
colombian cocaine profits and pledged its full cooperation with 
federal authorities 
representatives in bccis central offices in london said 
wednesday that the financial institution is wholly unaware of any 
alleged violation and denies all allegations against it 
the bank will do everything in its power to assist the 
concerned authorities in resolving these serious allegations 
bank managers said in a statement 
us customs service agents announced tuesday that 
luxembourgbased bcci holding two of its subsidiaries and nine 
bank officials were among 85 accused of participating in an 
intercontinental ring which allegedly laundered 32 million in 
profits for the colombian cocaine trade 
federal agents alleged that 14 million was funneled through 
bcci 
the amount of 14 million hardly suggests that it could have 
helped a bank of 20 billion to enhance its financial position 
the london bcci office said 
bcci founded in 1972 has 14000 employees and reserves of 15 
billion and operates in 73 countries 
fortyone suspects have been taken into custody undercover 
agents posed as financiers during a twoyear sting that involved 
operations in 10 cities in the united states london and paris 
during hearings for defendants arrested in tampa prosecutors 
said syed aftrab hussain bccis operations officer in panama 
showed agents how to use bcci to better service drug clients 
prosecutors allege that hussain was part of a group of bcci 
officials who courted drug accounts they said the group was led by 
amjad awan 41 of coral gables assistant director of bccis latin 
american division 
comments by prosecutors during awans hearing tuesday raised 
questions about the colombian drug trades ties to panamas 
military ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
assistant us attorney mark jackowski said that awan who 
managed bccis panamanian office between 1981 and 1985 was a 
witness last february in a us senate subcommittee investigation 
noriegas former political adviser and top aide jose blandon 
reportedly testified that noriega sold his influence to colombian 
cocaine cartels and that some of the money got to him through bcci

the government today lost its 2year battle to 
stop three london newspapers from publishing excerpts from 
spycatcher the memoirs of former intelligence agent peter 
wright 
for the press the ruling was a victory after prolonged legal 
wrangling that turned spycatcher a bestseller in the united 
states and australia into a test case of freedom of speech versus 
national security 
the five judges of the law lords britains highest court 
unanimously upheld a ruling by the court of appeal that the 
guardian the observer and the sunday times could publish the 
excerpts 
the judges lifted temporary injunctions barring publication but 
only after criticizing wright for violating the lifetime secrecy 
oath he took when he joined mi5 britains counterintelligence 
agency 
they said he flagrantly breached his oath and was as 
guilty of treachery as heinous as that of the spies he wrote 
about only the fact that the book was so widely available 
elsewhere convinced them to allow publication in britain they said 
publishers william heinemann said they will notify the 
government they plan to publish 200000 paperback copies of the 
book in britain the publishers earlier agreed to provide such 
notice to allow the government time to intervene 
home secretary douglas hurd said the government felt vindicated 
by the decision because it upheld its view that former security 
agents remain bound by their secrecy oath 
but opposition labor party spokesman ray hattersley said the 
government made britain a laughingstock from america to 
australia by pursuing the case 
lord keith of the court of appeal said he voted for publication 
primarily because the book is available outside britain and its 
contents are widely known 
it is absolutely terrific said peter preston editor of the 
guardian this has gone on for 2 years and been heard by 23 
judges it is smashing to win hands down at the end 
the government estimates its legal battle has cost 994750 but 
legal experts say it could be as much as 5 million 
the book describes wrights experiences during 20 years with 
mi5 britains counterintelligence agency among other things 
wright claims that the late roger hollis an mi5 chief was a 
double agent working for the soviets a claim the government says 
has never been substantiated 
it alleges the security service eavesdropped on foreign 
embassies bungled operations stole documents plotted to 
assassinate egyptian president gamal abdel nasser and to 
destabilize harold wilsons labor party government in the 1970s 
wright retired to tasmania australia in 1976 and could not 
immediately be reached for comment an attempt by the british 
government to suppress publication in australia failed and it has 
been published there 
wright 73 has said that his book which has sold 14 million 
copies in 40 countries revealed nothing that could jeopardize 
national security 
the british government maintains it has pursued its case to 
uphold the principle that former intelligence agents are bound by 
their lifetime oath of secrecy and to prevent similar books from 
being published

the environmental protection agency says it 
will define a oneinmillion chance of getting cancer as 
effectively zero permitting it to sometimes disregard a legal 
provision that outlaws cancercausing additives in food 
paradoxically the agency says this could reduce the pesticide 
threat in the diet by speeding the introduction of pesticides that 
are weak causes of cancer but safer than those being used today 
though epa doesnt regulate most food additives it does 
regulate pesticides federal law defines as an additive any 
pesticide residue on food that is concentrated by processing 
a cancercausing residue may be permitted on raw food if epa 
finds that the benefit of pesticide use outweighs the risk 
when the federal food drug and cosmetic act of 1958 was passed 
it included a provision called the delaney clause after the 
bills main sponsor thenrep james j delaney dny banning 
any food additive shown to cause cancer in man or animal 
up to now epa has interpreted the clause to require it to 
refuse to establish a permitted residue level for new 
cancercausing pesticides that become more concentrated in 
processing and to refuse to issue pesticide licenses for such new 
chemicals 
but in the early 1980s the agency became aware that new data 
gathered in its massive review of old pesticides licensed under 
looser standards would forbid the licensing of those chemicals if 
they were to come up again 
jack moore the agencys acting deputy administrator admitted 
to reporters wednesday that the agency was reluctant to face the 
implications of the new data at first 
even today a zero risk policy is totally infeasible as we 
sit here there would be so many pesticide uses being curtailed 
wed cause dramatic and deep disruption in the food supply moore 
said 
moore said the policy change will permit epa to decide the fate 
of 73 currently licensed old pesticides for which there is some 
evidence of cancercausing power at least 50 concentrate residues 
in processing 
there are at least a dozen chemicals known to be weak causes of 
cancer that have been proposed for new or additional uses on food 
though not all have current license applications pending he said 
if you dont let the new chemical on the market therell 
never be an opportunity to retire the old one either through 
regulations or competitive pressure moore said 
janet hathaway an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council and jay feldman coordinator of the national campaign 
against the misuse of pesticides both said epa was indeed obliged 
to use the delaney clause against old pesticides if new data 
justified it 
we are horrified said ms hathaway who accused epa of 
completely gutting the delaney clause 
you need legislation if youre going to go this route she 
said in fact her group supported in principle an unsuccessful 
bill this summer aimed at similar changes in the law 
feldman said epas new policy failed to consider the cumulative 
risk from all pesticides were talking about significant 
exposure he said 
if a pesticide has a better than oneinamillion chance of 
causing cancer epa will not permit any residue in processed food 
if the only residue is on the raw crop epa will apply riskbenefit 
calculations giving greater weight to benefits to the food supply 
as a whole than it did in the past 
if the maximum risk of cancer is one in a million or less the 
agency will treat the chemical as if it were not a cause of cancer 
the change in epa policy is in line with one of the 
recommendations of a national academy of sciences panel last year 
generally federal agencies are permitted to disregard 
congressional directives that lead to results counter to what a 
statute intended in specific cases the courts may rule against 
them as happened to the food and drug administration when it tried 
to apply the same oneinamillion standard to food coloring 
the federal appeals court that decided the case noted that its 
decision might not apply to pesticides

a fire caused by renovation work at the 
arsonravaged central library could delay the buildings reopening 
if historic murals in the lobby were damaged officials said 
were concerned terrified as a matter of fact that there 
is enough smoke damage to put another film on the murals city 
librarian wyman jones said wednesday 
construction materials in the basement were ignited tuesday by 
hot scraps that had been cut by a welding torch said fire 
inspector ed reed 
except for the murals which were recently cleaned at a cost of 
400000 all of the librarys books and other valuables had been 
removed 
if the murals painted in 1920 and depicting californias 
history need another cleaning the librarys scheduled reopening 
date in 1992 could be delayed jones said 
the fire broke out as the 62yearold library was undergoing a 
152 million renovation following two disastrous arson fires that 
destroyed hundreds of thousands of books in 1986 
the renovation had not reached the point of installing fire 
sprinklers fire and library officials said

bishop frank rodimer says five nuns who 
remain barricaded in a monastery to protest changes in their way of 
life are causing a scandal in the roman catholic church 
rodimer the head of the paterson diocese said wednesday that 
the nuns could be relieved of their vows if the standoff at the 
morris township monastery does not end 
its a possibility he said at a news conference but i 
dont foresee that theyve broken the vow of obedience and i 
suppose its a scandal in that sense 
my hope is that theyd be able to come around and live 
together in peace 
the vatican has asked the rev kevin culligan of milwaukee a 
carmelite priest to help resolve the dispute the nuns also belong 
to the carmelite order 
rodimer denied claims by the nuns that he was trying to close 
the monastery of the most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel but 
added that their actions could end the carmelite order in the 
diocese 
the nuns barricaded themselves in the monasterys infirmary on 
oct 4 in protest of changes including the introduction of sweets 
radio and television 
very profound issues rodimer said sarcastically 
he said nuns didnt have electricity or telephones in the 16th 
century but that the protesters never objected to those additions 
to the orders life 
for all the sisters to remain together and remain seriously at 
odds with one another would be a course of action that could 
potentially lead to the closing of the carmel an outcome that no 
one wants he said people cannot pray together unless they can 
live together in charity 
the protesters have said that all 13 nuns at the monastery 
should strictly adhere to the traditional carmelite life which 
stresses prayer and silence 
one of the barricaded nuns sister john of the cross has said 
the nuns were upset after rodimer took the highly irregular 
move of putting mother teresa hewitt in charge of the monastery 
without consulting the nuns who live there she said the nuns are 
supposed to elect their own prioress 
culligan is to meet with the prioress and all of the nuns 
individually to hear their views on the dispute rodimer said the 
bishop said he will make a final decision on how to resolve the 
matter

the moslem government today appointed a 
shiite moslem as acting chief of security today after rejecting a 
christian appointed by the rival christian government 
police superintendent assad taqsh was named acting chief of 
security by abdulla rassi interior minister in interim prime 
minister salim hoss syrianbacked cabinet which is predominantly 
moslem 
a moslem politician speaking on condition of anonymity 
described the naming of two rival security chiefs as the most 
dangerous step in the direction of formalizing lebanons 
partition 
the countrys de facto partition into sectarian cantons followed 
parliaments failure to elect a successor to president amin 
gemayel whose sixyear term expired sept 22 
the hoss government rejected the appointment of police brig 
gen nadim lteif to the post of security chief by army commander 
gen michel aoun and his cabinet the rival christian government 
aoun on tuesday appointed lteif a greek catholic chief of 
security after dismissing jamil nimeh a gemayel supporter 
the double appointment to the position of chief of security who 
issues passports in lebanon may present a legal problem 
who would issue the lebanese passports now lteif or taqsh 
asked the moslem politician 
the moslems would presumably have passports signed by taqsh 
and the christians passports would be issued by lteif i wonder 
which of the two passports would be accepted by foreign 
countries he said 
taqshs appointement came shortly after us ambassador john 
mccarthy held separate talks in west beirut with hoss and 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem on ways to 
break the political deadlock 
parliament has failed three times since aug 18 to elect a 
successor to gemayel after christian deputies boycotted sessions to 
prevent the needed 51member quorum from gathering the christians 
wanted to block the election of a prosyrian candidate as president 
gemayel appointed aoun to head an interim military government 
pending the election of a president syrianbacked moslem leaders 
rejected aouns appointment and declared support for hoss who had 
been premier under gemayel

here are excerpts from the citation 
from the swedish academy which awarded the 1988 nobel prize in 
literature to egyptian writer naguib mahfouz on thursday 
nobel prize winner in literature 1988 naguib mahfouz who 
through works rich in nuance now clearsightedly realistic now 
evocatively ambiguous has formed an arabian narrative art that 
applies to all mankind 
mahfouzs great and decisive achievement is as the writer of 
novels and short stories his production has meant a powerful 
upswing for the novel as a genre and for the deveopment of the 
literary language in arabicspeaking cultural circles the range is 
however greater than that his work speaks to us all 
mahfouz really made his name with the big trilogy 195657 in 
the center is a family and its vicissitudes from the end of the 
1910s to the middle of the 1940s the series of novels has 
autobiographical elements the depiction of individuals relates 
very clearly to intellectual social and political conditions on 
the whole through his writings mahfouz has exerted considerable 
influence in his country 
the theme of the unusual novel children of gebelawi 1959 
is mans everlasting search for spiritual values different 
norm systems are confronted with tension in the description of the 
conflict between good and evil 
a houseboat on the nile 1966 not yet translated into 
english is an example of mahfouzs impressive novellas here 
metaphysical conversations are carried on in the borderland between 
reality and illusion at the same time the text forms itself into a 
comment on the intellectual climate in the country 
in the volume of selected stories gods world 1973 the 
artistic treatment of the existential questions is forceful and the 
formal solutions often striking 
there has been a tendency to divide mahfouzs writings into a 
number of periods eg a historical a realistic and a 
metaphysicalmystical naturally this has not happened without 
reason however the illumination throughout of human life in 
general should also be emphasized

scientific tests on the shroud of turin 
indicate it is no more than 728 years old and cannot be the burial 
cloth of christ the archbishop of turin announced today 
but the shroud is not necessarily a fake the archbishops 
scientific adviser said 
scientists are 95 percent sure of the accuracy of tests 
dating the shroud between 1260 and 1390 the archbishop cardinal 
anastasio ballestrero told a news conference i see no reason 
for the church to put these results in doubt he said 
luigi gonella the scientific adviser bristled at suggestions 
the shroud is a forgery 
a forgery is for the specific purpose of deceiving people it 
could be possible but there is no proof gonella said this 
could be a medieval icon we dont even know how it was made 
the shroud 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide 
bears a faint yellowish negative image of the front and back of a 
man with a thorn mark on the head flogging lacerations on the 
back bruises on his shoulders and knees and wounds in the side 
wrists and feet 
for centuries it has been revered by some as the burial cloth of 
jesus and dismissed by others as a clever forgery 
ballestrero repeated that the roman catholic church never 
claimed the shroud to be a holy relic but he and gonella said the 
image on the shroud has great symbolic importance 
ballestrero said he personally saw the shroud as the 
revelation of the face and the body of christ 
the church believes in the image and not in the history 
because this image of jesus christ in fact is very interesting and 
the people believe deeply in jesus ballestrero said 
news reports for weeks have said the carbon14 tests dated the 
shroud to the middle ages and therefore it could not be christs 
burial cloth 
gonella today attacked those reports especially in the british 
press and said they made the unfair insinuation that the church 
was afraid of science and was trying to hide the results 
he added that the church does not fear science it agreed to 
do these tests the results confirm that the shroud is medieval as 
for history it is a date but for the faith the shroud is the 
face of christ and those things dont change 
laboratories at the university of arizona the swiss federal 
institute of technology at the university of zurich and oxford 
university conducted the carbon14 tests on postagestamp size 
pieces of linen snipped from the shroud in april 
the tests give a scientific basis for the age of the shroud but 
do nothing to solve the enduring riddle of how the image was 
created 
american scientists who subjected the linen to its most rigorous 
chemical computer and photographic analysis concluded in 1981 that 
it was a real human form of a whipped and crucified man and not 
the product of an artist 
they speculated it resulted from chemical changes in the linen 
while it was in contact with a body such changes could be 
duplicated to a degree in the laboratory they said but they added 
no method could adequately explain the shrouds image 
the carbon14 tests were supposed to be conducted as a blind 
study each of the three laboratories was given one piece of the 
shroud and one piece of linen with a known date the labs were not 
to know which was which but the distinctive herringbone pattern of 
the shroud could have given its sample away 
scientists have said the triple carbon dating should reveal the 
age of the cloth within a 200year range 
the first mention of the possible existence of christs shroud 
came from french crusader robert of clari who wrote that he saw it 
in 1203 in the imperial palace in constantinople 
but the first actual records of the shroud of turin trace it 
only to lirey france in 1354 
the shroud was bequeathed to the pope by former king umberto ii 
of italy upon his death in 1983

a hotel owner with an extensive collection of 
nazi memorabilia who came under fire for hosting hitler birthday 
parties says he has painted over a controversial mural and will 
sell the artifacts rather than put them on display 
imperial palace owner ralph engelstad also said he will sell his 
collection of world war ii german vehicles instead of opening a 
wing of his automobile exhibit for them 
engelstad reported his decision to get rid of his 
multimilliondollar collection in a letter tuesday to the jewish 
federation of las vegas he had met with with mayor ron lurie the 
day before 
i now feel i have done what i can and apologized for what i 
cannot do engelstad said in the letter 
alan hilburg a dallas public relations specialist in crisis 
communication who is representing engelstad said i think what 
he has tried to do is arrive at a solution that meets the needs of 
the entire las vegas community and will allow las vegas to get back 
to business 
last week engelstad apologized for the hitler parties he held 
for employees saying they were stupid insensitive and held in 
bad taste he denied that he had any sympathy for hitler or nazi 
ideology 
he said then that he was still considering opening his private 
war room collection of nazi and axis memorabilia to the public 
over the weekend he spent quite a bit of time wrestling with 
this and decided it selling the collection was the best thing to 
do said hilburg 
the resort owner has already had the mural in the war room 
painted over and is making plans to get rid of his collection the 
spokesman said 
in his letter to the jewish federation engelstad complained of 
a degree of unfair treatment by the media but acknowledged he 
had not been successful in convincing the community that his 
apology was heartfelt and sincere 
i realize that what was missing in my apology was an 
acknowledgement of the specific hurt and pain felt by the jewish 
community over this issue he said and i am prepared to 
publicly do that 
engelstad also is under investigation by the state gaming 
control board for allegations that he ordered the destruction of 
imperial palace security records and other documents that have 
become a point of contention in a civil lawsuit 
gaming agents recently inspected the war room as part of an 
investigation into engelstads suitability as a casino owner last 
week they found a printing plate at the hotel used to make 
hundreds of bumper stickers bearing the words hitler was right 
the board wants to know if engelstad ordered the bumper stickers 
printed

treasury chief nigel lawson today 
promised more tax cuts when it is prudent and forecast a drop 
in inflation next year 
but in his address to his conservative partys annual 
convention he warned that interest rates now at 12 percent would 
remain high for quite a while 
the third day of the gathering in this english seaside town was 
highlighted by a promise of more cash for nurses whose pay 
dispute is one of the most serious now facing the government and 
birthday greetings to prime minister and party leader margaret 
thatcher who turned 63 today 
lawson who is chancellor of the exchequer the equivalent of 
treasury secretary said inflation now running at 57 percent 
would begin to drop next year 
he also pledged to cut the basic income tax rate now 25 
percent to 20 percent as and when it is prudent but interest 
rates which had been raised to dampen a consumer spending boom 
brought on partly by lawsons previous tax cuts would remain high 
for quite a while he said 
health secretary kenneth clarke delighted delegates with an 
offer of 23545 million to boost nurses pay and spare the 
nations health authorities from having to cut back services 
this year many nurses joined in an unprecedented oneday strike 
for higher pay and because they enjoy considerable public 
sympathy their demands have put mrs thatchers budgetcutting 
strategies to a severe test 
clarke denied he had caved in to the nurses saying they were 
worth every penny of it 
hundreds of delegates rose to their feet and started singing 
happy birthday as mrs thatcher arrived in the convention hall 
mrs thatcher looked genuinely surprised as an electronic organ 
blared out the song and party members shouted out good wishes 
dressed in a blue checked suit she smiled broadly when tory 
party senior vicechairman sir stanley odell handed her a large 
bouquet

authorities in the southern republic 
of montenegro today banned street rallies after demonstrations by 
nationalists escalated into antigovernment protests 
belgrade newspapers said three communist party leaders probably 
would be ousted during a meeting of party leaders monday the 
bosses have promised a shakeup aimed at ending the economic crisis 
and ethnic conflict 
the ruling politburo sharply denounced attacks on the late 
president josip broz tito some prominent intellectuals blame tito 
for the problems 
inflation stands at 217 percent unemployment at 15 percent and 
the foreign debt is 21 billion living standards have fallen by at 
least onehalf since 1980 according to official figures 
in addition ethnic serbs have been agitating for more serbian 
control over the autonomous provinces of kosovo and vovodjina 
alleging harassment by the majority ethnic albanians 
some of the biggest rallies have occurred in the southern 
republic of montenegro 
a statement from the republics ruling politburo urged citizens 
to stay away from scheduled mass demonstrations this weekend 
the statement was carried by the staterun tanjug news agency 
tanjug also quoted marko orlandic a montenegrin member of the 
national poliburo as saying the state presidency of montenegro 
has introduced urgent measures to stop all gatherings which could 
jeopardize the security situation property and lives of citizens 
in montenegros capital titograd numerous riot police were on 
patrol this week 
security has been stepped up among police army and civilian 
defense units in at least some regions of the country according to 
sources who asked not to be identified 
belgrade dailies reported at least two scheduled nationalist 
rallies were called off in serbia and montenegro this week this 
appeared to be a reaction to a warning from president raif 
dizdarevic on sunday that further unrest could provoke unspecified 
emergency measures 
the communist leadership is meeting in each of yugoslavias six 
republics and two autonomous provinces this week to prepare for 
mondays central committee session in belgrade 
the announcement of the probable ouster of three top leaders 
from the partys central committee was made during a meeting of top 
communists in the northern republic of slovenia on wednesday 
belgrade newspapers reported today 
the reports identified the three all from the republic of 
slovenia as stane dolanc currently yugoslavias vice president 
marjan orozen head of the official trade unions and janez 
zemljaric one of the nations two vice premiers 
they were the first people named as being likely to be removed 
during the meeting of the 165member central committee 
stefan korosec a national central committee secretary was 
quoted in belgrade newspapers as telling the slovene central 
committee that the three men are among those who are likely to be 
replaced 
he added that several other leaders from yugoslavias other 
republics would lose their posts but said he did not want to name 
them 
dolanc has frequently been named in recent weeks as a leader 
serbian nationalists wanted to see fall the serbs allege dolanc 
was not tough enough on ethnic albanians after racial riots erupted 
in serbias province of kosovo in 1981 when dolanc was interior 
minister 
zemljaric has been involved in economic policy for much of the 
1980s when inflation spiraled out of control 
as head of the trade unions orozen is also a target for 
criticism amid growing worker unrest over austerity measures that 
are slashing wages but failing to stem price hikes 
on wednesday slovene communist leader milan kucan criticized 
serbian communists and nationalist rallies 
the attack followed a strong defense of the rallies tuesday by 
serbian communist party leader slobodan milosevic who has support 
among the hundreds of thousands who have attended the gatherings 
in belgrade ivica racan a member of the politburo from the 
republic of croatia today said attacks on tito amount to attacks 
on yugoslavias political system he spoke during a meeting of 
party leaders 
a 19member committee in defense of intellectual freedoms in a 
statement to the yugoslav leadership june 27 said tito was to 
blame for creating an undemocratic repressive political system 
which has thwarted the progressive development of the society 
tito who died in 1980 after ruling for 35 years is revered by 
yugoslav authorities and public criticism of his policies can be 
prosecuted 
there can be no way out of the present economic political and 
moral crisis affecting yugoslav society without a thorough critical 
evaluation of past yugoslav policies the statement said 
according to tanjug racan said several government organizations 
and officials have denounced the committees statement calling for 
political or even criminal responsibility of the authors

novelist naguib mahfouz of egypt who 
chronicled mans search for values in stories set from the nile 
delta of the pharaohs to the busy streets of modern cairo today 
won the 1988 nobel prize for literature 
the 76yearold retired civil servant who once had his work 
banned in his native country was the first arabiclanguage writer 
to win the award 
i am happy extremely happy for myself and for arab 
literature mahfouz was quoted as saying by the governments 
middle east news agency in cairo 
i remember at this moment my professors egyptian writers who 
deserved this prize before me it was a complete surprise 
because i had no idea i was even nominated to win it he was 
quoted as saying 
the 18member swedish academy which awards the prize cited 
mahfouz as an author who through works rich in nuance now 
clearsightedly realistic now evocatively ambiguous has formed 
an arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind 
mahfouz a selfeffacing coffeeshop habitue produced a 
halfcentury of literature the academy said his work has meant a 
powerful upswing for the novel as a genre and for the development 
of the literary language in arabicspeaking cultural circles 
the range is however greater than that his work speaks to 
us all it said 
publishers and cultural page writers had urged that the academy 
give this years prize to someone other than a male from europe or 
the united states the 87yearold prize carries a 390000 cash 
prize 
speculation had included south african novelist and apartheid 
critic nadine gordimer american author joyce carol oates vs 
naipaul a writer of indian origin and the perennially mentioned 
graham greene of britain 
last years winner was exiled soviet poet joseph brodsky 
sture allen the academys secretary said no one in the academy 
read mahfouzs works in the original arabic he declined to say 
whether the decision was unanimous but said the egyptian writer 
was one of five on the final list 
mahfouz set his early novels in the time of the pharaohs but 
his later works move to the crowded alleys of modern cairo said 
the academy 
mahfouz who spends an hour each day in bazaar coffee shops 
once said he considered his writing probably fourth or fifth 
rate 
although he ranks among egypts most popular writers mahfouzs 
realistic almost dickensian portrayals of the wretched conditions 
under which his countrys poor live have made his popularity less 
than unanimous 
his 1967 novel miramar attacked thenpresident gamal abdel 
nassers domestic and panarabist policies the characters guests 
at an alexandria hotel pay lip service to the ideals of 
revolution while privately holding them in contempt 
the academy singled out mahfouzs 1959 work children of 
gebelawi which was banned in his own country 
the books characters were based on adam and eve moses jesus 
mohammed and a modern scientist 
the academy described the work as an allegory of humanitys 
historic destiny under the great monotheistic founders of 
religion 
arabic has between 150 and 200 million native speakers but they 
are concentrated in about 21 countries many with small literate 
populations 
his major work was the trilogy completed in 1957 a 1500page 
semiautobiographical work 
twelve of mahfouzs 40 novels or volumes of stories have been 
translated into english and a smaller number have been published 
in german french and swedish 
he also has written short stories plays and more than 30 film 
scripts based on his novels 
mahfouz worked in culturerelated posts for the egyptian 
government until his retirement in 1971 
his first novels were written at a time of nationalist foment in 
egypt before the 1952 revolution led by nasser who died in 1970 
the academy said these novels set in ancient egypt were social 
utopias written from the need of national identity 
the literature prize begun in 1901 is one of five established 
by the estate of alfred nobel who left a fortune from his 
invention and marketing of explosives a sixth the economics 
prize was added by the bank of sweden in 1968 
other nobel prizes will be announced next week medicine on 
monday economics on tuesday and physics and chemistry on 
wednesday the peace prize was given sept 29 to the un 
peacekeeping forces

vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen 
returned to the capitol today and urged his democratic colleagues 
to get down to work for their partys national ticket 
the texas senator met with house speaker jim wright dtexas 
and then spoke at a closeddoor meeting of house democrats he 
received loud applause several times in what attendees described as 
a fireemup address 
he then strolled over to the senate where reporters were 
allowed in for the beginning of his session with democrats there 
bentsen received a standing ovation when introduced by senate 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva with a slip of the tongue 
byrd seemed to express the feelings of many senators that bentsen 
not michael dukakis should head the ticket 
my colleagues its my pleasure to present to you the next 
president the next vice president byrd said to roars from his 
fellow democrats 
with congress close to adjourning for the year and attention 
focused on tonights final presidential debate bentsen took time 
out from campaigning to spend most of the day in washington 
its a call to arms said joe oneill bentsens chief of 
staff 
the democratic ticket this year has had much more support from 
locallyelected officials than walter mondale did four years ago 
but aides say a total commitment is needed to squeeze out a victory 
we can win this thing but its got to be everybody pulling 
together said oneill 
enter bentsen who regardless of his position on the ticket has 
tremendous clout because of his chairmanship of the senate finance 
committee he declined to elaborate on what pitch he would throw to 
get the democrats in congress moving 
oh i dont want to tell them ahead of time he said 
bentsen said he would be calling dukakis on the telephone today 
to wish him luck in the debate he expressed confidence in the 
massachusetts governor but denied there was any more pressure on 
the democrat than there is on bush 
i think its important for both of them no more important 
for mike than it is for bush he said 
asked what advice hed have for dukakis he said im going to 
say just what he said to me be yourself 
hang loose he added 
dukakis is not known for hanging loose and has often been 
criticized for being cold and aloof bentsen scoffed at reporters 
questions on that topic 
hes going to do good lets watch it hell do great he 
said 
bentsen planned to fly tonight to houston to watch the debate 
and then attend a postdebate rally there on friday hes 
scheduled to fly to california for a joint rally with dukakis 
on wednesday bentsen campaigned in missouri and arkansas 
highlighting issues such as economic nationalism and bushs choice 
of dan quayle as a running mate which the democrats hope dukakis 
can hammer home during the 90minute nationally broadcast debate 
bentsen told a crowd outside the courthouse in columbia mo 
about quayles assertion that america is still the envy of the 
world 
but not because of people like dan quayle and george bush who 
refuse to stand up for the american economy he said 
today i read in the newspaper that dan quayle says hes going 
to be his own campaign manager be his own dr spin 
control he said that may be his pitch but ill bet its 
thrown george bush a real curve ball 
bentsen said bushs choice of quayle was another example of how 
the vice president swings and misses in the war against drugs 
no runs no hits no progress he said

even moderate use of cocaine during the first 
three months of pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of 
spontaneous abortion and premature birth a researcher says 
the longterm effects of this socalled recreational use of 
cocaine early during pregnancy are not yet known said dr kenneth 
jones a birth defects specialist at the university of california 
san diego 
earlier studies of women who use cocaine heavily often in 
combination with other drugs suggest that cocaine can produce 
abnormal behavior in 3dayold infants and can lead to increased 
risk of bleeding in the brain which may or may not be related to 
the behavioral difficulties jones said wednesday night at the 
annual meeting in new orleans of the american society of human 
genetics 
these are the most important things we know about prenatal 
cocaine we dont know how they the infants are going to do when 
they grow up he said in an interview to label them 
neurological cripples is unfair 
the infants show irritability and emotional distress when 
handled or dressed jones said adding that standard tests to 
assess their health show that the infants have an impaired ability 
to interact with their environment 
in his ongoing study of modest cocaine users those who said 
they used less than one gram of cocaine per week and said they used 
no other drugs jones found that 17 of the 73 women or 23 
percent had spontaneous abortions 
thirteen women or 18 percent gave birth prematurely 
jones emphasized that the results are preliminary and that the 
study has not been subjected to the scientific scrutiny that 
customarily takes place before an article is accepted for 
publication in a medical journal 
studies of heavy cocaine users have shown that they often 
experience detachment of the placenta from the uterus which can 
produce spontaneous abortion if it occurs early in pregnancy or can 
produce abrupt birth if it occurs later in pregnancy 
this detachment and the behavioral problems associated with 
cocaine use in pregnancy might all be consequences of the effects 
cocaine has on the blood vessels jones said 
cocaine causes the blood vessels to tighten and narrow and 
results in an increase in blood pressure these changes could 
trigger placenta separation and bleeding in the brain jones said 
further studies are necessary to assess these problems more 
carefully but such studies are difficult because many women who 
use cocaine also use other drugs and therefore it is difficult to 
determine precisely which problems are associated with cocaine 
rather than the other drugs jones said 
additionally because cocaine use is presumed to be harmful 
during pregnancy researchers may suffer from a subtle bias in 
which they seem to see more harm than can actually be proven to 
occur from cocaine use during pregnancy 
they may see things in the data that arent there he said

deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov its new ambassador to 
kabul an afghan foreign ministry spokesman said today 
the appointment of such a highlevel official appeared to be 
designed to emphasize the importance the soviet union will continue 
to place on afghanistan despite withdrawing its troops western 
diplomats said 
it puts a guy with a great deal of clout here to show how much 
they support the place one of the diplomats said on condition of 
anonymity 
the afghan foreign ministry spokesman when asked why moscow had 
chosen someone of such high rank said only that it meant 
afghanistan was an important country under briefing rules the 
spokesman is not identified 
the spokesman also denied claims made in neighboring pakistan 
that the moslem guerrillas battling afghan troops shot down five 
afghan air force planes and helicopters last week 
the ussupported guerrillas have their headquarters in 
pakistan 
vorontsov will replace nicholai igorytchev a member of the 
soviet communist partys central committee whose departure 
appeared quite abrupt 
igorytchevs farewell reception took place at midday today 
barely 24 hours after the invitations were received at other 
diplomatic missions in kabul such invitations are usually sent out 
about two weeks in advance 
the appointment of a new soviet ambassador comes at a time when 
both moscow and the sovietstyle government in kabul have been 
stepping up diplomatic pressure to end the fighting between afghan 
government forces and usbacked moslem guerrillas 
under an accord signed in geneva on april 14 the soviet union 
is to complete the pullout of its troops from afghanistan by feb 
15 1989 the withdrawal started may 15 and is now at the halfway 
point with an estimated 50000 to 60000 soldiers remaining in 
afghanistan 
soviet forces intervened in afghanistan in december 1979

a major nuclear weapons test today 
registered 58 on the richter scale and shook highrise hotels and 
apartment buildings in this gaming capital 80 miles from ground 
zero 
the 58 reading on the measure of ground motion at the national 
earthquake information center in golden colo was one of the 
highest from a nuclear test in some time according to center 
spokesman russ needham 
the 7 am blast prompted calls to operators at some las vegas 
resorts with guests asking if there had been an earthquake 
the test codenamed dalhart was the 11th conducted this year 
at the nevada test site and the 686th announced blast at the remote 
desert site since testing began there in january 1951 
the nuclear device was buried 2100 feet beneath the surface of 
yucca flat 
energy department spokeswoman barbara yoerg who was in a 
control building 12 miles from ground zero at the time of 
detonation said the building was still swaying perceptibly 20 
seconds afterward 
ms yoerg who has been at the site for many of the blasts said 
todays was one of the strongest she has felt 
she said the test had an explosive force of less than 150 
kilotons the limit set by ussoviet treaty the shot would have 
been near the upper limits based on the richter reading and the 
building motion described by nevadans 
dora rosso a switchboard operator at the energy department 
office west of the las vegas strip said venetian blinds started 
moving side by side then we could feel the chair moving side by 
side 
this is the first one weve felt in a long time at ground 
level she said you were very aware of it there was a 
quivering motion for about a minute

newly uncovered notes kept by robert e peary 
show the explorer claimed to be the first person to reach the north 
pole even though he knew he hadnt come closer than 121 miles an 
astronomer and historian says 
the new evidence indicates peary knew exactly how far away he 
was and turned back when supplies ran low and warming weather 
threatened to make the floating ice too dangerous dennis rawlins 
said in an interview today 
peary had been under pressure to publicly declare his 1909 
expedition a success said rawlins who uncovered a previously 
sealed file in the johns hopkins university library 
my feeling is his reaction was he had to make the claim 
because he had published a book in 1907 saying he got close and it 
didnt sell at all rawlins said 
he had the task of hoaxing the world while under the harshest 
spotlight all the while accusing his archrival explorer frederick 
a cook of faking the very same attainment the amazing thing is 
he had the guts and the intelligence to pull it off 
rawlins findings published wednesday in the washington post 
are the latest salvo in an 80year geographical dispute over 
whether peary was the first to reach the north pole and if not 
whether he knew how far off the mark he had been 
the peary controversy erupted almost immediately after the 
explorer lodged his claim because he did not provide evidence such 
as the records of his sextant readings to show he had been at the 
pole 
a slip of paper with pearys sextant readings and other 
navigational calculations apparently written while he was at his 
northernmost point during the expedition was suppressed by peary 
and then was sealed and placed in the national archives along with 
his other papers many years after his death in 1920 
in 1984 pearys descendants unsealed the papers containing 
mostly numbers that remained undeciphered until rawlins obtained 
them 
pearys scrawled calculations understandable only to someone 
familiar with navigation by the stars show the explorer came no 
closer to the pole than 121 miles according to rawlins 
despite the coverup rawlins says peary still discovered the 
northernmost point of land in the world cape jesup in northern 
greenland and ranks as the greatest us polar explorer in 
addition peary should be credited with completing a difficult 
400mile crossing over land through an obstacle course of drifting 
ice floes 
there had to have been a core of integrity to him or he 
wouldnt have kept this record rawlins said the reason i 
believe he kept it was because he was so justly proud of the 
greatest journey in the history of arctic exploring 
long before finding the new evidence rawlins had suspected 
peary missed his mark in 1970 based on pearys diaries and 
testimony from his companion on the trip matthew henson he wrote 
an article in the us naval institute proceedings making a strong 
case that pearys claim was fraudulent 
in 1973 rawlins published a book peary at the north pole 
fact or fiction providing additional evidence against pearys 
claim 
in the september issue of national geographic magazine a 
british arctic expert wrote that new knowledge of arctic weather 
currents and ice drift and analysis of pearys documents indicate 
he missed the mark by 30 to 60 nautical miles

a 50state survey involving nearly 10000 likely 
voters has found george bush leading solidly in the presidential 
race that counts the statebystate contest for electoral votes 
surveys have found a close race between republican presidential 
nominee bush and democrat michael dukakis across the nation as a 
whole but the abc newswashington post poll examined their 
standings in each state where the election actually is decided 
the result bush led firmly in 21 states with 220 electoral 
votes just 50 short of the total needed to win abc reported 
wednesday dukakis was ahead in three states and the district of 
columbia for 30 electoral votes 
voter sentiments can change before the nov 8 election and some 
polls have indicated different outcomes than the abcpost survey 
which was notable for its size and scope 
bush called the survey interesting and encouraging but said 
he would stick to his strategy he told abc if polls are 
encouraging it makes me feel good but i also remember when they 
werent 
the poll was conducted among 9778 likely voters in the 50 
states and the district of columbia from sept 21 through monday 
margins of error varied with differing sample sizes in each state 
and abc would not disclose them 
abc and the post also conducted a standard national survey that 
put the race at 51 percent for bush to 45 percent for dukakis a 
cbs newsnew york times poll wednesday had nearly the same margin 
for bush 4742 
national polls measure sentiment across the nation as a whole 
but in the election each state gives its electoral votes to the 
winner in that state so statebystate standings are more relevant 
such surveys rarely are done because polling in all the states 
requires a far larger sample than surveying the nation as a whole 
the abcpost poll interviewed 100 to 500 voters in each state 
sampling error was high for the poll with the margin of error 
for each state ranging from five to 10 percentage points pollsters 
for the network said they had large enough samples to characterize 
the state races 
those they put firmly in bushs column included texas where 
recent state polls have given him a 10point lead new jersey 
where he led by eight points in a state poll last week and ohio 
where he led in a state poll a month ago by just four points the 
states they said were leaning toward bush included new york where 
most other recent polls have shown a slight dukakis lead and 
california where most recent polls have found a tie 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a survey released today by the buffalo news found dukakis 
holding a 9 percent lead over bush 49 percent to 40 percent in 
new york state including a commanding 62 percent to 28 percent 
lead in the new york city area 
politicalmedia research inc of washington dc conducted the 
survey of 850 registered voters monday and tuesday the poll had a 
margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points

the cbstimes poll meanwhile found increasing doubt about sen 
dan quayles qualifications to serve as president by a 21 margin 
probable voters in the poll said they would worry about quayle the 
republican vice presidential nominee if he had to take over as 
president 
the poll indicated the concern was keeping the race a close one 
in terms of the contest nationally when respondents were asked 
their preference if they could vote for president only without a 
running mate support for dukakis dipped from 45 percent to 41 
percent bushs remained at 50 percent 
the cbstimes poll was done oct 8 through monday among 1009 
probable voters the smaller national abcpost poll was done oct

state health officials say the weekend shutdown of 
a plutonium processing building at the rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant raises doubts on the facilitys ability to clean up the 
pollution it creates 
officials with the us environmental protection agency and the 
colorado department of health said wednesday that the closure would 
prompt them to take a closer look at the plant operators plans to 
remove pollution there 
the question is one of the competence of the people 
involved said mike sattler of the health department 
rockwell international corp operates the plant for the us 
department of energy 
the shutdown and ongoing cleanup operations are separate 
issues but our visibility may increase as a result of it said 
epas nat miullo we may have more frequent inspections of the 
plant we have to be more visible 
state officials and the epa are studying 107 polluted sites at 
the plant and designing plans to clean them rocky flats officials 
are providing most of the information about the sites and 
recommending cleanup operations 
the area of most immediate concern is known as the 881 hillside 
where chemical pollution has tainted groundwater and threatens 
woman creek 
doe officials in washington on saturday stopped operations in 
building 771 where rockwell manufactures triggers for the nuclear 
weapons and recovers plutonium from contaminated materials and old 
parts 
the shutdown resulted from an incident earlier this year when 
three men went into a restricted area without respirators the 
incident posed no health threat to the men doe officials said

committee crippled his campaign by breaking a promise to contribute

rest even though his financially strapped campaign couldnt afford 
television ads without it 
dunn has spent 250000 of his own money on his campaign and

the united states and the soviet union today 
signed a fiveyear agreement providing for joint research programs 
to combat aids drug abuse alcoholism and polio 
signing for the soviet side valentin pokrovsky president of 
the soviet academy of medical sciences expressed hope that the 
ceremony will mark the beginning of a wonderful long road which 
we will travel together 
samuel o thier president of the national institute of 
medicine signed for the united states the ceremony at the 
national academy of sciences featured champagne toasts and numerous 
expressions of friendship and good will 
the initial plans call for several joint activities in 1989 
including a symposium in the united states on aids research and a 
meeting in the soviet union on the health effects of radiation 
at a news conference wednesday night pokrovsky said the last 
summit meeting between president reagan and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev and the general political atmosphere have 
contributed to closer cooperation he wore a lapel pin displaying 
the soviet and american flags 
he said aids and nuclear radiation are two logical areas for 
cooperative research 
pokrovsky said american experts are particularly interested in 
learning about the soviet experience following the disaster at the 
chernobyl nuclear power plant in april 1986 dozens of persons are 
reported to have died in that accident 
it would be gross negligence not to research in detail all 
aspects of this accident pokrovsky said 
at the same time he said soviet doctors are eager to learn 
more about how the american medical community deals with the aids 
problem 
he said there has been only one soviet fatality since march 1987 
as a result of aids but 81 persons who are not yet sick have been 
diagnosed as carrying aids antibodies he acknowledged that the 
percentage of soviet citizens who have been tested for aids is 
relatively small 11 million 
there have been about 300 cases of nonsoviet citizens in the 
soviet union afflicted with aids primarily students from african 
countries where there is a high incidence of the disease pokrovsky 
said 
while the aids problem has acquired almost catastrophic 
dimensions in the united states he said it is only a 
localized infection in the soviet union 
he suggested that one reason is that soviet drug users are far 
less susceptible to aids than their american counterparts 
the incidence of drug abuse through a needle is very low in 
the soviet union he said 
the research on drug abuse and alcoholism pokrovsky said will 
focus on the circumstances of addiction possible genetic origins 
and the effects on future generations

the united states today began airlifting food 
and medical supplies to thousands of sick and starving people in 
famineravaged southern sudan after the sudanese government agreed 
to let the aid go thruough the state department said 
the airlift got underway after a meeting in khartoum of sudanese 
prime minister sadek elmahdi us ambassador g norman anderson 
and walter bollinger an official of the us agency for 
international development 
the agreement breaks a deadlock between the sudanese government 
and foreign aid donors state department spokesman charles redman 
said food and medical supplies are being airlifted to prepositioned 
storage points 
the relief plan was drawn up by a team from the state 
departments office of foreign disaster assistance the sudanese 
government and other donors including private groups according to 
a cable from the us ambassador in khartoum a copy was obtained 
by the associated press 
the cable quoted the sudanese prime minister as saying 
i have followed the work of the team which is helping us deal 
with some of our problems we appreciate that good work and feel it 
enhances the friendly relations between our people and the people 
of the united states 
the sudanese government which has fought an intermittent war 
with christians and animists in the south who resisted the 
imposition of islamic law had resisted delivery of food supplies 
into rebel areas 
lately however the rebel sudaense peoples liberation army 
commanded by useducated col john garang has fired on relief 
planes and convoys making assistance difficult the rebels are 
backed by the marxist government in ethiopia 
the united states has good relations with sudan which received 
100 million in american aid last year in africa only egypt gets 
more us economic assistance 
bollinger was quoted in the cable as saying the relief plan 
reflects a joint effort on the part of the united states and the 
sudan to provide essential food and medicines to thousands of 
people who face death from hunger and disease 
the englishlanguage newspaper sudan times reported on wednesday 
that troops and rebels weree fighting housetohouse in the 
besieged southern sudanese town of torit and that roman catholic 
archbishop paride taban had sent a plea we implore you to pray 
for peace 
the army meanwhile confirmed reports by the peoples liberation 
army that the rebels had captured ikotos a town near torit it 
said soldiers made a tactical withdrawal from the town 
the army claimed its 108man garrison had inflicted many 
casualties among more than 3000 rebels attacking from three sides 
but gave no figures for casualties the rebels said friday that 62 
soldiers had died in the threeday battle and that 300 had fled 
into uganda 
the fall of ikotos gives the rebels control over three towns 
that form a triangle around torit capital of east equatoria 
province 85 miles east of juba the largest city in the south 
liberation army fighters captured kialla and katire weeks ago 
the sudan times said street fighting was reported this week in 
torit and that the archbishop has been sending appeals for food and 
other relief supplies for the besieged populace 
this is my last message to you tabans message read 
according to the newspaper we implore you to pray for peace 
he said catholic agencies in his diocese have nothing else to 
offer torits thousands of hungry people but the town has given up 
on expecting help from the outside the newspaper reported 
bollinger was quoted in the cable that reached the state 
department today as saying critical food shortages brought on by 
civil strife in the south heavy rains and other problems have 
driven thousands of people from the countryside into towns were 
resources have been streatched beyond limit 
he added the us is pleased to be able to join others in the 
donor community in assistant the government of sudan in its efforts 
to support the men women and children who are at risk 
the relief operation began with planes carrying food and medical 
supplies from storage points in in kadugli outside abyei to al 
muglad and babanusa to the west the cable from khartoum said 
ambassador anderson reported that flight operations will begin 
to other locations in southern kordofan which has been isolated 
and where hundreds of thousands of displaced people face possible 
starvation 
in addition to the food supplies the cable said the relief 
plan also calls for drugs and medical supplies to assist 250000 
people for three months 
last week the state department and the agency for international 
development deplored recent attacks on relief efforts by insurgents 
in the south 
aid said nine kenyan drivers and assistants had been killed or 
were missing and several relief trucks had been disabled or 
abandoned the us agency accused the peoples liberation army of 
trying to shoot down a civilian relief aircraft carrying american 
supplies to juba on sept 25 
we deplore these outrageous actions which target trucks and 
planes that are undertaking humanitarian missions state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said we call on all 
parties to the conflict in sudan to avoid interference with the 
movement of emergency relief operations so that the hungry might be 
fed and the sick attended

the trial of a man charged with drunken 
driving on horseback has ended in a deadlocked jury 
if theyre going to take your license for riding a horse they 
ought to make you have tags and a license for it said defendant 
barry michael treadway after the mistrial wednesday 
assistant district attorney art jacobson said he believed some 
of the jurors were troubled about applying the drunken driving law 
against a horseman he said he had not decided whether to pursue 
the case 
treadway 26 of canton had been convicted in district court 
last month and the jury was impaneled to hear his appeal 
treadwell was arrested about 2 am july 24 by city police who 
found him sitting atop a horse in the parking lot of homers keg 
room 
officers testified monday that treadway was fussin and 
cussin and appeared intoxicated when he dismounted 
treadway said he was not the man who had been seen riding the 
horse around the parking lot 
the horses owner who had been at a horse show nearby asked 
treadway to hold the horse while he stepped inside to use the 
telephone the defendant said 
treadway admitted drinking four to five beers at the horse show 
several hours before his arrest and a breathalyzer test at the 
police station indicated a blood alcohol level of 010 the legal 
minimum for intoxication 
treadways conviction in district court netted him a sevenday 
jail term 500 fine and loss of his drivers license for four 
years he risked losing his license for up to five years if 
convicted in superior court but said he appealed in part to 
fight a law he considered unfair

the armed forces first said the dead were guerrillas but then 
changed its version to say eight civilians were killed in a 
guerrilla ambush and army troops killed two of the ambushers 
lazo said the federal judge in san sebastian 30 miles east of 
san salvador was asked to issue warrants for the arrests 
san sebastians jurisdiction covers the village of san 
francisco where according to residents soldiers of the jiboa 
battalion used grenades and rifle fire to kill seven men and three 
women suspected of collaboration with leftist guerrillas 
we have asked the judge to order the arrest of four people 
all soldiers in the jiboa battalion said lazo sufficient 
evidence exists to justify their detention the testimony of the 
relatives the neighbors the local and international press knows 
that those who killed them the victims were soldiers 
lazo said residents of san francisco reported up to eight 
soldiers were involved in the slayings and that more arrests could 
be requested he said no officer has been implicated 
the slayings were the first massacre of such magnitude 
attributed to government forces in four years 
a 9yearold civil war pitting leftist guerrillas against 
government forces has killed an estimated 65000 people most of 
them civilians

house speaker jim wright today advised his 
partys presidential candidate michael dukakis to get rid of his 
slick commercials and be himself relax and say it like it is 
for the final 26 days of the campaign 
people who know mike dukakis like him wright told 
reporters as a human being warm with feelings and 
convictions 
he said the massachusetts governor should get rid of these 
commercials that try to hawk the candidate like toothpaste or soap 
flakes when that happens were going to win 
wright dtexas called his comments constructive 
suggestions and not criticism of the dukakis media machine but 
added i think the media advisers not just for dukakis but in 
general are too clever by half 
he told a story of having bought a block of 30 minutes on 
television in one congressional campaign where he faced strong 
opposition against the advice of media experts who told him no one 
would listen for that long 
you cant tell me that people wont listen to something 
serious wright said this is serious business this is the 
future of america 
and he called the efforts of vice president george bush to base 
the gop campaign on matters like the american flag and the 
massachusetts prison furlough system petty and silly and cheap 
and trivial 
all the states have furlough programs and he dukakis 
inherited that from a republican predecessor wright said to use 
it as campaign fodder is unworthy of a presidential campaign 
perhaps if you were running for sheriff wright said 
and for any party to claim the american flag as its exclusive 
property surely is beneath the dignity of a nation like this this 
is america were too big to spend our time on all this little 
petty stuff

hundreds of university of illinois students 
held a candlelight march and rally to protest a series of sexual 
attacks on campus and the sexism that organizers said lies at the 
root of the problem 
sexism making women sex objects is closely tied to the 
degradation of women which ultimately can lead to rape said 
laurel maclaren one of the students who put together wednesday 
nights demonstration 
the rally was called to raise the awareness of students to a 
string of 13 sexual attacks since april by what police have labeled 
a serial rapist 
about 500 students most holding candles took part in the march 
and the rally at the universitys urbana campus 
ive been raped as many of the women on this campus have 
student jenny keller said at the rally were not asking for 
pity were demanding respect for the strength it takes to 
go through this experience 
the rally also called attention to an increasing number of 
acquaintance rapes in which the two people know each other 
maclaren said 
another speaker at the rally jeff jochims president of the 
universitys interfraternity council called on university 
officials to solve the no 1 problem on the campus and make 
sure this place is safe 
rally organizers also condemned one of the traditional rites of 
college life the panty raid 
were working to change the image of fraternities jochims 
said 
last month a campus sorority gamma phi beta signed a criminal 
complaint against the sigma alpha mu fraternity after fraternity 
members raided the sorority house and attempted to throw a sorority 
member into a shower jochims said

the national geographic society finally 
changed its view of the world on thursday 
and still had it flat 
society officials unveiled a new world map drawn by a 
projection method that differs radically from the one it has used 
since 1922 and said they would distribute 105 million copies with 
the december issue of the national geographic magazine 
after more than a halfcentury of using the van der grinten 
projection the national geographic society is adopting the 
robinson projection which we believe more clearly portrays the 
world as it really is said john b garver jr chief 
cartographer for the society 
both robinson and van der grinten are known as compromise 
projections according to the american congress on surveying and 
mapping 
you cant have what you want you would like to have all the 
right sizes and all the right shapes said arthur h robinson 
developer of the new map 
but because any flat map distorts some parts of the earth 
mapmakers have to try and find a balance between the relative size 
and shape of continents their relationships with one another and 
the oceans separating them 
garver said that robinsons projection has less distortion in 
the size of land masses located far from the equator making 
countries such as canada and the soviet union appear closer to 
their real size 
in addition by reducing the size distortion of land areas the 
robinson map shows more of the earths surface as water that also 
is a more accurate portrayal since 71 percent of the planets 
surface is 
water 
robinson a professor emeritus at the university of 
wisconsinmadison began developing his mapping ideas during world 
war ii refined them in the 1950s and produced his projection in 
1963 
i hesitate to say this but it is pretty much an artistic 
process rather than a scientific one you try to get the most 
realistic view of the world said robinson i worked with the 
variables until it got to the point where if i cnaged one of them 
it didnt get any better and so i stopped 
based on an ellipse the robinson projection has lines of 
longitude curving toward the poles as does the van der grinten 
that it replaces but the poles are points on the van der grinten 
maps and lines on robinsons projection 
the van der grinten projection developed in 1904 by american 
engineer alphons van der grinten is based on a circle it was 
adopted by the society in 1922 
probably the best known map projection is the mercator 
developed some 400 years ago which has straight lines of longitude 
and latitude forming a grid on a rectangular map 
it became popular because it allows navigators to plot their 
courses as straight lines the only map on which this can be done 
however it greatly distorts the size of land areas away from the 
equator 
national geographic maps however are not intended as 
navigational charts leaving the society free to try to find better 
perspectives as to the sizes of major areas 
a poorly chosen map projection can actually be harmful we 
tend to believe what we see and when fundamental geographical 
relationships such as shapes sizes directions and so on are badly 
distorted we are inclined to accept them as fact if we see them 
that way on maps the american cartographic association has 
commented 
robinsons map is considered superior to the van der grinten 
because it is less distorted at areas distant from the equator 
for example on van der grinten maps greenland appears to be 554 
percent larger than it really is while it is only distorted by 60 
percent on the robinson projection 
on van der grinten maps the soviet union appears 223 percent too 
large and the united states seems to be 68 percent bigger than it 
actually is on the robinson maps the soviet union is just 18 
percent larger than it should be and the united states is 3 
percent smaller

naguib mahfouz winner of the 1988 nobel 
prize for literature is a habitue of bazaar coffee shops and once 
called his writing fourth or fifth rate 
although he ranks among egypts most popular writers mahfouzs 
realistic almost dickensian portrayals of the wretched conditions 
under which his countrys poor live have made his popularity less 
than unanimous 
one book of his was banned from egypt and another attacked 
thenpresident gamal abdel nassers domestic and panarabist 
policies 
widely translated he writes in arabic but has little respect 
for arab writers including himself once asked to rate his work 
mahfouz said probably like the rest of modern arabic literature 
fourth or fifth rate 
he spends an hour a day in the coffee shops of khan khalili 
soaking in the ambiance of one of the middle easts oldest and 
largest bazaars 
he is widely popular throughout the region but does not relish 
public acclaim 
mahfouz was born in cairo in 1911 the youngest child of a 
lowermiddleclass family he showed no interest in foreign 
literature before he entered the king fuad i university in 1930 
but his strongest influences in college became the 
turnofthecentury british social realist novelists and victorian 
writers 
scholars generally place mahfouzs writing in three periods 
the first featured trilogy a 1500page partly 
autobiographical work he completed in 1952 that period entailed 
three historical novels and then a series on social themes 
detailing the struggles of egyptian society 
mahfouzs second period began in 1959 when he turned away from 
social realism toward metaphysical allegory the specialists 
marsden jones and hamdi sakkut wrote in 1978 that in this period 
mahfuz forsook man in society for man in time 
beginning with miramar in 1967 which took aim at nassers 
domestic and panarabist policies mahfouzs third period shows a 
synthesis of the first two periods 
mahfouzs novels are more historical chronicles than political 
treatises their only political meaning being a tangential 
reflection of conditions that politics cause 
nevertheless after nassers free officers movement overthrew 
the egyptian monarchy in 1952 mahfouz showed his displeasure by 
stopping writing for seven years 
his 1959 allegory children of gebelawi which included 
characters based on adam and eve moses jesus mohammed and a 
modern scientist was banned because it contained religious themes 
deemed unacceptable in arab society 
although he writes in arabic his knowledge of ancient arabic 
literature is slight he much prefers writers of the english 
language joyce huxley orwell faulkner hemingway and balzac 
sartre proust and camus in the french 
he once told an interviewer that william shakespeare james 
joyce and leo tolstoy are examples of firstrate writers 
secondraters were hg wells dickens thackeray shaw 
galsworthy huxley and dh lawrence 
but he said he never had read doesnt want to read lesser 
european writers than those adding that he did not suppose many 
europeans would be interested in modern arabic literature as it 
has produced only such writing 
john rodenbeck a professor of literature at the american 
university in cairo who as head of the university press was 
mahfouzs publisher for nine years called him the greatest 
novelist of the arab world living or otherwise 
he said mahfouzs impact on prose narrative will probably be 
everlasting in the arab world

jessica mcclure the toddler who cried and 
softly sang a nursery rhyme while trapped 58 hours in an abandoned 
well shows little sign of her ordeal one year after her daring 
rescue her doctor says 
and midlanders are still proud of how their community responded 
to the little girls plight while the nation watched and waited 
jessica now 2 lost her right little toe and the tip of her 
big toe because of her ordeal she walks normally and doesnt seem 
to suffer from emotional problems such as nightmares or phobias 
said orthopedic surgeon charles younger 
shes a pretty extroverted personable child younger said 
i think shes an intelligent child obviously when she was 1 
and she was singing winniethepooh in the well i think a lot of 
people thought she wouldnt be able to do that 
it is that image of a toddler crying for her mother and 
bravely singing while trapped in a dark narrow shaft that 
captured the imaginations of rescue workers and millions of 
television viewers 
jessica fell into the 8inchwide abandoned well shaft oct 14 
1987 and was wedged 22 feet underground the water well was in her 
aunts back yard where she was playing 
midland firefighters and paramedics feared the shaft would 
collapse on top of jessica if they tried to dig directly to her 
private drilling companies and engineers rushed to help and 
suggested using highspeed diamondtipped drills to bore through 
the hard rock surrounding the well 
while paramedics blew warm air into the shaft to keep jessica 
warm drillers worked around the clock to break through the rock 
their progress agonizingly slow they sank the parallel shaft then 
broke through from below the toddler 
when the gauzewrapped girl was rushed to the surface on the 
night of oct 16 rubbing her eyes in the glare of floodlights 
midlanders poured into the streets honking their car horns 
the crowd at the midland high football game that night roared 
when the announcer interrupted the contest to relay the news 
i look upon it like many midlanders do and thats with 
pride said darlene gifford cochairman of the midland spirit 
committee not only that we did it and brought her out alive but 
that we all got together to do it 
the spirit committee organized a celebratory parade a few weeks 
after jessicas rescue and commissioned a commemorative bronze 
plaque that jessica is scheduled to unveil saturday in downtown 
midland 
the 4foothigh 6footwide plaque depicts jessica being 
plucked out of the well it is meant as a thankyou to companies 
that donated drilling equipment and other heavy machinery and to 
the hundreds of volunteers who drilled the hole handed out food 
and drinks and supervised the effort 
wed had some pretty tough times with the oil business and it 
kind of distanced us from our problems mayor carroll thomas said 
of the 2day drama it made us realize we have friends and 
neighbors 
the rescue and jessicas recovery are remembered with fondness 
and nostalgia 
jessicas room midland memorial pediatric nurse cindi 
walker said lightly tapping her fingers on room 330s door as she 
walked past most of the people we put in here get excited 
because it was jessicas room 
she was so cute she was really tolerant of all the things we 
had to do most kids dont like it when we have to poke and stick 
things in them but she didnt mind much 
jessica was hospitalized for more than a month and underwent at 
least six operations on her right foot which had been jammed 
between her head and the wall of the well the foot was so damaged 
from lack of circulation that doctors considered amputating it she 
also had a pressure wound on her forehead 
her doctor said cosmetic surgery has made the forehead scar 
inconspicuous younger also said the missing toe wont have much 
effect 
the mcclure familys spokesman pete snelson said jessica and 
her parents chip and cissy are recognized just about everywhere 
they go 
people are nice to them snelson said but their privacy 
was taken away 
the mcclures have declined most interview requests 
following the rescue the town council ordered that all 
abandoned wells be capped or plugged and a state official 
criticized jessicas aunt for inadequately supervising the 
youngster before the accident 
two groups of volunteers have negotiated movie rights to the 
story of jessicas rescue snelson said it will be difficult for 
moviemakers to capture the depth of emotion midlanders felt during 
the frenzied rescue effort 
it was a very cohesive force an outpouring of a common 
objective he said it sort of made the economic problems fade 
into the background it gives off a good feeling when youre in 
town its been an uplifting experience

the graceful sight of canada geese slicing through 
the sky in their v formation has become a foreboding sight in 
the northeast 
theyre very pretty to look at unfortunately they leave 
problems behind says elaine moore a selectman in the town of 
stoneham where police on horseback conducted daily goose roundups 
this spring 
in stoneham like many other towns across the region the birds 
were welcomed when they started fluttering in about six years ago 
they would cross main street and you would see the mother and 
the little goslings behind her the traffic would stop and let 
these sweet little things go across the street ms moore said 
the welcome soon wore out as the birds chewed up golf courses 
lawns and landscaped office parks leaving behind liberal 
smatterings of their pungent calling cards 
over the past six years more and more geese have appeared in the 
northeast with more birds stopping short in their journey south 
homegrown flocks have also grown 
a canadian expert on the wild geese said one reason for the 
upsurge in local gaggles is the creation of ideal breeding grounds 
in parks and on golf courses areas of short fertilized grass 
surrounding a body of water 
if you wanted to make a place for geese you could not do 
better than that said harry lumsden who worked for 40 years for 
canadas ministry of natural resources in ontario and now is a 
private consultant 
we make the mistake of allowing the geese to get the idea that 
this park or this golf course is a nice safe place with good 
food he said 
in stoneham a town of 23000 about 10 miles north of boston 
residents complained of being kept awake by the honking and had to 
shoo birds from their lawns with brooms the town reservoir was 
clogged with droppings and police resorted to horseback roundups in 
may to corral the birds at a downtown intersection ms moore said 
george haas migratory bird specialist at the us fish and 
wildlife services boston office said geese can be found along the 
coast from maine to florida but the highest concentrations are 
from maryland northward 
winter population inventories from last year showed 76900 in 
new york 90200 in new jersey 6900 in connecticut and 13600 in 
massachusetts haas said federal officials arent able to 
determine exactly which geese are migrating and which have settled 
in a state he said 
the federally protected birds face few predators and are smart 
enough to outwit many hunters during the limited season he said 
several states have implemented hunting seasons haas said in 
massachusetts about 3000 birds were bagged in an experimental 
season last year 
one of the more innovative goosecontrol methods is the ss 
bytex a radiocontrolled miniature boat the boat has been in 
action since last spring buzzing around a pond at bytex corp in 
southborough to scare off geese said owner and selfstyled 
goosebuster norman heifetz 
lumsden said farmers in ontario can apply for permits to kill 
nuisance birds but scaring the birds away from prime grazing 
grounds with constant noisemakers is usually the most effective 
method 
get after those birds in midmay and dont give them a 
moments peace he advised

free advice to michael dukakis from house 
speaker jim wright get rid of your slick commercials forget your 
media advisers and simply talk to the american people 
hes got to seize every opportunity that he has be on any 
talk show he can be on get rid of these commercials that try to 
hawk the candidate and party like toothpaste or soap flakes 
wright told reporters in answer to a question thursday 
people who know mike dukakis they like him they trust him 
they admire him they respect him as a person as a human being a 
warm individual with feelings and convictions the texas democrat 
said 
he said dukakis trailing george bush in the polls as election 
day nears should go on television and talk directly to the voters 
just as wright said he did when he faced a critical house race in 
texas 
get on the tube and look people in the eye and talk with them 
earnestly and let them get to know mike dukakis wright said 
thats what we need to do and when that happens were going to 
win 
i think the media advisers are too clever by half and ive 
always believed this wright said 
in a personal example he spoke of a major threat he had in a 
campaign once 
against the recommendations of his advisers wright said he 
bought 30 minutes of television time to speak to voters in his 
district 
all the professionals the cynics the consultants said oh 
no you cannot hold them for 30 minutes god almighty theyll tune 
you out he said instead he said he program brought 2000 
phone calls offering help 
they cant tell me that people wont listen to something 
serious he said you dont have to get into a slogan and make 
it into a cheap contest of carnival barkers this is a serious 
business 
taking a shot at george bushs republican campaign he said 
for any party to try to claim the american flag as its exclusive 
property surely is beneath the honor and the dignity of a nation

the presidential press conference has fallen 
into a serious state of disarray under ronald reagan who has 
held relatively few such sessions a harvard commission says but 
reagans spokesman today said the report gave too much emphasis to 
how many sessions are held 
the panel of journalists and scholars urged the next president 
to take his lumps on a more frequent basis in its study on how 
to revive white house news conferences the panel also called for 
making them routine and mostly daytime events 
the longer presidents go without a press conference the 
greater the suspicion that there is something to hide and the 
greater the pressure becomes for holding press conferences the 
harvard commission on the presidential news conference said in a 
report wednesday 
when ultimately the president holds a conference it is 
liable to be a hostile affair in which both the president and the 
press look bad it would seem better on balance for the president 
to take his lumps on a more frequent basis 
asked today to respond to the reports criticism of the 
irregularity with which reagan has held news conferences white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater defended the administrations 
record but he said i dont think any president in good 
conscience would ever commit to numbers on anything 
what im trying to say is that there is a diversity of 
ways to communicate with the general public besides a press 
conference fitzwater added weve held the press conferences 
that we think are appropriate weve held other kinds of press 
interviews that we think are useful and in the final analysis you 
can be the judge 
the commission also said that reporters must behave better the 
public will quit paying attention if it believes reporters 
questions are unfair irrelevant or overly aggressive it said 
the panel recommended that presidents meet with the media twice 
a month during daytime hours and limit televised evening news 
conferences to six a year 
daytime news conferences would reduce the temperature and 
encourage more substantive and useful exchanges the panel said 
the 16member commission appointed by the joan shorenstein 
barone center on the press politics and public policy of harvards 
john f kennedy school of government was cochaired by marvin 
kalb director of the center and frederick w mayer of duke 
university 
the commission said the presidential press conference a 
75yearold institution is not aging well 
once a forum for a vigorous exchange between the president and 
the press the institution has withered the panel said it is 
now in a serious state of disrepair 
the commission gave this history of the institution 
theodore roosevelt according to legend he invited some 
reporters who were waiting in the rain to come inside and hear him 
out the sessions however were not really news conferences the 
reporters simply stood and listened while the president talked to 
them often while being shaved by the white house barber 
woodrow wilson he initiated the news conference he felt 
presidents should be obliged to answer reporters questions just as 
british prime ministers field questions from the opposition in the 
house of commons 
warren harding wilsons successor met with the press twice a 
week for most of his presidency but required that the questions be 
submitted in advance in writing 
calvin coolidge if he didnt like a written question hed 
crumple it up and throw it away 
herbert hoover he met with reporters more than twice a week at 
the start but after the 1929 stock market crash he held less 
frequent short and uninformative meetings 
franklin d roosevelt he met in warm sessions with reporters 
almost twice a week for 13 years around his desk or at warm 
springs ga around his car he often flattered reporters 
impressed them with the depth of his knowledge sometimes bullied 
them once sent a reporter to sit in the corner wearing a dunce 
cap he didnt insist on written questions but sometimes put 
answers off the record and usually could only be paraphrased by 
reporters not quoted directly 
harry s truman he moved the press conference into a more 
formal setting most of what he said was on the record and 
sometimes his spunky spontaneous answers got him in trouble 
dwight d eisenhower he allowed television cameras in changing 
forever the nature of news conferences although live telecasts 
were not permitted 
john f kennedy his press conferences marked by wit became 
the standard against which subsequent presidents would be judged 
or judge themselves he had a briefing book prepared and 
practiced answers 
lyndon johnson kennedy was a tough act to follow and johnson 
to avoid questions when his vietnam policy came under challenge 
took to making long opening statements one study found his opening 
statements consumed more than a third of the time 
richard nixon he averaged only six a year during the watergate 
crisis when he went for five months without a press conference

the us centers for disease control on thursday 
reported progress toward 1990 goals for childhood immunization but 
said adults are not showing up as they should for their shots 
phil horne program management officer for the cdcs 
immunization division said the problem is especially acute among 
the elderly 
in its weekly report the agency said 97 percent of the children 
entering kindergarten in 1986 had been immunized against 
diphtheria measles mumps whooping cough paralytic polio 
rubella and tetanus the goal was 95 percent 
the goal was 90 percent immunization against the same diseases 
for children 2 and under it appears likely that this objective 
will not be met the report said 
it said measles outbreaks among preschoolers although 
stabilized in recent years indicate the immunization level at that 
age is inadequate 
cdc figures show mumps in 1987 at the highest level since 1979 
with 12848 cases illinois and tennessee which had the highest 
number of cases did not start enforcing laws requiring preschool 
mumps immunization until 1987 and 1988 respectively 
the report said the 1990 target for reductions in diphtheria and 
polio appear to have been met and that there is substantial 
progress toward goals for tetanus and rubella 
school is the most forceful instrument we have now to assure 
immunization horne said but laws differ from state to state 
they are not consistent 
he said some states do not require some immunizations or may 
exempt some students on medical or religious grounds 
there is a general perception by the adult population that 
immunizations are childhood activities horne said there is a 
feeling that if they were immunized as a child they do not need to 
be immunized as adults 
he said only about 20 percent of the target population for 
influenza vaccines get the needed annual vaccinations and that 
about 10 percent of the target group has the onetimeonly 
pneumonia shot 
the target groups for both shots he said include people over 
65 or adults with any debilitating illness 
horne said the national coalition for adult immunizations 
formed out of concern for the adult vaccination figures is trying 
to get the word out through volunteer organizations and hopes to 
include its pitch with social security checks 
he said it is difficult to measure success 
with school enterers we can require a statement of proof of 
immunization for entry into school he said most industries 
would not require a similar statement for example for new 
employees 
vaccinations of target groups for hepatitis b he said range 
from an estimated 5 percent to 40 percent to 50 percent with the 
high end including health care professionals such as dentists and 
those who handle human blood products 
the report identified users of illicit injectable drugs and 
homosexual men as target populations less likely to be vaccinated

the senate beginning working on a 26 
billion drug bill today debated an effort by liberal senators to 
strip a provision providing the death penalty for drug offenders 
who kill 
i dont believe our society should ever be one to say this 
one lives and this one dies said sen mark hatfield rore 
the amendments sponsor 
hatfields proposal would substitute a mandatory life sentence 
without possibility of parole for the death penalty it would also 
require mandatory life imprisonment for many violent drug offenses 
for which the bill would impose 20year sentences 
leaders of both parties seemed to have worked out a plan 
allowing the chamber to begin shaping the bill into its final form 
lawmakers held several meetings this morning to work out the final 
problems 
democratic and republican leaders reached agreement late 
wednesday on a procedure for winnowing a list of more than 100 
amendments many of them controversial down to about 56 the 
senate was expected to decide whether to accept the plan today and 
if adopted begin debating the legislation 
lawmakers who helped shape the formula warned that if the 
procedure was not adopted congress might adjourn for the year 
without drug legislation to show the voters 
if people want to fight over the margins in the next few days 
well probably end up going home with nothing said sen sam 
nunn dga 
the bipartisan bill would authorize additional money for 
federal state and local law enforcement agencies and for alcohol 
and drug abuse programs sixty percent of the money authorized by 
the measure would be directed to treatment programs and 40 percent 
would be for law enforcement 
but the legislation lacks a mechanism to pay for the very 
programs it would create lawmakers expect the government to be 
able to scrape together 450 million to finance the measure during 
the next year far short of the 14 billion that would be needed 
for that period 
the bill also would allow capital punishment for some drug 
offenders who commit murder lengthen sentences for drug offenders 
who commit violent crimes and crack down on money laundering by 
requiring better recordkeeping by institutions that sell cashiers 
and travelers checks 
with all 435 house seats and 33 senate seats being contested 
nov 8 legislators have been eager to adjourn for the year and 
campaign with a tough drug measure to boast about congressional 
leaders have been hoping to end the 100th congress by friday 
but those plans and ultimate passage of the drug legislation 
have been jeopardized by amendments waiting in the wngs that were 
likely to spark volatile debates 
house leaders already have warned representatives to be prepared 
to work next week senior members of the senate told their 
colleagues that the drug measure could be completed by friday if 
things go smoothly or next week if disputes persist 
if thats what senators want thats all right with me said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan im not running this 
year 
under the agreement to pare down the list of amendments about 
30 of the proposals would be folded into the legislation those 
would include provisions stiffening penalties for some drug 
offenses giving authorities more weapons for combating child 
pornography and making a newly created federal drug czar a 
member of the white house national security council 
a redhot dispute over a proposal limiting the rights of 
convicted criminals to appeal their sentences on procedural grounds 
would be settled by having congress revisit the issue next year 
eight other amendments would be voted on separately including a 
provision that is expected to lose that would eliminate the bills 
death penalty language 
eighteen other amendments would be considered if senate leaders 
from both parties agreed to put them to votes 
the house on sept 22 passed a similar bill containing the death 
penalty and many provisions eroding the rights of suspects in favor 
of law enforcement authorities president reagan has said he 
prefers the house legislation 
before the measure can be sent to the president for his 
signature the two chambers will have to fashion a compromise bill

the reagan administration is asking the 
government of chile for 12 million in compensation for that 
countrys alleged role in a 1976 terrorist incident in washington 
that claimed the life of chilean opposition leader orlando letelier 
state department spokesman charles redman said that since last 
april the united states has been pursuing claims against the 
chilean government filed by relatives of letelier and of an aide 
who was killed in the same incident ronni karpen moffitt 
their claims against the government of chile for the deaths of 
orlando letelier and ronni moffitt are now as a matter of us 
international law considered the us governments own claims 
redman said 
doing this is a serious step because it reflects a decision by 
the us government that the claims are meritorious and that the 
failure to make compensation constitutes an injury to the united 
states 
redman said there was no breakdown on how much of the claim was 
for the victims relatives and how much for the us government to 
cover the cost of investigating the killings 
letelier and ms moffitt died in a car bombing on sept 21 
1976 in washingtons fashionable embassy row section it was one 
of the most notorious politically motivated terrorist incidents in 
us history 
redman said he did not believe the chilean government had 
responded to the us demand for compensation however the new 
york times which disclosed the us action in thursdays editions 
said chile had rejected the request because it denied 
responsibility for the killings 
the united states has maintained that the killings were carried 
out by chilean secret police agents 
letelier was chiles ambassador to the united states under 
president salvador allende whose government was ousted in a 1973 
military coup 
letelier who also served as defense minister and foreign 
minister was detained by chiles military authorities for an 
extended period after the coup and was living in washington at the 
time of his death he was an outspoken opponent of the military 
government in his country

mayor pete sferrazza says life in this 24hour 
city where divorces are easy and slot machines clang in both 
casinos and supermarkets isnt as stressful as one researcher 
claims 
in fact the twicedivorced and threetimes married twice to 
the same woman mayor says the high suicide divorce crime and 
alcoholism rates that led to the title may be a measure of 
release of stress 
i dont think its an accurate picture of what life is like in 
reno sferrazza said of the ranking reported in psychology today 
living here i know we have a smalltown environment and i know 
its far less stressful 
california psychologist robert levine reported in the november 
issue of psychology today that reno was the nations most stressful 
city and las vegas was right behind it compared to 284 other 
cities in the nation 
nevada gov richard bryan who was born in las vegas replied 
without a bit of stress in his voice folks who reach that 
conclusion need some counseling themselves 
people vote with their feet and tens of thousands of people 
have moved to nevada because of its beauty and many recreational 
opportunities he said 
levine counters moving to a new area often appeals to people 
who are having trouble in their lives so they move to a place 
where conditions are most attractive bringing their pathology with 
them and driving up the rates of divorce suicide alcoholism and 
crime 
pathology 
thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard said tara 
hartsoch who works in the promotions department of harrahs reno 
hotelcasino ive lived here five or six months and i think its 
very relaxed now portland ore was stressful 
no says lifelong reno resident sheryl dembeck los angeles is 
much harder on the nerves than the biggest little city in the world 
my husband lived in los angeles and he says he loves it here 
in reno because its so calm mrs dembeck said sure youve 
got your 24hour lifestyle and it can get fastpaced here but then 
you can go to the mountains or to the lake and get away 
mrs dembeck works in the washoe county clerks office where all 
local divorce filings are handled the consensus from the nine 
clerks is that divorce isnt always a stressful thing 
some of them are real happy about it she said but the 
last time the mayor came in he seemed a little stressed if you ask 
me 
levine a psychology professor at california state 
universityfresno said that failed marriages aside reno and las 
vegas still top the list of stressful cities as far as 
psychological wellbeing goes 
even without the divorce figures which are inflated by the 
presence of so many people who come to nevada just to get a 
divorce the two cities would still be highest in overall 
pathology he said 
las vegas mayor ron lurie agreed that life can be stressful in 
the gambling capital of the world but i dont think were any 
different than any other city 
im stressed all the time he said i just work on nervous 
energy you have to have a good attitude about it 
according to levines survey state college pa was the least 
stressful city in the nation

time and breathing room were running 
out thursday for three gray whales trapped in arctic ice and 
biologists said they had been unable to contact an icebreaker to 
give aid 
the california gray whales apparently were swimming from the 
beaufort sea to their winter grounds off the coast of mexico when 
they got caught in the ice east of point barrow a week ago said 
geoff carroll a biologist for the north slope borough 
he said the whales movement kept open two holes about the size 
of basketball courts about 450 feet offshore but those openings 
shrunk as temperatures plunged on wednesday barrows minus 13 set 
a record low for the date 
a bowhead whale larger and better adapted to ice than its gray 
cousin might break through the 6inch ice carroll said but he 
held little hope for the trio of trapped mammals 
apparently they got over into the beaufort sea and stayed too 
long he said 
the boroughs department of wildlife management tried repeatedly 
to get in touch with an icebreaking vessel that a government 
survey crew reported seeing from the air but radio messages went 
unanswered again today biologists said 
another icebreaker the coast guards polar star began working 
its way to the northwest passage this week after ice off the 
northern alaska coast blocked the vessels intended route to the 
west the polar star was too far from the whales to help them 
coast guard spokesman andy connor said wednesday the coast guards 
second icebreaker the polar sea is in port in seattle 
carroll said the whales were stuck near plover point a spit 
extending southeast from point barrow they appeared in the holes 
about every four minutes he said 
they eat a lot and they have to keep moving carroll said 
im sure theyre going to eat everything thats there before very 
long he said the whales eat plankton from the ocean floor 
the population of california gray whales has been expanding 
carroll said and in recent years the animals have been migrating 
over a larger area near point barrow the first gray whales of the 
season usually are observed early in june he said 
the beluga and bowhead whales that also inhabit those waters 
spend their winters in the bering sea carroll said

officials from north and south korea on 
thursday failed to agree on measures to reunite the peninsula and 
ended a fifth round of talks with each side blaming the other for 
the deadlock 
after two hours of haggling at this truce village inside the 
demilitarized zone separating their nations delegates agreed to 
meet again nov 17 
the northern side took an insincere stand throughout and 
there was no progress lee handong a south korean delegate and 
parliamentarian told a news conference after the meeting 
chon kum chol the chief north korean negotiator said the 
souths position was basically the same as before and they made no 
concessions at all 
the two koreas meeting for the first time since the olympics 
ended oct 2 in seoul made some changes in their positions but 
neither side showed willingness to make major concessions 
delegates first shook hands over a new conference table and 
exchanged small talk previously the table was so wide they could 
not reach across for handshakes 
the cordial mood quickly dissipated as both sides exchanged 
testy statements accusing each other of insincere efforts to find 
ways reunite the korean peninsula which was divided in 1945 
thursdays meeting the fifth since aug 21 was called to 
prepare for proposed main talks between the koreas legislatures on 
nonaggression and other peace measures 
north korea suggested the main talks include onethird of the 
lawmakers from the north or 218 people and half of the souths 
lawmakers or 150 people that was a change from previous meetings 
at which north korea demanded a joint meeting of all the nearly 
1000 lawmakers of the two sides 
south korea wants a smaller meeting it called for largely 
ceremonial opening and closing sessions attended by all legislators 
of both sides and a smaller session for the actual negotiations 
the two sides differ widely over the proposed agenda 
the communist north is putting more emphasis on a nonaggression 
statement seoul officials say the statement seeks the withdrawal 
from south korea of 42000 us troops stationed there 
the south wants to discuss the possibility of setting up a 
summit between the nations leaders north korean delegates oppose 
this as an agenda item 
the first talks were held aug 21 the sides began far apart and 
neither has made significant concessions at the fourth session 
aug 26 both sides blamed each other for blocking progress but 
agreed to meet again after the olympics 
north korea accused south korea on thursday of having left a 
stain on the nations history by hosting the olympics alone in 
seoul 
the olympics are supposed to be a festival of peace and good 
will chon said by having the olympics alone he said south 
korea split the nation 
north korea wanted to share the olympics but the international 
olympic committee said the games are awarded to a single city and 
cannot be shared

irancontra defendant albert hakim is trying 
to invoke attorneyclient privilege to bar the testimony of a 
geneva lawyer who helped him set up the secret financial network 
used in the armsforhostage deals 
hakim has filed a motion to obtain details of everything that 
willard i zucker told prosecutors about the secret swiss bank 
accounts and offshore shell companies that were conduits for 
millions of dollars generated by the arms deals according to court 
papers 
zucker a us citizen who has lived in switzerland for 20 
years operates a financial consulting business in geneva that has 
long overseen hakims banking interests in that country 
a former internal revenue service lawyer zucker has received 
immunity from prosecution for his role in the irancontra affair 
and is listed as a prospective witness by independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh 
zuckers business compagnie de services fiduciares sa csf 
kept the financial records of the arms deals and set up a series of 
dummy corporations and swiss bank accounts for the arms 
transactions 
hakim had long utilized the services of mr zucker and csf in 
the conduct of his legal and business affairs defense lawyers 
said in so doing he has often entered into confidential 
communications with mr zucker for the purpose of securing both 
opinions on law and legal services 
mr zucker is a member of the bar who rendered legal services 
to mr hakim and mr hakim has insisted that all communications 
with respect to those services remain confidential defense 
lawyers n richard janis and lawrence h wechsler said in a 
pleading that was ordered unsealed wednesday by us district judge 
gerhard a gesell 
an accounting of the information zucker provided walsh may 
well result in the suppression of any effort by the government to 
introduce at any trial either the testimony of mr zucker or any 
information derived directly or indirectly from government contacts 
with mr zucker hakims lawyers said 
defense lawyers threatened to try to prevent zucker from 
testifying not only against hakim but his three codefendants in 
the irancontra conspiracy case former national security adviser 
john m poindexter exwhite house aide oliver l north and hakims 
former business partner retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord 
the four are charged with conspiring to defraud the government 
by diverting profits from the usiran arms sale to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
separate trials have been ordered for each defendant 
prosecutors said in a pleading filed thursday they were ready to 
begin norths trial in january they opposed further delays in 
pretrial proceedings sought by north contending the defense was 
merely trying to delay the trial 
zuckers testimony would provide key evidence against all four 
defendants about the clandestine network of swiss bank accounts and 
offshore dummy corporations through which armssale profits were 
diverted to the contras 
his testimony would also support a charge that hakim and secord

police today arrested a teenager and 
charged him with setting one of two dozen fires that have plagued 
the white mountain area recently the arrest came one day after a 
former firefighter was accused in several other blazes 
lawrence coulter jr 19 of jefferson was charged with setting 
a fire earlier this month at a vacation home in dalton two towns 
away from jefferson the scene of most of the fires police said 
someone at a neighboring home saw a man walking from the house 
about the time of the fire and took down the mans license plate 
number but state police lt gary sloper declined to say if the 
plate was traced to coulter 
on wednesday police charged lance lalumiere 23 of jefferson 
with setting one fire in jefferson and said they will seek 
indictments charging him with 15 others lalumiere was charged with 
setting fire to his brothers house in august 
jefferson has been plagued by 21 arson fires since may during 
the period there have been at least three suspicious fires in 
nearby towns the one coulter is charged with setting and two in 
august in lancaster 
despite lalumieres arrest jefferson residents are doubtful 
their siege is over 
well sit up at night til we hear more well go on the way 
we have been said donna hartford whose family narrowly escaped 
a fire that destroyed their home in july 
this is at least something they have done something but i 
dont feel comfortable 
her unease was echoed by others in the community of 850 and 
sloper said five of the towns 21 suspicious or confirmed arson 
fires apparently were set by someone other than lalumiere 
no one has been killed or seriously injured in the fires that 
have blackened pockets of jeffersons 52 square miles of scenic 
meadows woods and hills but there have been close calls among the 
villages 363 residences 
the fires began with a grass fire on may 5 a barn was the next 
target and by late may the first occupied building had been struck 
as the toll of destruction mounted many families began sleeping 
in shifts and abandoned vacation plans some residents began night 
patrols police feared vigilante violence one child packed all her 
precious possessions and mailed them to relatives in other states 
afraid her home would be next to burn 
sloper said lalumiere a restaurant dishwasher had been a 
suspect for some time 
its taken a great deal of time and effort to make sure 
we had more than a reasonable amount of evidence to present he 
said 
lalumiere reported the fire at his brothers home and was there 
trying to put it out when firefighters arrived authorities said 
the fire damaged the front of the building 
lalumiere was asked to resign from the fire department after he 
moved to another town briefly jefferson requires volunteer 
firefighters to live within its borders 
he entered no plea during his arraignment in lancaster routine 
in felony cases in new hampshire he was being held in belknap 
county jail in lieu of 50000 cash bail 
but in an interview two days after the fire at his brothers 
house lalumiere told the weekly coos county democrat all i 
tried to do was save my brothers house and this is the thanks i 
get 
i have nothing to hide he added 
despite the dramatic news many residents said their fears and 
doubts remain 
some townspeople who know lalumiere said they do not believe he 
is capable of singlehandedly setting the fires and eluding the 
elaborate police surveillance in the town since summer 
also some point out that at least two fires occurred after 
lalumiere was under constant police surveillance 
explain the two fires that happened after lance was under 
24hour surveillance hartford said weve all been up today 
thinking there might be something more than lalumieres arrest 
but now its kind of blah 
lalumiere has been staying at a motel in jefferson since august 
william perkins who has lived there since his home burned in may 
said he also doubts lalumiere is involved 
i think theyve got the wrong fish in a cage perkins said 
lalumieres parents who live in jefferson did not answer 
knocks at their door wednesday afternoon 
one resident who spoke under condition of anonymity out of fear 
of reprisals said she would not rest easy until every fire is 
explained and every arsonist convicted 
until then she said i leave my light on and im going to 
stay up with a gun

the shroud of turin is only about 700 years 
old and cannot be the authentic burial cloth of jesus christ as 
believed by millions over the centuries the archbishop of turin 
said thursday 
cardinal anastasio ballestreros announcement that he accepted 
the results of dating tests conducted by three laboratories ended a 
debate over the origin of the cloth that has raged for hundreds of 
years 
but another mystery remains unsolved how the shroud came to 
bear the image of what scientists have called a real human form of 
a whipped and crucified man 
rejecting attempts to brand the shroud a fake ballestrero 
stressed that for the roman catholic church the linen cloth 
remains a venerated object and a powerful symbol of faith 
the church believes in the image and not in the history 
because this image of jesus christ is very interesting and the 
people believe very much in jesus he said 
ballestrero told a news conference at the headquarters of his 
archdiocese that carbon14 tests by labs in the united states 
britain and switzerland concluded with 95 percent accuracy that the 
shroud cannot be more than 728 years old dating to between 1260 
and 1390 
i see no reason for the church to put these results in 
doubt the cardinal said 
the vaticans official newspaper losservatore romano did not 
comment on the announcement but printed the text of the cardinals 
statement on page two 
vatican radio in reporting the news said the chapter is not 
closed noting that the problems of the image on the cloth still 
remain 
although the church has never claimed it as a holy relic the 
shroud has been revered for centuries by millions who believed it 
was the actual cloth that christ was wrapped in after he died on 
the cross others called it a clever forgery 
the sheet 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide 
bears a faint yellowish negative image of the front and back of a 
man with a thorn mark on the head lacerations from flogging on the 
back and bruises on the shoulders 
for years church officials refused to let scientists study the 
cloth 
us scientists who subjected it to rigorous chemical computer 
and photographic analysis in 1981 concluded that it was a real 
human form of a whipped and crucified man and not the product of an 
artist 
luigi gonella scientific adviser to the cardinal said the 
american scientists found the image resulted from chemical changes 
in the linen while it was in contact with the body 
gonella said the church was particularly angered by claims that 
since the shroud dates to medieval times it must be a fake 
a forgery means it was made for the specific purpose of 
deceiving people gonella said this is possible but there is 
no proof of that it could be a medieval icon we dont even know 
how it was made 
believers will be hurt much more by the comments about the 
results than by the results themselves gonella added 
pope john paul ii finally gave the goahead for testing in 1986 
in april the shroud was taken from its red silk wrapping inside 
a silver chest on an altar in turins cathedral postagesized 
samples of the cloth were snipped off for the carbon14 testing 
carbon14 is widely used to date archaeological finds it is a 
radioactive isotope whose halflife the time required for 
disintegration of half its atoms is known thus the amount of 
carbon14 present in an object can reveal its approximate age 
the laboratories that conducted the tests were at the university 
of arizona the swiss federal institute of technology at the 
university of zurich and oxford university all dated the shroud 
to between 1260 and 1390 gonella said 
ballestrero said church officials in turin received official 
results from the three labs on sept 28 and delivered them 
personally to the vatican the next day vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro flanked the cardinal at the news conference 
witnesses from as far back as the 12th century reported seeing 
the shroud in the imperial palace at constantinople the trail was 
then lost until more than a hundred years later in 1354 when the 
shroud was traced to lirey france 
the cloth arrived in turin in 1578 and has remained in its 
silver chest here ever since king umberto ii of italy bequeathed 
it to the pope upon his death in 1983 
the shroud has occupied public attention so much it was even the 
subject of a 1986 broadway musical the show called into the 
light opened to negative reviews and closed after a week

george bush and michael dukakis polished 
their lines one final time thursday in advance of their primetime 
debate the republican looking to protect his lead in the polls and 
the democrat hoping for a breakthrough to transform the 
presidential race in its final weeks 
there was no underestimating the stakes as the two wouldbe 
presidents pointed toward their 90minute 9 pm edt faceoff on 
the ucla campus their second and final debate of the campaign 
predebate polls gave bush a narrow lead among voters nationwide 
with a little less than four weeks remaining to the election 
statebystate breakdowns indicated the vice presidents electoral 
college advantage was more formidable although several large 
battleground states enough to tip the balance of the election 
appeared unsettled 
debate sponsors were looking for a television audience in the 
tens of millions for the second and final clash between the 
republican vice president and the democratic governor of 
massachusetts 
the audience included vice presidential candidates lloyd bentsen 
and dan quayle who held their only debate of the campaign eight 
days ago in omaha neb 
the debate scenery a redcarpeted stage with a blue backdrop 
and oak lecterns was the same one used in the first bushdukakis 
debate in north carolina last month and again in the vice 
presidential debate in nebraska this time it was uncrated and 
erected in pauley pavilion home of the ucla basketball team 
the format for evening was identical to that of the earlier 
clashes with the candidates responding to questions from a panel 
of reporters but having no formal opportunity to question each 
other 
the panelists were moderator bernard shaw of cable news network 
andrea mitchell of nbc ann compton of abc and margaret warner of 
newsweek magazine 
neither bush nor dukakis campaigned during the day although 
both met with aides and arranged to view the debate set a few hours 
before the event began 
dukakis took his customary morning power walk with hand 
weights bush planned no predebate events outside his hotel other 
than his private walkthrough at the debate site 
meanwhile bentsen spent the morning in washington urging his 
colleagues in congress to get behind the national ticket i was 
asking for their support and commitment and their leadershiop in 
their own states and we had a very enthusiastic meeting he said 
after meeting in closed session with democratic members of the 
senate 
quayle who campaigned in three states took time out to 
telephone bush with his advice hit it over centerfield 
from both campaigns the word was that the biggest task of the 
two presidential candidates in their final debate was to define 
where they would lead the country 
bush said wednesday he wanted to help americans understand 
what my heartbeat is what i really care about 
dukakis said one of the nice things about debates is they get 
people out from behind the balloons and out of the flag factory and 
it gets them to address the issues 
house speaker jim wright of texas offered dukakis advice from a 
distance get rid of his slick television commercials and talk 
straight to the voters 
hes got to seize every opportunity that he has be on any 
talk show he can be on get rid of these commercials that try to 
hawk the candidate and party like toothpaste and soap flakes 
said wright 
the commission on presidential debates took over sponsorship of 
the encounter after the league of women voters abruptly backed out 
after complaining that the candidates had refused to relinquish 
control over such details as the format and membership of the panel 
of questioners 
repeated national opinion surveys have said a majority of voters 
question quayles qualifications to succeed to the presidency and 
suggest the indiana senator could cost the republican ticket votes 
on nov 8 
but a washington postabc statebystate survey of 10000 likely 
voters made public on the eve of the debate said bush led solidly 
in 21 states with a total of 220 electoral votes just 50 short of 
the total needed to win dukakis was firmly ahead in only three 
states with 30 electoral votes the survey was conducted over a 
threeweek period beginning sept 21 
debate preparations for bush and dukakis followed the same 
pattern they used before their first confrontation at wake forest 
university in winstonsalem nc 
dukakis rehearsed with washington attorney robert barnett acting 
as a standin for bush 
former deputy treasury secretary richard darman took the role of 
dukakis during the bush preparations

a novelist whose latest book was banned 
in india accused the government of bowing to religious 
fundamentalists and denounced the ban in an angry letter to prime 
minister rajiv gandhi 
indian newspapers on thursday published salman rushdies letter 
which urged a lifting of the ban on the satanic verses 
rushdie 41 is a british citizen of indian descent and lives in 
london he won the booker prize britains most prestigious 
literary award for his first book midnights children a 
broad satire on postindependence india 
satanic verses has also been nominated for the booker prize 
which is announced oct 25 rushdies second novel shame 
earned wide acclaim 
satanic verses was banned oct 5 after complaints from 
moslem members of parliament they said they feared moslem 
militants might use the book to incite communal riots 
the book is sharply critical of religious fundamentalism and 
makes veiled references of the prophet mohammed and the koran the 
sacred book of moslems 
the complicated story which mixes elements of realism and 
fantasy focuses on two indian characters the benevolent one acts 
as a messenger for mohammed the founder of the islamic religion 
the other is satanic and manipulative 
in the letter carried on the front pages of major indian daily 
newspapers rushdie accused gandhi of denying the right to free 
expression at the behest of religious fundamentalists 
the right to freedom of expression is at the very foundation 
of any democratic society and at present all over the world 
indian democracy is becoming something of a laughingstock 
rushdie wrote 
when selfappointed guardians of muslim sensibilities say 
that no civilized society should permit the publication of a book 
like mine they have got things backwards the question raised by 
the books banning is precisely whether india by behaving in this 
somewhat south african fashion can any more lay claim to the title 
of civilized society the author said 
the prime minister was touring northern india on thursday and 
his office had no comment on rushdies letter 
the ban has been widely criticized in india and abroad indian 
newspapers have been particularly outspoken 
the conservative daily the hindu criticized the ban as a 
philistine decision while the antigovernment indian express 
called it thought control 
under the ban the ministry of finance barred importation of the 
book or sale of it there was no hearing before the decision was 
made 
in an interview published thursday in the new york times 
rushdie said the idea that the minister of finance should decide 
what books should be read and not be read is not acceptable in a 
free country 
it seems to me that the government has grown very week in 
india while the power of religious extremists seems to have grown 
very strong he was quoted as saying the book is not the 
issue this is an attempt to manipulate the government 
the satanic verses was published sept 22 in britain and is 
scheduled to be published in the united states in february 
six people including playwright tom stoppard and novelist 
kingsley amis signed a telegram to gandhi protesting the ban 
the protest telegram which was sent last week said we 
consider that the banning of a serious work of literature 
represents a very grave threat to freedom of expression in your 
country and strongly urge you to ensure that the ban is lifted 
the other signers were poet stephen spender philip spender and 
sally laird the director and editor respectively of index on 
censorship a britishbased journal on free speech issues and 
kevin boyle director of article 19 a second anticensorship 
organization

emperor hirohitos jaundice worsened thursday and 
doctors gave him another blood transfusion to fight his anemia 
court officials said 
imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda said the 
87yearold emperor discharged more blood two court physicians 
were spending thursday night watching over the worlds oldest 
living monarch 
doctors say hirohitos enlarged pancreas apparently has blocked 
his bile duct sending bile into his bloodstream and causing 
jaundice 
the emperors kidney and liver functions also appeared to be 
worsening news reports said 
with the 04pint transfusion thursday hirohito has received 
more than 15 pints of blood since his condition worsened 24 days 
ago 
court officials have not confirmed or denied reports that he has 
cancer in the area of his upper intestine 
officials of the governing liberal democratic party said prime 
minister noboru takeshita would resume trips outside of tokyo to 
campaign for a tax reform plan kyodo news service reported 
takeshita suspended the trips after hirohitos condition became 
serious but decided to resume them next week because his condition 
apparently stabilized kyodo said 
concerts festivals political meetings sports meets and other 
events have been canceled because of hirohitos illness some 
japanese have criticized the cancellations as an overreaction 
some courses at tohoku university in sendai in the northwest 
were canceled thursday after about 50 students built barricades and 
began a strike they said hirohitos illness was being used to 
build sympathy for and strengthen the imperial system kyodo said 
some japanese fear a strengthened imperial system could bring a 
resurgence of the nationalism and militarism that characterized 
japan during world war ii 
the militarists who controlled japan during the war used 
hirohitos name to rally public support for japans invasion of 
other asian countries 
japans postwar constitution defines the emperor as the symbol 
of the state and gives him no real political power

senior leader deng xiaoping said thursday that a 
summit ending chinas nearly 30year estrangement from the soviet 
union could be held in 1989 finlands foreign minister reported 
the minister kalevi sorsa said deng made the comment in a 
meeting with visiting finnish president mauno koivisto 
in a statement to the associated press and in comments at a news 
conference in the northern chinese city of xian where he flew from 
beijing sorsa revised his earlier report that deng said a summit 
would be held in 1989 
he said deng told the finnish delegation that if the upcoming 
visit to moscow by chinese foreign qian qichen goes well there 
might be a summit next year 
despite the qualification dengs statement was the first time a 
chinese leader speculated publicly on the date for a summit it was 
the most positive in a series of increasingly optimistic remarks by 
chinese officials on chances for normalization of relations between 
the two communist giants 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
president mikhail s gorbachev is ready to meet with chinas leader 
anytime any place but no date has been fixed yet 
gerasimov indicated the soviets had agreed in principle to a 
meeting with the chinese leadership and said they had sought such 
a meeting for some time 
our suggestion was to have the sinosoviet summit some time 
ago obviously we suggested it be held anytime any place 
gerasimov said as to when and where it would be held it has yet 
to be dealt with 
china and the soviet union were close allies in the 1950s but 
split in the early 1960s over ideological and strategic differences 
china announced last month that qian would visit moscow this 
year for talks that could clear the way for normalized relations 
the exact date has not been set for what will be the first working 
visit of a chinese foreign minister to moscow in 32 years 
the last chinesesoviet summit was in 1959 when nikita s 
khrushchev visited mao tsetung in beijing among other things mao 
was angered by the soviet assumption that it should dictate policy 
to china as a big brother in revolution 
the official chinese news agency xinhua said in its report on 
the dengkoivisto meeting that deng stipulated relations with 
moscow could not return to the alliance of the 1950s with moscow 
in a dominant position 
xinhua did not mention dengs comments on a possible summit 
china long has said there are three obstacles to normal 
relations with the soviet union the soviet troop presence in 
afghanistan the heavy soviet troop concentration in mongolia on 
chinas border and sovietallied vietnams occupation of cambodia 
the soviets pulled some troops out of mongolia in 1987 and began 
to withdraw from afghanistan this year an official in the finnish 
delegation said deng reitered in his meeting with koivisto that 
cambodia is now the main obstacle 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said deng did 
not comment on the status of chinesesoviet talks on cambodia 
premier li peng said in september that the two sides were 
relatively close but still had points of disagreement 
vietnam invaded neighboring cambodia in 1978 and ousted the 
chinesesupported khmer rouge it maintains an estimated 120000 
troops there to support the government it set up under heng samrin 
and battle chineseaided cambodian guerrillas 
china maintains that vietnam could not continue its occupation 
without soviet financial help 
finnish officials said deng did not discuss where a summit would 
be held beijing is considered the likely venue because deng 84 
no longer travels abroad he has retired from most of his party and 
government posts but still retains final authority in setting 
policy behind the scenes

thursday the government will charge ferdinand marcos with crimes 
allegedly committed during his 20 years as president 
mrs aquino also said marcos who fled to exile in hawaii in 
1986 will be allowed to return to the philippines to answer the 
charges philippine law prohibits criminal trials in absentia 
sometime in the future we will file a criminal case or cases 
against mr marcos mrs aquino said at that time we will 
have to allow him to return to face the trial no definite time 
frame can be given as of now for this

indicated her government may delay filing charges against the 
ousted president until us authorities decide whether to prosecute 
him

up to 10 billion before his administration was toppled in the 1986 
uprising that swept mrs aquino to power 
the los angeles times reported tuesday that the us state 
departments legal officer abraham sofaer recommended that us 
authorities allow marcos to surrender millions of dollars he

presidential commission on good government said marcos simply 
wants to return to the philippines to evade prosecution in the 
united states

an excuse by mr marcos to escape his indictment abroad

taken by marcos

the usrun clark air base were killed and another wounded in a

a display of 1000 soviet books at a superpower 
book swap featuring everthing from russian science fiction to 
dr zhivago represents a new chapter in literary glasnost 
organizers said thursday 
the display the ussr perestroika and glasnost has 
drawn a steady stream of browsers curious about life and literature 
in the soviet union said evgueny g semenikhin who is traveling 
with the exhibit 
included are works by boris pasternak whose classic dr 
zhivago was banned for many years in the soviet union 
for our country which was closed so to say for a long time 
this process has a tremendous influence on the whole population of 
the country and especially the creative intelligencia semenikhin 
said 
perestroika or restructuring refers to economic and political 
reforms instigated by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev glasnost 
describes a new policy of government selfcriticism and openness in 
expression 
soviet literature still carries the iron curtainimage of 
propagandaladen tomes and censorship but glasnost has changed 
that said semenikhin deputy chief of the soviet state committee 
for publishing and printing the committee and the us information 
agency are cosponsors of the exchange 
i am in book publishing for about 15 years and i think that 
censorship exists everywhere including the us because here you 
have economic censorship it still exists in the ussr but now 
its absolutely incomparable with what it was two to three years 
ago he said 
georgy ginzburg an art photographer and publisher also 
traveling with the exhibit pointed to pasternaks books and other 
previously banned novels as tangible evidence of glasnost 
theyre publishing all of this which was under the table he 
said 
many notable works however remain under the table such as 
alexander solzhenitsyns the gulag archipelago 
glasnost also has opened doors for artists ginzburg said 
we have a group of artists who used to be considered 
nonconformists now were publishing books on these new artists 
he said 
marshall goldman associate director of harvard universitys 
russian research center called the exchange an interesting 
development 
in the old days you would have these exchanges and it would be 
mostly propaganda thats different now theres some substance 
he said 
i think theyre doing it for an ulterior motive and thats to

twentythree horses have died recently in 
the southern region of andalusia prompting fears of an epidemic 
that could force a change of venue of the equestrian events at the 
1992 olympic games 
the agriculture ministry said thursday that scores of sick 
horses have been tested to see if they have african horse sickness 
but results are not expected until next week if they are found to 
have the disease it would be the second outbreak in 14 months in 
spain 
the ministry said the government has taken the precaution of 
importing 7500 doses of vaccine for african horse sickness from 
south africa where the illness is endemic 
gerard de las casas a government health official from 
andalusia said preliminary tests of 150 sick horses turned up 
negative results for the disease but he said the horses are so 
sick they will have to be put to death 
de las casas said the regional government has prohibited entry 
into southern spain of horses from north africa as well as the 
movement of all horses within the andalusian region 
african horse sickness is also known as equine plague it is a 
viral disease transmitted by insects symptoms include fever and 
fluid retention and death may occur quickly from fluidfilled 
lungs there is no known cure but vaccinations have proved 
effective 
the madrid daily el pais quoted a spanish olympic committee 
official as saying that another outbreak of the illness could 
result in spain being cited as a country where the disease is 
endemic 
the 1992 summer olympic games are to be held in barcelona 
the official who was not identified was quoted as saying that 
an outbreak could force the equestrian events to be held elsewhere 
since equestrians would not want to bring horses to a country where 
the disease is endemic 
the last outbreak of african horse disease in spain occurred in 
august 1987 in central spain 
the most recent horse deaths occurred last week at the swank 
sotogrande resort in cadiz province and in eight sites in 
neighboring malaga province the agriculture ministry said 
the andalusia government said thursday it canceled a special 
show of andalusian horses set for seville during the oct 1721 
state visit of queen elizabeth ii the first state visit to spain 
by a british monarch

the united states detonated a major nuclear 
device deep beneath the nevada desert thursday sending a shudder 
through highrise hotels 80 miles from ground zero 
it was a big one said energy department spokeswoman barbara 
yoerg who was in a building at a control point 12 miles from 
ground zero the building was still swaying 20 seconds after 
detonation 
the 58 reading on the richter scale of ground motion at the 
national earthquake information center in golden colo was one of 
the highest readings from a nuclear test in some time according to 
center spokesman russ needham 
thursdays 7 am blast prompted calls to operators at some las 
vegas resorts with guests asking if there had been an earthquake 
the test codenamed dalhart was the 11th conducted this year 
at the nevada test site and the 686th announced shot at the remote 
desert site since testing began there in january of 1951 the last 
previous test was bullfrog on aug 30 
the nuclear device was buried 2100 feet beneath the surface of 
yucca flat 
the test was announced as having an explosive force of less than 
150 kiltons the upper limit set by ussoviet treaties the blast 
was thought to be near the upper limit because of the richter 
reading and because managers of highrise buildings in las vegas 
were warned two days before the blast not to have workers in 
precarious positions at the time of detonation 
such warnings are issued only when the blast is expected to 
reach near the upper limit 
the energy department used to announce all tests as having a 
force of less than 20 kilotons or as having 20 to 150 kilotons 
that policy was dropped earlier this year and all tests are now 
simply listed as less than 150 kilotons 
the atomic bomb that destroyed hiroshima in 1945 had an 
explosive force of 13 kilotons 
ms yoerg who has been at the site for many of the blasts said 
thursdays shot was one of the strongest she has felt 
it was like when you were a kid being up in a tree on a 
narrow branch and having a strong gust of wind sway the tree 
she said you were swaying side to side

an international banker arrested by the us 
customs service last week had told congress earlier that he managed 
a 20 million secret bank account for panamanaian ruler manuel 
antonio noriega according to senate testimony made available 
thursday 
the witness amjad awan an officer of the bank of credit and 
commerce international bcci said the account was used to make 
cash payments to panamanian politicians and to pay travel and creit 
card expenses for noriega and his family 
awan said he flew to panama monthly to report to noriega on the 
status of his account 
i made an effort to cultivate him awan told investigators 
on sept 30 at a private session of the senate foreign relations 
subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics 
senators attending the session were told awans testimony would 
be closely held because of our concern for mr awans life 
subcomittee counsel jack blum said in the testimony released by the 
office of sen john kerry dmass 
a spokesman for kerry the subcommittee chairman said that 
following awans arrest the panel voted unanimously to release the 
testimony and send a copy of it to the justice department 
awan was indicted this week on charges of money laundering his 
bank which is based in luxembourg was charged in an indictment 
handed down in tampa fla with laundering 14 million in 
narcotics profits for members of colombias medellin drug cartel 
in his senate testimony awan 41 a native of pakistan who 
holds british citizenship denied any knowlege of money laundering 
and said his bank made an effort to avoid any contact with illicit 
cash he also said he had no knowlege of whether or not noriega 
received drug payments 
but he said he made an effort to solicit accounts from noriega 
and in 1982 received from him a deposit of several hundred 
thousand dollars in cash 
he was head of panamanian intelligence at the time and told 
me that this was a secret account a secret service account awan 
said i was told that the account should be kept in a highly 
confidential and secret manner 
awan said the balances in noriegas account went up and down but 
at one point reached a high of 20 million maybe 25 million 
he said he paid cash out of the account only after receiving a 
note signed by noriega preceded by a telephone call telling me 
to expect the person to come in to get these funds 
to whom was the money paid awan was asked 
politicians he replied this was during the time of the 
elections in panama 
he said the expenses for noriegas trips abroad also were paid 
out of the account as were personal expenses charged to credit 
cards held by noriega his wife and their three daughters 
awan said that when he reported to noriega on his account the 
panamanian was not interested in his balance but wanted to know how 
money had been spent 
when i told him that this month we debited 50000 to your 
account he wanted to know what that 50000 consisted of so it 
was basically the airline bills hotel bills visa card debits 
limousines reservations theater tickets schools hospitals 
the st petersburg fla times on thursday quoted an 
unidentified justice department official who worked on both the 
noriega and banker cases as saying we have never been able to 
identify a noriega bank account outside of panama we would like to 
hope this account would be a breakthrough 
he said us investigators hope to obtain detailed records of 
the account by the end of the week after the necessary paperwork is 
completed 
records and sworn testimony presented earlier this year to 
senate investigators have shown that theres no doubt that bcci 
definitely handled noriega money the official told the times 
both noriegas and bccis alleged involvement in laundering drug 
proceeds were also described in other senate subcommittee testimony 
by leigh ritch and steven kalish two convicted tampabased 
smugglers who are alleged to have laundered at least 4 million 
through panamanian banks 
a week after his senate testimony awan and four of other bcci 
officials were arrested in tampa in a customs service sting 
operation they had been drawn to tampa in response to a faked 
wedding invitation sent by an undercover customs agent who had 
known them in the two years he posed as a money launderer

iran has told the united states it is not 
interested in dealing with unauthorized individuals over the 
release of american hostages a top diplomat said thursday 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy said the iranian 
message had been part of communications between the two countries 
conducted through switzerland and other countries that have 
diplomatic ties to iran 
the united states has not authorized any individuals to strike 
deals with iran over the release of the hostages held by 
proiranian militants in lebanon he said 
we have made sure through those same channels i referred to 
that the government of iran has received that same message and 
they realize our position and they affirm they are not interested 
in dealing with private citizens and unauthorized individuals 
murphy said in testimony before the house subcommittee on europe 
and the middle east 
murphy did not say when that communication took place 
former iranian president abolhassan banisadr said earlier this 
month that an emissary for vice president george bush had 
negotiated the release from lebanon of mithileshwar singh a us 
resident from india secretary of state george shultz last week 
denied that and other reports about negotiations with iran 
murphy said the united states has repeatedly made clear to iran 
that the continued detention of americans in lebanon would preclude 
any improvement in relations between the two countries 
there will be no deals made for their release he said 
they must be returned forthwith 
asked about reports that the hostages may be held by palestinian 
groups murphy said the united states did not have any evidence 
that the americans are in the hands of anyone but lebanese faithful 
of the hezbollah or party of god hezbollah is closely allied with 
iran 
in addition to the return of the nine american hostages murphy 
said the united states is seeking an end to terrorist activity 
sponsored by iran against targets abroad and an end to its 
intimidation of us allies in the persian gulf region 
murphy said iran already has adopted a softer tone towards 
regimes in the region as part of its attempt to lift its 
international isolation iran had launched both physical and verbal 
attacks against kuwait saudi arabia and other prowestern arab 
governments for their support of iraq and what it called their lax 
adherence to strict shiite moslem principles 
theyre not abandoning the revolution but theyre obviously 
less aggressive about exporting it and we welcome that murphy 
said 
iran has already complied with one us condition for 
improvement in relations by adopting a de facto ceasefire that 
ended its sevenyear war with iraq murphy said 
he said the recent changes in irans position are not a 
180degree turn but we hope theyre moving toward improved 
relations 
the united states is willing at any time to launch a direct 
dialogue he added but iran is not yet ready

the shroud of turin has been the focus of scientific and 
religious debate for centuries the mysterious object of christian 
veneration and even the subject of a shortlived broadway musical 
comedy 
what it wasnt roman catholic church officials conceded 
thursday was the burial cloth of jesus christ 
the history of the shroud of turin goes back only about 800 
years when a crusading knight said he saw it in constantinople it 
never has been traced to the holy land 
the catholic church never claimed it was jesus burial cloth 
and many critics have dismissed the linen cloth and its image as a 
clever forgery 
an early debunker was pierre darcis bishop of troyes in a 
1389 letter he told clement vii the papal claimant in avignon 
that the bishop who preceeded him in troyes knew who painted it 
the shroud bequeathed to the pope by exking umberto ii of 
italy upon his death in 1983 has been kept in the cathedral at 
turin since 1578 
through records the shroud can be traced to lirey in france in 
1354 in 1453 the royal family of savoy got the shroud and kept it 
at the castle of chambery where fire damaged it in 1532 
there are references to a burial cloth of christ as early as the 
5th or 6th centuries and coincidences have been found between the 
shroud and 7thcentury byzantine art and liturgy 
witnesses including william of tyre in 1171 and robert of clari 
of the fourth crusade in 1203 reported seeing the shroud in the 
imperial palace at constantinople the trail then is lost until the 
shroud appears in france 
the official church position has been that the shroud was a 
cherished object that must be given the respect due a relic 
wrapped in red silk under protective glass and an iron grill 
the shroud is kept on an altar in a silver chest that has only 
rarely been opened in the last century 
in an indication of the reverence accorded to the cloth an 
estimated 3 million people came to view it in 1978 when it was 
exhibited in turin on the 400th anniversary of its arrival it was 
the first time the shroud had been exhibited in 45 years 
perhaps the most significant occasion was in 1898 when a man 
named secundo pia was allowed to photograph it 
the result was sensational 
the image on the shroud is similar to a photographic negative 
so the negative on pias photographic plate gave the world its 
first positive image of the man on the shroud 
pias work confounded skeptics why would a medieval forger 
paint a negative image an image that produced a perfect positive 
visible only centuries later when photography was invented 
the mystery lived on compounded by the vaticans refusal for 
years to allow the shroud to be tested in 1986 pope john paul ii 
finally gave the goahead for testing but only on snippets of the 
cloth not on the image 
scientists continued to produce theories concerning the shroud 
in january 1982 alan whanger a duke university professor 
compared images of christ on a 6th century byzantine icon and a 7th 
century coin with those on the shroud and said there were 
astonishing similarities 
whanger theorized that the icon and the coin were copied from 
the facial imprint on the shroud more than 800 years before the 
cloth turned up in france in the 14th century 
in march 1982 an italian physician used the shroud to theorize 
that christ died of a heart attack on the cross and not of 
suffocation as previously believed 
dr luigi malantrucco said a large spot on the shroud was caused 
by blood and serum from profuse bleeding after christ was stabbed 
by a soldier as accounted in the gospel according to st john if 
christ had earlier died of suffocation then his blood would have 
coagulated malantrucco said 
the shroud even was the subject of a 1986 broadway musical 
titled into the light focusing on the relationship between a 
young boy and his father a research scientist investigating the 
cloth starring dean jones the show opened to mostly negative 
notices and closed after six performances and 14 previews

authorities banned street rallies 
thursday in the southern republic of montenegro and the police 
chief of that area resigned after police used clubs and tear gas to 
break up antigovernment protests 
in belgrade communist party leaders debated the legacy of late 
leader josip tito who has been blamed for forming a decentralized 
government unable to deal with the countrys worst economic crisis 
in four decades 
the weekend protests in montenegro were the latest in almost 
daily rallies driven by hundreds of thousands of serbs pressing for 
more control over serbias autonomous province of kosovo the 
provinces slav minority which is mainly christian allege 
harassment by the mainly moslem ethnic albanian majority 
communists in several regions of yugoslavia have stepped up 
security alerts for the police army and civilian defense units 
following last weekends events said sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the ban and the resignation of montenegros interior minister 
lazar djodjic were apparently moves to defuse three months of 
protests demonstrators also are protesting 217 percent inflation 
15 percent unemployment and wages of less than 100 a month 
the rallies backed by serbian communist party chief slobodan 
milosevic have angered communist leaders in other republics 
supporters of the ambitious serbian leader have referred to him as 
the second tito 
at the belgrade meeting of the ruling party politburo milosevic 
and federal party chief stipe suvar angrily clashed over a june 
statement by 19 intellectuals which blamed titos policies for the 
countrys present troubles 
suvar said the document was an assault on tito by serbian 
nationalists and said serbias communists had failed to criticize 
the document according to the staterun news agency tanjug 
milosevic said suvars comments were uncalled for since the 
serbian party was the first to denounce the intellectuals 
statement 
dusan ckrebic a prominent member of serbias leadership said 
suvars remarks were unacceptable because they represent serious 
accusations against serbias leaders 
the latest dispute forms the backdrop to a meeting monday of the 
communist partys policysetting central committee where several 
changes are expected in the leadership 
three senior communists yugoslavias vice president the head 
of its official trade unions and a deputy premier were named 
thursday as leaders likely to lose their seats on the 165member 
central committee 
the three were listed by a senior communist member of the 
central committee at a meeting in the northern republic of 
slovenia according to belgrade newspapers thursday the official 
was not identified 
the three include stane dolanc who was seen as no 2 to tito in 
the last years of titos undisputed 35year rule tito died in 1980 
serbian nationalists criticize dolanc 62 as not tough enough 
toward ethnic albanian nationalists during 1981 racial riots in 
kosovo dolanc was interior minister at the time 
serbia the largest of yugoslavias six republics is now 
pushing for more control over kosovo and vojvodina provinces 
the other two men named as likely to lose their seats were 
marjan orozen head of the national trade union organization and

east germany is likely to announce 
next week it will pay reparations to survivors of the nazi 
holocaust the head of the world jewish congress said thursday 
edgar m bronfman president of the new yorkbased jewish 
organization said he would meet with east german leader erich 
honecker on monday in east berlin to discuss the payments 
in principle what im going to be doing there is hopefully 
getting the east german government to agree that east germany too 
has some responsibility for what took place in germany during the 
second world war particularly the holocaust bro asked by the associated 
press if he expected the east germans 
would tell him during his visit that they have decided to make the 
reparations payments bronfman said yes i believe sonfman said 
 
a final decision on the payments to victims of nazi germany 
would mark a major change in the communist countrys policies 
since the end of world war ii east germany has argued it bore 
no responsibility for nazi atrocities because the nation was not 
founded until 1949 
west germany signed an agreement in 1952 with the world jewish 
congress to compensate holocaust victims and since then has paid 
out more than 48 billion to survivors and their families we east 
germany had been considering paying a up to 100 million to 
holocaust survivors and victims families 
for them now to take the proper moral position and say yes 
we will pay some reparations even if it is a token amount will 
be good news for the entire world bronfman said 
he said east german reparations to survivors of nazi atrocities 
would be an important step in reminding the world what happened 
during the holocaust 
our position is its not a question of just money but that 
the holocaust has to be taught not just to germans but to 
everyone bronfman said 
bronfman said he has resisted east german attempts to link 
reparations to trade agreements with the united states 
i know they are looking for trade agreements with the united 
states and i have said you cannot tie any payments youre going to 
make to the victims of the holocaust to any boons you might get 
from the us government bronfman said 
bronfman was in bonn for a conference of the eastwest forum 
which he heads the new yorkbased group consists of western 
intellectuals and politicians who meet to discuss developments in

with a champagne toast the united states and 
the soviet union signed a fiveyear agreement thursday which calls 
for cooperative research programs to combat aids drug abuse 
alcoholism and polio 
valentin pokrovsky president of the soviet academy of medical 
science and head of a fivemember soviet delegation expressed hope 
that the agreement will mark the beginning of a wonderful long 
road which we will travel together 
signing for the united states at a brief ceremony at the 
national academy of sciences was samuel o thier president of the 
us institute of medicine he said the talks leading up to the 
agreement were cordial and he predicted an extremely pleasant 
experience for both sides if the current atmosphere is maintained 
the initial plans call for several joint activities in 1989 
including a symposium in the united states on aids research and a 
meeting in the soviet union on the health effects of radiation 
at a news conference wednesday night pokrovsky said the last 
summit meeting between president reagan and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev and the general political atmosphere have 
contributed to closer cooperation he wore a lapel pin displaying 
the soviet and american flags 
pokrovsky said us experts are eager to draw on soviet 
expertise in the health effects of radiation based on the 
aftermath of the april 1986 accident at the chernobyl nuclear power 
plant 
at the same time he said the program will offer soviet experts 
an opportunity to learn how americans deal with aids a disease 
which has a far higher incidence in the united states than in the 
soviet union 
he said there has been only one soviet fatality since march 1987 
as a result of aids but 81 persons who are not yet sick have been 
diagnosed as carrying aids antibodies he acknowledged that the 
percentage of soviet citizens who have been tested for aids is 
relatively small 11 million 
there have been about 300 cases of nonsoviet citizens in the 
soviet union afflicted with aids primarily students from african 
countries where the disease is common 
the two sides agreed that in the areas of alcoholism and drug 
abuse the focus will be on transmission to offspring 
identification of populations at risk and ways to prevent and treat 
these problems 
as for polio the research will emphasize the application of 
molecular biology to the monitoring and application of the disease 
the two countries have existing cooperative programs in the 
health area and the new agreement is designed to complement them 
prior to the signing ceremony the soviet delegates visited 
research centers in washington dc baltimore new york

university of illinois students shaken by a 
series of rapes are taking steps to protect themselves and to 
fight the sexism many blame for the attacks student leaders and 
school officials say 
the attacks around the campus stopped when police identified a 
suspect but students are labeling sexism a factor a message 
underscored with a candlight march and rally wednesday night 
the message at the rally was that sexism is in our society and 
it is the cause of a lot of things that go wrong rape 
discrimination and women feeling low selfesteem jane brouwer 
president of the panhellenic council said thursday the council 
represents about 3500 sorority members on the 35000student 
campus and helped organize the demonstration 
a lot of people just dont think about sexism ms brouwer 
said 
about 500 students demonstrated wednesday carrying candles to 
draw attention to the role of sexism in the series of assaults that 
police attribute to a serial rapist 
we have a suspect champaign detective gerald schweighart 
said thursday he was identified just before the series of rapes 
stopped around sept 10 
police are awaiting results of tests on the suspects blood and 
have made no arrest schweighart said 
investigators believe about nine rapes have been committed by 
the same man since spring said schweighart 
the rally wednesday united groups as diverse as the panhellenic 
council the campus chapter of the naacp and a political coalition 
united progressives 
the aim was to stress the role of sexism in society from pinup 
calendars and pornography to references to women in casual 
conversation participants said 
we need a general respect of men and women for each other 
ms brouwer said if we are serious we can make a change 
jenny keller a senior at the school majoring in political 
science who identified herself as a victim of rape was one of the 
speakers at the rally 
were not asking for pity were demanding respect for 
the strength it takes to go through this experience said ms 
keller the vast majority of women are raped by friends 
relatives people who live in their dormitories 
petitions were circulated urging pay equity at the university 
more education on the problems of sexism and more emphasis on 
ensuring campus safety 
participants also condemned campus traditions such as panty 
raids 
jeff jochims president of the interfraternity council 
acknowledged the fraternity system has not done a lot to fight 
sexism 
we need to realize the greek system has always had a problem 
with sexism jochims said at the rally its ugly but its a 
reality 
he said members are working to change the image of 
fraternities 
mary ellen oshaughnessey assistant dean of students said 
thursday the demonstrators concerns are justified 
sexism is not just a campus problem she said it is a 
cultural issue 
ms oshaughnessey said her office has organized seminars on 
personal safety and supervised programs providing women with 
whistles to use in sounding the alarm if they feel threatened and 
van service to avert the need for women to walk home alone from 
class or work at night emergency telephones also have been placed 
around campus 
though not new oshaughnessey said the programs seem to be 
attracting more interest now she estimated the effort costs about 
33000 a year 
about 7000 whistles have been distributed this year about 
1000 women received van rides in a twoweek period this fall and 
about 150 people have participated in the safety seminars she said 
in addition jochims said fraternity members escort women on 
campus so they do not have to walk alone and are preparing a 
program to patrol areas where attacks have occurred

felix wankel inventor of the rotary 
engine has died at age 86 
wankel died on sunday said thomas burkhardt a close friend of 
the german inventor 
wankel began work on a rotary engine in 1926 and began producing 
the new motor at the west german nsu motor works in 1957 
through the years wankel also designed motors for the japanese 
auto companies mazda and toyota as well as engine superchargers 
the west german nsu spider was the first car to be massproduced 
with the wankel rotary engine that was in 1964 the nowdefunct 
nsu company also produced the ro 80 wankel rotary engine car which 
had a reputation for unreliability and was discontinued in 1977 
there was much interest in wankels rotary engine in the 1960s 
and early 1970s according to west german automobile industry 
figures in 1971 wankel was working with 24 different companies 
around the world on plans to further develop his engine 
but the first oil crisis of 197374 changed all that bringing a 
drastic loss of interest in investing in the automobile industry 
experts say 
mazda continued work on developing the wankel rotary engine and 
made the concept a successful one 
according to industry figures mazda has produced more than 15 
million cars with rotary engines including the popular rx7 sports 
car 
in 1976 wankel also developed a streamlined amphibious car he 
called zisch german for whoosh which was able to reach 62 
mph with its 300 horsepower engine 
wankels research offices are in lindau on the shores of lake 
constance in southern west germany 
wankels wife died in 1978 they had no children

police and army troops patrolled the 
streets of two southern cities thursday after the government 
enacted tough new gun laws to combat ethnic violence that left 
hundreds dead this month 
officials in karachi the countrys largest city and hyderabad 
100 miles to the northeast reported their districts were returning 
to normal following five days of bloody clashes earlier this month 
that left about 275 people dead 
the violence involved ethnic indians who comprise more than 40 
percent of the southern province of sind and seek recognition as a 
separate nationality and militant sindhis seeking independence for 
the province 
in islamabad the government wednesday announced new laws that 
provide prison sentences of up to 14 years for possession of 
machine guns other heavy weapons and their ammunition 
on the night of sept 30 sindhi militants sprayed the streets 
of hyderabad with gunfire massacring nearly 200 people mostly 
ethnic indians authorities said 
the violence touched off several days of retaliatory rioting in 
karachi killing 60 more people mostly indians 
police said many of the deaths were caused by heavy weapons that 
have surfaced in pakistan during the 10year war in neighboring 
afghanistan 
the new laws announced by the government provide for special 
courts and speedy trials for accused criminals and authorize 
provincial governments to use military force for public security 
it does not mean that martial law been imposed in sind 
province justice minister wasim sajjad told reporters in 
islamabad 
the measures can be extended to other parts of pakistan if 
similar incidents take place there he said

highranking west german officials say 
iran has indicated a readiness to slowly move toward improving 
relations with the united states and other western nations 
the signals are definately improving said a west german 
official who spoke to the associated press on condition he not be 
identified 
there are influential people in the tehran government who 
understand that isolation is no longer politically or economically 
viable they know it is in the countrys best interests to return 
to a broader world community the official said 
he described the iranian officials as pragmatists who clearly 
see the value of rapproachment 
west germany has long enjoyed good relations with iran and with 
iraq tehrans bitter foe in the persian gulf war the two 
countries are observing a ceasefire 
in recent months bonn officials have said they wanted to use 
those good relations in efforts to improve conditions in the middle 
east and to help broker more ties between iran and the united 
states 
unlike the united states and other countries which broke off or 
curtailed ties with iran after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini came to 
power in 1979 west germany has kept its relations active and has 
sought to expand ties during the past year 
west german officials in bonn said those efforts paid off in 
winning the release in september of west german hostage rudolf 
cordes held by proiranian shiite moslem kidnappers in lebanon 
after cordes release intensive talks continued with iran on 
the question of freedom for other hostages in lebanon the bonn 
source said 
he added that those west german initiatives may have also 
played a role in the release on oct 3 of mithileshwar sing an 
indian professor who holds permanent us residency status 
government sources in bonn said foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher was informed by tehran at least a day in advance of the 
release of hostage singh and immediately told secretary of state 
george shultz 
the fact that we were informed of this latest release in 
advance is also a sign of tehrans appreciation of west germanys 
efforts in the region one source told the ap 
genscher is scheduled to visit tehran in november and bonn 
sources said he would use the opportunity to deepen dialogue with 
iran on its relations with the west and to press for more help in 
winning the release of the remaining foreign hostages in lebanon 
we hope that all sides will use this opportunity to improve 
relations he said

delegates at the conservative partys 
conference thursday jeered prime minister margaret thatchers 
ousted predecessor edward heath when he attacked her opposition to 
closer union among european economic community nations 
others applauded heath when he hailed the scheduled dismantling 
in 1992 of all trade barriers within the eec as a major movement 
toward the unity of europe in every way 
mrs thatcher to whom the 4500 delegates sang happy 
birthday she turned 63 left the conference center to return 
to her hotel before the intervention by heath they have been on 
bad terms since she ousted him as party leader in 1975 after he 
lost two successive elections 
aides said she wanted to work on her keynote address to the 
final session of the fourday convention friday 
earlier treasury chief nigel lawson the chancellor of the 
exchequer promised more tax cuts when prudent and forecast a 
drop next year in inflation now 57 percent and rising 
but in his address to the convention in this south england 
resort he warned that interest rates now at 12 percent would 
remain high for quite a while 
heath prime minister when britain joined the eec in 1973 said 
the rest of the 12nation trade bloc would not tolerate britain 
treating the post1992 single market merely as a free trade 
area 
it is a major movement toward the unity of europe in every 
way said heath it also concerns a common currency with a 
common monetary system and a common bank 
several dozen delegates raised small replicas of the union jack 
and waved notices declaring no to ted 
in a policy speech last month in bruges belgium mrs thatcher 
rejected a common european currency bank or monetary system and 
said a united states of europe would never come about she 
criticized what she called the bureacracy at the eec headquarters 
in brussels 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe defended mrs thatchers 
rejection of what she regards as unrealistic talk of a united 
europe he said she was as much a european as french president 
francois mitterrand or west german chancellor helmut kohl leaders 
of the two other biggest financial contributors to the eec 
on eastwest relations howe said the west should not assume 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs desire for reform was 
shared throughout the soviet command structure 
the red army and the kgb still loom in force he said 
thats why the west must go on negotiating arms cuts from

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
suggested thursday that the institution of the presidential press 
conference is overrated as a means of communicating with the 
american people 
defending the infrequency with which president reagan has held 
fullscale primetime press conferences fitzwater said that no 
chief executive should be expected to fulfill a quota on such 
questionandanswer sessions 
fitzwater was responding during his daily news briefing to a 
harvard commissions report that said among other things that 
white house news conferences have fallen into a serious state of 
disarray under reagan 
the spokesman said the report wednesday by the panel of 
journalists and scholars did include several positive 
recommendations on how to improve the conduct of these sessions 
the commission said for instance that press conferences should be 
held mostly in the daytime 
but it also criticized reagan for holding too few press 
conferences saying his successor should take his lumps on a more 
frequent basis 
the longer presidents go without a press conference the 
greater the suspicion that there is something to hide and the 
greater the pressure becomes for holding press conferences the 
16member harvard commission on the presidential news conference 
said 
reagan pledged to hold news conferences once a month but has 
held only 45 in more than 7 years in office and once let 5 months 
pass without one the last such session came at the end of the 
sevennation economic summit in toronto last june 
the report said that reagan although successful in the short 
run in dodging difficult questions suffers from the perception 
that he is not really in charge of his own white house 
it recommended that presidents meet with the media twice a month 
during daytime hours and limit televised evening news conferences 
to six a year 
asked to respond to these and other criticisms fitzwater said 
i dont think any president in good conscience would ever 
commit to a specific number of formal press conferences 
what im trying to say is that there is a diversity of 
ways to communicate with the general public besides a press 
conference he added weve held the press conferences that we 
think are appropriate weve held other kinds of press interviews 
that we think are useful and in the final analysis you can be the 
judge 
asked what criteria are used to decide when the president holds 
a news conference fitzwater said the guiding factor is whats in 
the public interest and ways to communicate with the american 
public 
the spokesman acknowledged that the white house intentionally 
kept reagan at a distance from the media during the height of the 
irancontra affair but he said that was because officials didnt 
want to say anything that might prejudice investigations into the 
matter 
we had no intention of holding press conferences and having 
the president comment on ongoing investigations fitzwater said 
he said reagan will likely have another news conference before 
the end of the year but not before election day on nov 8

the house on thursday refused to consider an 
educational grant bill that republicans attacked as porkbarrel 
legislation because its price tag had grown from 750000 to 60 
million 
the proposal making its second trip to the house floor didnt 
even reach the debate stage because lawmakers voted 256131 to 
reject the rule that had to be approved before debate could begin 
the opposition was led by rep robert walker rpa who pointed 
out that the measure was far different and much costlier than the 
version that had been approved by the house earlier in the session 
the original bill merely authorized the department of education 
to provide 750000 to the taft institute which uses public and 
private money to provide summer programs for high school civics 
studies teachers 
by the time the senate and housesenate conferees had completed 
their work the package had swollen by nearly 60 million with 
grant authorizations targeted to some 16 schools and educational 
programs

china will freeze or impose ceilings on the 
prices of a wide range of goods to curb rising inflation the 
official xinhua news agency reported thursday 
it was the first government indication that it will actually 
roll back price reforms rather than merely halting them as 
previously announced 
the situation in the last month shows that the prices of some 
commodities have not yet been reined in xinhua quoted cheng 
zhiping director of the state administration of commodity prices 
as saying 
he said the government will establish national price ceilings 
for important means of production and freeze the prices of 
daily necessities that previously were decontrolled xinhua did 
not list the affected items 
price ceilings will be set for grain now sold on the free 
market and the prices of chemical fertilizer pesticides and other 
agricultural inputs will be regulated xinhua quoted cheng as 
saying 
cheng spoke two weeks after the ruling communist party ordered a 
twoyear effort to control inflation officially estimated at about 
20 percent but believed to be higher the party called for steps to 
end hoarding profiteering and loose credit that have fueled 
inflation and for a cutback in industrial growth that has strained 
the countrys weak infrastructure 
premier li peng on tuesday ordered the state council chinas 
cabinet to put the new austerity policy into effect 
nobody can shirk responsiblity and the problems cannot be left 
unsettled xinhua quoted him as saying he said soaring prices 
are affecting social security and peoples confidence in 
reform and that a period of stability is needed 
a series of xinhua reports thursday indicated the government 
envisions a widescale retrenchment in its decadeold process of 
reducing central controls over the economy 
one report quoted commerce minister hu ping as saying the retail 
price of major commodities will be standardized many commodities 
deemed essential such as soap currently float within locally set 
ranges while hundreds of other light industrial items are 
completely decontrolled 
hu also was quoted as saying the government will seek to 
stablize the prices of nonstaple foods most of which now sell on 
the free market at prices set by local supply and demand again 
xinhua gave no specific list of goods affected or the level at 
which prices would be held 
xinhua also gave no date for enacting the measures announced by 
cheng and hu 
economists generally believe that decontrol of prices so they 
can reflect supply and demand is essential to chinas effort to 
replace cumbersome central planning with a more flexible 
marketstyle economy however chinas price reform has been 
piecemeal resulting in a hodgepodge of controlled 
semicontrolled and decontrolled prices 
some goods are sold both by the state at artifically low prices 
and on the free market at much higher prices resulting in growing 
profiteering li and other top officials recently said this mix of 
prices will remain for a long time 
liu hongru deputy governor of the peoples bank of china the 
central bank meanwhile reported a drop in the money supply since 
late september and slowdown in new loan issues xinhua quoted liu 
as saying both developments indicated that government moves to 
tighten loose credit were taking effect

the nations merchandise trade deficit surged 
to 1218 billion in august as a record flood of imported products 
swamped a continued boom in exports the government reported 
thursday 
the commerce department said the august imbalance was 27 
billion higher than the july figure which had been the lowest 
monthly deficit in 3 years 
while the august figure was slightly worse than expected 
financial markets took the news in stride unlike a year ago when a 
disappointing trade report set off a chain of events culminating in 
the oct 19 stock market collapse 
the dollar tumbled briefly in hectic foreign exchange trading 
but then steadied the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
gained 712 points to close at 213336 
the market reaction was in sharp contrast to a year ago when 
the august trade report sent the dow plunging by 95 points setting 
the stage for the record 508point drop five days later on black 
monday 
analysts said the market got the bad news out of the way early 
this time falling by more than 30 points on wednesday on fears 
that the report would show a higher trade deficit 
the reagan administration which has been fending off attacks on 
its trade record by democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen moved quickly to play down 
the significance of the widening in the august deficit 
commerce secretary c william verity noted that the trade 
deficit for the first eight months of the year is running at an 
annual rate of 1385 billion a 19 percent improvement from the 
record deficit of 1703 billion run up in 1987 
i have been saying for some time now that we can hope for an 
improvement of about 30 billion in the trade deficit this year 
the figures for the first eight months show that we are right on 
target verity said 
however bentsen said the steep rise in the august deficit was 
another example of failed republican economic policies 
while imports flood america gop nominees george bush and 
dan quayle sit back and let the damage accumulate telling 
americans dont worry be happy 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said the august 
deficit was new evidence that the nations trade problems are far 
from being solved 
the longawaited light at the end of the tunnel has turned out 
to be an onrushing freight train loaded with imported goods said 
byrd this congress passed a comprehensive trade bill what 
we need is an administration that will enforce it 
in august both exports and imports climbed to record levels 
exports were up 103 billion to 2755 billion as america sold 
more cars business capital goods and farm products to foreigners 
the boom in export sales has lifted the fortunes of american 
manufacturing companies and is credited as the principal reason the 
country is enjoying betterthanexpected overall economic growth 
but imports rose even faster than exports in august surging by 
373 billion to an alltime high of 3972 billion 
private economists viewed the big jump in imports with concern 
they said it is unrealistic to expect further big increases in 
export levels which are up 29 percent so far this year from a year 
ago 
they said that for the trade deficit to shrink from the current 
level imports which are up 10 percent so far this year will have 
to begin to shrink 
the process of trade adjustment is slowing down said bruce 
steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch we made stellar 
gains in the first half of the year but we are going to make very 
little further progress for the rest of the year 
steinberg predicted that the trade deficit for this year would 
shrink by about 40 billion but that the decline in 1989 would be a 
much more modest 10 billion 
other analysts noted that foreign shipments of various types of 
consumer goods such as clothing shoes and electronics began 
rising in august as retailers faced with depleted inventories 
began placing new orders 
when you cut through all the monthtomonth fluctuations you 
are still left with a very large trade deficit said lawrence 
chimerine president of the wefa group an economic forecasting 
firm 
chimerine predicted that the dollar will have to fall further 
boosting prices of imported goods even more as a way of reducing 
american demand 
the import rise included a 11 billion increase in consumer 
goods and a similar advance in business capital goods reflecting 
higher demand for computers and electrical machinery 
car imports rose by 700 million in august while oil imports 
were up by 300 million to 37 billion as a jump in volume offset 
a drop in the price per barrel to 1515 
the 103 billion rise in us exports was attributed mainly to 
an increase of 800 million in sales of american cars and parts and 
a 200 million rise in the sales of farm goods 
as usual the largest single deficit was incurred with japan an 
imbalance of 48 billion up from a july deficit of 44 billion 
the united states recorded deficits of 17 billion with taiwan and 
14 billion with western europe

the house on thursday postponed until next 
week a vote on legislation that would establish disclosure 
requirements for banks department stores and other firms that 
offer credit cards 
the senatepassed measure requires that information to be 
provided in directmail solicitations include annual fees the 
interest rate charged for unpaid balances the method for 
calculating that balance and the length of grace periods during 
which no interest is charged similarly late fees overthelimit 
fees and fees for cash advances must be disclosed 
currently only a handful of states have laws requiring public 
disclosure of such information before consumers apply for the cards 
under an agreement the leadership gave to members no vote was 
to be taken in the house after 1 pm on thursday the bill got to 
the floor shortly before 2 pm and was discussed by house members 
a vote on the creditcard disclosure measure will be taken when 
the house returns from its weekend recess on tuesday 
rep fernand j st germain dri chairman of the house 
banking committee and the bills floor manager called the measure 
one of the most important and strongest credit disclosure acts 
that we have been able to move through the congress since the first 
truthinlending statute was passed 20 years ago 
he said the proposed law ends the hideandseek approach to 
disclosures on credit card terms it prevents sneak attacks on 
unsuspecting consumers who often learn of charges and fees long 
after the fact too late to reject the card and seek 
alternatives 
st germain said more than 100 million consumers have one or more 
credit cards with outstanding balances approaching 150 billion he 
also said credit card companies solicit nearly 25 billion 
consumers a year 
rep charles e schumer dny a chief house sponsor said 
millions of card users are not aware that there are tremendous 
differences between the costs of the credit cards available this 
should put an end to the unjustifiable rates of 18 19 or 20 
percent some card issuers are now able to charge 
the measure has been endorsed by a wide range of consumer groups 
but it has its opponents too 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the consumer 
subcommittee called the measure a bad bill disguised as a 
consumer protection bill it is fitting that we are taking up the 
bill in the month of halloween because this bill indeed wears a 
mask and unlike halloween where you at least get the option of 
trick or treat this bill offers only trick or trick 
among other things annunzio opposes the measure because it 
would prohibit states from enacting stricter standards and puts no 
limit on the amount of interest on outstanding balances that card 
issuers may charge 
let me suggest that what americans want in their credit cards 
is not more disclosure but lower interest rates on their 
charges he said there is nothing in this legislation that 
will cause credit interests to fall

a majority of adults believe schools should 
teach sex education and the federal government should put more 
money into development of new birth control methods according to a 
poll released thursday by planned parenthood federation of america 
the poll said 82 percent of the respondents favor government 
spending on research and development of new and improved birth 
control methods while 16 percent of those polled do not 
in addition 59 percent of those interviewed said they thought 
the europeandeveloped birth control pill ru 486 which can 
terminate a pregnancy in its first few weeks should be made 
available in this country thirtythree percent disagreed 
humphrey taylor president of louis harris said the poll also 
found that abortion is becoming a less controversial issue 
in 1979 38 percent said abortion was a decisive issue in 
choosing a candidate for elective office that number dropped in 
1982 to 28 percent and in 1988 to 18 percent of the 18 percent 9 
percent said they could not vote for a prochoice candidate and 9 
percent said they could not vote for an antiabortion candidate 
so one clear finding is that a lot of the heat is going out of 
the abortion issue and that political candidates in 1988 need not 
worry as much as they have in the past about losing votes on it 
one way or the other taylor said 
results of the poll conducted by louis harris and associates 
were released at the start of planned parenthoods annual meeting 
in st louis the findings were based on telephone interviews 
conducted in may with 1250 randomly selected adults nationwide 
the polls margin of error was 3 percent 
anne saunier planned parenthoods chairwoman said that of the 
6 million pregnancies in the united states each year half are 
unintended of the unintended pregnancies half end in abortion 
she said 
more than 1 million teenagers become pregnant each year and 
more than 80 percent of those pregnancies are unintended she said 
obviously something is wrong saunier said the federal 
government spends approximately 9 million on contraceptive 
research each year less than is spent every 15 minutes for 
defense in this country 
saunier said 95 percent of americans think teenage pregnancy is 
a serious problem up 11 percent since a 1985 planned 
parenthoodharris survey sixtytwo percent think the problem is 
getting worse 
at the same time support for sex education in schools has grown 
4 percent since 1985 this years study found that 89 percent of 
those polled think sex education should be provided by schools and 
10 percent do not 
americans also think school health clinics should be allowed to 
refer sexually active students to outside family planning clinics 
saunier said according to the poll 80 percent favor establishing 
links between schools and family planning clinics while 18 percent 
oppose the idea she said 
the research found that 73 percent of those interviewed 
supported making birth control information and contraceptives 
available in school health clinics while 25 percent opposed it

evelyn vega a single mother and former 
welfare recipient considers herself living proof of the gains she 
believes other women can make under the welfare bill signed by 
president reagan on thursday 
three years ago ms vega 28 of stamford conn was on 
welfare and could not read or write much less hold a job 
now she manages a fastfood store has her own car and hopes to 
send her three daughters to college 
other welfare recipients can do the same she said shortly after 
attending the white house rose garden ceremony where reagan signed 
the measure that will offer welfare recipients education training 
and work programs 
im a happy person now that im working and im not on 
welfare said ms vega now that the government did all this 
it could be a chance to help a lot of women like me 
ms vega whose parents separated when she was young said she 
largely raised herself after running away from home at age 10 she 
and an older sister traveled from puerto rico to several us 
states and ms vega became pregnant for the first time at age 15 
three years ago when all of her daughters were old enough to 
attend school ms vega went to her welfare caseworker and said she 
wanted to get off public assistance 
i was so lonely i was so scared she said i didnt want 
to sit there with my girls going to school and me doing nothing 
ms vega got a tutor page oristano from the literacy 
volunteers of america who began to teach her reading writing and 
basic skills such as how to look up a number in the telephone book 
eventually another agency agreed to help her find an entrylevel 
job in a fastfood store and the manager there decided to help her 
train for a management job 
she passed the management test a month ago with 98 of 100 
possible points several months earlier ms vega received her last 
welfare check 
im a single woman and im just taking care of my girls and 
im happy ms vega said sometimes i feel like im drowning 
but its ok 
she reads at the third or fourthgrade level and is more 
proficient with material which is job related she has a good 
chance of finishing high school ms oristano said 
ms vegas goal is to send her daughters to college and 
eventually attend college herself 
ms vega said she is convinced other welfare mothers can get off 
public assistance 
theyve got to say im going to do it im going to stick 
with it and im not going to go back she said 
the family support act signed by reagan thursday provides money 
to states and requires them to offer education and job training to 
women with children age 3 and over and to put new pressure on 
noncustodial parents to pay child support 
the incentive to get off welfare has to come from the person 
because the programs are there ms vega said 
she and ms oristano attended the billsigning ceremony under 
the auspices of the united way which supports many of the programs 
that aided her

a usfunded airlift started carrying 
food and medical supplies on thursday to thousands of starving 
people in wartorn southern sudan sudanese and united nations 
officials said 
a un official said the airlift aimed to send 12 planes daily 
to transport supplies to the towns of mairam kadugli muglad and 
abyei food was reported to have run out in abyei last wednesday 
government and un officials implied that southern rebels 
promised airlift organizers not to shoot down the planes 
washington says the guerrillas in the past attacked civilian planes 
and truck convoys and interfered with the international red cross 
in its effort to work out relief programs 
the airlift began after prime minister sadek elmahdi met in 
khartoum with us ambassador g norman anderson and walter 
bollinger an official of the us agency for international 
development aid 
the agreement broke a deadlock between foreign aid donors and 
the government which had resisted delivery of food supplies into 
rebel areas 
the situation in abyei is very bad its now the rainy season 
and the airport is only a strip of sand and stones we dont give a 
time limit but we would like to carry out the relief operation as 
quickly as possible the un official speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press 
abyeis normal population of 10000 shot up to 40000 as people 
in rural areas fled the fierce fighting to the towns relative 
safety abyei will be virtually isolated for the next two months 
because of the rainy season 
an ap reporter saw a government report covering the last few 
months which indicates that dozens of people in abyei have been 
dying each week 
ibrahim mohamed osman secretarygeneral of the sudanese red 
crescent said townspeople and refugees in abyei ate the last of 
their food on wednesday and that about 700 metric tons of sorghum 
oil and cereal had to be sent there 
the red crescent is sudans equivalent of the red cross 
the southern rebellion began five years ago with the mainly 
christian and animist rebels demanding autonomy and administrative 
and economic reforms from the moslemdominated government in the 
north 
the official sudan news agency said most flights are going to 
abyei 500 miles southwest of khartoum and that supplies destined 
for the other towns will be transshipped from there 
it is the first major foreign civilian relief effort in two 
years since operation rainbow a problemplagued un program that 
finally got off the ground in october 1986 
a major stumbling block to relief efforts then was a threat from 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army to shoot down relief 
planes claiming the government would use them for military 
purposes 
more than 70 people died when rebel gunners shot down two planes 
at that time 
asked if organizers of the latest airlift had contacted the 
liberation army about safe conduct for the flights the un 
official said wed rather not comment on the issue 
when reminded of a liberation army threat made three weeks ago 
to shoot any plane flying in the south the un official said 
that was another time now it is something else 
osman said planes that took off thursday carried medicine 
health experts and highnutrition biscuits to people who might 
soon starve if food doesnt reach them in the next few days people 
are suffering from hunger and famine is eminent 
he said the only hospital in abyei was deserted last april and 
basic medical care was nil 
organizers have not disclosed the duration of the operation or 
how much food and medication are being flown south paid for by aid 
according to a cable from the us ambassador in khartoum on the 
relief plan however 90 tons of food will be flown initially into 
abyei with more to follow the plan calls for 1500 metric tons of 
food to be trucked from kadugli west to muglad and babanusa the 
associated press obtained a copy of the cable 
the un official said that in addition to the sudanese 
government and the aid organization the operation involves unicef 
the un childrens fund the world food program the un 
development program the red crescent and private agencies 
the operation began a week after sudanese and un officials 
toured abyei a sudanese official with the delegation speaking on 
condition of anonymity said there was a tacit agreement to avoid 
publicizing the operation 
the rebels claim to control 90 percent of the southern 
countryside fighting has forced more than 820000 southerners to 
flee to army protection in southern towns northern cities and even 
into neighboring ethiopia

former us ambassador arthur hartman on 
thursday called the soviet union a failed society and said it 
may grant some independence to its baltic republics to perk up the 
countrys economy and to satisfy national aspirations 
however hartman said the steps toward more local control in 
lithuania latvia and esthonia could turn moscow back on the road 
to a more authoritarian regime if the baltics tried to escape from 
the soviet system 
eventually this could be a cataclysmic event he said 
hartman who left his post in moscow in 1985 was recently in 
the soviet union he said it remains pretty much a deadhand 
operation despite moves by president mikhail s gorbachev to 
consolidate his political power 
it is a failed society and a failed system of central control 
and central planning hartman said at a seminar sponsored by the 
johns hopkins school of advanced international studies 
he said gorbachev was determined to improve the economic 
situation throughout the country by loosening moscows control over 
the various republics and their communist parties 
i think there has been a decision that the way to handle the 
baltics and the way to get the baltics to be a kind of economic 
locomotive for the country which is what it could be is to give 
them a kind of national freedom the exambassador said 
hartman said the people in the three republics could set the 
pace for economic reform because they have a memory of how to do 
things in a way the russians dont 
as a result he said the soviets are proceeding in a more or 
less autonomous direction for the baltics 
and yet hartman said moscow cannot allow the baltics to get 
away from the soviet system 
i think something can happen which will set the soviets back 
on the road to a much more authoritarian kind of regime he said 
on human rights hartman denounced as crazy congressional 
attempt to withhold economic benefits unless the soviets improve 
their human rights record 
the people who are talking about linkage want to stop any 
development in the relationship between the superpowers he said 
if they tried it in stalinist times i could understand it but 
he said that under gorbachev the soviets were stepping up jewish 
emigration because they want a better relationship with the west

the republican presidential campaign 
has pulled out heavy artillery in the form of retired us air 
force gen chuck yeager to warn texans that liberal democrats 
will take away jobs from the states defense industry 
in a television advertisement airing this week in texas yeager 
warns that the 300000 texas jobs related to the defense industry 
could be jeopardized by democrats who advocate cuts in defense 
spending 
but yeager the first man to break the sound barrier has worked 
for the past six years as a consultant to northrop corp of 
california a competitor of general dynamics corp the fort worth 
division of general dynamics is one of the largest defense 
employers in the state with 27000 workers 
republican national committee spokesman kathryn murray said she 
wasnt aware that yeager was a consultant to northrop but that it 
was irrelevant 
the point of the ad is that general yeager has firsthand 
knowledge of what it takes to have a strong defense and he believes 
the policies of the republicans are more in sync with making that 
happen she said he speaks from the heart about the defense of 
the nation

israel ended yearlong celebrations of its 
40th year thursday with a dramatic concert at the windswept 
foothills of masada where jewish zealots committed mass suicide 
rather than surrender to the romans 
their refusal to yield became a symbol and legacy of courage 
for the state of israel in its revival president chaim herzog 
said in a speech before the concert our presence here tonight 
and the beginning of our fifth decade of our independence is proof 
of our promise that masada will not fall again 
the festivities were marred by the 10month palestinian uprising 
in the occupied lands which led to a 13 percent drop in tourism 
the damage from the point of view of image has also been 
enormous said micha gidron deputy directorgeneral of israels 
tourism ministry 
he said it was hoped the concert would revitalize tourism and 
return peoples confidence in visiting israel 
yosef yadin son of the late archaeologist yigal yadin who 
excavated masada opened the ceremonies reading from the final 
speech of eleazar ben yair commander of the 1000 jewish warriors 
and their families who stood off 15000 romans for nearly two years 
facing certain defeat eleazar called on the survivors to commit 
mass suicide and destroy the fortress at masada except for its 
food store 
it will testify when we are dead that we did not perish 
through want but because in keeping with our intitial resolution 
we chose death to slavery eleazar is said to have told his 
followers 
zubin mehta conducted the 120member israel philharmonic 
orchestra and a choir of 170 in peforming gustav mahlers second 
symphony known as the resurrection 
mehta said the music was chosen to symbolize the suffering and 
rebirth of the jewish people the first movement begins with a 
funeral dirge and moves to a dramatic conclusion symbolizing the 
day of judgment 
the men first cut the throats of their wives and children then 
10 men were chosen by lot to kill the other men more lots were 
drawn and one man killed his nine companions and then threw 
himself on the sword 
the ancient monument which overlooks the dead sea is a major 
tourist and pilgrimage site symbolizing jewish commitment to the 
land of israel in recent years israeli military officers have 
been sworn in at ceremonies conducted atop the 1300foothigh 
monument 
israel had hoped the celebrations which began after the start 
of the jewish new year in september 1987 would bring 16 million 
tourists earnings were projected at 350 million more than in 
1987 when 15 million tourists brought in 15 billion 
instead gidron said only about 13 million tourists are 
expected by years end 
about 4000 israelis including prime minister yitzhak shamir 
and his political rival foreign minister shimon peres attended 
the concert in the judean desert hills 95 miles southeast of 
jerusalem 
the price of tickets ranged from 150 to 960 
security was tight with cars banned from the site and shuttle 
buses taking people to the staging area 
the celebration included a sound and light show fireworks 
synchronized to music and a procession of 400 torchcarrying 
israeli youths who climbed to the top of the monument 
french entertainer yves montand and american actor gregory peck 
were hosts for the program which included a reading of roman

a navy admiral has ordered a court martial for 
a female lieutenant who has refused to provide a urine sample for a 
drug test under the direct observation of another woman 
rear adm james d cossey the chief of naval technical 
training ordered the special court martial on thursday for lt 
elizabeth susan unger accusing her of one count of willfully 
disobeying a lawful order said lt brian cullin a navy spokesman 
the court martial is to be conducted at the great lakes naval 
training center ill where lt unger is assigned on a date not 
determined as yet added cullin 
the maximum punishment if convicted is six months 
confinement and forfeiture of twothirds pay for six months 
a special court martial differs from a general court martial in 
that the presiding officer cannot order a bad conduct discharge a 
conviction at special court martial however would still likely 
lead to a general or administrative discharge for a navy officer 
unger has told navy officials she supports drug testing and is 
willing to submit a urine sample but refuses to do so if she must 
be observed in the process 
i told my commanding officer that i cant be observed she 
told the washington post in an interview last month 
i think its demeaning and degrading i said i think its 
wrong he said that we make certain sacrifices we give up certain 
privileges in the navy 
a civilian attorney retained by unger gary r myers has argued 
the navys urinalysis policy should be changed because a woman 
officer has to disrobe a male officer does not 
a woman officer has to face that observer eyeball to eyeball 
a man does not 
myers also argues that forcing officers to disrobe in front of 
enlisted personnel flies in the face of the militarys strict 
policies against fraternization between the two

rounding up gifts for a english princess 
proved challenging to members of this southeastern nebraska 
community but it was nothing compared with trying to give them to 
her 
the gage county visitors committee threw a baby shower for 
princess beatrice the daughter born aug 8 to prince andrew and 
sarah the duchess of york because the community and the princess 
share the same name 
the sept 1 shower yielded crocheted bibs booties and blankets 
hightopped tennis shoes a key to the city of 13000 and a college 
scholarship 
the gift package weighing about 50 pounds was bound up and 
sent off by united parcel service to london buckingham palace 
returned it said diane schwenke president of the beatrice chamber 
of commerce because its palace policy not to accept gifts 
working through diplomatic channels ms schwenke decided to 
send the gifts to the hospital for sick children in london where 
the gifts were donated in princess beatrices name 
a flurry of correspondence from ms schwenke to buckingham 
palace to explain the detoured gifts and the communitys intentions 
got derailed by a british mail strike 
once the strike was over however it didnt take long to get 
the response from the palace ms schwenke said thursday a note

mickey mouse showed up in a cornfield 
here to harvest his ears 
the pitzenberger family father dick and brothers ted rick and 
joe worked together to plant cultivate and harvest a 238acre 
cornfield in the shape of mickey mouses famous profile 
disney officials who came up with the idea used it as a 
promotion for the mouses 60th birthday they settled on a field in 
northern iowa because it lies beneath the routes of dozens of daily 
crosscountry airline flights 
after planting and cultivating the field last spring the job of 
picking the mickey mouse field started three weeks ago disney 
officials came back to iowa last week with mickey to help harvest 
the crop 
the mouse tried his hand at harvesting 
we had a little more fun with him ted pitzenberger said 
thursday he showed up to run the combine for a couple of rows 
the effort proved to more than just a promotional stunt for 
disney officials from seven towns near the field picked up on the 
idea as a way to show how smalltown iowa is trying to recover from 
the 1980s farm recession 
now that were picking mickey there are mickey mouse corn 
kernels in jars and mickey mouse ears of corn going around the 
area so its staying with us

researchers who studied ancient chinese 
chronicles of solar eclipses found that a day is now seven 
hundredths of a second longer than it was nearly 4000 years ago 
because the earth is spinning more slowly 
the length of a day just keeps getting longer and longer 
said kevin pang who conducted the study as an astronomer at the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
just as a spinning ice skater slows down by extending her arms 
earths rotation on its axis slows as tidal interactions make the 
moon orbit earth more quickly and become more distant from it he 
said wednesday 
four billion years ago the moon was only onethird as far 
away as it is now and the day was only eight hours long at the 
time said pang whose study will be published soon in the 
british journal vistas in astronomy 
pang and his coauthors determined that compared to today the 
length of a day was 22 hundredths of a second shorter in ad 532 
42 hundredths of a second shorter in 899 bc and seven 
hundredths of a second shorter in 1876 bc 
other studies have shown earths rotation varies slightly over 
time because the oceans and atmosphere produce drag on the planets 
topography and because molten rock within the earth sloshes 
against solid rock to produce a similar drag 
knowing how earths rotation rate changes helps you understand 
things like the interaction between the ocean solid earth and 
atmosphere and tells you something about the interior of the 
earth pang said 
while ancient chinese annals report thousands of eclipses the 
researchers limited themselves to those that occurred at sunrise or 
sunset allowing them to compute the time of the eclipses 
knowing the times along with the fact the eclipses were visible 
from china the scientists were able to calculate how much earths 
rotation has slowed since the dates the eclipses occurred 
for example had the day always been 24 hours long the 899 bc 
eclipse would have been seen in the middle east instead of china 
pang explained 
pangs calculations of the rate at which earths rotation is 
slowing are consistent with previous studies but extend further 
back in time the oldest arabian and babylonian records of solar 
eclipses date to about 700 bc 
pangs findings on the 899 bc eclipse first were reported in 
early 1987 in that study he and his colleagues studied ancient 
chinese chronicles called the bamboo annals which mentioned a 
time when the day dawned twice 
by performing a computer simulation of the history of the 
earths rotation around the sun they determined the phrase meant 
that the moon eclipsed the sun just after dawn on april 21 899 
bc that let them figure out the earths rotation rate at the time 
in the new nasafunded study they were able to compute the time 
of the 532 and the 1876 bc eclipses 
some people incorrectly assume earths gravity pulls the moon 
closer to earth but that is not the case pang said

prosecutors argued thursday that a countys 
problems do not excuse two people from taking hostages at a 
newspaper but the defense said eddie hatcher and timothy jacobs 
saw no alternative 
conceding an argument that there are serious problems in 
robeson county that need to be addressed that does not excuse the 
action taken here said assistant us attorney john bruce 
were not saying that because there were problems in the past 
in robeson county that this was a violent protest countered 
defense lawyer lewis pitts one of jacobs attorneys thats what 
the government would like you to think but it ignores the real and 
immediate threat to timothy jacobs and eddie hatcher 
the arguments were held before a federal jury began its 
deliberations in the case at 350 pm after more than an hour of 
instructions from us district judge terrence boyle 
after about 45 minutes of deliberations jurors asked for and 
received definitions for knowingly willfully and 
maliciously they deliberated until 5 pm and were to resume 
friday 
hatcher 30 and jacobs 20 both tuscarora indians from 
pembroke face charges of making and possessing illegal firearms 
conspiring to make those weapons and making a bomb threat a 
federal charge of hostagetaking was dismissed earlier this week 
against jacobs but remains against hatcher 
the defendants have argued that their lives were in jeopardy 
because of information they had linking law enforcement officers to 
drug trafficking in robeson county they claimed they had to take 
hostages at the robesonian newspaper in lumberton to publicize 
their case and save their lives 
the two held as many as 20 people during their 10hour siege on 
feb 1 no one was injured 
the judge rejected a request by defense attorneys wednesday to 
discuss selfdefense in his instructions to the jury which will 
follow closing arguments 
can you imagine 60000 frightened abandoned people crying 
out hatcher appealed to the jury in a closing statement partly 
written by his attorney william kunstler from 150 miles away 
theyre crying out some are faint theyre tired theyre wore 
out please dont abandon me and timmy 
kunstler could not appear at the trial because he is tied up in 
a new york case 
mr bruce talked about the constitution this morning and how 
it allows peaceful protest hatcher said when those sworn to 
uphold the constitution wont what do you do 
hatchers voice cracked and began to quaver bringing sobs from 
his supporters in the courtroom and tears to jacobs and his defense 
attorneys who were seated opposite the jury 
but bruce said if everything in this whole scenario they have 
spun out is true it still does not justify their putting innocent 
people in terror of their lives 
pitts said taking hostages was a drastic action he was not 
trying to minimize but that the intentions of hatcher and jacobs 
were critical to the case 
if you put aside the fear and impact on the individuals at 
the newspaper what it comes down to is if they had a guilty mind 
or evil intent he said

a bipartisan group of nearly 60 senators urged 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar on thursday to 
launch an international crusade to prevent the use and spread of 
outlawed chemical weapons 
in a meeting in new york with sen nancy kassebaum rkan the 
secretary general was given a letter signed by 59 senators urging a 
coordinated response by the international community against 
chemical weaponry 
over the past decade we have seen both the spread and use of 
chemical weapons gain increasing momentum stated the letter a 
copy of which was released by kassebaums office in washington 
this is a problem of international dimension it is critical 
that we move as a body of nations to rebuild the barrier to 
chemical weapons use and reassert the principle that chemical 
warfare is unacceptable the senators said 
a copy of the letter which was written by kassebaum and sens 
william cohen rmaine bill bradley dnj and joseph biden 
ddel also was sent to president reagan 
the lawmakers endorsed reagans recent call for an international 
conference to determine how to enforce a 1925 protocol that bans 
chemical weapons in international conflicts reagan in his 
farewell speech to the un general assembly last month condemned 
the use of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war 
in addition the senators suggested a broadening of controls on 
exports of materials and technologies that can be used in the 
manufacture of chemical weapons a number of western nations have 
an informal set of export controls but the lawmakers said those 
can only be effective if the soviet union eastern bloc nations and 
emerging industrialized countries join in the effort to prevent the 
spread of chemical weapons 
finally the senators recommended the united nations adopt a 
policy of international sanctions against any country that uses the 
banned weapons and called for a system that makes it easier for 
un teams to investigate cases of suspected use 
we strongly believe that unless the international community 
moves swiftly perhaps the most serious threat we face is that the 
main lesson from the iraniraq war will be that chemical 
weapons do work and states that use them can get away with it

one day after taking office 
premier ladislav adamec on thursday demanded economic reform under 
a strong central government and warned his ministers their jobs 
depended on concrete results 
president gustav husak swore in adamec and his cabinet wednesday 
evening in a reshuffle that added 10 new faces to the 20member 
government 
it was the biggest shakeup in 20 years and saw the departure of 
lubomir strougal who led the government for more than 18 years 
and foreign minister bohuslav chnoupek 
adamec told his cabinet at its first meeting that the central 
committee which sets policy for the ruling communist party 
strongly criticized strougals government for the present state of 
the economy 
it sharply criticized a number of branches of the economy 
for which we bear responsibility adamec said according to the 
official news agency ctk 
a number of suggestions were made on how to improve the 
activity of the governments and ministries 
he indicated the government was under pressure from the party to 
achieve concrete results that would be felt by a population 
accustomed to adequate supplies of consumer goods and services 
czechoslovakia has not faced the economic stagnation and 
declining living standards that plague communist neighbors poland 
and hungary but economic growth has slowed and much of its 
production processes are outdated 
it is our duty to respond to all suggestions and demands as 
soon as possible by energetic efforts to provide a remedy for 
the shortcomings in the criticized branches ctk quoted adamec as 
saying 
he emphasized the role of the government as the state economic 
center 
adamec cautioned that changes would not come overnight he also 
said the government would be judged not by the extent of 
personnel changes but by the results achieved 
he warned against ignoring growing discontent among the 
population and said the government could not be indifferent to poor 
quality production or short supplies of goods and medicines 
his emphasis on the need to keep consumers well supplied 
indicated that the prague leadership hopes to achieve economic 
reform without making political concessions as the leaderships in 
warsaw and budapest have done

a baltimore astronomer and historian says hes 
found longsuppressed evidence that shows explorer robert e peary 
was not the first man to reach the north pole but had stopped 121 
miles short of his goal 
dennis rawlins a 51yearold researcher fascinated by the peary 
expedition said thursday he had deciphered pearys detailed 
navigational notes from a document that indicates he and his 
dogsled were off course 
rawlins believes peary felt pressured to declare his 1909 polar 
expedition a success but privately instructed his wife to treat 
this the document as your most precious possession and never let 
it out of your hands except to silence an archrival who had 
falsely claimed to have beaten peary to the north pole 
he had the task of hoaxing the world while under the harshest 
spotlight all the while accusing his archrival explorer frederick 
a cook of faking the very same attainment the amazing thing is 
he had the guts and the intelligence to pull it off rawlins said 
there had to have been a core of integrity to him or he 
wouldnt have kept this record he said 
officials of the national geographic society which backed 
pearys expedition said they would examine the document but the 
society said in a statement we believe mr rawlins has been too 
quick to cry fake 
last month national geographic magazine published an article by 
another writer acknowledging peary might have been 30 to 60 
nautical miles from his destination 
rawlins claimed isaiah bowman the director of the new 
yorkbased american geographical society the professional society 
of geographers had seen pearys secret papers in 1935 at the peary 
family home in eagle island maine after pearys daughter became 
concerned about published attacks on her fathers trip 
rawlins who is publishing his findings in his own journal dio 
said he stumbled upon the evidence on sept 3 1987 while 
reviewing the papers of bowman a peary admirer and the former 
president of johns hopkins university from 1935 to his death in 
1950 
after having them verified by an astronomer bowman suppressed 
the papers as well telling eminent geographers of the day the 
papers backed pearys claim to have reached the pole rawlins said 
despite the alleged coverup rawlins said peary remains the 
greatest us explorer having discovered the northernmost point of 
land in the world cape jesup in northern greenland after 
surviving an obstacleladen route 
rawlins said pearys secret document reveals he was somewhat 
short and a good distance to the right of the north pole 
in 1973 rawlins published a book peary at the north pole 
fact or fiction providing evidence against pearys claim

the senate on thursday voted to allow capital 
punishment for drugrelated killings as lawmakers lurched past 
procedural snarls and finally began debating a 26 billion drug 
bill 
the capital punishment language retained in the legislation on 
a 6425 vote was just one of many provisions in the 600page 
campaignseason measure that would strengthen the governments 
arsenal against drug offenders 
the lawmakers easily defeated two other efforts to weaken the 
death penalty language and then adopted by an 880 vote a 
provision that would allow fines of up to 10000 against people 
who possess even small amounts of illegal drugs 
the failed effort by liberals to strip the death penalty 
language from the bill was a major step toward extending federal 
capital punishment statutes because there is similar language in 
the harsher housepassed version of the legislation congressional 
leaders want to send the drug legislation to president reagan 
before adjourning for the year in the next few days 
the death penalty is necessary and long overdue as a weapon in 
the incredible butchery that is taking place on americas 
streets said sen alfonse damato rny 
liberals from both parties however derided capital punishment 
as an ineffective vestige of less enlightened times 
the desire for vengeance for eyeforaneye justice is a 
principle and a mentality unworthy of civilized government and of 
this body said sen mark hatfield rore 
the bill would allow capital punishment for drug traffickers who 
kill civilians or law enforcement officers hatfields amendment 
which was defeated 6425 would have removed the death penalty from 
the bill and replaced it with mandatory life imprisonment without 
possibility of parole 
consideration of the legislation was delayed for days while 
lawmakers squabbled over more than 100 amendments they wanted to 
attach added pressure was being placed on legislators by the 
calendar since 33 senate seats and all 435 house seats are being 
contested in the nov 8 elections and lawmakers are eager to 
campaign fulltime at home 
by thursday afternoon legislative leaders seemed to have pared 
the list of amendments down to around 60 and were ready to fold 
some of them into the bill and debate others separately 
two of the most contentious proposals advanced by 
conservatives seemed to have been resolved in closeddoor 
negotiations 
an effort to restrict the right of convicted criminals to appeal 
their sentences on procedural grounds was toned down with an 
agreement that congress would reconsider the question next year 
after a supreme courtappointed commission issues a report 
another provision was altered that would have allowed courts to 
use evidence seized by police with no warrants instead the 
amendment would codify a 1984 supreme court ruling that evidence 
seized in good faith by officers could be used even if their 
warrant was defective 
many other amendments awaited action including language 
strengthening federal laws against child pornography requiring 
warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers mandating random 
drug testing for firsttime drivers license applicants and 
allowing the loss of many federal benefits for repeat drug 
offenders 
overall the legislation would devote 60 percent of its 
resources toward treatment and prevention programs and 40 percent 
toward law enforcement efforts 
it would provide 676 million for federal agencies to hire 3287 
new law enforcement officers purchase new equipment and build 
additional prisons another 275 million would be made available to 
state and local authorities 
an additional 1 billion would be provided for treatment and 
prevention allowing programs to handle an additional 600000 drug 
abusers annually over five years money would be distributed 
locally to train health professionals to improve existing or build 
new treatment centers and to train teachers involved in drugabuse 
education 
federal penalties for repeat drug offenders and for narcotics 
crimes involving children or firearms would be increased a 
cabinetlevel federal drug czar would be created federal 
contracts would be prohibited with businesses that could not 
maintain a drugfree workplace and public housing projects would 
be permitted to evict tenants who are drug offenders 
but there was a question where the money would come from 
lawmakers said 14 billion of the measures money would be spent 
over the next 12 months without a new source of revenue which 
they so far have refused to provide they said they only knew 
where about 450 million of that amount would come from 
lawmakers and aides however said thursday that there was a 
chance legislators would pass a supplemental spending bill 
providing extra money and adding to the deficit next week or 
when the 101st congress commences in january 
reagan favors the tougher house bill which was passed sept 22 
it contains some provisions imposing tough penalties that are 
missing in the senate bill 
housesenate negotiators will have to agree to a compromise bill 
before it can be sent to the white house for reagans signature

the soviet union named as new 
ambassador to kabul its first deputy foreign minister yuli 
vorontsov an afghan foreign ministry spokesman said thursday 
the appointment of such a highlevel official appeared designed 
to emphasize the importance the soviet union continues to place on 
afghanistan despite withdrawing its troops western diplomats said 
it puts a guy with a great deal of clout here to show how much 
they support the place one diplomat said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the afghan foreign ministry spokesman when asked why moscow had 
chosen someone of such high rank said it meant afghanistan was an 
important country under briefing rules the spokesman is not 
identified 
the spokesman also denied claims made in neighboring pakistan 
that the moslem guerrillas battling afghan government troops shot 
down five afghan air force planes and helicopters last week 
pakistan is headquarters for the ussupported guerrillas 
vorontsov will replace nicholai igorytchev a member of the 
soviet communist partys central committee whose departure 
appeared quite abrupt 
igorytchevs farewell reception took place at midday today 
barely 24 hours after the invitations were received at other 
diplomatic missions in kabul such invitations are usually sent out 
about two weeks in advance 
the appointment of a new soviet ambassador comes at a time when 
both moscow and the sovietstyle government in kabul have been 
stepping up diplomatic pressure to end the civil war 
under an accord signed in geneva on april 14 the soviet union 
is to complete the pullout of its troops from afghanistan by next 
feb 15 the withdrawal started may 15 and is now at the halfway 
point with an estimated 50000 to 60000 soviet soldiers remaining 
soviet forces intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 
meanwhile in peshawar pakistan seven afghan army defectors 
criticized the afghan military thursday as weak and incapable of 
surviving without soviet support 
the seven surrendered to moslem guerrillas earlier this month 
during a siege of the northeastern garrison town of asmar in the 
border province of kunar asmar is now in the hands of the moslem 
guerrillas called mujahedeen 
heavy fighting in the kunar valley in recent weeks has routed 
afghan army troops from several heavily fortified garrisons on 
monday the provincial capital of asadabad fell to the rebels 
noor ahmad nasrat corps commander of the 9th division of the 
afghan army said the majority of the military support the 
mujahedeen but because of pressure cant come over to them 
nasrat the highest ranking defector and selfappointed 
spokesman said antipersonnel mines surround government garrisons 
to keep the government soldiers from leaving

retirement according to the du pont co which operates the 
nuclear complex 
du pont spokesman jim felder said there was no connection 
between the departure of srp general manager john t granaghan 59

the government thursday lost its long and costly 
battle to block british newspapers from publishing extracts from 
spycatcher the memoirs of former intelligence agent peter 
wright 
hours later british broadcasting corp tv altered its schedule 
to air an april interview with wright in which he said part of his 
book was unreliable 
he was refering to a passage dealing with an alleged plot inside 
britains mi5 counterintelligence agency to force the resignation 
of labor party prime minister harold wilson in the 1970s 
conservative party spokesman michael mates said wrights comment 
made nonsense of media claims of the publics right to know 
the public doesnt have a right or need to know about fanciful 
ideas which somebody chooses to put in a book and call it 
revelations of wrongdoing 
newspapers saw the ruling by the law lords britains highest 
court as a triumph for press freedom while the government claimed 
a moral victory because the five judges unanimously accused wright 
of violating the oath of secrecy he took as an intelligence officer 
he was guilty of treachery as heinous as that of the spies he 
excoriates in his book said lord keith one of the judges 
but the judges said any possible damage to britains national 
security had already been caused by the books publication 
elsewhere and they lifted temporary injunctions against the 
guardian the observer and the sunday times of london 
it is absolutely terrific peter preston editor of the 
guardian said after the ruling this has gone on for 2 years 
and been heard by 23 judges it is smashing to win hands down at 
the end 
andrew neil editor of the sunday times said we won but 
its a battle we should never have had to fight 
the book has sold 14 million copies overseas after being 
published in 40 countries including the united states 
spycatcher alleges that mi5 eavesdropped on foreign 
embassies bungled operations stole documents plotted to 
assassinate egyptian president gamal abdel nasser and plotted to 
destabilize the labor party government in the 1970s 
wright also claims the late mi5 chief sir roger hollis was a 
soviet agent a claim the government says has never been 
substantiated by investigators 
on the bbc broadcast thursday night wright indicated the 
alleged wilson plot was not as advanced as the book suggested and 
that the manner of forcing the resignation was not exactly as 
published 
asked if that part of the book was perhaps an exaggeration of 
what you recall now wright answered i would say it was 
unreliable 
asked if it would be fair to conclude from that that the plot 
if thats what it was was not as advanced as the book 
suggests wright responded i think that is true 
he indicated his ghostwriter paul greengrass might have 
misunderstood him but when the bbc showed him proofs he had edited 
without changing the statements in question he said 
i think basically i never thought there would be a fuss about 
it i didnt see why there would be a fuss about it because it had 
been stopped 
the bbc said wright who was 72 at the time of the interview and 
had suffered a stroke appeared a bit confused over details 
after the ruling publishers william heinemann said they would 
give the government two weeks notice that they plan to print 
200000 paperback copies in britain 
but early editions of fridays daily telegraph quoted heinemann 
spokeswoman helen fraser as saying that after studying the decision 
with company lawyers we do not think this would be possible 
home secretary douglas hurd said the ruling vindicated the 
governments threeyear international battle to block 
spycatcher and uphold the duty of confidentiality which bars 
intelligence agents from writing books and memoirs about their work 
wright 73 retired to australia in 1976 to raise thoroughbred 
horses following a 20year career with mi5 
lord brightman said wright had flagrantly breached his 
secrecy oath and lord jauncey said his action reeked of 
turpitude 
wright could not be reached for comment thursday his lawyer 
malcolm turnbull welcomed the decision but said the judges 
comments about wrights conduct lacked objectivity and were 
inappropriate 
wright has said nothing in his book could jeopardize national 
security but lord griffiths said it wasnt for wright to decide 
what may appear to the writer to be trivial may in fact be the 
one missing piece in the jigsaw sought by some hostile intelligence 
agency he wrote 
donald trelford editor of the observer estimated the 
government would have to pay 35 million in legal fees the 
government puts the bill at 1 million 
the government first moved against the book in september 1985 
when it obtained a temporary injunction preventing publication in 
australia 
that case was resolved only in june when australias highest 
court unanimously ruled against britain while accepting that 
wright was bound by secrecy the judges said australian courts had 
no jurisdiction to enforce british security regulations 
the hong kong court of appeal upheld the british governments 
case but the new zealand high court rejected it 
last year the government said individuals could bring copies of 
spycatcher into britain and heinemann estimates 50000 
hardbacks and 70000 paperbacks arrived that way mostly from the 
united states and ireland

the senate passed emergency legislation 
thurday ordering the federal aviation administration to resolve an 
air traffic control crisis at chicagos ohare international 
airport 
the resolution approved without objection instructed the federal 
agency to report to congress by oct 25 on its plans to reduce 
pressure on controllers and alleviate flight delays at the nations 
busiest airport 
the faa said it already has 80 recommendations to improve 
operations at ohare including a pay increase for tower staff as 
an incentive to attract and keep experienced controllers at the 
facility 
david carle an aide to sen paul simon dill said the 
federal office of personnel management approved the 20 percent pay 
incentive on wednesday however opm said thursday that the 
proposal remains under review 
action is expected by opm within days on the bonuses which most 
likely would apply to hardtostaff control towers in new york los 
angeles and atlanta as well as chicago transportation secretary 
james burnley said late thursday 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn added that no decision has been 
reached yet on the percentage bonus to be offered to the 
controllers 
the faa said ohare controllers have had 30 flighthandling 
errors so far this year compared with 12 mistakes during all of 
1987 and far surpassing the previous record of 22 errors in 1986 
i find that record appalling said sen alan dixon dill 
one of the measures sponsors it is simply indefensible 
dixon said the fult lies with the faa for its failure to ease 
the workload on controllers handling flights to and from ohare and 
other chicagoarea facilities including midway airport and meigs 
field 
responding to the increase in mistakes the faa imposed 
restrictions oct 4 limiting the number of takeoffs and landings at 
ohare during peak periods instead of improving conditions 
lawmakers said the limitation has caused more than 100 flight 
delays at the airport each day 
dixon joined simon and sen nancy kassebaum rkan in 
introducing the resolution which orders the faa to propose both 
immediate and longterm solutions to the problem of controller 
errors at ohare 
although congress will not be in session simon said 
subcommittee members would review the report and expect the agency 
to implement any measures not requiring a vote in the house or 
senate 
we know what the problems are at ohare the faa knows what 
the problems are simon said i have assured faa i will work 
with my colleague in instances where congressional action may 
be needed 
the resolution also instructs the faa to establish a timetable 
for increasing the number of journeyman controllers at ohare 
agency standards call for 72 fullperformancelevel controllers at 
the ohare tower and simon said only 32 are fully qualified now 
the resolution would not have the force of law but simon said a 
meeting tuesday with faa officials left him confident the agency 
would comply 
this is a problem that has been smouldering for years and it 
wont be completely solved overnight he said but we now seem 
to have faas attention and their willingness to cooperate 
meanwhile the faa announced several steps thursday aimed at 
increasing the radar and control tower staffs at ohare 
the agency said it is turning over training responsibilities to 
an outside contractor freeing five fully qualified controllers to 
handle traffic it also said that nine fullperformance controllers 
who once worked at ohare have agreed to return to duty there 
within the next 30 days 
in addition the faa said two additional controller positions 
will be created by midjanuary to help handle incoming aircraft at 
ohare

a federal judge issued arrest 
warrants thursday for four soldiers implicated in the september 
massacre of 10 peasants his assistant said 
judge rafael pena signed the warrants at the request of the 
attorney generals office said the assistant jorge lozano 
carlos lazo of the attorney generals human rights department 
said the judge had been asked to issue the warrants for four 
soldiers of the jiboa battalion alleged to have been involved in 
the sept 21 massacre 
according to residents of san francisco 30 miles east of san 
salvador battalion soliders used grenades and gunfire to kill 
seven men and three women from the village who were suspected of 
collaborating with leftist guerrillas 
the army at first said the 10 dead were part of a guerrilla 
column ambushed by troops after testimony of relatives and 
neighbors became public the military changed its version to say 
eight peasants were killed in an ambush by guerrillas and troops 
killed two of the ambushers 
lazo said that according to villagers up to eight soldiers were 
involved in the slayings while more arrest warrants could be 
requested lazo said no officer had been implicated to date 
we have asked the judge to order the arrest of four people 
all soldiers in the jiboa battalion lazo said sufficient 
evidence exists to justify their detention the testimony of the 
relatives the neighbors 
the jiboa battalion is part of the 5th infantry brigade based in 
nearby san vicente brigade commander col jesus chavez caceres on 
thursday sent pena a list of soldiers who chavez said were 
operating in san francisco on sept 21 
chavezs list which lozano showed reporters in the judges 
office in san sebastian had the names of 33 men only one of the 
four names appearing on the arrest warrants hernan ayala was on 
the list which did not identify the soldiers ranks san sebastian 
is 21 miles east of san salvador 
lozano said pena would ask chavez for an expanded list to 
include ranks he said the arrest warrants would be delivered to 
chavez 
attempts to contact chavez at 5th brigade headquarters were 
unsuccessful 
in comments broadcast wednesday by local television chavez 
insisted the peasants died in a guerrilla ambush 
nine of the 10 bodies were exhumed last week roberto maldonado 
a courtappointed forensic doctor told journalists seven of the 
nine bodies had powder burns indicating they had been shot from a 
distance of about six inches 
the slayings represented the first massacre of such magnitude 
attributed to government forces in four years human rights groups 
also have expressed concern over a rise in killings by rightwing 
death squads 
a recent report by americas watch a new yorkbased private 
organization that monitors human rights noted two weeks ago that 
no salvadoran officer or death squad member has been prosecuted and 
punished for a human rights violation 
the us state department through the embassy has put 
considerable pressure on government and military authorities to 
investigate the slayings and prosecute those responsible 
diplomatic sources say 
the 9year civil war pitting leftist guerrillas against 
government forces has killed an estimated 65000 people most of 
them civilians

here is the text of thursdays presidential 
debate between republican vice president george bush and democrat 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts 
q good evening on behalf of the commission on presidential 
debates i am pleased to welcome you to the second presidential 
debate i am bernard shaw of cnn cable news network my colleagues 
on the panel are anne compton of abc news margaret warner of 
newsweek magazine and andrea mitchell of nbc news the candidates 
are vice president george bush the republican nominee and 
governor michael dukakis the democratic nominee 
for the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates 
following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the 
two campaigns however there are no restrictions on the questions 
that my colleagues and i can ask this evening and the candidates 
have no prior knowledge of our questions by agreement between the 
candidates the first question goes to governor dukakis you have 
two minutes to respond governor if kitty dukakis were raped and 
murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the 
killer 
dukakis no i dont bernard and i think you know that ive 
opposed the death penalty during all of my life i dont see any 
evidence that its a deterrent and i think there are better and 
more effective ways to deal with violent crime weve done so in my 
own state and its one of the reasons why we have had the biggest 
drop in crime of any industrial state in america why we have the 
lowest murder rate of any industrial state in america 
but we have work to do in this nation we have work to do to 
fight a real war and not a phony war against drugs and thats 
something that i want to lead something we havent had over the 
course of the past many years even though the vice president has 
been at least allegedly in charge of that war we have much to do 
to step up that war to double the number of drug enforcement 
agents to fight both here and abroad to work with our neighbors 
in this hemisphere and i want to call a hemispheric summit just as 
soon after the 20th of january as possible to fight that war 
but we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at 
home and thats one of the things that i hope i can lead 
personally as the president of the united states weve had great 
success in my own state and weve reached out to young people and 
their families and been able to help them by beginning drug 
education and prevention in the early elementary grades 
so we can fight this war and we can win this war and we can do 
so in a way that marshals our forces that provides real support 
for state and local law enforcement officers who have not been 
getting that kind of support do it in a way which will bring down 
violence in this nation will help our youngsters to stay away from 
drugs will stop this avalanche of drugs thats pouring into the 
country and will make it possible for our kids and our families to 
grow up in safe and secure and decent neighborhoods 
q mr vice president your oneminute rebuttal 
bush well a lot of what this campaign is about it seems to 
me bernie is to a question of values and here i do have on 
this particular question a big difference with my opponent 
you see i do believe that some crimes are so heinous so 
brutal so outrageous and id say particularly those that result 
in the death of a police officer those real brutal crimes i do 
believe in the death penalty and i think it is a deterrent and i 
believe we need it and im glad that the congress moved on this 
drug bill and it finally called for that related to these 
narcotics drug kingpins and so we just have an honest difference 
of opinion i support it and he doesnt

a scientist involved in research based on 
nazi experiments that deliberately froze to death concentration 
camp prisoners has resigned from the university of minnesota 
dr robert pozos said thursday that he plans to continue the 
hypothermia studies at his new post at the university of 
washington he said his resignation was not prompted by the 
criticism surrounding the research 
im just changing where im doing my research the work will 
continue said pozos 45 director of the hypothermia research 
laboratory at the university of minnesota duluth 
pozos whose resignation takes effect oct 25 said he will 
become vice president of minority affairs at the university of 
washington he also will teach as a professor of physiology and 
biophysics at the washington school of medicine in seattle 
seattle is a very nice part of the world to live in but 
im going to regret leaving northeastern minnesota said pozos 
whos been at the university of minnesota for 18 years 
earlier this year pozos sparked debate over how science should 
approach data obtained during the holocaust he said he planned to 
use nazi studies of world war ii concentration camp prisoners 
imprisoned at dachau 
the plan was criticized by some scientists and jewish leaders 
but some medical ethicists contend the study of nazi research could 
save lives 
pozos and dr arthur caplan a university of minnesota medical 
ethicist plan to address a conference in minneapolis next may on 
the ethical questions raised by using the nazi studies pozos said 
caplan and i are using what happened in nazi germany more so 
as a model to discuss and to show what can happen with a society 
when it feels that it needs to get data to protect itself pozos 
said 
were not saying its good or bad this is what happened he 
added 
earlier this year pozos said he plans to analyze and republish 
a littleknown world war ii text the treatment of shock from 
prolonged exposure to cold 
the study conducted by doctors at dachau includes observations 
and physiological measurements of human subjects placed in vats of 
freezing liquid often to the point of death according to those 
familiar with the study 
you had some of the worlds experts doing research in these 
areas pozos said it doesnt make them correct in terms of 
ethics 
pozos will continue to consult the university of minnesota 
duluth on research projects he helped start those projects came 
from 1 million in grants from government and corporate sources

become the 41st president of the united states what have you to 
say about that possibility 
bush id have confidence in him and i made a good selection 
and ive never seen such a pounding an unfair pounding on a young 
senator in my entire life and ive never seen a presidential 
campaign where the presidential nominee runs against my vice 
presidential nominee never seen one before you know lloyd 
bentsen jumped on dan quayle when dan quayle said hes had roughly 
the same amount of experience he had two terms in the congress he 
had two terms in the senate serving his second term 
he founded the authored the job training partnership act that 
says to american working men and women that are thrown out of work 
for no fault of their own that theyre going to have jobs were 
moving into a new competitive age and we need that kind of thing

the first national security decision that we had to make 
the vice president talks about national security three times 
since world war ii the vice president has had to suddenly become

the use of furloughs for prisoners in the 
united states is widespread successful and marred by few problems 
according to an independent journal for corrections professionals 
the issue of furloughs for prisoners serving life sentences has 
been debated in the presidential campaign with charges by vice 
president george bush that massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
state program was the most liberal in the nation 
but marj marlette editor of corrections compendium said a 
survey done for the journal didnt support bushs claim 
our survey didnt indicate that the massachusetts program was 
that much different from those in the twothirds of the state 
corrections systems which allow furloughs for lifers she said 
the survey was done by contact center inc a lincolnbased 
nonprofit information referral service for criminal justice and 
human services it showed showed that all states the federal 
bureau of prisons and the district of columbia have some form of 
furlough or temporary release program 
thirtysix states the federal system and that in the district 
of columbia allow furloughs for lifers in 1987 at least two states 
allowed prisoners sentenced to life without parole to become 
eligible for furlough the survey said 
bush has cited the case of willie horton jr a convicted 
murderer who brutally slashed a maryland man and twice raped his 
fiancee last year after escaping in 1986 while on a massachusetts 
furlough 
massachusetts no longer allows furloughs for prisoners convicted 
of first degree murder and serving life without parole 
in 1987 massachusetts granted 5857 furloughs and all but 
three were completed without incident under the terms of the 
furloughs according to information provided for the survey the 
three unsuccessful furloughs involved rule violations such as being 
involved in alcohol or drugs she said 
last year massachusetts granted furloughs to 1373 lifers and 
all of them were completed successfully according to the survey 
twentytwo states reported no problems or few problems with the 
program eleven states reported that some furloughs were 
unsuccessful because inmates committed of another crime while on 
furlough 
most often those were escapes but we dont have a breakdown 
on how many of those involved lifers escaping in each state as i 
said before the problems were mostly with late returns drugs or 
alcohol or some other rule violations none involved violent 
crimes she said 
an estimated 200000 furloughs were granted in 1987 with more 
than 53000 inmates involved nearly half of the prison systems 
reported that their furloughs were 98 percent successful 
mississippi nevada north dakota south dakota wisconsin and 
washington reported 100 percent success all but three states 
hawaii oregon and north carolina had success rates over 90 
percent marlette said 
virtually every system considered furloughs helpful in 
preparing inmates for release and improving institutional morale 
she said 
according to responses from all us prison systems the federal 
system and the district of columbia furloughs were most often 
granted to help inmates maintain family ties look for work and 
housing prior to parole and for general reintegration in the 
community 
they also were given for medical care shopping recreation and 
religious or treatment programs 
the lengths of the furloughs ranged from four to 12 hours 
during daylight hours in florida to up to 210 days in oregon 
most were for shorter periods although we didnt run an average 
time marlette said

two smiling and ostensibly upbeat candidates 
george bush and michael dukakis shook hands amiably thursday night 
to begin their second and final debate of the presidential campaign 
both men had been coached by advisers to project a personable 
and humane image and acknowledged with a wave and a pointed finger 
the audience as applause greeted their arrival at uclas pauley 
pavilion 
but their expressions quickly turned serious at the first 
question to dukakis about whether he would favor the death penalty 
for the killer if his wife kitty were raped and murdered 
both men punctuated their answers with expansive gestures 
dukakis seeming to use less of the familiar closedfist 
thumbjabbing movement that has become his trademark 
dukakis looked directly into the camera but bush contrary to 
advice given him by former sen john tower of texas to do the same 
in order to establish a connection with the tv viewing audience 
instead faced mostly the panelists or his opponent while answering 
dukakis appeared eager to counter his image as a somber 
nonhumorous candidate smiling as he said i think the 
presidency of the united states is a very serious office but 
adding that he wants to be liked and would handle the job with as 
much good humor as i can 
bush also smiled often and looked bemused when asked a question 
about the possibility of his runningmate dan quayle becoming 
president should bush be elected and die before inauguration day 
but bush then gave a serious answer reiterating his confidence in 
the indiana senator 
the debate stage telegenic blue backdrop red carpeting and oak 
lecterns installed in the pavilion were the ones the two candidates 
used at their first debate in winstonsalem nc last month 
the props were trucked to los angeles from omaha neb where 
they also had been put to use for last weeks debate between vice 
presidential rivals dan quayle and lloyd bentsen 
the lectern bush stood behind was set at 48 inches while the 
one for the halffoot shorter dukakis was at 45 inches 
in the carpeting around dukakis lectern was a circular cut from 
where it was altered to insert a subtle threeinch riser the 
massachusetts governor used in winstonsalem 
dukakis wore a dark grey suit with a red tie and bush wore a 
dark blue suit with a red white and blue striped tie 
the audience was restrained having been lectured severely 
against outbursts and applause but did reward each candidate with 
those responses on occasion 
the welldressed audience was dotted with california elected 
officials and some members of the hollywood community including 
actress sally field 
bush said wednesday he wanted to show voters what my heartbeat 
is what i really care about 
it took work at ucla to create a setting that might foster those 
kinds of personal self revelations 
the venue at ucla was vastly different from the cozy wake forest 
university chapel where they met in north carolina

moderator anne compton for the vice president 
q thank you bernie mr vice president yes we read your 
lips no new taxes but despite that same pledge from 
president reagan after income tax rates were cut in each of the 
last five years some federal taxes have gone up on social 
security cigarettes liquor even longdistance telephone calls 
now thats money straight out of peoples wallets isnt the phrase 
no new taxes misleading the voters 
bush no because thats that im pledged to that and yes 
some taxes have gone up and the main point is taxes have been cut 
and yet income is up to the federal government by 25 percent in the 
last three years and so what i want to do is keep this expansion 
going i dont want to kill it off by at tax increase 
more americans at work today than at any time in the history of 
this country and a greater percentage of the work force and the 
way you kill expansions is to raise taxes and i dont want to do 
that and i wont do that and what i have proposed is something 
much better and its going to take discipline of the executive 
branch its going to take discipline of the congressional branch 
and that is what i call a flexible freeze that allows growth 
about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the 
congress just to add on spending 
i hear this talk about a blank check the american people are 
pretty smart they know who writes out the checks and they know 
who appropriates the money it is the united states congress and by 
two to one congress is blamed for these deficits and the answer 
is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional 
branch by holding the line on taxes 
so i am pledged to do that and those pessimists who say it 
cant be done im sorry i just have a fundamental disagreement 
with them 
moderator gov dukakis your 1 minute response 
dukakis anne the vice president made that pledge hes broken 
it three times in the past year already so it isnt worth the 
paper its printed on and what im concerned about is that if we 
continue with the policies that mr bush is talking about here this 
evening flexible freeze somebody described it the other day 
as a kind of economic slurpee 
he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system 
around he says hes not going to raise taxes though he has broken 
that pledge repeatedly he says he wants to give the wealthiest 1 
percent in this country a five year 40 billion tax break and 
were going to pay for it and hes been proposing all kinds of 
programs for new spending costing billions 
now if we continue with these policies this trillion and a 
half dollars worth of new debt thats already been added on the 
backs of the american taxpayers is going to increase even more if 
we continue with this for another four years then im worried 
about the next generation whether we can ever turn this situation 
around 
no we need a chief executive whos prepared to lead who wont 
blame the congress but will lead will bring down that deficit 
will make tough choices on spending will go out and do the job 
that we expect of him and do with with the congress of the united 
states

the african national congress 
on thursday blamed security forces for an arson attack on a roman 
catholic church building in pretoria 
the outlawed anc said in a statement sent by telex from zambia 
that limpet mines and hand grenades found at the offices of the 
southern african bishops conference damaged in wednesdays fire 
came from the stocks of the police or army 
police said investigators were trying to determine the origin of 
the arms 
it does not matter from which quarter such callous deeds stem 
i want to give the assurance that the south african police will 
fight arson terrorism and violence with all the means available to 
it minister of law and order adriaan vlok said thursday night 
police said two mines two grenades and five ammunition 
magazines for sovietmade ak47 rifles were found after the 
predawn fire 
jude pieterse a spokesman for the bishops blamed the arsonists 
for planting the weapons 
there is no doubt that the objects of destruction were 
left in the building by the same persons who entered to destroy 
it pieterse said 
he said police investigators did not ask any questions about the 
explosives when speaking to church officials and workers 
we believe the reason for this omission is that the policemen 
assumed the explosives had been left by the saboteurs 
pieterse said 
no one was injured in the fire four people including a nun 
were rescued from a balcony where they were trapped by flames 
police said a minibus with false license plates was seen outside 
the building shortly before the fire started 
it was the second attack in six weeks on offices of an 
antiapartheid church organization a bomb wrecked the headquarters 
of the south african council of churches in johannesburg on aug 31 
the anc said the attacks on church groups reaffirm the immoral 
and criminal nature of the apartheid regime which falsely claims 
to be christian 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
elsewhere three black men were injured when a limpet mine 
exploded outside a post office in nigel about 30 miles southeast 
of johannesburg police said damage was minor police added 
police headquarters said six policemen were wounded by gunfire 
late wednesday in kathlehong a black township east of johannesburg 
the officers were hospitalized but were not seriously hurt 
police said 
no arrests were made police said cartridges found at the scene 
indicated the attackers used ak47 rifles a standard weapon for 
anc guerrillas

an actors life is not easy but it certainly 
can be funny as tom mardirosian demonstrates in saved from 
obscurity his semiautobiographical play that opened thursday at 
offbroadways playwrights horizons 
mardirosian is a genial balding nondescript man one of those 
talented journeyman actors no one quite remembers when the house 
lights come up audiences occasionally see them in plays both on 
and offbroadway in television soap operas and if they dont 
blink in major motion pictures make no mistake theyll remember 
mardirosian after this 
he has put together a winning and ultimately joyous theatrical 
resume that celebrates his particular life in the theater for 90 
minutes the actor talks about his career and what lured a fat 
greekarmenian kid from buffalo ny to the stage 
was it his thwarted debut as the sheriff of nottingham in the 
fourth grade when his mother made him stay home from school because 
he was sick his understudy a girl yet went on to receive all 
the glory 
or was it beause of the funny faces he could make and get his 
friends a tough italian crowd to laugh out loud or his 
professional stage debut at buffalos studio arena in a bit role he 
got only because he could do a french accent 
mardirosian tells his story more or less chronologically with 
fine support from peter appel frederica meister and hansford rowe 
he highlights his work as an actor in new york and on the west 
coast 
the play has special appeal for theater buffs or insiders those 
audiences who actually have seen some of his quick flops such as 
cliffhanger offbroadway or happy end on broadway 
a high point of the evening is his explanation of his role in 
the normal heart larry kramers longrunning aids play in 
which the actor played several small parts among these was a 
doctor who sat silently on stage while being harangued by a fellow 
physician during the plays run mardirosian became bored in the 
role and began making up silent retorts to the accusations thrown 
at him 
the actor devotes a long segment to his association with cuba 
and his teddy bear the broadway play starring robert de niro and 
burt young mardirosian understudied both stars and finally went on 
one night for an absent young 
he takes the audience through his preparation to sub for the 
actor describing the terror and exhilaration of jumping into a 
play that is already running and working with actors who are used 
to performing with someone else its a fascinating story one that 
goes a long way toward explaining mardirosians enthusiasm for 
acting 
saved from obscurity the title refers to what the academy 
award did for the career of f murray abraham is the best kind of 
theater memoir its an inside story told by a pro with affection 
and just enough jaundice to make it all the more entertaining

q and to governor dukakis 
q governor let me follow up on that by asking you youve said 
it many times that you have balanced 10 budgets in a row in 
massachusetts are you promising the american people here tonight 
that within a fouryear presidential term you will balance the 
federal budget 
dukakis no im not sure i can promise that i dont think 
either one of us can really theres no way of anticipating what 
may happen i will say this that well set as our goal a steady 
gradual reduction of the deficit which will require tough choices 
on spending it will require a good strong rate of economic growth 
it will require a plan that the president works out with the 
congress doesnt blame them works it out with them which 
brings that deficit down it will require us to go out and collect 
billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that arent being 
paid in this country and thats grossly unfair to the average 
american whos paying his taxes and paying them on time and 
doesnt have any alternative its taken out of his paycheck 
mr bush says were going to put the irs on every taxpayer 
thats not what were going to do im for the taxpayer bill of 
rights well i think its unconscionable anne that we should be 
talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average americans 
when there are billions out there over a hundred billion dollars 
in taxes owe that arent being paid 
now i think if we work together on it and if you have a 
president that will work with the congress and the american people 
we can bring that deficit down steadily 20 25 30 billion a 
year build economic growth build a good strong future for 
america invest in those things which we must invest in economic 
development good jobs good schools for our kids college 
opportunity for young people decent health care and affordable 
housing and a clean and safe environment we can do all of those 
things and at the same time build a future in which were standing 
on a good strong fiscal foundation 
senator bentsen said as you recall at the debate with senator 
quayle that if you give any of us 200 billion dollars worth of 
hot checks a year we can create an illusion of prosperity but 
sooner or later that credit card mentality isnt going to work 
and i want to bring to the white house a sense of strength and 
fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation 
under which this country or above which this country can move 
grow invest and build the best america for its people and for our 
kids and our grandkids 
q mr vice president youre one minute response 
bush the governor has to balance a budget in his state hes 
required to by law hes raised taxes several times i wish he 
would join me as a matter of fact in appealing to the american 
people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government 
and for the lineitem veto id like to have that lineitem veto 
for the president because i think that would be extraordinarily 
helpful 
and i wont do one other thing that hes had to do took 29 
million out of his state pension fund thats equivalent in the 
federal level of taking out of the social security trust fund im 
not going to do that i wont do that and so im still a little 
unclear as to whether hes for or against a tax increase i have 
been all for the taxpayers bill of rights all along and this idea 
of unleashing a whole bunch an army a conventional force army of 
irs agents into everybodys kitchen i mean hes against most 
defense matters and now he wants to get an army of irs auditors 
going out there im against that i oppose that applause and 
boos

turkish and iranian authorities discussed 
on thursday the plight of kurdish refugees who fled to turkey 
claiming iraqi forces dropped chemical bombs on their settlements 
a government official reported 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press the talks took place in the southeastern border 
village of esendere 
the independent hurriyet news agency meanwhile reported that 
iran closed its border with turkey to prevent any crossings by 
kurdish refugees 
about 60000 kurds sought refuge in turkey in august and iran 
offered to accept any of the refugees 
nearly 19000 refugees from iraq voluntarily went from turkey to 
iran in recent weeks but iran reportedly ran into problems finding 
them shelter 
iran still had the same problem and negotiations centered on 
such issues the official said refusing to go into detail 
during the persian gulf war iran supported kurdish guerrillas 
fighting for autonomy in northern iraq 
iraq started an offensive against kurds soon after iran agreed 
to a ceasefire in the 8yearold war in august

a kurdish guerrilla official a spokesman for the kurdistan 
democratic party or kdp charged thursday that turkey has 
discreetly forced as many as 30000 kurdish refugees into iran 
in recent days 
the spokesman who is known to the associated press in nicosia 
cyprus spoke to the ap there by telephone from a west european 
city he spoke on the condition his name and exact location not be 
used for security reasons 
the official called turkeys treatment of the kurdish refugees 
despicable and appealed for international help 
we are deeply perturbed at turkeys forcible transportation of 
refugees without giving the iranian authorities any prior 
notice and without making sure that any arrangements have been made 
for them in iran he said 
the refugees now were crammed into an overcrowded camp at zieva 
in irans northwestern urumiyeh province he claimed 
irans official islamic republic new agency monitored in 
nicosia said 32000 kurdish refugees from turkey have sought 
sanctuary in northwest iran including nearly 8000 in the last few 
days because of ankaras reluctance to host them 
the kdp official said although we are grateful to turkey for 
its initial response in providing refuge for many thousands of 
kurdish civilians fleeing iraqi onslaughts with chemical weapons 
the turkish governments behavior in recent weeks has been 
despicable 
about 20 million kurds live in the mountainous region where the 
borders of turkey iran and iraq converge they have been fighting 
for independence in all three countries intermittently throughout 
this century

moderator im going to say this and im going to say it once 
to every person in this auditorium what these candidates are about 
is of utmost seriousness to the american voters they should be 
heard and you should be quiet if you are not quiet im going to 
implore the candidates to do something about prodding or 
quieting their own partisans but we cannot get through this 
program with these outbursts margaret warner for governor dukakis 
q good evening governor mr vice president governor you won 
the first debate on intellect and yet you lost it on heart 
bush just a minute 
dukakis i dont know about the vice 
q youll get your turn the american public 
dukakis i dont know whether the vice president agrees with 
that 
q the american public admired your performance but didnt seem 
to like you much now ronald reagan has found his personal warmth 
to be a tremendous political asset do you think that a president 
has to be likable to be an effective leader 
dukakis margaret may i go back and just say to the vice 
president that i didnt raid the pension fund in massachusetts 
youre dead wrong george we didnt do that as a matter of fact 
im the first governor in the history of my state to fund that 
pension system and im very proud of that and you just had your 
bush inaudible 
dukakis you just have your information no we did not 
no we did not ive been in politics for 25 years margaret ive 
won a lot of elections ive lost a few as you know and learned 
from those losses i won the democratic nomination in 51 separate 
contests i think im a reasonably likeable guy im serious 
though i think im a little more lovable these days than i used to 
be back in my youth when i began in my state legislature but im 
also a serious guy i think the presidency of the united states is 
a very serious office and i think we have to address these issues 
in a very serious way 
so i hope and expect that ill be liked by the people of this 
country as president of the united states i certainly hope ill be 
liked by them on the 8th of november but i also think its 
important to be somebody whos willing to make those tough choices 
now weve just heard two or three times from the vice president 
that hes not going to raise taxes i repeat within days after you 
made that pledge you broke it you said well maybe as a last 
resort well do it and you supported legislation this year 
thats involved tax increases not once but twice 
so that pledge isnt realistic and i think the vice president 
knows it i think the people of this country know it the fact of 
the matter is that the next president of the united states is going 
to have to go to the white house seriously hes going to have to 
work with the congress seriously he cant turn to the congress and 
blame them for the fact that we dont have a balanced budget and 
that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink 
and im going to be a president who is serious i hope and 
expect will be liked by the american people but more than that 
will do the kind of job that im elected to do will do it with as 
much good humor as i can but at the same time will do it in a way 
which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people 
and i think we know what they are 
moderator governor 
dukakis a good strong future a future in which there 
moderator youre time has run out sir 
dukakis is opportunity for all of our citizens 
moderator one minute from the vice president 
bush i dont think its a question of whether people like you 
or not to make you an effective leader i think its whether you 
share the broad dreams of the american people whether you have 
confidence in the peoples ability to get things done or whether 
you think it all should be turned over as many of the liberals do 
to washington dc you see i think its a question of values not 
likeability or lovability 
its a question in foreign affairs of experience knowing world 
leaders knowing how to build on a superb record of this 
administration in arms control because youd know exactly how to 
begin you have to learn from experience that making unilateral 
cuts in the defense system is not the way that you enhance the 
peace 
youve got to understand that it is only the united states that 
can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we cant 
turn it over to the united nations or other multilateral 
organizations it is though trying to understand the heartbeat of 
the country and i know these campaigns get knocked a lot but i 
think id be a better president now

moderator margaret warner for the vice president 
q id like to follow up on that mr vice president the tenor 
of the campaign youve been running in terms of both the issues and 
your rhetoric has surprised even some of your friends sen mark 
hatfield has known your family a long time and who knew your 
father the late sen prescott bush said and i quote if his 
father were alive today im sure his father would see it as a 
shocking transformation 
is sen hatfield right 
bush what was he referring to 
warner he was referring to your performance in the campaign 
bush well i think my dad would be pretty proud of me because i 
think weve come a long long way and i think you know three 
months ago i remember some of the great publications in this 
country had written me off and what ive had to do is to define 
not just my position but to define his dukakis and i hope ive 
done it fairly and the reason ive had to do that is that he 
dukakis ran on the left in the democratic primary ran firmly and 
ran with conviction and ran on his record 
and then at the democratic convention they made a 
determination and they said there ideology doesnt matter just 
competence and in the process the negatives began it wasnt me 
that was there at that convention thank god i was up with jimmy 
baker camping out and i didnt have to hear all of the personal 
attacks on me out of that democratic convention it was wonderful 
not to have to listen to it and im not the one that compared the 
president of the united states of rotting like a dead fish from the 
head down i didnt do that 
but i have defined the issues and i am not going to let gov 
dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these 
very liberal positions hes the one that said i am a liberal 
traditional liberal progressive liberal democrat hes the one 
that brought up to garner primary votes the whole question of the 
aclu and i have enormous difference with the aclu on their 
political agenda not on their defending some minority opinion on 
the right or the left i support that but what i dont like is 
this leftwing political agenda and therefore i have to help 
define that and if hes unwilling to do it if he says ideology 
doesnt matter i dont agree with him 
moderator one minute from gov dukakis 
dukakis well margaret weve heard it again tonight and im 
not surprised the labels i guess the vice president called me a 
liberal two or three times said i was coming from the left in 
1980 president reagan called you a liberal for voting for federal 
gun control and this is something republicans have used for a long 
time they tried it with franklin roosevelt and harry truman and 
john kennedy its not labels its our vision of america and we 
have two fundamentally different visions of america 
the vice president is complacent thinks we ought to stick with 
the status quo doesnt think we ought to move ahead thinks things 
are okay as they are i dont i think this is a great country 
because weve always wanted to do better to make our country 
better to make our lives better weve always been a nation which 
was ambitious for america and we move forward and thats the kind 
of america i want thats the kind of leadership i want to provide 
but i dont think these labels mean a thing and i would hope 
that tonight and in the course of the rest of this campaign we 
can have our good solid disagreements on issues theres nothing 
the matter with that but lets stop labeling each other and lets 
get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country

q andrea mitchell for the vice president 
q mr vice president governor mr vice president let me 
return for a moment to the issue of the budget because so much has 
already been put off limits in your campaign that most people do 
not believe that the flexible freeze alone will solve the problem 
of the deficit so lets turn to defense for a moment 
pentagon officials tell us that there is not enough money in the 
budget to handle military readiness preparedness as well as new 
weapons systems that have been proposed as well as those already 
in the pipeline you were asked at the first debate what new 
weapons systems you would cut you mentioned three that had already 
been canceled can you tonight share with us three new weapons 
systems that you would cut 
bush if i knew of three new weapons systems that i thought were 
purely waste and werent protected by the congress they wouldnt 
be in the budget they would not be in the budget but you want one 
now ill give you one that hemat that heavy truck thats cost 
what is it 850 million and the pentagon didnt request it and yet 
a member of congress a very powerful one put it in the budget 
i think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated 
concept andrea that i know you do understand of competitive 
strategies it is new and it is very very different than whats 
happened but its not quite ready to be totally implemented but 
its very important i think we can save through the packard 
commission report and im very proud that david packard the 
originator of that report is strongly supporting me so its not 
a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste i dont 
believe that 
i do think this were in the serious stages of negotiation with 
the soviet union now on the strategic arms control talks and we 
are protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our 
strategic forces my secretary of defense is going to have to make 
a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with but 
we are protecting both of them were moving forward with 
negotiations and you see i just think it would be dumb 
negotiating policy with the soviets to cut out one or the other of 
the two options right now the soviets are modernizing they 
continue to modernize and we cant simply say weve got enough 
nuclear weapons lets freeze we cant do that 
we have to have modernization especially if we achieve the 50 
percent reduction in strategic weapons that our president is taking 
the leadership to attain and so thats the way id reply to it 
and i believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible 
if we modernize if we go forward with competitive strategies and 
if we do follow through on the packard commission report 
q governor dukakis one minute 
dukakis well andrea weve just had another example of why the 
vice presidents mathematics just doesnt add up i think you know 
because youve covered these issues that theres no way that we 
can build all of the weapons systems that the vice president says 
he wants to build within the existing defense budget everybody 
knows that including the people at the pentagon 
now my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with some 
of those decisions but its going to be the president thats going 
to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the 
congress what weapon systems are going to go and what are going to 
stay were not going to spend the billions and trillions that mr 
bush wants to spend on star wars were not going to spend billions 
on mxs on railroad cars which is a weapon system we dont need 
cant afford and wont help our defense posture at all were not 
going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from 
washington to tokyo 
those are decisions that the chief executive has to make yes 
were going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear 
deterrent were going to go forward with the stealth the d5 and 
the advanced cruise missile and good conventional forces but the 
next president of the united states will have to make some tough 
and difficult decisions im prepared to make them

moderator andrea has a question for you 
q governor continuing on that subject then you say that we 
have to do something about conventional forces you have supported 
the submarinelaunched missile the d5 you just referred to yet 
from jerry ford to jimmy carter to ronald reagan there has been a 
bipartisan consensus in favor of modernizing the landbased 
missiles now you have ruled out the mx and the midgetman more 
recently some of your aides have hinted at some flexibility that 
you might show about some other new form of missile can you tell 
us tonight why you have rejected the collected wisdom of people as 
diverse as sam nunn henry kissinger al gore people in both 
parties and what type of landbased missile would you consider 
dukakis well andrea today we have 13000 strategic nuclear 
warheads on land on air and the sea thats an incredibly 
powerful nuclear deterrent i dont rule out modernization and 
there are discussions going on now in the congress and over at the 
pentagon about a less expensive modernized landbased leg of the 
triad 
but there are limits to what we can spend there are limits to 
this nations ability to finance these weapons systems and one of 
the things that the vice president either ignores or wont address 
is the fact that you cant divorce our military security from our 
economic security how can we build a strong america militarily 
thats teetertottering on a mountain of debt 
and if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the vice 
president is suggesting tonight and has in the past that debt is 
going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger so military security 
and economic security go hand in hand and we will have a strong 
and effective and credible nuclear deterrent were going to have 
conventional forces that are well maintained well equipped well 
trained well supported and we have serious problems with our 
conventional forces at the present time and theyll get worse 
unless we have a president whos willing to make some of these 
decisions 
and we also have important domestic priorities in education and 
housing and health care in economic development and job training 
in the environment now all of these things are going to have be 
addressed thats why i say again to all of you out there who have 
to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is 
that the next president has to do the same 
i want the men and women of our armed forces to have the support 
they need to defend us the support they need when they risk our 
sic lives to keep us free and to keep this country free but we 
cannot continue to live on a credit card we cannot continue to 
tell the american people that were going to build all of these 
systems and at the same time invest in important things here at 
home and be serious about building a strong and good america and 
thats the kind of america i want to build 
moderator one minute for the vice president 
bush i think the foremost can we start the clock over i 
held off for the applause can i get 
moderator you can proceed sir 
bush i think the foremost responsibility of a president really 
gets down to the national security of this country the governor 
talks about limit what we cant do opposes these two 
modernization systems talks now about may well well develop 
some new kind of a missile it takes eight years 10 years to do 
that 
he talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when i was in 
europe trying to convince european public opinion that we ought to 
go forward with the deployment of the inf weapons and thank god 
the freeze people were not heard they were wrong and the result 
is we deployed and the soviets kept deploying and then we 
negotiated from strength and now we have the first arms control 
agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons you just dont make 
unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the soviets are going to 
behave themselves world peace is important and we have enhanced 
the peace and im proud to have been a part of an administration 
that has done exactly that peace through strength works

the foreign minister of nicaragua said 
thursday that he hoped the next us president would help repair 
relations with his leftist government 
foreign minister miguel descoto brockmann told delegates to the 
43rd general assembly that the problem in central america has a 
first and last name it is called us intervention 
when the united states stops making war on nicaragua and stops 
involving its lackeys in this war then the international situation 
will be immensely eased in central america descoto said 
the minister claimed the reputation of the united states had 
sunk to an alltime low internationally and all agree that the 
dirty immoral and illegal policy against nicaragua is the basic 
reason for this discredit 
secretary of state george shultz and a couple of his latin 
american friends may think differently but thats another kettle 
of fish descoto said 
we were not intimidated in the military struggle against the 
us mercenary forces we have defeated them he said referring 
to the ussupported rebels known as contras the united states 
has supported the contra since 1981 two years after the sandinista 
government came to power 
leftist rebels fighting el salvadors usbacked government and 
the usbacked contras battling the sandinistas both launch raids 
from honduran territory 
we believe that it is possible to arrive at an understanding 
with the united states and normalize our bilateral relations with 
that country descoto added with the next us administration 
we hope that might be possible 
the us presidential elections between democrat michael 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts and vice president george 
bush a republican is nov 8 with the winner taking office in

moderator anne compton for gov dukakis 
q governor today they may call them role models but they 
used to be called heroes the kind of public figure who could 
inspire a whole generation someone who is larger than life my 
question is not who your heroes were my question instead is who 
are the heroes who are there in american life today who are the 
ones that you would point out to young americans as figures who 
should inspire this country 
dukakis well i think when i think of heroes i think back 
not presently anne but there are many people who i admire in this 
country today some of them are in public life in the senate and 
the congress some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to 
me i think of those young athletes who represented us at the 
olympics who were tremendously impressive we were proud of them 
we felt strongly about them and they did so well by us 
i can think of doctors and scientists jonas salk who for 
example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread 
diseases we ever had and hes a hero i think of classroom 
teachers classroom teachers that i have had classroom teachers 
that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people 
because they inspire them they teach them but more than that 
they are role models members of the clergy who have done the same 
drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to 
youngsters who come up to me and others and ask for help and want 
help and are doing the hard work the heroic work which it takes to 
provide that kind of leadership that kind of counseling that kind 
of support 
i think of people in the law enforcement community who are 
taking their lives in their hands every day when they go up to one 
of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs 
into our communities and into our kids so there are many many 
heroes in this country today these are people that give of 
themselves every day and every week and every month in many cases 
theyre people in the community who are examples and are role 
models 
and i would hope that one of the things that i could do as 
president is to recognize them to give them the kind of 
recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young 
people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow can go into 
public service can go into teaching can go into drug counseling 
can go into law enforcement and be heroes themselves to generations 
yet to come 
moderator one minute for vice president bush 
bush i think of a teacher right here largely hispanic school 
jamie escalante teaching calculus to young kids 80 percent of 
them going on to college i think of a young man now in this 
country named valladeres who was released from a cuban jail came 
out and told the truth in this brilliant book against all hope 
about what is actually happening in cuba 
i think of those people that took us back into space again 
rick hauck and that crew as people that are worthy of this i 
agree with the governor on athletics and theres nothing corny 
about having sports heroes young people that are clean and 
honorable and out there setting a setting the pace i think of 
dr fauci probably never heard of him you did reference to 
ms compton hes a very fine research top doctor at the national 
institute of health working hard doing something about research on 
this disease of aids 
but look i also think we ought to give a little credit to the 
president of the united states he is the one that has gotten us 
that first arms control agreement and the cynics abounded 
moderator mr vice president 
bush and he is leaving office with a popularity at an 
alltime high 
moderator mr vice president your time has expired 
bush because american people say he is our hero

the air force on thursday denied 
that a safety officer mistakenly destroyed a navy trident 2 
submarine missile as a wisconsin congressman charged 
the range safety officer acted within the parameters of the 
mission flight rules by destroying the missile when he did the 
air force said in a statement issued at its eastern space and 
missile center here the missile was off course and continued to 
veer off farther 
pentagon sources in washington indicated the test team might 
have deliberately built an offcourse maneuver into the flight path 
to see how well the missiles guidance system reacted and that such 
information may never have been transmitted to the range safety 
officer 
us rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee said in washington wednesday theres always 
someone who doesnt get the word and in this incident it was the 
man with his finger on the button 
the trident 2 was launched sept 19 from cape canaveral as the 
15th of 19 test flights planned from a land launch pad before the 
weapon begins submarine test firings the missile exploded about 60 
seconds after liftoff 
aspin said the safety officer sent a radio signal to blow up the 
missile when he mistakenly believed it was about to leave the range 
safety corridor 
its the range safety officers job to allow the missile to 
fly as long as it can to achieve its test objective but he also 
must protect the public the air force statement said the air 
force is responsible for safety on the missile test range 
aspin said in testing thus far the trident 2 series shows two 
outright failures and one partial success he said the destruction 
of the 15th missile was counted as a no test because the 
missile did not malfunction 
overall test results indicate the missile is still meeting 
its objectives the congressman said 
the trident 2 capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads to 
different targets will be the most powerful weapon in the navy 
arsenal when it becomes operational late next year each trident 
submarine carries 24 missiles

q anne has a question for you mr vice president 
q lets change the pace a little bit mr vice president in 
this campaign some hard and very bitter things have been spoken by 
each side about each side if youd consider for a moment governor 
dukakis in his years of public service is there anything nice you 
can say about him anything you find admirable 
bush hey listen youre stealing my close i had something 
very nice to say in that 
q somebody leaked my question to you 
bush no look ill tell you what no let me tell you 
something about that and barbara and i were sitting there before 
that democratic convention and we saw the governor and his son on 
television the night before and his family and his mother who was 
there and im saying to barbara you know weve always kept 
family as a bit of an oasis for us you all know me and weve held 
it back a little but we use that as a role model the way he 
took understandable pride in his heritage what his family means to 
him 
and weve got a strong family and we watched that and we said 
hey weve got to unleash the bush kids and so you saw 10 
grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the at 
the convention you see our five kids all over this country and 
their spouses and so i would say that the concept of the dukakis 
family has my great respect and id say i dont know whether 
thats kind or not its just an objective statement and i think 
the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to 
face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise because its 
gotten a little ugly out there its gotten a little nasty its 
not much fun sometimes 
and i would cite again dan quayle ive been in politics a long 
time and i dont remember that kind of piling on that kind of ugly 
rumor that never was true printed now come on so some of its 
unfair but hes in the arena teddy roosevelt used to talk about 
the arena you know daring to fail greatly or succeed no 
matter hes in there so i salute these things i salute those 
who participate in the political process 
sam rayburn had a great expression on this he said you know 
i hear all of these intellectuals out there griping and complaining 
and saying its negative coverage rayburn says yeah and that 
guy never ran for sheriff either michael dukakis has run for 
sheriff and so has george bush 
q governor a oneminute response sir 
dukakis i didnt hear the word liberal or left one 
time i thank you for that 
bush thats not bad thats true 
dukakis and doesnt that prove the point george which is that 
values like family and education community 
bush thats where you want to take the country 
dukakis decent homes for young people that family in long 
island i visited on monday where lou and betty tulamo bought a 
house for some 19000 back in 1962 have had seven children 
theyre all making good livings they cant live in the community 
in which they grew up in those are basic american values i 
believe in them i think you believe in them theyre not left or 
right theyre decent american values 
i guess the one thing that concerns me about this anne is this 
attempt to label things which all of us believe in we may have 
different approaches we may think that you deal with them in 
different days but theyre basically american i believe in them 
george bush believes in them i think the vast majority of 
americans believe in them and i hope 
q governor 
dukakis the tone weve just heard might just be the tone we 
have for the rest of the campaign i think the american people 
would appreciate that

a federal judge has declared 
unconstitutional a franchise fee charged by the city of palo alto 
to a local cable television company a ruling described by a 
company lawyer as the first of its kind 
the ruling if it stands would save the cable company century 
federal 900000 a year attorney harold farrow said thursday but 
he said the potential impact of the issue is much greater because 
more than 40 million homes in the nation have cable and at least 90 
percent are with companies that pay franchise fees 
i believe this is the first case in the whole country where 
they held a franchise fee to be straightforwardly and without any 
question unconstitutional farrow said noting that a federal 
appeals court in philadelphia had ruled to the contrary 
he called the ruling a victory for freedom of the press 
jerome falk a lawyer for palo alto and several neighboring 
communities that joined in assessing the franchise fee declined 
comment 
the decision by us district judge eugene lynch issued 
wednesday declared that the franchise fee discriminated against 
cable operators in violation of constitutional freedom of 
expression 
palo alto said the fee which is 5 percent of a companys gross 
revenue was justified as rent for use of the citys rightofway 
to place cables 
lynch said the fee was discriminatory because pacific bell 
which uses the same rightofway for its telephone lines is not 
charged any fee as its access is guaranteed by state law also 
pacific gas amp electric co is charged only a 2 percent fee for use 
of a public rightofway by the neighboring city of atherton a 
defendant in the cable case 
the 5 percent fee is aimed exclusively at cable television 
operators engaged in speech protected by the first amendment 
lynch said 
he also said the citys goal of raising money could have been 
met by a nondiscriminatory fee 
farrow who represents several cable companies that have fought 
local restrictions said century federal had signed up 50000 
subscribers in the palo alto area paying an average of 30 a month

moderator margaret warner for the vice president 
q vice president bush abortion remains with us as a very 
troubling issue and id like to explore that for a minute with 
you you have said that you regard abortion as murder yet you 
would make exceptions in the cases of rape and incest my question 
is why should a woman who discovers through amniocentesis that her 
baby will be born with taysachs disease for instance that the 
baby will live at most two years and those two years in incredible 
pain be forced to carry the fetus to term and yet a woman who 
becomes pregnant through incest would be allowed to abort her fetus 
bush because you left out one other exception the health of 
the mother let me answer your question and i hope it doesnt get 
too personal or maudlin bar and i lost a child you know that we 
lost a daughter robin and we took we were out i was over 
running records in west texas and i got a call from her come 
home went to the doctor the doctor said beautiful child 
your child has a few weeks to live and i said what can we 
do about it he said no she has leukemia acute leukemia a 
few weeks to live we took the child to new york thanks to the 
miraculous sacrifices of doctors and nurses the child stayed alive 
for six months and then died 
if that child were here today and i was told this same thing 
my granddaughter noel for example that child could stay alive 
for 10 or 15 years or maybe for the rest of her life and so i 
dont think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge 
at the time i think human life is very very precious 
and look this hasnt been an easy decision for me to make 
work meet i know others disagree with it but when i was in 
that little church across the river from washington and saw our 
grandchild christened in our faith i was very pleased indeed that 
the mother had not aborted that child and put the child up for 
adoption and so i just feel this is where im coming from and 
it is personal and i dont assail him on that issue or others on 
that issue but thats the way i george bush feel about it 
moderator one minute for governor dukakis 
dukakis margaret kitty and i had very much the same kind of 
experience that the bushes had we lost a baby lived about 20 
minutes after it was born but isnt the real question that we 
have to answer not how many exceptions we make because the vice 
president himself is prepared to make exceptions its who makes 
the decision who makes this very difficult very wrenching 
decision 
and i think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own 
conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision who are 
we to say well under certain circumstances its all right but 
under other circumstances it isnt thats a decision that only a 
woman can make after consulting her conscience and consulting her 
religious principles and i would hope that we would give to women 
in this country the right to make that decision and to make it in 
the exercise of their conscience and religious beliefs

moderator governor margaret has a question for you 
q governor id like to return to the topic of the defense 
budget for a minute you have said in this campaign that you 
would maintain a stable defense budget yet you are on the board 
on the advisory 
dukakis and incidentally may i say that that thats the 
decision of the congress and the president has concurred 
q yet you are on the board of a group called jobs with peace in 
boston that advocates a 25 percent cut in the defense budget and 
the transfer of that money to the domestic economy my question is 
do you share that goal perhaps as a longrange goal and if not 
are you aware of or why do you permit this group to continue to 
use your name on its letterhead for fundraising 
dukakis well i think i was on the advisory committee 
margaret no i dont happen to share that goal its an example of 
how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of 
whose particular positions we dont support even though we 
support in general the hope that over time particularly if we can 
get those reductions in strategic weapons if we can get a 
comprehensive test ban treaty if we can negotiate with the soviet 
union and bring down the level of conventional forces in europe 
with deeper cuts in the soviet side yes at some point it may be 
possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important 
things here at home like jobs and job training and college 
opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the 
things that all of us care about 
but i do think this that the next president even within a 
relatively stable budget and thats what were going to have for 
the foreseeable future well have to make those tough choices 
that i was talking about and that mr bush doesnt seem to want to 
make and that really is going to be a challenge for the next 
president of the united states i dont think theres any question 
about it 
but i also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with 
the soviet union to build on the progress that weve made with the 
inf treaty which i strongly supported and most democrats did 
to get those reductions in strategic weapons to get a test ban 
treaty and to really make progress on the reduction of 
conventional forces in europe 
and if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts 
on the soviet side which is where they ought to come from then i 
think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move 
some of our resources from the military to important domestic 
priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young 
woman whose mother wrote me from texas just the other day from 
longview texas two teachers a mother and a father who have a 
child thats a freshman in college whos an electrical engineering 
major a very bright student and they cant afford to keep that 
child in college 
so i hope that we can begin to move those resources its not 
going to happen overnight it certainly will have to happen on a 
stepbystep basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms 
control and arms reduction but it certainly ought to be 
moderator governor 
dukakis a longterm goal of all americans and i think it is 
moderator one minute for the vice president 
bush the defense budget today takes far less percentage of the 
gross national product than it did in president kennedys time for 
example moved tremendously and you see i think were facing a 
real opportunity for world peace this is a big question and its 
a question as to whether the united states will continue to lead 
for peace see i dont believe any other country can pick up the 
mantel 
i served at the un united nations i dont think we can turn 
over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the 
united nations or anything else so what im saying is we are 
going to have to make choices i said i would have the secretary of 
defense sit down but while the president is negotiating with the 
soviet union i simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts 
and i think those that advocated the freeze missed the point 
that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a 
principle asymmetrical cuts the soviets take out more than we do 
and the principle of intrusive verification and those two 
principles can now be applied to conventional forces to strategic 
forces provided

q andrea mitchell for governor dukakis 
q governor youve said tonight that you set as a goal the 
steady reduction of the deficit and youve talked about making 
tough choices so perhaps i can get you to make one of those tough 
choices no credible economist in either party accepts as realistic 
your plan to handle the deficit by tightening tax collection 
investing in economic growth bringing down interest rates and 
cutting weapons systems 
dukakis and some domestic programs as well andrea 
q and some domestic programs as well so lets assume now for 
argument purpose that it is the spring of 1989 and you are 
president dukakis and you discover that all of those economists 
were right and you were wrong you are now facing that dreaded last 
resort increase taxes which tax do you decide is the least 
onerous 
dukakis may i disagree with the premise of your question 
q for the sake of argument no 
dukakis as a matter of reality im going to have to because we 
have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there 
are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not 
being paid in these are not taxes owed by average americans we 
dont have an alternative we lose it when its taken out of our 
paycheck before we even get it but its the internal revenue 
service which estimates now that we arent collecting 100 billion 
or more in taxes owed in this country and that is just absolutely 
unfair to the vast majority of americans who pay their taxes and 
pay them on time 
the dorgan task force which included two internal revenue 
commissioners one a republican former internal revenue 
commissioners one a republican one a democrat it was a 
bipartisan commission a study by two respected economists which 
indicated that we could collect some 40 45 50 billion of those 
funds the point is youve got to have a president whos prepared 
to do this and to begin right away and preferably a president who 
as a governor of a state thats had very very successful 
experience at doing this in my own state we did it in other 
states weve done it republican governors as well as democratic 
governors and weve had great success at revenue enforcement 
now the vice president will probably tell you that its going 
to take an army of irs collectors again well his campaign 
manager who used to be the secretary of the treasury was taking 
great credit about a year ago and asking and receiving from the 
congress substantial additional funds to hire internal revenue 
agents to go out and collect these funds and im happy to join jim 
baker in saying that we agree on this 
but the fact of the matter is that this is something that we 
must begin its going to take at least the first year of the new 
administration but the dorgan task force the bipartisan task 
force estimated that we could collect about 35 billion in the 
fifth year 105 billion over five years the other study even more 
than that 
q governor 
dukakis and thats where you begin 
q one minute response mr vice president 
bush well andrea you didnt predicate that lack of 
economists support for what i call a flexible freeze cause some 
good very good economists do support that concept and i think 
where i differ with the governor of massachusetts is i am 
optimistic they jumped on me yesterday for being a little 
optimistic about the united states i am optimistic and i believe 
we can keep this longest expansion going 
i was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my 
hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political 
leaders were cause it isnt the end of the world and what we have 
to do is restrain the growth of spending and we are doing a better 
job of it the congress is doing a better job of it and the 
dynamics work but they dont work if you go raise taxes and then 
the congress spends it continues to spend that the american 
working man and woman are not taxed too little the federal 
government continues to spend too much applause hold it

moderator mr vice president andrea has a question for you 
q mr vice president you have flatly ruled out any change in 
social security benefits even for the wealthy now can you stand 
here tonight and look a whole generation of 18 to 34 year olds in 
the eye the very people who are going to have to be financing that 
retirement and tell them that they should be financing the 
retirement of people like yourself like governor dukakis or for 
that matter people such as ourselves here on this panel 
bush more so you than me but 
q we could argue about that 
bush no but youve got to go back to what social security 
was when it was created it wasnt created as a welfare program it 
wasnt created it was created as a whole retirement or health 
supplement to retirement program it wasnt created as a welfare 
program so heres whats happened we came into office and the 
social security trust fund was in great jeopardy and the president 
took the leadership working with the democrats and the republicans 
in congress some tough calls were made and the social security 
trust fund was put back into sound solvent condition 
so i dont want to fool around with it and theres several 
theres a good political reason because its just about this time 
of year that the democrats start saying the republicans are 
going to take away your social security it always works that 
way ive seen it in precinct politics in texas and ive seen it 
at the national level 
we have made the social security trust fund sound and it is 
going to be operating at surpluses and i dont want the liberal 
democratic congress to spend out of that social security trust fund 
or go and take the money out for some other purpose i dont want 
that and i will not go in there and suggest changes in social 
security i learned that the hard way 
and the governor and i both supported slipping the colas for one 
year he supported it at the national governors conference and i 
supported it in breaking a tie in a major compromise package and 
we got assailed by the democrats in the election over that and i 
am going to keep that social security trust fund sound and keep our 
commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line maybe when you 
get two decades or one into the next century youre going to have 
to take another look at it but not now we do not have to do it 
keep the trust with the older men and women of this country 
moderator governor you have one minute sir 
dukakis andrea i dont know which george bush im listening 
to george bush a few years ago said that social security was 
basically a welfare system and in 1985 he flew back from the west 
coast to cut that cola i voted against that at the national 
governors association we won a majority we didnt win the 
twothirds that was necessary in order to pass that resolution 
george but everybody knew what we were doing and ive opposed 
that 
the reason that we raised concerns not just in election years 
but every year is because republicans once theyre elected go in 
there and start cutting you did it in 1985 the administration 
tried to do it repeatedly repeatedly in 81 82 and im sure 
youll try to do it again because theres no way that you can 
finance what you want to spend theres no way you can pay for that 
fiveyear 40 billion tax cut for the rich and still buy all those 
weapon systems you want to buy unless you raid the social security 
trust fund

ferdinand marcos fostered unrest against his 
own government to justify dictatorial powers according to a 
journal handwritten by the ousted philippine president the los 
angeles times reported thursday 
i have that feeling of certainty that i will end up with 
dictatorial powers if the situation continues and the situation 
will continue marcos wrote in 1970 
the papers indicate that marcos deceived us officials who have 
long sought good relations with the philippines because of the 
countrys strategic location and vast us military installations 
for example marcos told ambassador henry a byroade that he 
suspected china of supplying arms to maoist revolutionaries just a 
few months after marcos wrote in the papers that it appeared no 
foreign powers were providing the revolutionaries with arms the 
times said 
the papers are reportedly part of a larger manuscript discovered 
in the presidential palace after marcos fled manila in the 
bloodless revolution that brought corazon aquino to power in 
february 1986 
marcos lives in exile in hawaii his spokesman gemmo trinidad 
blasted the papers release as an invasion of privacy and said 
marcos may go to court over it 
the papers also show that marcos expected maoist rebels would 
try to spark a revolution but he acknowledged that they and other 
groups were weak 
we should allow them to gather strength but not such strength 
that we cannot overcome them a feb 17 1970 entry says 
marcos worked his plan for absolute power cautiously the papers 
say 
i must continue to restrain myself lest we lose the support of 
the people by a stance of tyranny another entry says 
by march 1970 however marcos was losing patience as nonviolent 
demonstrations were not disruptive enough for him the papers say 
the disorders must now be induced into a crisis so stricter 
measures can be taken a march 3 1970 entry says 
another entry says a little more destruction and vandalism 
and i can do anything 
james miller an independent handwriting analyst hired by the 
newspaper checked them against formal degrees written by marcos 
and found virtually everything was consistent 
the entries start on new years eve of 1970 just after marcos 
was reelected to his second term as president in an election 
marked by allegations of vote fraud 
one month later he started outlining his total solution an 
elaborate scheme to liquidate communists and silence opposition

supporters of marcos have been subpoenaed to appear before a 
federal grand jury that apparently is investigating an alleged 1987 
plot to return marcos to power 
trinidad said those subpoenaed include marcos daugther irene 
and her husband gregorio araneta 
marcos denounced the subpoenas as pure and simple harassment 
the us justice department through the fbi has been 
investigating possible violations by marcos supporters in hawaii

supporters of marcos allegedly provided a private boeing 707 
that flew into honolulu last year but departed without marcos after 
federal agents threatened to restrain him if he tried to leave 
us officials are convinced that marcos continues to try to 
destabilize the government of president corazon aquino marcos 
denies such efforts

moderator ann compton for the vice president 
q mr vice president there are three justices of the supreme 
court who are in their eighties and its very likely the next 
president will get a chance to put a lasting mark on the supreme 
court for the record would your nominees to the supreme court 
have to pass something that has been called a kind of conservative 
ideological litmus test and would you give us an idea of perhaps 
who two or three people on your short list are for the court 
bush well one i dont have a list yet i feel pretty confident 
tonight but not that confident and secondly secondly i dont 
have any litmus test but what i would do is appoint people to the 
federal bench that will not legislate from the bench who will 
interpret the constitution i do not want to see us go to again 
and im using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is 
going to legislate from the bench 
they dukakis supporters dont like the use of the word but 
may i remind his strong supporters that only last year in the 
primary to capture that democratic nomination he said i am a 
progressive liberal democratic i wont support judges like that 
there is no litmus test on any issue but i will go out there 
and find men and women to interpret and i dont have a list but i 
think the appointments that the president has made to the bench 
have been outstanding outstanding appointments 
ms compton including bork including bork 
bush yeah 
moderator governor 
bush i supported him 
moderator you have a oneminute reponse time 
dukakis if the vice president of the united states thinks that 
robert bork was an outstanding appointment that is a very good 
reason for voting for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen on the 8th of 
november and i think mr bush supported the bork nomination 
you know mr bush has never appointed a judge ive appointed 
over 130 so i have a record and im very proud of it i dont 
ask people whether theyre republicans or democrats ive appointed 
prosecutors ive appointed defenders i dont appoint people i 
think are liberal or people who i think are conservative i 
appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence 
people who will be a credit to the bench and those are the 
standards that i will use in nominating people to the supreme court 
of the united states 
these appointments are for life these appointments are for 
life and when the vice president talks about liberals on the 
bench i wonder who hes talking about is he talking about a 
former governor of the state of california who was a former 
prosecutor 
moderator governor 
dukakis a republican named earl warren because i think 
chief justice warren was an outstanding chief justice and i think 
most americans do too

q anne compton has a question for you governor dukakis 
q governor millions of americans are entitled to some of the 
protections and benefits that the federal government provides 
including social security pensions medicare for the elderly 
medicaid for the poor but in fact there are so many millions of 
americans who are eligible that government just cant continue to 
pay for all of those programs as theyre currently constituted a 
blue ribbon panel shortly after the election is likely to 
recommend that you go where the money is when you make budget cuts 
and that means entitlements before the election would you commit 
yourself to any of those hard choices such as which one of those 
entitlements ought to be redrawn 
dukakis andrea why do people who want to balance budgets or 
bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to 
benefit people of very modest means you know twothirds of the 
people in this country who receive social security checks live 
entirely on that check they have no other income and yet mr 
bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985 
medicare is not getting less expensive medical care for the 
elderly is getting more expensive with greater deductibles with 
fewer benefits the kinds of things that weve had under this 
administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kinds of 
benefits that one gets under medicare yes we now have 
catastrophic health insurance but its gonna cost and thats 
going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens it had 
bipartisan support it should have had bipartisan support but i 
suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional 
costs on senior citizens across this country 
so im not going to begin and im not going to go to 
entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when were 
spending billions on something like star wars when were spending 
billions on other weapon systems which apparently the vice 
president wants to keep in his back pocket or someplace but 
which if we continue to spend billions on them will force us to 
cut social security to cut medicare to cut these basic 
entitlements to people of very very modest means 
now there are some things we can do to help people who currently 
do get entitlements to get off of public assistance i talked in 
our first debate about the possibilities of helping millions and 
millions of welfare families to get off of welfare and im proud 
to say that we finally have a welfare reform bill and the ruby 
sampsons and dawn lawsons hundreds of thousands of welfare mothers 
in this country and in my state and across the country who today 
are working and earning are examples of what can happen when you 
provide training for those welfare mothers some day care for their 
children so that those mothers can go into a training program and 
get a decent job 
q governor 
dukakis thats the way you bring a deficit down and help to 
improve the quality of life for people at the same time 
q one minute for the vice president 
bush i think ive addressed it but let me simply say for the 
record i did not vote to cut colas and i voted the same way that 
he did three months before in a national governors conference and 
he said at that time quote and this is a paraphrase a freeze 
thats easy so i dont believe that we need to do what youve 
suggested here and ive said that im going to keep the social 
security entitlement to keep that trust fund sound 
but i do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the 
pressing problems particularly that affect our children and i 
have made some good sound proposals but again weve got a big 
difference on child care for example you see i want the families 
to have the choice i want i dont want to see the federal 
government licensing grandmothers i dont want to see the federal 
government saying to communities well you cant do this 
anymore were going to tell you how to do it all 
i want flexibility and i do you know these people laugh about 
the thousand points of life you ought to go out and light you 
ought to go out and see around this country whats happening in the 
volunteer sector american helping american and i want to keep it 
alive in child care 
q mr vice president 
bush and in other entitlements

moderator margaret warner for governor dukakis 
q governor im going to pass on the question i originally 
planned to ask you to follow up on your rebuttal to a question 
andrea asked and that involves social security now it is true as 
you said that originally you sought an exemption for social 
security colas in this national governors association vote 
dukakis right 
q but when you lost that vote you then endorsed the 
overall freeze proposal and whats more you had great criticism 
of your fellow governors who wouldnt go along as political 
cowards you said it takes guts and it takes will 
dukakis that is absolutely not true margaret no that is 
absolutely that is absolutely not true it had nothing to do 
with the debate on social security it had to do with the 
discussion we had had the previous day on the oveall question of 
reducing the budget 
q my question is arent you demagoguing the social security 
issue 
dukakis no and i have to i have to i just have to 
correct the record that simply isnt true now were not a 
parlimentary body the national governors association we vote on 
resolutions if you dont get a twothirds then your resolution 
doesnt pass but everybody knew that those of us who voted 
against the freezing of colas did so we did so emphatically and 
i never made that statement never would 
the point is that as we look at this nations future and we 
have two very different visions of this future i want to move 
ahead the vice president talks about a thousand points of light 
im interested in 240 million points of light im interested in 
240 million citizens in this country who who share in the 
american dream all of them in every part of this country 
but as we look at the decisions that the next president of the 
united states is going to have to make i just dont believe the 
place you go first is those programs those socalled entitlements 
which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of 
medical care for the elderly for the disabled for people who 
cant make their way on their own and in many cases have given a 
great deal to this country 
the vice president did call social security a few years ago 
basically or largely a welfare program it isnt its a contract 
between generations its something that we pay into now so that we 
will have a secure retirement and our parents and grandparents 
will have a secure retirement its a very sacred contract and i 
belive in it so thats not where we ought to go 
there are plenty of places to cut theres lots we can do in the 
pentagon where dishonest contractors have been lining their pockets 
at the expense of the american taxpayer there are we certainly 
ought to be able to give our farm families a decent income without 
spending 20 to 25 billion dollars a year in farm subsidies and im 
sure we can do that thats where we ought to go and those are the 
programs that we ought to review first 
moderator one minute for the vice president 
bush well let me take him up on this question of farm 
subsidies we have a fundamental difference approach on 
agriculture he favors this supply maintenance or production 
controls he said that hes been out in the states saying that in 
these midwestern states i dont i think the farm bill that he 
criticizes was good legislation outstanding legislation and i 
believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the 
government further involved but to do what im suggesting 
first place never go back to that democratic grain embargo 
that liberal democrat grain embargo that knocked the markets right 
out from under us and made mr gorbachev say to me when he was 
here how do i know youre reliable suppliers we never should 
go back to that and we ought to expand our markets abroad we 
ought to have rural enterprise zones we ought to move forward 
swiftly on my ideas of ethanol which would use more corn and 
therefore make create a bigger market for our agricultural 
products but lets not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that 
passed with overwhelming democrat and republican support 
moderator mr vice president 
bush the farm payments are going down because the agricultural 
economy is coming back

a un cambodia resolution calls for the 
10th straight year for withdrawal of vietnamese forces but this 
time also specifies nonreturn of pol pots genocidal policies 
in trying for a breakthrough 
increasingly the issue of khmer rouge leader pol pot and how to 
prevent his return to power is seen as a major stumbling block in 
achieving a vietnamese troop withdrawal a political settlement and 
a nonaligned cambodia 
chinas un mission indicated on tuesday that the beijing 
government could accept pol pot and his circle as refugees under 
chinese law but the statement did not specifically mention the 
ailing communist leader 
although a formal offer of refuge for pol pot has not been made 
and details remain to be worked out diplomats here see chinas new 
willingness to offer sanctuary as a major positive development in 
resolving the problem 
china has been a strong supporter and arms supplier of the khmer 
rouge the strongest antivietnamese fighting force but has 
distanced itself from pol pots policies 
the cambodia resolution has been adopted overwhelmingly every 
year since the december 1978 invasion of cambodia by vietnamese 
troops to oust pol pot who presided over the deaths of at least 1 
million cambodians in the 1970s 
the united nations is expected to play a major role in any 
cambodian settlement possibly providing a peacekeeing force and 
observers to supervise a vietnamese troop withdrawal and free 
elections 
the noncommunist association of southeast asian nations asean 
has been drafting the resolution for 10 years it introduced major 
changes this year to reflect the dialogue between cambodian 
factions and the desire to exclude pol pot from any major role in 
cambodia 
the khmer rouge led by khieu samphan is the strongest of three 
factions fighting the vietnamese the others are noncommunist 
factions led by former cambodian prime minister son sann and prince 
norodom sihanouk the prince is expected to become the head of a 
future coalition government 
the resolution last year was adopted by a vote of 117 to 21 
with 16 abstentions 
this year the yes vote could be even higher according to 
asian diplomats while vietnam the soviet union and their friends 
are expected to oppose it again the reference to excluding pol pot 
is considered a welcome change 
the draft resolution calls for the following new elements 
the nonreturn to the universally condemned policies and 
practices of a recent past a reference to the documented deaths 
blamed on the pol pot regime the passage is taken directly from 
the secretarygenerals own report on cambodia issued oct 17 1985 
the khmer rouge and others call that reference an unacceptable 
interference in cambodias internal affairs but asian diplomats 
familiar with the resolution say the secretarygenerals own 
language carries considerable weight and will be difficult to 
change 
the effective international supervision and control of the 
withdrawal of about 130000 vietnamese troops and effective 
guarantees providing for a pullout 
an interim administering authority or a coalition 
government also bolstered by effective guarantees by the 
international community 
the promotion of national reconciliation among all cambodians 
under the leadership of samdech norodom sihanouk 
a future coalition government is expected to include the three 
cambodian factions fighting the vietnamese as well as the 
vietnameseinstalled government in phnom penh 
asian diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity say china 
is not enthusiastic about the language condemning khmer rouge 
atrocities but it strongly opposes vietnams occupation of 
cambodia and is expected to support the resolution again 
a draft copy of the resolution was provided to the associated 
press by foreign diplomats and the document was expected to be 
formally introduced friday or early next week

moderator margaret warner has a question for you mr vice 
president 
q mr vice president id like to cover a subject that wasnt 
covered in the first debate you have said in this campaign i am 
an environmentalist and described yourself as having zero 
tolerance for polluters and yet your record does seem to suggest 
otherwise 
when you were head of the presidents task force of regulatory 
relief you did urge epa to relax regulations involving the 
elimination of lead from gasoline i believe you urged suspension 
of rules requiring industries to treat toxic wastes before 
discharging them in sewers and your group also urged osha to 
weaken the regulations requiring that workers be informed of 
dangerous chemicals at the worksite 
finally i believe you did support the presidents veto of the 
clean water act and my question is arent you how do you 
square your campaign rhetoric with this record 
bush ninety percent reductions in lead since i chaired that 
regulatory task force ninety percent its all do you 
remember that expression get the lead out its almost 
out almost gone clean water im for clean water but what 
im not for what im not for is measuring it the way the 
democratic congress does 
we sent up a good bill on clean water a sound bill on clean 
water but the only way you can express your love for clean water 
is to double the appropriations for clean water and then rant 
against the deficit i am for clean water ive been an outdoorsman 
and a sportsman all my life ive been to these national parks i 
led for the earlwallop bill or what formerly dingelljohnson i 
headed the task force when i was a member of the congress way back 
in the late 60s on these kinds of things on the republican side i 
led for that and so i refuse to to measure ones commitment as 
to whether youre going to double the spending that is the same 
old argument thatd gotten us into the trouble on the deficit side 
so ill just keep saying i am one im not going to go down 
there and try to dump the sludge from massachussetts off the 
beaches off of new jersey boos from the audience im not 
going to do that that boo was excessively loud can you add five 
seconds bernie out of fairness come on give me five i mean 
this guy this is too much down there 
but im not gonna do that i am an evironmentalist i believe in 
our parks i believe in the presidents commission on outdoors and 
ill do a good job because i am committed 
moderator governor dukakis you have one minute to respond 
dukakis bernard im not sure i can get all of this in in one 
minute george we have supply management today under the 1985 
bill its called set asides secondly if you were so opposed 
to the grain embargo why did you ask the godfather of the grain 
embargo to be one of your top foreign policy advisors 
im against the grain embargo it was a mistake im also 
against the pipeline embargo which you folks attempted to impose 
that was a mistake as well and cost thousands of jobs for american 
workers in the midwest and all over the united states of america 
margaret once again i dont know which george bush im talking 
about here or looking at the george bush who was a charter 
member of the environmental wrecking crew that went to washington 
in the early 80s and did a job on the epa or the one weve been 
seeing and listening to the past two or three months but let me 
say this because he spent millions and millions of dollars on 
advertising on the subject of boston harbor george boston harbor 
was polluted for 100 years im the first governor to clean it up 
no thanks to you no thanks to you and weve been cleaning it up 
for four years 
moderator governor 
dukakis we passed landmark legislation in 84 no thanks to 
you did everything you could to kill the clean water act and the 
those grants 
moderator governor 
dukakis which make it possible for states and local 
communities to clean up rivers and harbors and streams

q andrea mitchell has a question for you mr vice president 
q mr vice president jimmy carter has called this the worst 
campaign ever richard nixon has called it trivial superficial and 
inane whoever started down this road first of negative 
campaigning the american people from all reports coming to us 
are completely fed up now do you have any solutions to suggest 
is there time left to fix it there are 26 days left for instance 
would you agree to another debate before its all over so that the 
american people so that the american people would have another 
chance before election day to compare you two 
bush no i will not agree to another debate the american 
people are up to here with debates they had 30 of them we had 7 
of them now we got three of them i am going to carry this 
election debate all across this country in the last whatever 
remains of the last threeandahalf weeks or whatever we have and 
the answer is no i am not going to have any more debates we dont 
need any more debates ive spelled out my position 
in terms of negative campaigning you know i dont want to 
sound like a kid in a schoolyard he started it but take a 
look at the democratic convention take a look at it do you 
remember the senator from boston chanting out there and the 
ridicule factor from that lady from texas that was on there i 
mean come on this was just outrageous but ill try harder to 
keep it on a high plane 
but let me let me if you could accept a little criticism i 
went all across central illinois and spoke about agricultural 
issues in about seven stops we had some fun crystal gayle and 
loretta lynn with us and they got up and sang we went to little 
towns and i talked agriculture and not one thing did i see with 
respect on your network about my views on agriculture and not one 
did i read in any newspaper why cause youre so interested in a 
poll that might have been coming out or because somebody had said 
something nasty about somebody else 
and so i dont know what the answer is i dont somebody hit 
me and said barry goldwater said you ought to talk on the issues 
more how can barry goldwater sitting in arizona know whether im 
talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after 
position paper he puts out position paper after position paper 
and we see this much about it because everyone else is fascinated 
with polls and whos up or down today and whos going to be up or 
down tomorrow 
so i think we can all share with respect in the fact that 
maybe these the message is not getting out but its not getting 
out because theyre too few debates there will be no more debates 
q governor dukakis you have one minute to respond sir 
dukakis well i can understand after the vice presidential 
debate why mr bush would want no more debates boos thats my 
five seconds george andrea i think we both have a responsibility 
to try to address the issues 
yes we have fundamental differences i think a great many of 
them have come out today and i think if we get rid of the labels 
and im not keeping count but i think mr bush has used the 
label liberal at least 10 times if i had a dollar george for 
every time you used that label id qualify for one of those tax 
breaks for the rich that you want to give away 
isnt that the point most americans believe in basic values we 
have differences about how to achieve them i want to move forward 
i want this nation to move forward im concerned about the fact 
that 10 percent of our manufacturing and 20 percent of our banking 
and nearly half of the real estate in the city of los angeles are 
in the hands of foreign investors im concerned about what that 
does to our future im concerned about the fact that so many of 
our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these 
massive deficits but those are the issues on which we ought to be 
debating and 
q governor 
dukakis if wed just put away the flag factories and the 
balloons and those kinds of things and get on to a real discussion 
of these issues i think well 
q andrea 
dukakis have a good 26 days

in the 1930s before she turned to large 
theatrical dances choreographer martha graham rooted her work in 
indian material from the us southwest 
at 94 she has returned to american indians for her 178th dance 
creation 
night chant had its premiere thursday night by the martha 
graham dance company at the city center 
the music was traditional navajo forms arranged by r carlos 
nakai melodies carried by what sounded like wooden flutes and 
reed instruments were beautiful and not melancholy even when the 
dance led one to expect that 
the dance is in ritual form and sustains a viewers interest 
when a line of men or a line of women dance across the stage they 
repeat the same pattern of steps the next time they use a 
different pattern but also repeat it all the way across 
denise vale was the central figure standing at first in front 
of a tall structure which looked like a metal cactus without 
spikes designed by isamu noguchi she lifted a tambourine which 
she hit a few times then hung on a hook on the cactus 
from time to time she bowed to it as though it were the moon 
side lighting by david finley makes it look like moonlight though 
none of the dancers looked indian the dance strongly evoked an 
outdoor nighttime american indian scene 
one section has four men with long poles flexing them over the 
head of a fifth man he dances and falls injured finally is 
killed then carried out this isnt what the entire dance 
leads up to as in the rite of spring 
three couples who have danced together before dance together 
again after that scene miss vale is partnered briefly by peter 
london the 20minute dance ends with miss vale pounding the 
tambourine with her hand 
the evening also included miss grahams diversion of angels 
errand into the maze and appalachian spring

today is seven hundredths of a second 
longer than a day in the year 1876 bc say scientists who studied 
ancient chinese records of solar eclipses to learn how much earths 
rotation is slowing 
just as a spinning ice skater slows down by extending her arms 
earths rotation on its axis slows as tidal interactions make the 
moon orbit earth more quickly and become more distant from the 
planet astronomer kevin pang of nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
said wednesday 
four billion years ago the moon was only onethird as far 
away as it is now and the day was only eight hours long at the 
time said pang whose study will be published soon in the 
british journal vistas in astronomy 
pang and his coauthors determined that compared to today the 
length of a day was 22 thousandths of second shorter in ad 532 
42 thousandths of a second shorter in 899 bc and 70 thousandths 
of a second shorter in 1876 bc

an ad for the staid victoria and albert museum 
shows a white mug behind an odd black pot from its collection 
underneath it says theres nothing wrong with modern art that a 
good cup of tea wont cure 
the museum reports better attendance in the three months since 
launching a series of flip sometimes slangy ads such as these the 
vampa an ace caff cafeteria with quite a nice museum attached 
they all say 
like other museums facing increased competition for visitors and 
cash the v and a is discovering how to sell itself 
these citadels of art science and history are hiring marketing 
professionals introducing admission fees and courting corporate 
sponsorship the v and a named a gallery after toshiba corp while 
the natural history museum leases its scientists as consultants 
for national museums especially those with a tradition of free 
admission and fat government support the shakeup is dictated by 
the entreprenurial spirit of prime minister margaret thatcher who 
believes culture should help pay its own way 
the private museums association britains professional museum 
body recently devoted its annual meeting to marketing 
its a very radical reappraisal of what the museum is in 
business to do says graeme farnell director general of the 
association there is some concern about increasing the 
commercial slant fundamentally its a concern about integrity 
the venerable 235yearold british museum feels even more 
strongly 
there is a point where its possible to ask the question have 
we gone so far down a road that we are no longer a museum 
says deputy director jean rankine 
however critics say the ad campaign is a disgrace and that the 
museum is more interested in attendance than the art experience 
museums say the crunch stems mainly from rising costs and 
shrinking government funding 
under a new government system fixing grants three years in 
advance the natural history museums subsidy will decline from 
368 million this fiscal year to 363 million in 199091 
after the natural history museums 266 million 19867 grant 
left it more than 21 million short it threatened to close 
galleries trim staff or charge admission it began charging 340 
per adult in 1987 
the statefunded museums and galleries commission in a survey 
of national museums said the financial strain was already 
noticeable in closed galleries reduced security curtailed 
opening hours or days backlogs of work and less good service 
to the public 
competition adds to the woes with 35 to 40 new museums opening 
each year and vying for the mere 25 percent of the british who 
visit museums compared with an estimated 60 percent of the us 
public 
its not just museums were competing with all sorts of 
claims on peoples times says charles mills the recently hired 
first marketing manager at the 136yearold v and a the nations 
eclectic museum of art and design whose exhibits range from 17th 
century waistcoats to chinese porcelain 
after years of shutting one day a week to save money the v and 
a began asking for donations in 1985 
although the fee is voluntary visitors are led through toll 
boothlike gates that exert psychological pressure on them to pay 
some were so outraged that they wore buttons boasting i 
didnt pay at the v and a and attendance fell by more than 40 
percent in two years from 2 million in 1985 to 14 million last 
year 
attendance is recovering and entrance fees will cover about 4 
percent of the museums estimated 243 million in running costs 
mills says 
the natural history museum which hired a marketing manager this 
year has also suffered a 40 percent fall in attendance since 
instituting 2pound 342 charges last year 
the museum now sees signs of a recovery and expects to raise 
334000 from sales of scientific research in the next year 
the national museums have also explored more corporate 
sponsorships and social events including the british museum home 
of the fabled egyptian mummy collection 
still while the museum has spent 101 million on upgrading its 
cafeteria it draws the line at charging visitors 
we are not a product to be marketed says public services 
director geoffrey house 
neil cossons director of the science museum warns that fear of 
commercialism will ultimately hurt museums 
the reluctance on the part of many museums even to contemplate 
alternative frameworks of funding and management represents perhaps 
the greatest threat to their integrity the quality of their care 
and the professional standing of their staffs he wrote in may in 
the sunday times 
cossons who started the trend by instituting charges at the 
national maritime museum in 1984 wrote the future of our 
museums is at stake the battlefield will be the marketplace and 
the casualties will be those museums that fail to appreciate the 
public no longer lives in the 19th century 
the science museum will begin charging visitors two pounds in 
october

americans generally are richer with more money 
to spend on extras but theyre giving a smaller proportion of it 
to their churches 
thats the central finding of a broad study comparing real 
income gains adjusted for inflation and taxes with changes in 
church contributions over a 17year period 
for the first time in history says researcher sylvia 
ronsvalle the majority of people in the us have discretionary 
income beyond basic needs however church giving has not 
reflected this newly available money 
much of it goes into the leisure industry which soaks up 12 
percent of the average americans income with billions spent on 
cut flowers pets lawns and microwave popcorn the report says 
its apparently difficult to convince most church members that 
meeting domestic and world needs in jesus name is as satisfying 
as taking a beloved pet to a doggie restaurant or even buying cut 
flowers it says however as a starting point we ought to be 
able to portray increased stewardship as exciting as microwave 
popcorn and grow from there 
the study by empty tomb inc a nonprofit research and 
service organization in champaign ill under a grant from the 
lilly endowment inc offers comparative data from 31 protestant 
denominations and roman catholicism 
it found that protestants in 1968 gave an average of 305 
percent of their aftertax income to churches that shrank to 279 
percent by 1985 
nevertheless the average per capita amount given in terms of 
constant 1982 dollars was up from 247 in 1968 to 296 in 1985 
among evangelical denominations the latest per capita was slightly 
more 306 
among catholics average per capita giving declined from an 
average 232 in 1963 to 151 in 1985 from 34 percent to 14 
percent of income 
however disposable income increased 103 percent or 2511 per 
capita between 1968 and 1985 the report says average 
contributions rose 49 per capita in that period only 2 percent of 
the new income 
for protestants that meant that total contributions and per 
capita giving for the 31 denominations both were up but in view of 
the greater income the proportion given to churches was less 
although people have more money people are not choosing to 
give a larger percentage of their income to the church the 
report says in a time when leisure industries have been born and 
have expanded rapidly the church has remained a nogrowth entity 
beginning with 1950 a majority of americans have had a 
dramatically increasing amount of discretionary income the report 
says while advertising boosted demand for all sorts of extras 
as a result it says lifestyle expectations have outdistanced 
the increasing incomes and church giving has not kept pace 
with the increase in available money 
yet church stewardship sits in the context of a world with 
dire needs no longer removed from the church member mass 
communications has brought lazarus not only to our doorstep but 
into our living rooms 
to help balance the spending scales the report suggests the 
church might take a lesson from the successful leisure 
industry adding 
church programs should take a more aggressive attitude in 
effectively competing for the increased discretionary dollar of 
their members just like marketing fast food or swimming pools as 
necessities giving ought to be reinterpreted into that 
category

to charles kuralt the charm of being on the 
road is that its such a little deal 
i just send back stories from the road about people i 
admire he said all these years cbs has let me do what i like 
i was in a little town in illinois where everyone has his name on a 
coffee cup down at the drug store when someone dies the cup comes 
down 
can you imagine that story being on the cbs evening news 
nobody makes a big deal about what i do thats the charm of 
it 
kuralt who has been doing little stories for cbs since 1967 is 
in good company charles dickens rudyard kipling and mark twain 
all took to the road and sent back little stories 
his latest journey into prime time is the onehour special 
back on the road with charles kuralt which cbs will telecast 
friday it takes him from duncan city ga to moscow the one in 
the soviet union 
with kuralt its necessary to distinguish between the soviets 
moscow and the smalltown moscows in idaho kansas missouri ohio 
pennsylvania and tennessee 
kuralt was in moscow for the summit when a burly old man bullied 
his way into his hotel and asked to speak to an american reporter 
his name was dr nikita zakaravich asseyev and he had been waiting 
43 years to tell his story 
his chest was covered with war medals and he intimidated the 
kgb men guarding the hotel kuralt said he told me he had been 
in a german prisoner of war camp in world war ii the russian 
prisoners were starving to death until american prisoners in 
another part of the camp began throwing their red cross food 
parcels over the fence 
dr asseyev had never forgotten the americans he had their 
names and he wanted to thank them for saving lives 
in the show kuralt talks to asseyev and then looks up the 
americans that the russian had remembered for so many years he 
found dr sidney brockman in san diego and william jarema a 
retired new york city police officer 
kuralts travels began in october 1967 when he persuaded cbs 
news to let him take a threemonth trial run he headed first for 
new england where he did a piece on the autumn leaves that was a 
revolutionary idea for the network news and gave kuralt the courage 
to do the hundreds of little stories that followed his reports 
have won two emmys two george foster peabody awards and a 
christopher award 
it helps if youre fat and bald said kuralt people look 
at me and say if that guy can be on tv so can i it helps put 
people at ease we dont come on like a bigtime television crew 
we keep it very low key i dont even appear in many of the 
stories 
kuralts cameraman is isadore bleckman his soundman is larry 
gianneschi jr and his coproducer is bernard birnbaum 
one rule that kuralt follows is that he never rides the 
tricycle 
we were watching a reporter cover a tricycle race for a local 
news show he said it was a good story until the end the 
newsman got on a tricycle and rode it it ruined the whole story 
kuralt says his trips on americas backroads have given him a 
different view of the country than one would get in the seats of 
power 
i have a much more sanguine view than you would get from 
reading the newspapers he said i think the country is in good 
shape i think things have changed for the better since i first 
went on the road i see candidates running for office as 
environmentalists twenty years ago no one would have dared to call 
himself an environmentalist people are much more aware and 
caring 
kuralt said his family grew used to his absences during his 
earlier years as a news correspondent in south america and los 
angeles 
when i was a little boy my dad had a traveling job he said 
i think thats where i got it my mother was a school teacher and 
my father was a social worker i used to go with him on his visits 
around north carolina 
these days he flies back to new york every weekend for his 
duties as host of cbs sunday morning

when marguerite chandler a successful 
businesswoman in new jersey tried to persuade her community last 
year to build a shelter for the homeless she says she hit a 
brick wall 
she was arguing the morality of the issue but for the county 
board it was purely a political decision chandler said 
so she set out to learn the rules of the game of politics 
now she and 25 other students have earned diplomas from the 
graduate school of political management the inaugural class at 
what bills itself as the nations first degree program in 
professional politics 
the schools dean christopher arterton says there has been a 
tremendous commercialization of politics and a transfer of 
power from party elites to people whose services can be bought 
and just as mba programs sprang up to train legions of recruits 
for the tough new world of business the politics school hopes to 
turn out the campaign consultants and lobbyists of the future 
why promote myths says neil fabricant the schools 
president and principal founder the new politics is something we 
have to live with 
but does america need a graduate school devoted to teaching 
future politicians and lobbyists how to conduct and read polls how 
to design and produce a tv commercial how to raise the money 
i would have given anything to learn from the pros says 
george bushs campaign manager lee atwater he plans to teach at 
the school in some capacity after the nov 8 election 
this falls class includes two actors a prosthodontist and a 
former member of parliament from an eastern caribbean island who 
wants to put his degree to use back home 
classes are held at baruch college in lower manhattan but the 
school which is chartered by the new york state board of regents 
is not affiliated with any institution 
tuition is 13200 for the oneyear fulltime program 16200 
if you stretch it out over two years 
the faculty consists mainly of political entrepreneurs such as 
douglas bailey a onetime consultant to former president gerald 
ford 
efforts are made to be nonpartisan say students and 
administrators guest lecturers have included union leaders and 
political activists from such groups as the national righttolife 
organization 
contacts the students make through the school are considered a 
strong selling point the networking alone would have been worth 
the money said chandler 
the school hopes make accessible to more people the political 
technology which is now a condition of participating in political 
life fabricant said 
of the 30 students in this falls incoming class 10 are women 
five are black and two are hispanic the school advertises in 
minorityoriented newspapers and offers scholarships to minority 
students fabricant said most students receive some financial aid 
mainly in the form of loans 
school officials say its goals include raising the moral level 
of politics by focusing on professional responsibility 
no professional ethic ever emerges out of the profession 
itself you need a professional school especially in this area 
because you cant bar anyone from participating in 
politics fabricant said it cant be a licensed activity 
unlike medicine or law 
still teaching ethics can be difficult in a school for politics 
in a recent lobbying i class instructor william polf a 
lobbyist for columbia university conceded that his own profession 
really has a pretty bad name 
but the students in the room nodded as polf drew a line on the 
chalkboard to represent the division between special interests and 
government and said what any good lobbyist hopes to do is erase 
this line and ultimately make your interests so integrated that 
they think youre part of the process 
the new republic attacked the school in a july cover story 
titled the school for sleazeballs training americas future 
influencepeddlers media manipulators and political hacks 
professionalism according to the article is the means 
by which professionals achieve maximum income with minimum 
accountability 
but marty linsky a professor at harvard universitys kennedy 
school of government says politics has always been a mix of 
motives 
whether the school proves to have a positive or negative 
influence depends on how its curriculum develops he said if the 
school didnt teach them why to use political skills as well as 
how it would be missing part of the education he said 
the students motives for enrolling and their future aims are as 
diverse as their backgrounds 
chandler 45 heads an industrial park corporation and has a 
history of social involvement she plans to continue her community 
work and also possibly help a woman friend run for governor of new 
jersey next year 
one student who came from the university of houston law center 
joined michael dukakis presidential campaign as a legal adviser 
another helped run a successful ballot campaign this year against 
legalized gambling in detroit and still another is going to work 
for a lobbying firm on behalf of nuclear power 
i may run for a school board someday says student carmella 
mazzotta 35 who as a child dreamed of being mayor of her hometown 
of utica ny 
the program gave her time she says to reflect on ethical 
questions that she didnt have time to consider while working in 
the real world 
im leaving this program and im really questioning 
everything she said

while americans may never underestimate the 
verbal ingenuity of politicians they had better be prepared for 
the acrobatics of taxes that arent taxes 
tax is a bad word not only does it cost votes but it leads 
directly to other uunpleasant images including overspending 
bureaucracy waste pork barrel and favoritism 
but it is a very necessary word too since the very candidates 
for office who rail against taxes would hardly know what to do 
without them since most of their proposals involve expenditures of 
some sort 
be prepared therefore for more user fees revenue enhancers 
mandated benefits earmarking and other techniques for squeezing 
more out of the private sector without recourse to the nasty t word 
it already is happening those frenzied debates over postal 
rates for instance have been cooled by turning over the increases 
to a semiprivate entity where actions are much better shielded 
from public attention 
earmarking or special levies on special groups for special 
purposes is likely to become common in fact john hanly adams of 
the tax foundation suggests it will become a highly practiced art 
if voters dont cry out 
such tax boosts often can be hidden behind the name of a 
program he says thus a tax increase on parents to finance child 
care should be called an education premium he says and 
national health insurance seriously discussed lately could be 
financed with premiums similar to those on medicare 
the technique of mandated benefits would shift from government 
onto employers certain new services that once might have required a 
tax increase health insurance for parttime workers and 
dependents for example 
revenue enhancers already being employed take various forms 
user fees such as charges paid by users of coast guard services 
is one example 
another is to charge for forms used in meeting federal 
regulations the internal revenue service for instance charges 
fees for private rulings on tax questions including computations 
for individuals retirement annuities 
adams cites this revenue enhancer by tightening its procedures 
hiring more auditors carrying more disputes to the courts the irs 
can squeeze more dollars out of taxpayers whether tax rates go up 
or not 
the search for nontax taxes is intense and pervasive adams 
makes this classic observation 
many tax initiatives are conceived in secrecy drafted into 
legislation without public hearings passed with little or no 
debate and then buried in lengthy complex legislation on other 
topics such as trade rules and massive appropriations bills 
what do you think of this nontax tax idea now floating around 
congress index federal excise taxes on gasoline and other products 
so they could rise automatically and without publicity 
one of the goals of such ideas of course is to give the 
appearance of stable taxes while simultaneously raising them it is 
a politically ingenious idea since it gets everyone off the hook 
except the taxpayer

as more latin american nations shake 
off military rule and turn to democratic government foreign 
campaign consultants nearly all of them from the united states 
increasingly become a fixture in elections 
latin politicians say the advisers are most valuable for 
bringing an outsiders perspective on the candidate and on what 
voters want they also provide techniques to link the candidate to 
the voters desires 
us consultant david garth came to venezuela in 1978 to help 
presidential candidate luis herrera campins his first suggestion 
was that the famously fat politician lose weight 
herrera a social christian who felt his girth was an integral 
part of his popular image rejected garths advice 
when youre campaigning venezuelans will always offer you 
food and drink the stillcorpulent herrera recalled recently 
the only way you can refuse without losing a vote is to say 
somewhat mysteriously that youre taking pills and theyll think 
you have a venereal disease or something 
garth lost the battle to slim down his candidate he chose 
instead to capitalize on herreras communications skills in eight 
memorable commercials filmed outdoors featuring the candidate 
speaking with disgruntled citizens 
the spots galvanized the campaign and helped herrera defeat the 
social democratic party in a race that was crucial in forging 
venezuelas democracy into a twoparty system 
us pollsters media specialists and general advisers have also 
helped the winning presidential campaigns of carlos andres perez 
and jaime lusinchi in venezuela oscar arias sanchez in costa rica 
nicolas ardito barletta in panama alan garcia in peru and others 
besides garth these highpowered campaign consultants have 
included joseph napolitan david sawyer matthew reese robert 
squier and sergio bendixen 
sometimes candidates ignore the advice of their hired guns from 
the north at their own peril 
in the 1987 presidential nomination race in venezuela social 
democratic hopeful octavio lepage ignored his consultants advice 
to stay in his key government post rather than quit to campaign in 
the streets 
lepage a dry partyline politician with no popular appeal lost 
the nomination to carlos andres perez a charismatic former 
president who has no trouble gathering large and noisy crowds 
but the us consultants must also adapt in latin america as 
in europe political parties are much stronger than they are in the 
united states and party loyalty is the norm 
us consultants advice can get lost in the shuffle as party 
leaders struggle for influence in the campaign which is seen as 
collective rather than an individual bid 
latin american candidates who are almost always men prefer a 
political message that emphasizes strength and machismo 
while television is growing in importance as a political tool in 
latin america the oldfashioned campaign rally which has fallen 
from favor in the united states is still a powerful technique 
latin americans have resisted using direct mail or telephone 
campaign operations mainly because these public services are 
typically inefficient 
even so campaigns have increasingly resembled us contests 
with a variety of imported techniques 
mapping out a strategy choosing one or two short messages that 
are repeated as long as they are effective polling to obtain 
reliable information and relying more heavily on television are 
among the principles that have filtered south 
now the region is developing its own advisers who are pioneering 
their own techniques 
argentinas felipe noguera for instance an oxfordeducated 
mathematician is analyzing at what point a voter chooses a 
candidate 
substituting latin consultants for us ones appeals to latin 
pride and saves money at the same time 
the north americans tend to charge latin american clients the 
same rates as us candidates perhaps 100000 per campaign for a 
general consultant plus additional fees for specialists 
in venezuelas 1978 presidential election estimates of the 
candidates spending ranged up to 120 million in all 
in latin america there are no limits on campaign spending as 
there are in the united states 
as the region has become poorer candidates are less willing to 
spend that amount for a touch of foreign magic especially if 
they can hire quality talent locally 
but if they can afford to hire us consultants they generally 
do 
we began the campaign without foreign advisers and we ended it 
using foreign advisers said rafael montes de oca herreras 
former campaign manager they were indispensible because of their 
knowledge of the media and of the techniques to find out what 
people think

scotland has suffered another blow to 
its sense of separate identity the english have overrun its 
cultural establishment 
ever since 1707 when scotland and england were united under one 
crown and parliament scots have worried about being swamped by 
their english neighbors who outnumber them 111 
comes now the englishing of scotland broadcast aug 29 on 
the independent scottish television channel which shows the 
command posts of scottish culture firmly in the hands of sassenachs 
from south of the border 
not the artists mind native scottish creativity has never 
looked healthier what worries guardians of scottish identity is 
the preponderance of englishmen in a cultural bureaucracy supposed 
to be separate 
the englishing of scottish life is a process that has gone on 
for many years but many scots feel it is beginning to 
undermine the very notion of scotland george rosie the writer 
and host said in introducing the program 
rosie presented impressive of evidence of nonscot 
infiltration the nonscots being almost invariably from england 
nonscots run most of scotlands major statesubsidized arts 
institutions the national museums national galleries national 
library arts council scottish opera scottish ballet its three 
major international arts festivals and the scottish national trust 
for heritage parks and buildings 
they run five of the eight universities 10 of the 15 
governmentfunded colleges and three of the six leading theaters 
we are assimilating ourselves toward an english ideal and 
gradually i think we will assimilate ourselves out of existence 
billy kay a playwright historian and scottish nationalist said 
on the program 
paul scott a retired diplomat said i think were at very 
grave risk of ceasing to exist as a recognizable nation as a 
recognizable culture and identity the species is under threat 
while everyone saw a problem there was little agreement on the 
cause 
newspaper columnist neal ascherson said most of the institutions 
mentioned were recent creations copied from england 
the idea of cultural bureaucracies is entirely alien to 
scotland he said this is not a country which has 
traditionally been kind to the arts 
some said scots were reluctant to protest englishing for 
fear of sounding racist alan lawson editor of the leftwing 
journal radical scotland said this fear had deprived scots of 
the confidence to stand up and argue that there is a problem 
allan massie a conservative writer offered simple arithmetic 
because of the population ratio if you have a job that is 
publicly advertised and you have 10 applicants youre quite likely 
to find that seven of them come from outside scotland 
timothy clifford an englishman who heads the national gallery 
of scotland called the program absolute arrant nonsense 
he said just as many scots run english institutions but rosie 
reported no scots among 34 university heads in england and wales 
and said only two of the 21 statefunded museums art galleries and 
libraries south of the border were run by scots 
clifford argued that an englishman sometimes understands more 
and can better identify the scottishness of something than a scot 
can the program too paid tribute to the many nonscots who 
have fostered scottish art forms the scots themselves had neglected 
overall however rosies presentation painted a gloomy portrait 
of a culture hijacked by outsiders it inspired a deluge of 
commentary and letters that complained of englishing in 
everything from soccer through architecture to the englishisms 
creeping into everyday speech in scotland 
the advisory council for the arts in scotland weighed in with 
worry about the survival of scotland as anything more than a 
geographical expression 
rosie said the letters ran 82 in support of his conclusions 
which are that certain jobs should be reserved for people who are 
educated and brought up in scotland and understand the nuances of 
scottish culture 
he acknowledges the impossibility of barring englishmen from 
jobs in scotland since both are part of britain but added in an 
interview its similarly daft that so many such jobs are being 
taken by nonscots thats the ambivalence of our whole 
constitutional situation 
the broadcast coincides with a broadly based campaign for 
limited independence that is gathering support in scotland 
there does seem to be a fairly stronger feeling of nationalism 
again rosie said i think scots have a pendulum consciousness 
that swings from feeling british to feeling scottish and in my 
opinion its swinging toward scottishness now

israels election is focused on whether to keep 
the west bank and gaza strip as a buffer to hostile arab states or 
trade away the land to preserve the jewish character of israel 
israelis seem almost evenly split on the issue and the nov 1 
vote may be less a watershed than another shotgun wedding between 
the rightist likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir and the 
leftleaning labor party of foreign minister shimon peres 
shamir and peres have been reluctantly sharing power since the 
1984 elections resulted in a stalemate the unlikely coalition has 
hung together despite basic policy differences 
interest is high in this years election and about 80 percent of 
the 24 million eligible voters are expected to cast ballots 
israels belated debate on the future of the west bank and gaza 
captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war was largely sparked 
by the 10monthold palestinian uprising in which more than 290 
palestinians and six israelis have been killed 
the two large parties have summoned generals out of retirement 
to appear in tv ads and bolster their arguments over whether israel 
can risk yielding the territory to arab control 
the distance from jordan to jerusalem is about 12 miles 
warns likuds yehoshua saguy a former head of military 
intelligence 
standing on heights overlooking jerusalem saguy points down a 
road once used by iraqi tanks the message is simple we cannot 
leave these hills this is the security of the coastal plain 
where twothirds of israels 42 million people live 
maj gen ori orr exwest bank commander is shown driving 
through nablus the largest city in the west bank and a focus of 
the palestinian rebellion he suggests that controlling a hostile 
population is unworkable and rejects likuds argument that more 
force is the answer 
whoever promises to end the intefadeh arabic for uprising 
with military means is mistaken the solution to this problem is 
political he says 
peres supports arab calls for an international conference on 
middle east peace and labor leaders have suggested they would be 
willing to talk with the palestine liberation organization viewed 
by israel as a terrorist group if the plo abandons armed attacks 
and recognizes israels right to exist 
peres argues that if israel annexes the 2266 square miles of 
land occupied in 1967 as some rightwing politicians have 
demanded an arab majority will emerge and destroy the jewish 
character of the country 
shamirs peace program rules out territorial concessions to the 
arabs talks with the plo or an international conference he 
advocates negotiations on the basis of the camp david autonomy plan 
embodied in israels peace treaty with egypt 
yaakov ezrachi of the laboraligned decima poll said voters 
appear prepared to give up territory but want guarantees that it 
would work 
the voter is confused he wants peace but he doesnt believe 
the arabs ezrachi told reporters 
bethanie horowitz also of decima said initial reaction to the 
intefadeh was a sharp swing to the right but she predicted a 
surprise labor victory because a majority has emerged which 
wants to get rid of the burden of occupation 
mina zemach of the likudhired dahaf poll said likud was 
expected to do well among firsttime voters aged 18 to 22 about 10 
percent of total voters she said they were more hawkish 
partly because of their experience as soldiers dealing with rioters 
the polls have shown a neckandneck race with each party able 
to win about 42 seats in the 120seat parliament in 1984 labor 
won 44 and likud won 41 seats twentyeight parties are fielding 
candidates and about half are likely to win a place in the 
parliament 
likud appears to have the advantage in forming a coalition the 
form of government that had run israel since its founding because 
likud has a better rapport with the small religious parties which 
are expected to get 11 or 12 seats 
polls are not entirely reliable because arabs ultraorthodox 
jews kibbutz communal farmers and soldiers currently serving in 
the army are not surveyed said rachel yisraeli of the independent 
modiin ezrachi poll she said slum areas also are underrepresented 
shamir says his party has broader appeal and a more modern 
approach to the economy he portrays labor as speaking for european 
jews and the outmoded ideas of israels socialist founders 
labor represents a certain class we care about all groups 
he said in an interview during a campaign stop in kfar sava near 
tel aviv the concept of labor belongs to the past it belongs to 
east europe at the beginning of the century 
labor efforts appear centered on sephardim or jews whose 
families originated from north africa and the middle east they 
make up about 55 percent of israels 21 million voters and their 
surge to the likud in 1977 ended 29 years of labor government 
labor strategists have defined the undecided or floating 
voter as being aged 30 to 50 of sephardic origin with a 
highschool education and aboveaverage income 
david elazar a political analyst for the jerusalem center for 
public affairs told reporters that likud got about 70 percent of 
the sephardic vote in 1984 but would get less this time 
labor has been trying hard to change its image as an 
establishment party dominated by ashkenazi jews of european origin 
party officials note that for the first time there is a large 
sephardic representation on the partys list of candidates with 16 
sephardim having a chance at getting into parliament 
one labor tv ad featured ely dayan the moroccanborn mayor of 
ashkelon who complained that roads in the negev desert went 
unrepaired while likud governments squandered money on developing 
the west bank 
peres has concentrated his personal campaign in lowincome 
districts with heavy concentrations of sephardic jews but the 
reception has often been hostile 
on a recent walking tour of the openair market of ramle 12 
miles east of tel aviv scores of young sephardic jews jostled and 
booed peres taunting him with chants of go home traitor 
and plo the next day peres was sprayed with water in beit 
shemesh also a predominantly sephardic area

speculation that opec may be moving toward an 
agreement to restrain production has sent crude oil futures prices 
past the 14abarrel mark for the first time in two weeks 
analysts said some late buying wednesday was triggered by a 
rumor promptly denied by the state department that the us 
embassy in saudi arabia had been bombed 
the price for the november contract for west texas intermediate 
oil the benchmark us crude climbed 56 cents wednesday to settle 
at 1411 a barrel 
in other trading on the new york mercantile exchange the 
november contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 187 cent to 
settle at 4266 cents a gallon while home heating oil rose 176 
cent to 4084 cents a gallon 
the market has been volatile this week as crude oil prices 
bounced back from last weeks lows of under 1230 a barrel 
reports that several members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries have been producing well in excess of their 
quotas drove prices down to last weeks lows 
but prices have moved higher since then as some traders say 
signs have emerged of a more conciliatory attitude among opec 
members 
there is a growing perception that prices had gotten low 
enough to force opec to do something said peter beutel 
assistant director of the energy group at elders futures inc in 
new york 
earlier this week saudi arabia the worlds largest oil 
exporter reaffirmed it would stick to its production quota if 
other members of opec did 
beutel said the approach of the oct 20 meeting of the opec 
price monitoring and longterm strategy committees was making some 
traders nervous about the risks of agreements they might have 
previously made to sell borrowed oil contracts in expectation that 
prices would fall further 
as speculation about production restraint grows beutel said 
some of those traders are buying contracts to square those 
positions before the committee meetings occur 
he said some traders also believe this weekends meeting of the 
gulf cooperation council which includes four nations that are opec 
members could give the opec members a chance to patch something 
together that could be discussed at the opec price and strategy 
committee meetings 
bob baker senior energy analyst for prudentialbache 
securities said prices also were supported by an american 
petroleum institute report issued after the close of trading 
tuesday that showed crude oil and gasoline supplies fell last week 
he said many analysts were expecting rises 
nauman barakat vice president of energy investment at 
prudential bache said the embassy bombing rumor triggered a late 
price rise because it raised concerns that terrorists could disrupt 
the oil supply from the mideast

donald trumps deal to buy eastern airlines 
profitable northeast air shuttle for 365 million in cash still 
faces the hurdles of government scrutiny and a legal attack by 
easterns unions 
the real estate developer announced the purchase at a joint news 
conference wednesday with texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
who had agreed earlier to sell the threecity shuttle to trump the 
ailing eastern based in miami is a major subsidiary of texas air 
lorenzo said the deal under which the service between new york 
boston and washington would become the trump shuttle is 
expected to be completed by dec 15 he said he did not foresee any 
significant legal or regulatory barriers to the sale 
but easterns militant union leaders said the sale would be the 
death of the airline and vowed a fight to overturn it 
our attorneys and financial consultants will be taking a very 
close look at this one said jack bavis chairman of the pilots 
union at eastern and it wouldnt surprise me if some interested 
members of congress got involved given lorenzos past history of 
wheeling and dealing 
the eastern machinists union indicated it would to seek a 
federal court order against the shuttle sale 
in washington attorney joseph guerrieri representing the 
machinists said he planned to file later this week a request for 
the us district court in washington to grant an injunction 
against the sale 
earlier this year the eastern unions successfully blocked in 
the courts lorenzos attempt to transfer the shuttle operation from 
eastern to a new texas air subsidiary for 225 million 
besides the new court challenge threatened by the unions the 
sale to trump also must be approved by the department of 
transportation which could take from 60 to 90 days 
the department is not expected to have any concerns about the 
sale on antitrust grounds according to a dot official in 
washington who asked not to be identified by name 
trump now operates a helicopter service trump air between new 
york and atlantic city nj where he owns three hotelcasinos 
the operation is too small to raise antitrust concerns if combined 
with the shuttle the official said in an interview 
trump still must get a new operating certificate for the shuttle 
from the federal aviation administration because some of the 
shuttles personnel may be changed and the new employees may have 
different training backgrounds the dot official said 
the dot also judge the new owners fitness to operate the 
shuttle examining the managerial and technical ability of trump 
and his senior managers trumps financial posture and the 
likelihood he will comply with safety regulations and other rules 
but trump doesnt all of a sudden have to become an airline 
expert said robert joedicke an industry analyst for the 
investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
trump said wednesday he had named bruce r nobles who formerly 
ran pan am corps rival shuttle service as president of the trump 
shuttle nobles has been working at continental airlines the other 
big texas air subsidiary 
trump and lorenzo said the shuttle would maintain fares 
competitive with the pan am service and would not lay off any 
employees the 365 million price tag includes landing rights at 
airports in the three shuttle cities plus 17 boeing 727s 
the bluesilver eastern aircraft will be redecorated and 
emblazoned with red black and gold stripes and will carry the 
word trump on their tails

donald trumps purchase of the 
eastern airlines shuttle is prompting speculation and hope among 
local officials that this seaside resort where trump owns three 
casinos might be a big beneficiary of the deal 
trump would not say he definitely plans to use the shuttle to 
bring gamblers to atlantic city but said wednesday that its 
something that were looking at 
right now atlantic city gets most of its 30 million annual 
visitors by car and bus from cities several hours away 
we have an airport capable of handling the concorde gerald 
greenberg president of the atlantic city hotelmotel association 
said wednesday and it certainly has the potential to handle 
trumps shuttle 
we need more air service to atlantic city more people coming 
from distant markets greenberg said 
trump announced wednesday he would pay 365 million in cash to 
buy the shuttle from eastern a major subsidiary of texas air corp 
the shuttle which will be refurbished and renamed the trump 
shuttle is a profitable carrier serving boston new york and 
washington 
trump said the possibility of using the fleets 17 boeing 727s 
for shuttle service during the week and for atlantic city junkets 
on weekends was an interesting concept 
marvin b roffman an analyst with the philadelphia investment 
firm janney montgomery scott inc said the deal does not revolve 
around atlantic city hes buying the shuttle because it makes good 
business sense 
but it fits into atlantic city definitely in the next couple 
of years roffman said right now there are a limited number of 
hotel rooms in atlantic city but after trump gets the taj mahal 
casino hotel built then hell have 2250 rooms in his three 
hotels 
so im sure hed like to fly in at least 15000 to 20000 
people a month 
atlantic city airport located about 10 miles outside of the 
city is underused by most standards a longstanding political 
dispute among atlantic county and community officials over control 
of the airport has delayed plans for a 50 million expansion 
in may some progress was made when usair began offering 
regularly scheduled jet service from its pittsburgh hub to the 
airport which has been used primarily by chartered and commuter 
flights the airline declined to give statistics on its passenger 
traffic into atlantic city 
but before usair charter and commuter flights delivered just 
324000 of the citys 30 million annual visitors by comparison 
58 million of the 152 million visitors who travel to las vegas 
nev annually arrive by plane 
studies indicate that if jet service had been available in 
atlantic city in 1986 300000 more visitors would have flown to 
the resort 
atlantic county spokesman michael crowley said wednesday that 
the county would welcome seeing trump or any other airline bring in 
more flights 
and our interest is not exclusively for the casino industry 
he said were also thinking in terms of the people who live 
right here so they would be able to get air service from their 
hometown airport instead of having to drive to newark or 
philadelphia

steve jobs helped pioneer the personal 
computer and then turned the industry on its head with a whole new 
version of it but the guru of new technology still must prove 
himself 
the big question wednesday as the 33yearold father of the 
apple ii and the macintosh unveiled his new next computer 
workstation was whether jobs ousted three years ago from apple 
computer inc remains an enfant terrible who stumbled on fame and 
fortune 
was he what author lee butcher called an accidental 
millionaire a megalomaniac who ruthlessly capitalized on others 
achievements 
or does he have the entrepreneurial genius capable of creating 
what he calls insanely great new computer products 
the whole story of his computer debut is not so much a story 
in a business sense of its possible success or failure but a part 
of the whole mythbuilding process the media is trying to tell the 
story of whats happening to steve jobs said steve wozniak who 
cofounded apple computer with jobs in 1976 
i hope the media can judge him for qualities other than his 
folkhero image wozniak said he deserves a chance to be let 
off the hook if thats necessary 
separating the myth from the fact of jobs may be impossible 
jobs himself refuses to discuss the character questions that 
have followed him since his muchpublicized dethroning at apple 
and says only that he is interested in the future not the past 
some praise of jobs for the next already is coming in from those 
convinced that his attempts to make developing technology available 
to the widest number of consumers reflects the spirit necessary to 
drive the american computer industry into the 21st century 
i think the next clearly shows that what steve did in the past 
at apple was no fluke said jonathan seybold a leading los 
angelesbased trade publisher 
he is the kind of leader who gets people to achieve what they 
felt they couldnt achieve seybold said 
jobs is touting the next as a super personal computer that gives 
ordinary people the kind of technology previously available only to 
engineers 
but because he has allowed only limited trial use of the 
machine neither the industry nor the marketplace has decided with 
any finality whether his claim is hype or reality 
unless he proves the next offers another revolutionary step in 
computers jobs could join the ranks of other industry pioneers 
whose latest endeavors have failed to have much impact 
public perceptions of jobs may have changed since he was at 
apple in his book accidental millionaire butcher has 
described him as a moody tyrannical abrasive and arrogant boss 
contrary to the widespread public perception of him as an amiable 
somewhat eccentric collegial researcher 
john sculley the former president of the pepsicola division of 
pepsico came to apple in 1983 as its chief executive officer and 
gave jobs greater power than he ever had and i had created a 
monster he wrote in last years bestselling odyssey pepsi to 
apple 
both butcher and sculley have contended that jobs during his 
tenure as head of apples macintosh division almost destroyed 
apple by ignoring the opinions of others berating employees and 
insinuating himself into every decision 
both describe him as charismatic but claim he was lucky not 
talented when it came to his past business successes

a court order temporarily blocking grand 
metropolitan plc from acquiring any interest in pillsbury co also 
blocks pillsbury from making moves that could thwart grand mets 
52 billion takeover bid 
the temporary restraining order issued wednesday by hennepin 
county district court judge thomas carey lasts until oct 27 when 
the judge will hear further arguments in pillsburys lawsuit 
seeking to block the unsolicited 60ashare tender offer by the 
british liquor and hotel conglomerate 
the order temporarily enjoins grand metropolitan from acquiring 
any interest in pillsbury while barring pillsbury from taking any 
action to alter the status quo before the oct 27 hearing 
the judge also scheduled a hearing today to finalize terms of 
the order 
pillsbury sued to block the tender offer on grounds it violates 
state tiedhouse statutes that prevent liquor distillers from 
selling liquor in retail outlets pillsburys retail liquor outlets 
include the fullservice restaurant chains of steak amp ale and 
bennigans 
pillsbury closed up 12 cents at 5687 a share wednesday on 
the new york stock exchange 
the minneapolisbased food and restaurant company is fighting 
the takeover attempt but has not officially responded to the bid 
pillsbury must reject or accept the offer by oct 19 to conform to 
federal securities laws said johnny thompson vice president of 
public relations for pillsbury 
thompson said the order among other things would temporarily 
prevent pillsbury from such actions as making major acquisitions 
allen finkelson chief counsel for grand metropolitan said 
careys ruling was important because it blocks pillsbury from 
taking action that could thwart the deal 
but he also said the order could slow the pace at which market 
professionals buy pillsbury stock for the purposes of tendering it 
to grand met which would lower the stock price and decrease the 
momentum of the takeover bid 
people will become less sure that the offer will become 
sucessful so they dont buy the stock finkelson said 
he added that the full impact of the judges ruling would not be 
known until it is finalized 
finkelson said grand metropolitan already is prohibited by 
federal securities law buying pillsbury shares until its tender 
offer expires on nov 1 the offer could be extended 
larry haeg a pillsbury spokesman said careys ruling 
temporarily maintains the status quo in the relationship between 
pillsbury and grand metropolitan as litigation in 13 other states 
related to the tiedhouse statutes continues grand metropolitan is 
seeking waivers from the laws saying it will immediately sell 
pillsburys liquor retail outlets if the takeover succeeds 
pillsbury had obtained restraining orders in eight states 
blocking grand metropolitan from acquiring pillsbury stock but the 
restraining orders have dissolved in four of those states 
spokesmen for the two companies said 
separately grand metropolitan issued a news release late 
wednesday saying minnesota commerce commissioner michael hatch has 
ruled that the tender offer meets disclosure requirements under the 
states antitakeover law 
under the law hatch has the power to suspend tender offers if 
he determines minnesota shareholders are not provided with enough 
information about the deal

tyson foods inc may have to sweeten its 
891 million buyout offer before memphisbased holly farms corp 
gives in to the bid from its rival poultry processor 
holly farms officials on wednesday would say only that they were 
considering tysons offer of 45 cash and a quarter share of its 
class a common stock for each of holly farms 181 million 
outstanding shares 
tyson of springdale ark is the nations largest poultry 
processor a holly farms buyout would increase tysons market share 
from 18 percent to 28 percent analysts said 
i think holly farms will sell to tyson only as a last 
resort said john m mcmillin an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities in new york 
mcmillin said he valued holly farms at 55 a share or more he 
said the tyson offer amounts to about 4925 a share 
if tyson wants to buy the company hes going to have to pay 
55 mcmillin said 
holly farms stock rose sharply in heavy trading jumping 662 
a share to 4962 in composite new york stock exchange trading 
tyson fell 62 cents a share to 17 in overthecounter trading 
based on wednesdays closing price tysons offer would be worth 
4925 a share or about 8914 million 
holly farms officials could not be reached for comment wednesday 
night 
mcmillin also speculated holly farms alternatively would pursue 
a leveraged buyout by managers who will seek to take the company 
private 
theres a couple of options mcmillin said one is to look 
for a white knight which could potentially be a phillip morris or 
a sara leelook for a company to basically choose who they want 
to get married to 
the other is to pursue a managementled leveraged buyout take 
the company private i think thats what theyre pursuing right 
now mcmillin said 
john lawrence an associate analyst for morgan keegan in 
memphis said he believes holly farms could be bought out by tyson 
at a price in the range of 50 to 55 a share 
hours before tyson announced its offer late tuesday holly farms 
announced it had been approached by an unidentified company 
regarding a possible business combination holly farms said no 
specific proposal had been received and the company did not intend 
to seek one 
the company also said it had activated a shareholder rights 
plan commonly known as a poison pill takeover defense aimed 
at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive 
we havent heard a word we are just waiting on whatever 
decision they are making over there we are standing by bob 
justice of tyson foods said wednesday we do have a timetable of 
oct 19 thats our deadline hopefully they can make a decision 
prior to that and we feel optimistic about a response before 
that 
officials of the two companies met four weeks ago in memphis 
tyson asked for access to nonpublic corporate information from 
holly farms to help determine whether a higher offer was warranted 
tyson which posted sales of about 18 billion last year 
produces 14 million pounds of chicken meat each week from an 
operation that includes hatcheries feed mills processing plants 
and a sophisticated marketing arm the company sells both whole 
chickens and value enhanced products to supermarkets fast food 
chains and institutional customers 
holly farms is a diversified foods company with about 50 
percent of its sales concentrated in chicken the company which 
also mills flour and provides other meats for the food service 
industry had sales of about 16 billion last year

some union leaders and analysts see eastern 
airlines sale of its profitable northeast shuttle to real estate 
developer donald trump as a big step away from independence 
but an eastern spokesman says the company will get a good price 
for the shuttle bringing essential cash to keep eastern viable 
theres no question that within the eastern structure the 
shuttle is certainly the crown jewel robert joedicke airline 
analyst for shearson lehman in new york said wednesday 
obviously theyve been having difficulties at eastern and if you 
take out a highly profitable facet it certainly makes it much 
harder to survive 
robert v callahan former head of the eastern flight attendants 
union was more blunt about the 365 million sale announced 
wednesday by trump and frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
texas air corp 
if it clears all the legal hurdles it signals the end of 
eastern airlines as an independent entity he said referring to 
plans by easterns unions to try to block the sale in the courts 
the proposed sale simply confirms what we have been saying all 
along said jack bavis chairman of the air line pilots 
association local mr lorenzo is only intent on gutting 
easternnot in trying to make it fly 
bavis said he believes the shuttle sale is part of an ultimate 
plan of merging eastern into texas airs continental airlines a 
nonunion carrier 
but eastern spokesman robin matell said the deal absolutely 
does not mean the end of eastern 
if anything it strengthens eastern enormously he said 
matell said eastern would get badly needed cash for paying its 
bills while maintaining marketing relationships and route tieins 
also the shuttle linking new york washington and boston would not 
go to an existing competitor he said 
the shuttle has been easterns most profitable operation but 
matell said it provides only about 4 percent of easterns total 
revenue and therefore should not be considered crucial to its 
survival 
he said eastern would have preferred to keep the shuttle but was 
prevented by the reality of our economics 
easterns unions which have opposed major costcutting moves 
vowed to fight the sale they got the courts to block texas airs 
attempt in february to spin the shuttle off into a new subsidiary 
and lorenzo later dropped the plan 
i dont think anyone should consider this a done deal ron 
cole alpa spokesman said of the sale to trump weve been 
fighting the loss of any eastern assets and were going to keep 
fighting 
the agreement with trump came amid reports lorenzo also has been 
discussing the possible sale of the rest of eastern to carl icahn 
chairman of trans world airlines union sources reported icahn had 
talked with eastern labor representatives about making salary 
concessions 
joedicke the airline analyst said a combination of twa and 
eastern would make good competitive sense because easterns 
strengths in northsouth routes on the east coast and in the 
caribbean and latin america would complement twas routes 
eastern unions have opposed texas airs takeover of eastern 
since it was announced in february 1986 dozens of lawsuits still 
are pending in the courts and the eastern machinists union has 
been in federal mediation over a new contract since january 
texas airs management pointing to easterns 25 billion debt 
and 1 billion in losses over the past decade says the unions must 
cut labor costs by up to 30 percent 
last year easterns computer reservations system was made into 
a separate texas air unit for 100 million to eastern which pays 
some 10 million a month now to texas air to use the system 
according to court testimony eastern also has paid texas air tens 
of millions of dollars in management fees and other costs

walgreen co will not be distracted from its 
aggressive growth plans by the haft familys bid to acquire a stake 
in the nations largest drugstore chain says chairman charles r 
walgreen iii 
the hafts who already are bidding on the food retailer kroger 
co have applied for federal clearance to buy at least 15 million 
of the drug retailers stock walgreen said 
the disclosure came wednesday as walgreen reported a 22 percent 
increase in its fourthquarter net income and a 25 percent profit 
gain during the companys 1988 fiscal year 
walgreen stock rose 125 to 3525 a share in new york stock 
exchange composite trading wednesday 
based on that closing price and walgreens roughly 615 million 
outstanding shares a 15 million investment would give the hafts a 
stake of about sixtenths of 1 percent in walgreen 
the hafts who control dart group corp have a reputation as 
corporate raiders who buy large amounts of stock in companies they 
have ostensibly targeted for takeover and later sell their shares 
back to those companies or other suitors at a hefty profit 
neither the hafts nor landover mdbased dart would comment on 
their plans regarding walgreen which operates more than 1400 
stores in 29 states 
walgreen the companys chairman said the deerfield illbased 
chain would take all actions necessary to protect the company and 
its shareholders 
walgreen co intends to continue the course on which its 
success has been built concentrating on our core business 
growing that business carefully through a program of planned 
expansion and providing our customers with high quality products 
and service the chairman said in a statement 
we will not be distracted from that course 
the walgreen chain has grown by 562 stores in the past five 
years the company said it plans to open another 100 stores in 
fiscal 1989 
the hafts sold their 77store dart discount drugstore chain in 
1984 for 160 million and have said they intend to acquire another 
retailing company 
despite apparent attempts to acquire such chains as federated 
department stores inc may department stores co supermarkets 
general corp dayton hudson corp the hafts have yet to complete 
a takeover 
the hafts have also indicated interest recently in fw 
woolworth co and zayre corp but have not made bids for those 
retailers 
last month dart chairman herbert haft and his son company 
president robert haft offered to buy kroger for about 432 
billion the status of the bid was in doubt after the new york 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts inc withdrew a 503 
billion offer for kroger 
the hafts offered last week to help kroger fight the kohlberg 
bid by proposing to provide additional equity for krogers 
previouslyannounced restructuring 
robert haft reiterated that offer tuesday but declined to 
comment on whether the dart offer for kroger has been withdrawn 
walgreen reported net income of 319 million or 52 cents a 
share on sales of 12 billion for the three months ended aug 31 
for the year ended aug 31 walgreen reported net income of 
1291 million or 210 a share on sales of 49 billion

shamrock holdings inc has increased the 
pressure in its attempt to acquire polaroid corp charging with 
fullpage newspaper advertisements that the instant camera pioneer 
is fanning fear and concern among its employees 
the ads in two boston newspapers follow a sharp exchange between 
the presidents of the two companies in which polaroid rejected 
shamrocks request to meet with stockholders about its 42ashare 
buyout offer 
also wednesday a federal court in delaware held a hearing over 
polaroids lawsuit seeking to block shamrock from acquiring any 
additional shares of the company 
shamrock a burbank califbased television and radio concern 
owned by the roy e disney family was rebuffed in an unsolicited 
takeover bid before making a sweetened hostile offer last month 
valuing polaroid at 26 billion 
its latest offensive came in an ad titled why is polaroids 
president afraid to allow shamrock to meet with polaroid 
employees in the boston globe and the boston herald 
the ad appeared one day after polaroid president i macallister 
booth rebuffed a request by his shamrock counterpart stanley p 
gold to meet with polaroid employees to discuss the takeover bid 
booth responded that polaroid does not as a matter of 
longstanding policy put outside speakers in touch with our 
employees 
gold countered in the ad directed at polaroid employees we 
believe you have the right to hear directly from us as to what we 
have in mind for employees once our acquisition of polaroid is 
completed mr booth is attempting to create fear and concern among 
polaroids work force 
gold told workers they have nothing to fear if shamrock 
acquires polaroid 
at issue is polaroids employee stock ownership plan or esop 
which places 14 percent of company stock in employee hands 
shamrock has refused to recognize the esop and is suing polaroid in 
delawares court of chancery to block it hearings are to begin 
next week 
but polaroids employees committee told its 9700 us workers 
they would meet with gold only if shamrock drops the lawsuit and 
acknowledges employees as the largest stockholders 
the only reason he wants to meet with the employees is to 
convince us what a great guy he is so if he loses the suit he can 
solicit our votes committee chairman nick pasquarosa said 
wed be willing to meet with him but he has to show some good 
faith 
golds ad said shamrock was committed to restoring pay cuts 
imposed on polaroid employees to fund managements illconceived 
attempt to protect its position by sticking 14 percent of 
polaroids stock in a leveraged esop 
employees are paying for the shares with a 5 percent pay cut 
polaroid had to borrow 285 million to fund the 300 million esop 
shamrock also criticized polaroids ongoing restructuring that 
includes layoffs and what it called exaggerated promises for new 
products and diversification efforts 
if it acquires polaroid shamrock has said it would drop 
polaroids fledgling venture into 35mm film sell most of the 
companys undeveloped real property narrow its manufacturing 
facilities and limit research and development to polaroids core 
businesses 
analysts said the court case over the esop would be the major 
determining factor in the takeover battle 
in us district court in wilmington del polaroid asked judge 
caleb wright to issue a temporary injunction against the 
manipulative deceptive and materially false tender offer the 
injunction seeks to stop shamrock from acquiring additional shares 
of polaroid and compel it to divest its current 5 million shares 
attorneys for polaroid maintained shamrock violated securities 
laws because its offer was not extended to all valid shares and 
did not include its investment bankers wertheim schroder amp co 
and drexel burnham lambert inc as cobidders 
polaroid attorney paul saunders said the investment houses would 
obtain 100 million in stock or 21 percent control of polaroid 
for 46 million 
but shamrock lawyer pamela jarvis said the investment bankers 
only brought the deal to shamrocks attention and the 21 percent 
stake was part of a fee arrangement

the dollar dropped today for the third straight 
trading day because of what dealers said was uncertainty over the 
us economy stocks were also lower 
after opening at 12790 yen down from wednesdays close of 
12965 the dollar moved between 12775 yen and 12835 yen it 
closed at 12798 yen down 167 yen it fell a total of 385 yen 
tuesday and wednesday 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the tokyo stock 
exchanges main index lost 13607 points or 050 percent closing 
at 2727330 
dealers said the markets declined because dealers believed the 
us economy is slowing and were wary of us trade figures 
scheduled for release today in washington they also said the 
sudden decline of the dollar in tokyo reflected its overnight fall 
in london and new york 
the market appears to be overreacting a bit but there were 
various elements since last week that could push the dollar down 
said toshikazu kotoge a dealer at yasuda trust bank 
he cited the lowerthanexpected us employment rate of 54 
percent released last week and a growing feeling the us trade 
deficit is worsening 
my impression is that the yens appreciation was somewhat 
too steep japans kyodo news service quoted finance minister 
kiichi miyazawa as saying if the fluctuation is too wide for one 
day it better be tamed down 
but dealers said it was unlikely the dollar would dip below the 
125yen level as traders were likely to start buying at that rate 
the dollars closing today was the lowest since june 22 when it 
closed at 12760 yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange dealers said uncertainty in the 
foreign exchange market made investors already nervous over the 
upcoming us trade figures even more wary 
most exportoriented shares are down reflecting the yens 
sudden appreciation said ichitaro watanabe of nikko securities 
co only very few shares are gaining but the market as a 
whole was very quiet as expected ahead of the release of us trade 
figures 
the volume traded on the first section of the exchange where 
most major shares are listed was a light 400 million shares 
also dealers attributed the market slump to emperor hirohitos 
poor health since he became bedridden sept 19 the nikkei has 
lost 45699 points or 16 percent 
there is no clear logic to the relation between the emperors 
illness and the market said jeff bahrenburg an economist at 
merrill lynch but at least i can say a situation like this 
creates uncertainties and that one of the things market doesnt 
like most

falling oil prices helped boost japans trade 
surplus to 7742 billion in september an increase of 43 percent 
from a year earlier and a massive 569 percent rise from august 
the finance ministry announced thursday 
but japans trade surplus with the united states declined 
falling to 4648 billion from 4860 billion in september 1987 
the government said 
japans exports during september rose 136 percent from a year 
earlier to 23118 billion while imports increased 189 percent to 
15376 billion the ministry said 
in august japans trade surplus registered 4935 billion 
while in september 1987 it was 7424 billion 
after declining for 15 months from yearearlier levels the 
countrys trade surplus reversed direction in july causing concern 
among officials that a resurge in the imbalance could result in 
increased trade friction 
but ministry officials said it was too early to determine 
whether the increases would continue 
we think its going to go up and down for a while said a 
ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity but there 
are too many imponderables like how exchange rates and oil prices 
will move 
the officials said the value of imports had been held down by 
declining world oil prices crude imports fell 299 percent in 
value in september from a year earlier to 1166 billion the 
ministry said 
in the past several months the us dollar has been stable 
against the yen reportedly helping to drive up japanese exports 
but this week the yen began rising rapidly potentially making 
japanese products more expensive and therefore less competitive 
overseas 
if oil prices remain low the officials said imports likely 
will stay down resulting in larger trade surpluses 
but if the yen goes up against the dollar that would curb 
exports and increase imports one official said so a lot 
depends on how those things will change in the future 
manufactured goods accounted for 515 percent of all imports 
during the month surpassing the 50 percent mark for the first time 
and reflecting the decrease in oil imports the ministry said the 
previous high was 499 percent in april 
exports to the united states rose 66 percent from a year 
earlier to 8097 billion while imports from the united states 
surged 262 percent to 3448 billion the ministry said it was 
the ninth month in a row that the bilateral surplus has fallen from 
yearearlier levels 
exports to the european community increased 166 percent to 
3895 billion while imports grew 299 percent to 1881 billion 
yielding a trade surplus of 2014 billion compared to 1891 
billion in september 1987 the ministry said 
japans surplus with southeast asia also increased to 1834 
billion from 1103 billion a year earlier it said 
japan measures its trade on a customsclearance basis which 
includes freight and insurance costs on imports but not in exports 
its trade surplus would be higher if those costs were included in 
both categories

opec secretarygeneral subroto said thursday he 
was confident the oil cartel would be able to stabilize oil prices 
but that it might take more than one meeting of its members 
subroto speaking at an oil conference here also said success 
depended on unequivocal support for the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries from nonopec oil producers 
opecs price monitoring committee and its longterm strategy 
committee are to meet in madrid oct 20 the cartel is to hold a 
full meeting in vienna in late november 
it is not an easy task and maybe one or more meetings after 
the madrid meeting are necessary to reach a final production and 
pricing strategy subroto said 
clearly the present level of oil prices is unacceptable 
subroto said opec is determined to restore oil prices as soon as 
possible to the 18abarrel level 
oil prices now range 6 to 8 below that opec target price 
current opec production of about 20 million barrels a day is 
an unnatural level the chairman said adding we are going 
to bring it back to the level we agreed to 
all opec nations except iraq agreed in june to continue to limit 
their production to 1506 million barrels a day until the end of 
the year but several cartel members are exceeding their individual 
output quotas 
we are confident that we will be able to resolve these 
problems and to formulate a longterm stategy on oil prices and 
production subroto said 
subroto said his optimism was based on recent consultations with 
various opec nations and on the end of hostilities in the persian 
gulf 
there is almost a consensus that unless something is done 
prices would continue to slide down we are more aware now than at 
any other time of the gravity and dangers of the current 
situation 
however he added that the prospect of achieving oil price 
stability remains somewhat bleak as long as nonopec producers 
are indifferent toward opec 
what the oil industry urgently needs is a broader based 
dialogue between opec and all other opec oil producers he said 
overproduction by opec is not the only factor pressuring prices 
subroto said saying nonopec producers which include the soviet 
union united states and britain are producing as much as they can 
he accused the nonopec producers of enjoying the benefits of 
the cartels efforts without having to endure any of the 
sacrifices 
the oil conference at which subroto spoke was sponsored by the 
international herald tribune and the oil daily

a real estate firm noted for massive stock 
speculation filed for bankruptcy thursday citing debts equivalent 
to 12 billion a court official said 
the company nippon tochi asked the osaka district court for 
protection from 256 creditors said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the court will review the companys financial situation and 
attempt to help it pay off at much of its debts as possible 
nippon tochis petition which declared 156 billion yen in 
liabilities was the third largest bankruptcy filing in japanese 
history 
security analysists said nippon tochi began buying large chunks 
of konika co stock last year and had acquired more than 20 percent 
of the photo equipment and film manufacturing firm before the stock 
began declining recently 
the analysts also said real estate firms have faced severe 
financial problems in recent months because government restrictions 
last year drove down the price of land and made it hard for 
companies to repay bank loans 
speculators could borrow money from banks and financial 
institutions almost endlessly when the land price was still 
rising said one analyst who spoke anonymously but many of 
them are suffering badly now that their credit was decreasing and 
they are faced with a huge repayments with no extra money to 
invest 
said private securities analyst kazuo kitada it is becoming 
increasingly more difficult for land speculators to get money to 
invest in the stock market because of tighter control on land 
speculation and tighter securities law 
in the long run it nippon tochis bankruptcy is good for 
the market because it will send a signal to other speculators 
kitada said 
sanko shipping co declared bankruptcy in august 1985 with debts 
of 520 billion yen then worth about 22 billion toyota shoji 
filed for bankruptcy in february 1985 with debts of 200 billion 
yen or about 844 million under exchange rates at the time

a senior member of the house banking committee 
says savings industry lobbyists seeking a taxpayer bailout killed a 
bill that would have pumped 5 billion of industry money into the 
ailing federal savings and loan insurance corp 
legislation to expand the insurance funds borrowing limit from 
108 billion in bonds to 158 billion was strongly opposed by 
lobbyists for the industry which is paying an extra assessment to 
retire the 30year bonds 
by indefinitely postponing debate the house rules committee on 
wednesday effectively blocked the measure until next year 
rep john lafalce dny the sponsor of the bill had argued 
it is better for government regulators to obtain money through 
bonds paid off by the industry than to rely more heavily on 
promissory notes which could eventually have to be paid by the 
taxpayers 
i think the industry killed the bill i think the us league 
of savings institutions killed the bill because they want the 
taxpayers to bail out the industry they do not want to engage in 
any self help this has been their plan from day one lafalce 
said wednesday in a telephone interview 
the public is unaware of whats been going on theres no 
other lobby group but the industry itself and the industry says 
let someone else solve the problem he said 
mark clark senior vice president of the us league the 
largest sampl trade group said the house panels action was 
appropriate he said legislators should fashion a comprehensive 
solution to the sampl financial crisis next year rather than 
hurriedly pass a piecemeal bill this fall 
congress expects to adjourn for the year this week or next 
clark said healthy sampls have already paid about 4 billion more 
than the normal assessment for deposit insurance he said the extra 
payments so far this year caused 69 solvent institutions to lose 
money 
in related action the full house refused to abolish a 
muchcriticized federal agency created to manage and sell off 
property and other assets from failed sampls 
the house voted 247130 to abolish the federal asset disposition 
association but the measure failed because it fell five votes 
short of a needed twothirds majority 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 
3000 sampls created fada in 1985 as a quasipublic agency with its 
own board of directors made up of industry representatives 
lawmakers have accused fada of mismanagement favoritism 
conflicts of interest and of lavish spending on salaries as high as 
250000 a year the house banking committee on oct 4 voted 428 
to transfer its duties back to the sampl insurance fund the eight 
committee republicans opposing the bill charged it was politically 
motivated

the dollar sank today and interest rates rose 
after the government reported a jump in the nations trade deficit 
to 122 billion 
the stock market defied pessimism though prices were mixed in 
early trading and the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks was 
603 points higher at 213229 an hour after the new york stock 
exchange opening 
a record level of american exports was swamped by an alltime 
high in imports the commerce department announced the imbalance 
between what the united states imports and what it sells abroad 
climbed by 27 billion over a july deficit of 95 billion 
the july figure had been the smallest monthly imbalance in more 
than three years economists had expected an increase for august 
but the actual result was worse than the 113 billion imbalance 
many forecasters had predicted 
from the point of view of inflationwary investors the 
combination of strong exports and strong imports was probably the 
worst combination you could get because it signals possible 
overheating of the economy said michael moran chief economist of 
daiwa securities america inc 
even before the figures were released financial markets headed 
lower because of unease over what the government would report the 
dow jones industrial average fell by 3023 points on wednesday its 
biggest decline in nearly two months 
the dollars decline was not huge because the dollar had already 
fallen steadily this week in response to investors fears of a bad 
trade number 
a big deficit increases the likelihood that the dollar will need 
to decline to make american goods cheaper in world markets 
moments after the release of trade figures at 830 am edt the 
dollar fell to just above 126 japanese yen and less than 182 west 
german marks but traders had second thoughts and the currency 
recovered part of its lost ground 
two hours after the trade figures release the dollar was 
traded at a little over 127 yen and under 182 marks down from 
more than 129 yen and 183 marks wednesday the dollar has now 
retreated to its levels of late june and early july 
longterm interest rates rose that reflected investors 
concerns about inflation and a declining dollar which would prompt 
investors to switch money from dollars into other currencies 
the yield on the treasurys 30year treasury bond a key measure 
of longterm rates rose to 895 percent from 890 percent late 
wednesday that reflected a decline in its price as inflationwary

the european economic community said 
thursday some discounts offered cocacolas italian distributors 
violated trading rules because they discouraged competitors from 
entering the market 
the 12nation trading bloc said in a statement cocacola export 
corpfiliale italiana known as export italia agreed to change 
its discount program retroactive to jan 1 
the agreement it said opens the way for normal conditions of 
competition to develop on the italian cola drinks market 
however it said the eec will be particularly vigilant 
in the future and will not fail to act against any agreement or 
practice which infringes eec competition rules 
the community said the italian company san pellegrino filed a 
complaint in september 1987 against export italias discount 
program 
export italia concluded agreements with many large 
distribution companies the statement said it would grant a 
rebate to distributors selling only cocacola 
the amount of these rebates was fixed individually for each 
producer it said the agreements often provided clauses 
extending the exclusivity to other soft drinks 
the eec said it conducted a preliminary investigation of the 
complaint and found that export italia enjoys a dominant position 
on the italian cola market 
it said the socalled fidelity rebate program violated eec rules 
because it encourages the distributors to sell only cocacola 
and therefore prevents or hinders competing producers from 
entering the italian colas market 
it found other rebate programs offered by the company also 
violated eec rules it said these included offering discounts if 
distributors met certain targets that were based on the previous 
years volume 
but it said the eec did not object to rebates which were based 
on buying various sizes of the same product resupplying shelves or 
using advertising materials

the us merchandise trade deficit swelled to 
1218 billion in august as a record level of american exports was 
swamped by an alltime high in imports the government reported 
today 
the commerce department said that the imbalance between what the 
united states imports and what it sells abroad climbed by 27 
billion over a july deficit of 947 billion 
the july figure which followed a 1322 billion june imbalance 
had been the smallest monthly deficit in more than three years 
economists had expected an increase for august but the actual 
result was worse than the 113 billion many forecasters had 
predicted 
financial markets had been tensed waiting for the trade report 
remembering that a worsethanexpected august deficit a year ago 
had prompted a 95point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
just a few days before the black monday stock crash of oct 19 
today however the markets appeared to be riding out the bad 
news 
the dollar tumbled briefly in foreign exchange markets but soon 
rebounded the dow jones average climbed through the morning with 
analysts saying the market appeared to have taken the news largely 
into account with its decline on wednesday 
the reagan administration moved quickly to put the best face on 
the new trade figures insisting that the august increase was only 
a brief interruption to the downward trend in the deficit figures 
evident for most of this year 
commerce secretary c william verity said that if the wide 
swings in july and august were averaged the result would be a 
monthly deficit of 108 billion for the two months down from an 
average of 118 billion in the first six months of the year 
i have been saying for some time that we can hope for an 
improvement of about 30 billion in our trade deficit this year 
the figures for the first eight months show that we are on target 
at an annual rate of 139 billion verity said in a statement 
despite the administrations assurances the widening deficit 
was certain to provide ammunition for michael dukakis who has 
charged that the soaring trade deficits of the 1980s have cost 
america millions of lost jobs and represent one of the greatest 
failures of the reagan administration 
vice president george bush has sought to minimize monthtomonth 
variations in the deficit pointing instead to the fact that the 
deficit for the entire year is headed lower 
for the first eight months of the year the trade deficit is 
running at an annual rate of 1382 billion a substantial 
improvement from the record deficit of 1703 billion suffered in 
1987 
indeed the shrinking of the deficit has been the principal 
reason for the betterthanexpected economic growth so far this 
year economists attribute about half of overall growth to the 
improving trade deficit 
us exports rose to a record level of 2755 billion in august 
an increase of 103 billion over the july level 
after suffering hard times from mid1984 through 1986 american 
industry has been enjoying a boom as the lower value of the dollar 
has made us goods competitive once again on overseas markets 
but unfortunately the weaker dollar has not had much impact in 
slowing americans appetite for imported goods even though they 
now cost more 
imports jumped to an alltime high of 3972 billion in august 
an increase of 373 billion from the july level 
analysts have said that the country has seen about as much of an 
improvement as can be expected from higher exports and a further 
shrinking in overall deficit will not occur until imports begin to 
fall 
the rise in imports in august reflected identical increases of 
11 billion for business capital goods and consumer goods imports 
of foreign cars were up 700 million while oil imports rose by 300 
million to 37 billion 
the higher foreign oil bill reflected an increase in volume as 
the average price per barrel fell by 62 cents to 1515 per barrel 
the higher export sales reflected an increase of 800 million in 
sales of american autos and a smaller rise of 200 million in the 
category that includes farm products 
by country the largest deficit as usual was with japan an 
imbalance of 48 billion up from a july deficit of 44 billion 
the deficit rose to 17 billion with taiwan compared to 12 
billion in july while the deficit with western europe shrank to 
14 billion down from 23 billion in july

grain and soybean futures opened moderately 
higher today on the chicago board of trade in anticipation of 
increased export sales due to poor crops elsewhere and the dollars 
weakness against other major currencies 
the higher opening surprised analysts who had expected a drop in 
prices based on wednesdays crop production estimates from the 
agriculture department which projected slightly larger corn and 
soybean crops than it had previously estimated 
but the agency also reduced its estimates for endofthe year 
stockpiles of corn and wheat reflecting expectations of greater 
foreign demand for those grains 
youve also got to realize the fact that the dollar was 
sharply lower this morning and yesterday and that should keep our 
grains competitive on the world market said joel karlin 
research analyst with research department inc in chicago 
further support came from hopes of a new ussoviet longterm 
grain purchase agreement he said negotiators for the two 
countries were scheduled to meet this afternoon in london 
in early trading wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 438 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with december at 298 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 1 cents higher with december at 258 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents higher with november at 797 a 
bushel 
cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were slightly 
higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 15 cent lower to 22 cent higher with october 
at 7282 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 25 
cent higher with october at 82 cents a pound live hogs were 10 
cent to 40 cent higher with october at 4070 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 87 cent to 108 cents higher with february at

coniston partners said thursday it is mulling 
its options after food services giant tw services inc rejected its 
14 billion merger proposal 
in a statement issued late wednesday tw said its board turned 
down the proposal after its financial advisers determined that the 
28 a share coniston offered to pay was inadequate 
the board reaffirmed tws belief that its shareholders will be 
served best by the company remaining independent the statement 
said 
augustus oliver a coniston principal said the partnership is 
reviewing its alternatives which include launching a hostile 
tender offer while coniston is under no time constraints on making 
a decision oliver reiterated the firms interest in owning tw 
which runs the dennys restaurant chain 
new yorkbased coniston already owns about 19 percent of tws 
485 million outstanding shares the partnership outlined its 
proposal for a friendly merger in a letter to the tw board earlier 
this month 
were obviously disappointed at their response oliver said 
adding that its worth noting that they never made any attempt to 
contact us about the offer or to discuss their views on the 
price 
in its letter to tw coniston said that while 28 a share was an 
extremely favorable price it might be willing to offer more if 
tw could demonstrate sufficient business prospects to justify 
doing so 
oliver said that coniston still thinks the price is extremely 
high and we havent heard anyone out there in the financial 
community taking great issue with that 
on the new york stock exchange tw was trading at 2650 share 
at midday unchanged from wednesday 
tw chairman and chief executive officer frank salizzoni noted 
that the companys earnings have grown at a rate in excess of 20 
percent over the past two years and predicted the trend to continue 
for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our shareholders will benefit more from tws 
continued growth and performance than from the coniston proposal 
oliver countered however that the board is protecting 
shareholders and said rhetorically why dont they simply let 
the stockholders decide rather than make the decision for them 
in addition to dennys tw is a franchisee of the hardees 
restaurant chain the new yorkbased company also runs canteen 
corp a food services concern and a small nursing home chain 
tw reported net income of 472 million on sales of 25 billion

wall street giant merrill lynch amp co reported a 
664 percent slide in thirdquarter earnings thursday attributing 
it to the postcrash stock slump and an extraordinary gain in the 
yearearlier period 
merrill lynch also announced a major accounting change in its 
employee retirement program that will free 220 million in excess 
pension funds that have accumulated over the past few years and 
return the money to the company 
executives briefing reporters about the pension plan change said 
the 32700 employees affected would continue to receive equivalent 
benefits under the new arrangement and would be able to participate 
in a stock ownership plan that takes effect next year 
courtney jones chief financial officer said the company would 
use the 220 million surplus for various purposes but did not 
elaborate he said the change would be reflected in fourthquarter 
earnings results but did not estimate them 
thirdquarter earnings totaled 656 million or 58 cents a share 
for the three months ended sept 30 vs 1951 million or 178 a 
share in the equivalent period a year earlier the company said in 
an earnings statement 
total revenues in the third quarter totaled 279 billion vs 
266 billion a 48 percent increase but commission revenues 
tumbled 339 percent 
the results partly reflected a severe decline in investor demand 
for stocks in the aftermath of the october 1987 market crash which 
has devastated stock trading volumes and brokerage commissions of 
many wall street investment firms 
merrill lynch said in its earnings statement that the decline in 
thirdquarter results also reflected an extraordinary 1003 
million aftertax gain in the comparable 1987 quarter when the 
company sold a partnership interest in its manhattan headquarters 
while the results were sharply lower they were fairly 
consistent with the 60 percent average drop in thirdquarter 
earnings that the securities industry has been experiencing 
daniel p tully merrill lynch president and chief operating 
officer called the results positive in an environment marked by 
an industrywide decline in activity particularly among individual 
investors 
other merrill lynch officials said the companys effort over the 
past several years to diversify into other areas such as 
investment banking bond trading and corporate takeover financing 
had helped defray the impact of the stock market slump 
for the first nine months of the year merrill lynch earnings 
totaled 187 million or 167 a share a 517 percent drop from the 
387 million or 352 a share earned in the first nine months of 
1987 
revenue for the nine months totaled 768 billion vs 750 
billion a 23 percent increase but commission revenue fell 338 
percent 
merrill lynch is one of the largest us investment and 
financial services firms with capital of 3 billion and more than 
500 offices worldwide

share prices on the london stock exchange rose 
strongly thursday as dealers breathed a sigh of relief that the 
us trade report for august did not confirm the markets worst 
fears 
world financial markets had suffered a bout of jitters before 
the release of the report with rumors circulating that there would 
be a pronounced widening in the trade gap 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed up 
164 points or 09 percent higher at 18307 near the 
midafternoon best level for the day of 18311 
volume was modest with 4642 million shares changing hands 
compared with the 4765 million shares traded wednesday 
the us commerce department announced that the merchandise 
trade gap for august widened to 1218 billion from a revised 947 
billion in july 
several market observers had predicted a shortfall between 113 
billion and 125 billion but rumors abounded that the trade gap 
might balloon to as much as 15 billion 
the market had braced for a number far worse said kevin 
gardiner an economist at warburg securities in london 
gardiner suggested that the market had been looking back 
nervously to a year ago when the july trade figure of 1708 
billion unhinged world financial markets preceding the october 
stock market crash 
there was concern that history might repeat itself gardiner 
said 
but on wall street the dow jones industrial average was 1031 
points higher at 213656 as london trading ended thursday having 
opened about 4 points lower

american manufacturers need to install 
more automated machinery or lose jobs and sales to efficient 
foreign competitors that share technology with their peers 
according to a harvard university study released thursday 
the survey of more than 1300 us metalworking plants concluded 
that american industry is clinging to an outdated notion that big 
firms should not share technological advances with potential 
competitors 
relations between large and small firms is not part of the 
business culture in the united states said maryellen r kelley 
an assistant management professor at carnegie mellon university in 
pittsburgh and one of the studys authors 
that kind of boost to small manufacturers that encourages them 
to automate is absent she said 
the study found that more than half of us metalworking plants 
have not installed any computercontrolled machinery and just one 
in 10 plants planned to invest in computerization in 198889 
in the long run if small manufacturers in particular dont 
modernize they will no longer be able to compete with more 
sophisticated foreign suppliers kelley said that could 
ultimately lead to a loss of jobs 
the study found that just 11 percent of machine tools used in 
the american metalworking industry are computercontrolled kelley 
said a similar 1985 study of japanese firms found that 30 percent 
of the total stock was computerrun 
the model of the selfinterested doitalone small business 
driven by a gear of cutthroat competition seems to be a 
peculiarly american phenomenon the report issued by the center 
for business and government at the john f kennedy school of 
government said 
the authors said americas competitive culture must change if 
us industry is to continue to be an industrial power in the world 
economy in countries such as japan and italy potential 
competitors as well as buyers and suppliers routinely share 
information they said 
the survey of metalworking and machinery manufacturers in 21 
durable goods industries including hardware plumbing and forging 
was based on a national mail questionnaire and interviews with more 
than 1300 firms nationwide an equal distribution of companies 
with workforces ranging from under 20 to more than 250 was used 
the study the state of computerized automation in us 
manufacturing was conducted from september 1986 to april 1987 
it was funded by the national science foundation and the us 
congress office of technology assessment 
according to the survey 53 percent of us plants use 
conventional machinery while 47 percent have some type of 
computeroperated machines 
surprisingly we found that there has not been much adoption of 
competitive technology and this is after five years of economic 
recovery kelley a kennedy school research associate said in an 
interview 
small manufacturers have resisted the adoption of 
computercontrolled technology partly out of a fear of job losses 
through automation and partly because high expenses would require 
product diversification kelley said 
it certainly seems that this technology is more efficient and 
seems to be more flexible she said but that means a shift in 
business strategy is required 
the 22 percent of plants that said they have not adopted 
computercontrolled technology and have no plans to do so accounted 
for 1 million jobs in 1986 jobs kelley said are threatened by 
foreign competition 
the industries surveyed make tools used in machinery for 
production of a variety of durable goods from furniture to 
clothing kelley said three types of machines dominate the field 
numerically controlled computer numerically controlled and 
flexible manufacturing systems 
numerically controlled machinery is usully manually operated 
computer numerically controlled machinery allows machines to be 
programmed to automatically execute a set of metalcutting 
operations which reduces the cost of setup and permits repeat 
runs of a product 
flexible manufacturing systems used by just 15 percent of the 
firms surveyed are computer numerically controlled machines linked 
by automatic materialhandling equipment such as robots or 
conveyors

earlier this month when the nations largest 
retailers announced their results for september people with an eye 
on apparel sales breathed just the barest sighs of relief 
the numbers brought the first signals that a yearlong drought 
in clothing sales might be approaching an end but industry 
watchers stress the key word is might 
all of the major retailers are showing some fashion strength 
but it has to be taken in some context said walter loeb a 
retail industry analyst with the investment firm morgan stanley amp 
co 
donald i trott who tracks specialty retailers for dean witter 
reynolds inc called september apparel sales very good but 
said he was not fully convinced they marked the beginning of a 
trend 
the nations largest specialty apparel retailer limited inc 
reported that sales at its stores open for at least a year known 
in the business as samestore sales rose 7 percent last month 
from september 1987 
the companys overall sales picked up 11 percent in september 
but analysts believe samestore sales more accurately reflect a 
retailers performance than figures that include the results of 
newer stores 
fred wintzer an analyst with alex brown amp sons inc in 
baltimore was optimistic because limiteds sales have gradually 
improved in recent months especially at its limited express stores 
that cater to teens and young women 
wintzer estimated limited express samestore sales soared 30 
percent in september and said he expected limited inc to be the 
pacesetter for other apparel retailers 
this is the company that will lead the pack he said the 
rest of the industry will pick up on it after its definitely 
working at the limited this is the way it always goes 
limited and other retailers are trying to recover from the 
problems they encountered in the fall of 1987 fashion lines 
fizzled as women shied away from shorter skirt lengths and decided 
they had had enough of baggy oversized casual wear 
clothing sales nosedived and retailers forced to take heavy 
markdowns to clear merchandise saw their profits slide as well 
and because the stores had already ordered the same styles for 
spring 1988 their slump persisted through this summer 
for fall retailers have experimented with more tailored and 
dressy fashions and they reinstated longer skirts 
bloomingdales known for its trendy apparel brought back a 
large selection of career clothes not seen at the store for 
several years 
limited stores the flagship division of limited inc has 
featured suits and limited express which sells mostly casual 
clothes has hints of the tailored look with pleated pants and 
cableknit cardigan sweaters 
but while sales have improved no one can point to a specific 
fashion item or style that is extraordinarily successful 
gap inc which has continued to stress the casual look says 
its sales have come on a broad selection of merchandise 
i cant put my finger on any individual items that have been 
blowing out of the stores said warren hashagen gaps vice 
president and treasurer 
weve got more fashion merchandise and a steady flow of new 
items in new colors coming in he said that flow of 
merchandise has caused customers to come back 
gap does not report its sales monthly however trott of dean 
witter estimated gaps samestore sales rose during september by a 
percentage in the low to mid teens 
a year ago gap was the most prominent victim of the fashion 
slump after a disastrous august 1987 the company announced a 
sharp downward revision in its expected profit for that quarter 
investors responded by dumping gap and other retail stocks 
gaps shares which had traded at nearly 78 in august plunged to 
just under 37 a month later in two days alone the stock fell 
nearly 19 
having watched the industry stumble its way through the ensuing 
year analysts say they have reasons to be cautious 
for one thing the september increases were what the analysts 
call easy comparisons because they were made against the 
depressed results of a year earlier the industry watchers say 
sales must improve by doubledigit percentages to be meaningful 
trott said several questions remain to be answered such as how 
much of the sales increase is due to price inflation 
im not sure what that means in terms of numbers of garments 
sold he said of the september results 
william smith an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
said its a bit early to generalize and predicted october 
sales would give a better idea of how healthy clothing sales are 
and wintzer the alex brown analyst although upbeat about 
limited said for the rest of the industry to get in the swing 
of this the earliest it will happen is next spring

the dollar plummeted against major foreign 
currencies in heavy selling thursday after the american government 
reported a sharp widening of the us merchandise trade deficit in 
august 
however the us currency later managed to bounce back up above 
its worst levels of the day 
gold prices also fell but not as dramatically 
the august deficit of 1218 billion compared with a revised 
shortfall of 947 billion in july was near the top end of market 
expectations and prompted a bout of heavy selling that pushed the 
dollar to a session low of around 18110 west german marks 
the figure was as bad as expected or maybe a bit worse one 
dealer at a us bank in frankfurt said the dollar is now 
battered 
dealers said technical support at the 18100mark level and 
rumors that the us federal reserve was checking dollaryen rates 
helped to push the dollar back to its closing levels 
but market players added that sentiment remained bearish and 
most said they expected the dollar to continue its downward move 
any decline however would be limited by fear of central bank 
effort to prop the dollar up 
the frankfurt dealer said the central banks will make sure 
that the dollar moves down only gradually they dont want to risk 
a crash and just one year after the crash this psychology is 
strong in the market 
some analysts say the october 1987 stock market crash was 
triggered partly by worsethanexpected trade figures which had 
sent the dollar into a tailspin 
is no way the central banks will let the dollar fall too far 
ahead of the us presidential elections in november a london 
dealer said 
in london the dollar sank against the british pound it cost 
17470 to buy one pound more expensive than 17305 wednesday 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late 
wednesdays rates included 18193 west german marks down from 
18340 15390 swiss francs down from 15587 61995 french 
francs down from 62770 20475 dutch guilders down from 20760 
135400 italian lire down from 137900 and 12084 canadian 
dollars down from 12118 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar closed at 12798 yen down 167 yen later in london 
it was quoted at 12795 yen 
gold fell in london to a late bid price of 40670 a troy ounce 
compared with 40925 bid late wednesday 
in zurich gold was lower closing at a bid 40650 compared 
with 40810 bid late wednesday 
earlier in hong kong gold rose 269 to close at a bid 41122 
silver bullion prices fell on the london market where the metal 
was trading at a late bid price of 629 a troy ounce compared 
with wednesdays 635

prime computer inc said thursday it will acquire 
general electric cos calma business which makes computeraided 
design and manufacturing systems for an undisclosed price 
the move will increase primes share of the computeraided 
design and manufacturing market while getting ge out of a 
moneylosing business which it entered with fanfare in 1981 
with its 435 million takeover of computervision inc in 
february prime already is the second leading supplier behind 
international business machines corp in the field of 
computeraided design and manufacturing systems 
calma based in milpitas calif has 650 employees ge which 
bought calma for 170 million in 1981 said it has failed to earn a 
profit in recent years but the company declined to release figures 
on either its sales or losses 
salomon brothers inc a new york investment banking house 
estimated calmas sales at 200 million in 1985 and 210 million in 
1986 
one of calmas biggest customers has been fairfield connbased 
ge which said it will give prime preferred vendor status and 
access to ges corporate research in the field after the sale is 
completed in approximately 90 days 
analysts said the acquisition appears to complement primes 
current businesses but could prove difficult for the natickbased 
computer maker to absorb 
i think its a good strategic move in the same sense and 
direction that buying computervision was it could solidify the 
companys position in the cadcam market said carol e muratore 
an analyst with morgan stanley amp co 
but strategy is only one part of the puzzle she added 
execution is the other and that remains to be seen theyre 
still very early in the process of assimilating computervision and 
there are no clear signs yet that they have done that well 
the companies said some reductions in calmas workforce are 
likely before the end of the year but they said the numbers have 
not been determined 
prime reported earnings of 217 million on revenues of 7721 
million for the first six months of this year those earnings were 
down from 276 million in the same period of 1987 despite an 
increase in revenues from 4578 million most of the rise in 
revenues was due to the computervision takeover 
last week former ge executive anthony l craig was named to 
succeed prime president joe m henson in a few months both 
companies said the move was unrelated to the calma sale

were its improved operating performance and lower taxes 
earnings rose to 1266 million or 191 per share on sales of 
199 billion compared with 1987s third quarter earnings of 
1146 million or 157 per share on sales of 186 billion 
the third quarter was another strong one for raytheon

received important government awards during the quarter for 
submarine combat control systems missile programs and faa 
technical support services 
the electronics and defense equipment manufacturer said sales in 
major appliances continued to outpace those of last year but 
profits were lower due to higher material costs and stiff price 
competition 
provisions for federal and foreign income taxes were 547 
million in the quarter compared with 616 million last year 
for the first nine months of the year raytheon earned 3623 
million or 543 per share up 107 percent from 3272 million 
or 444 a share in the same period of 1987 
sales for the first nine months totaled 598 billion up from

the house today put off until tuesday a vote 
on senateapproved legilsation to require issuers of credit and 
charge cards to disclose information about interest rates fees and 
other details before consumers apply for the cards 
the house leadership had promised members who wanted to leave 
the nations capital for the weekend that there would be no 
rollcall votes after 1 pm today the bill although debated 
came up for a vote shortly before 2 pm 
rep fernand j st germain dri chairman of the house 
banking committee called the measure one of the most important 
and strongest credit disclosure acts that we have been able to move 
through the congress since the first truthinlending statute was 
passed 20 years ago 
he said the measure ends the hideandseek approach to 
disclosures on credit card terms it prevents sneak attacks on 
unsuspecting consumers who often learn of charges and fees long 
after the fact too late to reject the card and seek 
alternatives 
under present law terms of credit and charge card accounts do 
not have to be disclosed until after a card is issued more than 
1055 million americans hold 800 million of the cards 
sen christopher j dodd dconn consumer affairs subcommittee 
chairman who sponsored the bill approved by the senate on a voice 
vote tuesday night said full advance disclosure of card fees and 
terms would enable consumers to weigh the costs and benefits of 
signing up for particular credit or charge cards 
now he said the cost information is given to consumers too 
late to make a difference 
the information is often confusing and difficult to read and 
arrives at a time when the consumer cannot very well shop around 
for a better rate said dodd this late disclosure of 
information is in sharp contrast to the way card issuers solicit 
consumers we all know how that is done all you have to do is read 
your mail to know that lenders rely heavily on mail solicitations 
the legislation would require all direct mail applications and 
solicitations to contain clear information on the annual interest 
rate any minimum finance charge any transaction fee the grace 
period and the method of calculation used in computing the balance 
for interest purposes issuers also must clearly state any cash 
advance fees late fees and overthelimit fees 
the measure still falls short of the disclosure requirements 
sought by some members of congress and consumer groups 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
consumer affairs subcommittee said this bill does not help the 
consumer 
leslie gainer an official of the ralph naderorganized us 
public interest research group said the legislation fails to go 
far enough with the new disclosure rules and preempts states from 
passing stronger laws 
the consumer bankers association which represents approximately 
800 federally insured banks savings and loans and credit unions 
endorsed the legislation 
joe belew the association president said the measure 
provides for simple meaningful disclosures which ensure that 
consumers can compare terms on credit cards its enactment will 
show that consumer and industry representatives can work together 
to produce legislation which benefits the public

the 100 highest paid executives in hightechnology 
companies earned an average of 785000 last year and 17 were paid 
more than 1 million according to a survey by a trade publication 
at the top of the list is apple computer inc chief executive 
officer john sculley whose 1987 cash compensation was 214 
million electronic business magazine reported 
the figures in the survey which was compiled largely from proxy 
statements include salaries and cash bonuses but do not include 
nonpay benefits or stock options which in many cases equal or 
exceed the executives cash compensation 
the 785000 average pay was up 235 percent from 1986 when the 
top 100 earned an average of 633000 
the increase is partly a reflection of a good year for the 
industry which saw the top 200 electronics companies sales rise 
74 percent and profits soar 536 percent said linda b stallmann 
senior editor of the magazine 
but she added the october 1987 stock market crash and changes 
in income tax laws also helped drive up cash compensation 
executives are preferring cash because sometimes the stock 
options arent as valuable as they used to be and the new tax laws 
have reduced the value of perquisites like houses or cars 
stallmann said 
the magazine also found a sharp increase in the popularity of 
contractual guarantees to compensate top executives in the event 
their companies are taken over by hostile raiders 
because of all the mergers and acquisitions the chief 
executives are looking for more security stallmann said

air wis services inc rejected as 
inadequate a 121 million takeover bid from a connecticut 
investment firm but left the door open for a higher offer 
the offer of 16365 a share from cove capital associates inc 
of greenwich conn is the fourth takeover bid for the airline 
holding company since last november cove represents transmark usa 
inc an insurance holding company based in jacksonville fla 
the offer rejected wednesday includes 14 a share in cash and 
236 in preferred stock 
the air wis board of directors said it would reconsider its 
stance if a higher allcash offer were made 
air wis officials questioned how much cash cove and transmark 
could bring to the table without borrowing against assets of air 
wis whose air wisconsin subsidiary operates united express airline 
your proposal to utilize a form of preferred stock to finance 
a significant part of your acquisition costs suggests to our board 
that cove capital and transmark usa may not have sufficient 
resources to effect an acquisition of the company at a reasonable 
price without borrowing significantly against the companys 
assets air wis president preston wilbourne told cove 
wilbourne said an acquisition that involved heavy borrowing 
could impair air wis plans to expand and to acquire new equipment 
bring route cutbacks and cause defaults on existing financial 
agreements 
last november a group headed by citicorp venture capital and 
two former executives of united airlines offered 1150 a share for 
air wis 
that was followed by a bid from former air wis chairman arthur 
hailand and john j louis jr a director for 14 a share hailand 
and louis later raised their bid to 17 a share comprised of 14 
in cash and 3 in debt 
all three bids were rejected by the air wis board hailand was 
removed as chairman when the board turned down his first offer

four years after the 45 billion federal bailout 
of its flagship bank continental illinois corp is changing its 
name to reflect a change in its course officials said thursday 
pending stockholder approval on dec 12 continental illinois 
will become continental bank corp and the continental illinois 
national bank amp trust co of chicago will become simply the 
continental bank said chairman thomas c theobold 
in addition the company plans a dividend increase and an 
employee stockownership plan to reward its investors and workers 
for helping it achieve what it expects will be record high earnings 
this year theobold said in a statement 
continental also will seek shareholder approval for a 1for4 
reverse stock split to raise the price of its stock in hopes of 
attracting more institutional investors 
the name change which the company prefers to call a 
simplification reflects continentals new direction as a national 
business bank theobold said 
although proud of our illinois heritage we want a name that 
more accurately reflects the national scope of our business and 
reinforces the banks new strategic direction he said in many 
ways this modification is only a confirmation of how customers and 
investors already refer to the bank 
the name change is not an attempt to escape the stigma of the 
banks scrape with failure in 1984 said spokeswoman holly anderson 
weve always been continental bank thats our acceptable 
second reference she said 
the federal deposit insurance corp saved the continental 
illinois bank from collapse in june 1984 halting a 20 million run 
on deposits prompted by concerns about the stability of the bank 
which was at that time among the worlds largest 
questions about the banks stability first surfaced following 
the failure of the penn square bank of oklahoma city in 1982 
continental illinois had bought more than 1 billion in energy 
loans from penn square and was forced to write off most of them 
after the oklahoma bank collapsed 
the fdic purchased 52 billion worth of continental bank loans 
as part of its plan to save the bank from failure the federal 
insurance agency still owns or has options on 69 percent of the 
holding companys stock said continental spokesman edgar mcdougal 
last october three months after theobold succeeded john e 
swearingen as chairman continental illinois announced its plan to 
become a marketdriven business bank devoted to serving 
corporations institutional investors and individuals with complex 
financial requirements 
in the year since then the company has sold its consumer retail 
business to the first national bank of chicago sold some of its 
overseas holdings including its branches in seoul south korea 
and taipei taiwan and launched a 5 million advertising campaign 
aimed at persuading businesses to bank with continental 
the firm earned a record 1287 million in the first half of 
1988 and expects to post recordhigh annual earnings as well 
theobold said 
the quarterly dividend increase from 2 cents to 5 cents per 
share and the awarding of stock to employees are gestures of 
thanks theobold said 
its time we rewarded our stockholders and employees for their 
confidence in us through lean times and gave them reason to expect 
continued prosperity in the future he said 
the reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding 
shares from 215 million to 54 million and quadruple the stocks 
price theobold said many institutional investors and brokerage 
firms arent interested in stocks that trade below 10 a share as 
continentals does

economic experts met thursday to 
discuss the ability of the united states to compete in the world 
marketplace but there was wide disagreement over whether the 
nation is falling behind its industrial competitors in asia and 
europe 
the huge us budget and foreign trade deficits were major 
issues in the debate 
as the elections approach a major question is the impact of 
american consumers buying more and more foreignmade products on 
our ability to deal with national priorities said harold j 
raveche president of stevens institute of technology which played 
host to the meeting 
let us also ask the difficult question how can a debtor 
nation continue to lead raveche said 
economist george gilder author of wealth and poverty and 
the spirit of enterprise countered that the supposed decline 
in us competitiveness is in fact a myth 
the key lesson of the past eight years is an overwhelming 
increase in us competitiveness that has attracted capital from 
all over the world he said 
gilder argued that the enormous us foreign trade deficits in 
recent years largely reflect the inflow of investment capital and 
are a sign of strength not of weakness 
it is ludicrous to worry about a foreign takeover of the 
united states economy when the united states still has 45 percent 
of the worlds foreign direct investment and when only five percent 
of american industrial assets are owned by foreigners compared to 
20 percent in europe he said 
david halberstam a pulitzer prizewinning author stressed the 
importance of education in world competitiveness noting that 
technical universities like stevens are the cutting edge of 
economic development 
peter sprague chairman of the board of national semiconductor 
corp noted that the american university system is a mecca for 
foreign students 
about half our science and engineering students are 
foreigners he said we should accept them as immigrants 
however halberstam argued that american primary and secondary 
education is inferior to the japanese system 
higher education in the united states will not be good enough 
if our elementary and high school education dont work he said 
the japanese are killing us in ninth grade mathematics 
kenneth wilson the 1982 winner of the nobel prize in physics 
urged the importance of government financing for scientific 
research he asserted that scientific progress in the united 
states for the past 30 years has been practically all financed by 
the government 
gilder emphatically held his position that the united states is 
surging ahead in competitiveness 
power has shifted and is shifting toward the united states and 
asia where more capitalist policies are followed he argued 
all europes growth in the 1980s was due to the growth of 
government consumption and created no new jobs at all europe is 
stagnating 
but clyde prestowitz jr former counselor for japanese affairs 
to the secretary of commerce took a gloomier view he recalled 
that successive american industries steel automobiles 
electronics semiconductors have failed to hold their own against 
japanese and other competitors 
now the japanese are increasing their foothold in us banking 
he said the competitiveness problem for the united states he 
said is not only industrial but also financial

predict that gold would soon return to its recent lows below 400 a 
troy ounce 
on other markets energy futures rallied sharply livestock and 
meat gained grains and soybeans were mixed and stockindex 
futures retreated 
gold for october delivery traded as high as 409 a troy ounce on 
new yorks commodity exchange and december gold hit 416 as traders 
interpreted lower bond prices and the weaker dollar as bullish 
signals for the precious metals 
but to chartwatching technical traders those gold prices the 
highest in three weeks meant the market was overbought the 
technicians sold driving the december contract down to a close of 
41220 although the spot contract held up well settling at 
40840 
analyst peter cardillo of josephthal amp co in new york said the 
bond and dollar weakness that precipitated wednesdays gold rush 
was largely based on expectations that the government would report 
a widening of the us trade deficit in a report due out thursday 
morning 
meanwhile he said the low inflation rate ample gold supplies 
and other factors that led to the gold markets collapse last month 
remain in place 
i think the market is in an overbought condition and i think 
well test the recent lows of 390 to 395 in the december 
contract cardillo said

delivery in december at 41220 a troy ounce silver was 119 cents

the rally reflected a general mood of reassessment about the 
ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to 
curb their crude oil production and boost prices said peter

cardillo said the oil rally was linked to growing signs that the

lockheed corp said thursday its 
operating profit rose 15 percent in the third quarter while net 
income boosted by the sale of a computer operation tripled in the 
period 
the aerospace company said earnings from continuing operations 
totaled 123 million or 207 a share up from 107 million or 
161 a share in the third quarter of 1987 
earnings from continuing operations improved primarily because 
the new federal income tax law and accounting changes have cut the 
companys tax bill said lawrence o kitchen chairman and chief 
executive officer 
lockheed said income of 177 million from discontinued 
operations boosted final net to 300 million or 506 a share 
from 101 million or 152 a share a year earlier

ability to deliver orange juice she said

automakers reported thursday their sales of 
usmade cars and trucks jumped 315 percent in early october from 
a year earlier but that was a time when buying had slowed after a 
race for big incentives ended 
companies making cars and light trucks in the united states said 
they sold 278932 vehicles during the oct 110 period this year 
which was the first period in the 1989 model year they sold 
238707 during the same time last year 
the percentage comparison is based on daily sales rates because 
the period is so short there were eight selling days in the period 
this year compared with nine last year 
at the end of september last year when the 1987 model year came 
to a close many popular cutrate financing and cashback 
incentives expired those offers drew in a lot of consumers and 
buying dropped after new models went on sale 
you were heading into the nothingness stage last year where 
all the programs were expiring and inventories were getting down to 
a very low level said analyst charles brady at the investment 
firm oppenheimer amp co in new york 
now all of a sudden their comparison looks phenomenal 
brady said 
sales of usmade cars rose 368 percent in early october 
compared to the same period last year rising to a total of 183652 
cars from 151043 
kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc 
agreed that some car buyers who were planning on purchasing cars in 
late autumn last year headed to showrooms in september 1987 to take 
advantage of incentives for 86 models 
probably the whole month of october is going to be very high 
because the basis of last year was very low she said 
heaney also said us automakers put incentives on their 1989 
models shortly after they were introduced and that accounted for 
some of the sales boost early this month 
this year there was nothing really new on showroom floors 
she said i guess that was part of the reason for them putting 
the incentives on this year 
for the calendar year domestic automakers have sold 5927753 
cars compared with 5666841 last year a 46 percent increase 
for early october ford motor co showed the largest increase 
with car sales jumping 70 percent on a daily basis to a total of 
58407 from 38662 last year light truck sales increased 231 
percent to 33574 from 30681 
general motors corp showed a 317 percent rise in car sales to 
90183 from 77032 gms light truck sales rose 293 percent to 
41010 from 35693 
chrysler corps usmade car sales rose 118 percent to

business week story the enforcement agency does not comment on

starting saturday your fingers will have to do an 
extra three digits of walking when calling about half of 
massachusetts 
if they dont this is the computerized voice youll hear 
the area code for the number you dialed has been changed to 
508 please hang up and dial the area code 508 for the number you 
are calling 
make that 1508 
the longplanned addition of a new area code for about 190 
communities in eastern and central massachusetts was undertaken by 
new england telephone co to avoid the inevitability of running out 
of new telephone numbers 
the 508 service was activated in july but using the new code 
was voluntary as of saturday callers will hear the recording 
unless they dial the extra digits 
three towns walpole dover and north reading all appealed 
their placement in 508 to the state department of public utilities 
they all lost wilmington put its appeal on hold but said it would 
not pursue it after the others failed 
we feel its a great inconvenience wilmington town manager 
buzz stapczynski said wednesday most of our business is 
conducted with boston 999 percent of the calls i make are to 
boston 
bitterness and embarrassment over being removed from bostons 
617 area code along with new letterhead business cards and truck 
lettering are some of the aftereffects of the new code 
we in fact are part of greater boston asserted hartnell 
bartlett selectmen chairman in north reading which spent 20000 
to fight the change everything we do is within that region 
were the only community with a 508 exchange listed in the greater 
boston telephone directory 
more than the inconvenience of dialing the extra digits 
officials in border towns complained they were being exiled to 
exurbia by virtue of the less serious area code 
it obviously has a significant cost on businesses and a 
psychological impact bartlett said gee north reading must 
be up there someplace its in another area code 
stapczynski said wilmington is part of the bostonbased 
massachusetts water resources authority the massachusetts bay 
transportation authority and the massachusetts planning commission 
we dont relate to lowell or haverhill or lawrence or any of 
those places he said 
but stapczynski said the town decided against fighting the new 
code because of the expense and almostsure defeat why fight the 
bureaucracy and spend a ton of money and come out with the same 
decision he said 
new england telephone co spokesman peter cronin said the 
company sought to maintain a near equal number of telephone lines 
in the two regions minimize confusion and consider business and 
residential trends when deciding what towns were moved to 508 
the line had to go someplace and we felt we had established 
very fair criteria and very faithfully followed those criteria 
he said 
callers will not have to pay more money when calling into the 
new area code cronin said

the dollar fell thursday but other markets 
reacted calmly to a report that the nations persistent trade 
deficit widened in august 
one year ago an unexpected rise in the trade deficit served as 
one of the catalysts for the stock market crash 
the commerce department reported that the merchandise trade 
deficit widened to 122 billion in august from 95 billion in 
july confirming fears that had pushed stocks bonds and the dollar 
down earlier in the week 
the news pushed the dollar still lower but the stock and bond 
markets took the news in stride 
more stocks rose than fell on wall street as the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks rose 712 points to 213336 the 
average had fallen 3023 points on wednesday 
in the bond market interest rates rose immediately after the 
report but then partly retreated one closely watched measure of 
rates the yield on the 30year treasury bond rose to 892 percent 
from 890 percent late wednesday 
the dollar was ready to be nudged down further because the mood 
of the market had seemingly shifted against it this week 
the markets still not totally sure about it but the 
first reaction is weve got to sell the dollar said rimmer de 
vries chief economist of morgan guaranty trust co 
by late in the day the dollar was down to less than 1275 
japanese yen and 182 west german marks compared to more than 129 
yen and 183 marks on wednesday 
hopes for big reductions in the trade deficit had helped push 
the dollar higher through june july and august the dollar peaked 
around sept 1 then drifted slowly downward before falling steeply 
this week toward its level of early summer 
sentiments about the dollar are subject to change without 
notice and some analysts said thursday that they believed the 
underlying trend in the dollar was still for a stable or higher 
currency 
this is not a sufficiently bad number to change the 
psychology said lawrence krohn senior economist for shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
dollar traders and speculators have plenty of room to interpret 
the latest trade figures because economists have sharply 
conflicting projections for how much the trade deficit will shrink 
in coming years 
economists are divided between long laggers who expect the 
deficit to keep dropping sharply because of the lagging reaction to 
the dollars decline since 1985 and short laggers who believe 
all the benefits from the dollar drop have already come 
de vries who called himself a short lagger thursday said 
the dollars decline is good because it will make us goods more 
competitive in world markets and help shrink the trade deficit 
im glad about it we ought to make a lot more headway on the 
trade balance de vries said 
the alltime high in imports in august outweighed exports which 
also set a monthly record the heavy imports indicated that 
americans have not lost their taste for imported goods in spite of 
a rise in their prices from the depreciated dollar 
the imbalance between what the united states imports and what it 
sells abroad was up by 27 billion over a july deficit of 95 
billion which had had been the smallest monthly imbalance in more 
than three years 
from the point of view of inflationwary investors the 
combination of strong exports and strong imports was probably the 
worst combination you could get because it signals possible 
overheating of the economy said michael moran chief economist of 
daiwa securities america inc

an investment company making a hostile bid for 
consolidated gold fields plc on thursday disputed consolidateds 
claim that the takeover would lead to south african domination of 
world gold and strategic metals markets 
minorco sa a luxembourgbased firm controlled by anglo 
american corp of south africa and debeers consolidated mines ltd 
made the arguments thursday in an additional filing with the 
british governments office of fair trading 
anglo american and debeers are the gold and diamond mining 
interests of south africas oppenheimer family 
the fair trading office has the power to recommend an 
investigation of the bid on competition or publicinterest grounds 
the suggestion that anglo american gold fields and minorco 
together could influence the world price and free availability of 
gold is not supported by the facts minorco contended in its 
filing 
minorco meanwhile disclosed that it had purchased more of 
londonbased consolidated gold fields shares on the london stock 
exchange to lift its holding to 626 million shares or 2932 
percent 
minorcos cashandshare bid values consolidated gold fields 
entire share capital at about 29 billion pounds or 5 billion 
consolidated gold fields told the office oct 6 that success of 
the minorco bid would give the anglo american group control of 35 
percent of the western worlds gold supplies compared with the 
groups current 20 percent share 
but minorco said thursday that calculation wrongly included 
consolidated gold fields interests in companies in which it has a 
minority stake including newmont mining corp of the united 
states renison gold fields of australia and gold fields of south 
africa ltd 
minorco said it would sell consolidated gold fields holdings of 
493 percent in newmont and 38 percent in gold fields of south 
africa if the bid succeeds it would keep the 49 percent share of 
renison 
the selloff would leave minorco with an attributable interest 
of 1 percent of the wests gold production coupled with the 20 
percent share held by anglo american 
minorco also rejected the claim that the bid would lead to south 
african domination of certain strategic minerals and metals 
particularly the mineral sands from which zircon and titanium are 
extracted 
consolidated gold fields shares closed 6 pence 1048 cents 
lower at 1245 pounds 2175 thursday on the london stock 
exchange minorcos offer is currently worth 1266 pounds 2212 
dollars per share

annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent

senior tax negotiators from the house and 
senate reached agreement thursday on legislation imposing limited 
economic sanctions against iraq and seizing a portion of a historic 
battlefield in northern virginia aides said 
working on a miscellaneous tax bill negotiators also approved a 
tax break for freelance writers photographers and artists and an 
increased mileage deduction for rural mail carriers who use their 
own cars on their routes 
freelancers would be permitted to deduct expenses of a project 
in the year they are incurred rather than wait until a book 
painting or other work starts producing income the provision 
overturns a change brought about by the 1986 tax overhaul 
under the agreement rural letter carriers would be permitted to 
deduct 3375 cents per mile 50 percent more than the usual rate 
allowed for business mileage 
also approved by senior negotiators was agreement to eliminate 
restrictions on the amount of longterm bonds the treasury 
department may issue at rates above 425 percent 
aides said the two senior democrats and two senior republicans 
from each house agreed on these provisions which still are subject 
to endorsement by other negotiators 
taxwriters hope to complete the compromise tax bill in time for 
the house and senate to give it final approval next week before 
adjourning for the year 
on a 5025 vote last week the senate ordered the seizure of 540 
acres of land in prince william county va to block construction 
of a shopping mall on the site where gen robert e lee had his 
headquarters during the second battle of manassas in august 1862 
the reagan administration opposes the seizure as too expensive 
favoring the taking of only about 80 acres interior secretary 
donald p hodel has said he will recommend that president reagan 
veto legislation to which the manassas amendment is attached 
the sanctions against iraq were approved by the senate last week 
on an 870 vote the third time senators have thus registered their 
displeasure with iraqs use of poison gas against its kurdish 
minorities however the sanctions exempt us farmers and 
manufacturers of farm equipment by allowing continued exports of 
farm products 
the bill would immediately bar exportation of hightechnology 
equipment and munitions and require that us representatives in 
international organizations oppose loans to iraq 
the president would be required to impose additional sanctions 
by yearend if iraq continues to use chemical weapons those 
sanctions could include a cutoff of exportimport credit 
restricting imports from iraq and downgrading us relations with 
iraq 
final provisions of the tax bill are being hammered out behind 
closed doors by rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
house ways and means committee sen max baucus dmont chairman 
of the senate finance subcommittee on revenue measures and senior 
republicans on the two committees rep bill archer of texas and 
sen bob packwood of oregon 
the bill is designed chiefly to correct errors in the 1986 tax 
overhaul law it contains dozens of relatively minor targeted tax 
cuts and tax increases the senate version also would create a 
bill of rights for taxpayers involved in disputes with the 
internal revenue service

the average japanese earned the equivalent of 
23022 last year well above the us average of 18163 and the 
highest income among major industrialized nations surveyed in a 
study released thursday 
the us average also was topped by the west germans whose 
income averaged the equivalent of 21022 
when it comes to what the money will buy in technical tems 
purchasing power parity the average american remained in the 
lead with 9009 the west german income was calculated on this 
basis at an average 7783 the japanese at 7302 
the study japan in the world economy surveyed earning 
power in six of the major industrial nations after the top three 
nations france had a per capita income equivalent to 17657 
italy 14903 and the united kingdom 13395 
the authors call purchasing power a better measure of peoples 
prosperity since it takes account of the cost of food and housing 
which are especially high in japan 
for example the price of a house or apartment in a middle class 
tokyo district is said to be seven to 10 times the earnings of its 
owner a small apartment an hour and a half from the central part 
of the city cost nearly 500000 at the end of 1987 
in most european and american cities the cost is only four or 
five times earnings and the living space at least twice as large 
the twoyear study was done by americans bela balassa a 
consultant to the world bank and marcus noland a visiting 
assistant professor at saitama university in japan

first quarter losses for anac holding 
corp parent of revco ds inc nearly doubled over the same 
period last year because of extraordinary costs related to revcos 
chapter 11 filing the company reported thursday 
anac posted a 279 million net loss greater than the 14 
million loss in the same threemonth period last year 
the quarterly operating profit before depreciation and 
amortization was 61 million compared with 313 million in the 
same period last year according to gregory k raven revcos 
executive vice presidentfinance and chief financial officer 
anac had 5837 million in sales for the quarter compared to 
5228 million in its first fiscal quarter of 1987 
raven blamed the losses on extraordinary costs and temporarily 
low inventory levels directly related to the companys failure to 
make a subordinated debt interest payment on june 15 1988 and its 
voluntary filing for chapter 11 protection from creditors in 
bankruptcy court 
revco filed for chapter 11 protection on july 28 about a month 
after it failed to make an interest payment on about 700 million 
in outstanding highrisk junk bonds used to finance its 15 
billion leveraged buyout in 1986 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through 
borrowed funds repaid from a target companys profits or asset 
sales 
the twinsburgbased company sought protection from creditors 
after talks with bondholders broke down becoming the largest 
company involved in a leveraged buyout to take such action 
revco operates nearly 2000 drugs store in 27 states

president jose sarney on thursday fired 
the central bank director responsible for a massive jump in money 
market interest rates that caused stock prices to tumble and 
sparked a frenzy of rumors in financial markets 
sarney fired juarez soares after the director boosted the 
monthly interest rate on overnight money market investments from 39 
percent to 50 percent causing chaos when markets opened thursday 
according to presidential palace spokesman carlos de almeida santos 
the rate is adjusted daily 
soares told sarney he had hoped to steer investors away from 
nonmoney assets such as stocks property and gold and back into 
cash santos said higher interest rates increase the 
attractiveness of assets denominated in cruzados the brazilian 
currency 
in recent months investors have opted for noncruzado assets to 
protect themselves from steadilyrising inflation which is 
projected at 26 percent this month the stock market and the value 
of such investments have risen substantially 
but the market interpreted soares move as an indication of a 
much higher than expected inflation for this month creating a wave 
of panic and rumors that finance minister mailson da nobrega would 
be dismissed santos said 
in rio de janeiro the stock market closed down 38 percent 
technically the measure was right but soares chose a bad 
moment said geraldo moura a spokesman for the finance ministry 
inflation is high and there is a generalized instability
