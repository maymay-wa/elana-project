whatever your bag youll be welcomed 
to this farout enclave the rainbow family will call home next 
week but please curb your dogma 
thousands of people are descending on campsites in the superior 
national forest for the 19th annual rainbow gathering a weeklong 
mellowfest that officially begins sunday 
doctors and drifters alike bearded or beaded will shed their 
worldly trappings and get back to basics 
we try to speak gently to each other said one who would 
give only his rainbow name felipe rainbow 
the rainbow family is a loosely knit group of people and 
movements woven into what its members call a tribal gathering they 
travel to a different national forest each year to share their 
knowledge material goods and a desire for peace 
some stay the entire summer most hold regular jobs and arrive 
toward the end of june and stay the week 
us forest service officials say up to 10000 are expected by 
sunday at the site about 10 miles north of lutsen on lake 
superiors shore in northern minnesota 
although many rainbows share a vision for a peaceful planet all 
religious political and culinary preferences are welcomed 
were not any different from anyone else weve got every 
spectrum of the rainbow said tom 
like many rainbows tom got his name at a past gathering 
borrowing from a sanskrit word for ultimate harmony some names 
reflect the jobs family members perform as part of the tribe many 
take on spiritual meanings 
for many the gathering is a place to heal felipe rainbow a 
yaqui indian from mexico said he went to his first gathering years 
ago as a wasted alcoholic and found a new perspective on life 
we encourage people that leave the family to spread the news 
that theres people that coexist different cultures different 
religions that people can coexist in harmony felipe rainbow 
said 
bring your dogma here whatever experiences youve gleaned 
from your deity and life and share it said tom of the austin 
texas area but dont be hitting people over the head with 
your books because people dont want that 
while some show up just to party most arrive wellstocked with 
contributions each day a coffee can is passed around its 
contents pay for gasoline medical supplies and food 
look what they put in said michael bird a gold miner from 
grass valley calif digging his hand into the canister food 
stamps gold dubloons nuggets diamond rings phone numbers 
watches and dollar bills but mostly money 
a lot of people here have a simple philosophy about survival 
and the earth said debbie a porcelain artist from east 
tennessee one of the reasons we draw together is to network and 
see whos come up with new ideas its a time to come together and 
help each other grow 
still the rainbows have a reputation for flaunting the law and 
spreading disease 
in 1987 several rainbows at the gathering near brevard nc 
were arrested for drug use at the gathering half of the 12000 
people contracted dysentery and eventually spread it to 27 states 
according to us centers for disease control estimates 
larry dawson forest service district ranger said local and 
federal authorities did some checking when they heard the rainbows 
were coming here the villagers he said have been curious about 
the gathering but few have actively opposed it 
things have been going really well so far he said the 
rainbows have been doing this for 19 years so theyre keyed in to 
whats going on 
along streams in the campsite homemade signs remind members to 
boil water at least 15 minutes before drinking it and health 
officials arrive each day to survey the camp and give suggestions 
on washing dishes and bathing 
the rainbows respect for the earth is evident throughout the 
camp littering is taboo and gardens have popped up to let 
rainbows eat what they reap 
they dont mind being known as hippies at least in the 
environmental sense 
hippie comes from the word hep in the know said tom 
being knowledgeable is knowing not to throw your cigarette butts 
on the ground not only does it look nasty but the animals feed on 
them 
the gathering culminates each year on july 4 the sacred day the 
rainbows call interdependence day 
at high noon everybody does their thing in their own way 
pray or meditate and try to be peaceful within themselves and put 
that peaceful vibe out within the universe said debbie 
at that time almost like clockwork it is said that a rainbow 
appears in the sky according to rainbow lore one even appeared in 
a clear blue sky during a texas gathering a few years back after 
three months of drought

publicly imposed excommunication has become a 
rare penalty in roman catholicism but its considered automatic 
for those who unrepentantly obtain abortions 
sociological studies indicate it may apply to hundreds of 
thousands of catholics in such circumstances 
it also has become a potentially explosive issue between bishops 
and politicians 
the penalty barring a church member from holy communion and 
benefits of other church rites and prayers was formally imposed 
this month on an abortion clinic director in corpus christi texas 
such individually specific punishment is seldom decreed in the 
church these days it certainly is not commonplace said sister 
sharon ewart a canon law expert of the us catholic conference in 
washington dc 
however there was a 1986 case in providence ri in which a 
planned parenthood director was publicly named as automatically 
excommunicated 
other cases may seem similar yet are different its a complex 
variously conditioned process 
last november san diego bishop leo maher barred from communion 
a prochoice state senate candidate lucy killea but ms killea 
who was subsequently elected wasnt excommunicated from other 
church involvement 
that also is the case for an estimated 5 million to 6 million 
divorced and remarried roman catholics those in that category had 
been automatically excommunicated until a change made in 1977 
at that time us bishops with approval of the late pope paul 
vi revoked an 1884 decree by the american bishops automatically 
excommunicating divorced remarried catholics 
although that no longer applies such catholics still are barred 
from communion unless they secure an annulment of previous 
marriages or some other pastoral resolution of their cases 
current church canon law no 1398 prescribes automatic 
excommunication of those who secure an abortion and do not 
afterward change their stance meaning that they repent and seek 
absolution 
another canon no 1329 provides for automatic excommunication 
of accomplices to abortion that is those who enable someone 
to obtain an abortion who could not have done so without their help 
that canon was applied in the corpus christi and providence 
cases and there is considerable debate over its implications in 
reference to politicians who uphold laws permitting abortion 
new yorks cardinal john oconnor touched off a recent furor in 
saying such politicians were skirting grounds for excommunication 
persons excommunicated remain baptized church members and 
except in certain severe cases traditionally invoked by the pope 
may continue to attend church and associate with other members 
the penalty can be lifted through confessional repentance and 
determination to change conduct

firefighters at county fire 
department station 13 coped with a devastating sense of loss as 
they surveyed the charred remains of a community of beautiful homes 
they were hired to protect 
the 4900acre arson blaze that began wednesday swept through 
neighborhood after neighborhood leveling more than 400 homes and 
coming within several hundred yards of their firehouse 
one of the firefighters lost his home and everyone at the 
station knew at least one person whose house was destroyed 
the whole burn area is my area everything you see up there 
belongs to my district said capt carl durtche pointing to the 
charred hillside behind the station house four hundred of the 
homes that were lost were my homes i didnt know these people 
personally but you do have an attachment to the community 
as the blaze raged elsewhere firefighters at station 13 spent 
most of friday recovering from two days without sleep many of them 
had yet to assess the physical and emotional trauma of the fire 
but they seemed to feel the numbing sense of loss just as much as 
the homeowners who had counted on them 
since there werent enough beds to go around at the station 
house some firefighters friday were sprawled on the floor or 
asleep sitting up in chairs a few chatted quietly about the fires 
power 
one of the things that we do as firefighters is be around when 
people are allowed to go back and see their homes firefighter 
steve hobbs said on this fire we kind of just wanted to hide 
dan gaither said he knew some 25 people who had lost their 
homes including a 20year veteran firefighter who had laid out 
fire lines around his home 
you just realize there are certain conditions when you cant 
fight a fire gaither said 
allen meskimen who commands station 13 received a call friday 
morning from a longtime friend whose home had been gutted 
my friend just started crying to me over the phone meskimen 
said he got out but with nothing not even any photographs 
meskimen said the fire simply couldnt be turned back 
theres nothing much that could have been done he 
explained the men here take a lot of personal pride in their 
jobs they hate to see the loss the guys are pretty sensitive it 
was sad they guys realized they had a limited capacity to fight 
the fire 
still many of the firefighters most longtime santa barbara 
residents talked about rebuilding and took great pride in the 
handful of homes they were able to save 
its going to be a dead zone until the community gets itself 
together and rebuilds durtche said and we want to be a part 
of that we want to be able to help the community rebuild

a year after taking power sudans ruling 
junta is making some progress in resolving the countrys economic 
woes but has failed to end the civil war and is accused of abusing 
human rights 
imposing severe military discipline coup leader lt gen omar 
hassan ahmed elbashir has wiped out a rampant black market and 
controlled drug smuggling 
but the same harsh tactics have been used against critics of the 
new military government 
hundreds of government opponents have been arrested and more 
than 60 tortured since the coup on june 30 1989 according to a 
recent report by amnesty international 
elbashirs government denies wrongdoing 
political parties and trade unions were banned immediately after 
the coup parliament was dissolved and a promised new system for 
sudanese to participate in decisionmaking has not materialized 
the government executed 28 active and retired army officers by 
firing squad after a summary courtmartial found them guilty of 
attempting a coup against elbashir last april 
in addition to the 28 active and retired officers executed 16 
officers received sentences of up to life in prison and another 13 
officers were cashiered for opposing elbashir but the government 
gave few details of their alleged activities 
dissenting politicians and intellectuals who would not have 
hesitated to be quoted by name under the ousted civilian government 
of prime minister sadek elmahdi now refuse to have their names 
published for fear of government reprisals 
severe shortages of many basic commodities continue to plague 
the people elbashirs government has warned sudans 20 million 
inhabitants that there are more hardships to be endured before the 
situation gets better 
this month the government announced price increases of up to 50 
percent for commodities like gasoline tea and cigarettes this was 
part of a threeyear reform plan to end the budget deficit and 
adopt a market economy 
one ounce of sugar daily for the individual is not sufficient 
even if it is regular we wish the government would reconsider the 
quotas one homemaker said 
there is no sweet without fire and no honey without the sting 
of the bee said col suliman mohamed suliman a member of the 
15man ruling military council 
we know that hardships remain and that there are shortages in 
certain commodities but we are convinced that a bright future lies 
ahead he added 
after seeing a handful of convicted foreign currency smugglers 
and drug traffickers executed under new harsh military laws many 
sudanese appear to have been cowed 
strikes once an almost daily occurrence now seem unthinkable 
after a doctor leading a physicians strike was sentenced to death 
he was pardoned following protests from the united states and 
neighboring egypt 
government employees who once worked only a few hours in the 
morning now sit dutifully at their desks until the official end of 
the working day at 2 pm 
you may not like the military but you cannot deny they have 
put some discipline and order in the shaky civil service a 
sudanese expatriate said 
but the new governments main goal remains elusive the 
7yearold civil war in the south continues despite elbashirs vow 
to end it quickly the rebels want greater autonomy and a better 
economic condtions for the three southern provinces 
the civil war costs the government about a million dollars each 
day two rounds of peace talks between the government and the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army since last august have ended in 
deadlock no date has been set for further talks 
the government sems to have had more success in managing its 
foreign relations than in resolving some internal troubles 
last march sudan and libya signed an agreement calling for 
close cooperation in all fields for four years to be followed by 
unity it was the latest in a series of unity projects that libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi has sought with various arab countries since 
he seized power in 1969 
elbashir also has good relations with western countries though 
britain the united states and others have been vocal on the need 
to improve sudans human rights record

sponsors of a bill assuring workers unpaid 
time off for the birth of children and serious family illness 
acknowledge theyll have a difficult time trying to override 
president bushs veto of the measure 
bushs disapproval of the family leave bill friday set the stage 
for a new confrontation with congress and came despite substantial 
support for the measure among republicans as well as democrats 
if we dont succeed this time the president is going to see 
this bill every year as long as hes in the white house said 
sen christopher dodd dconn 
a group of 25 republicans had written bush asking for a chance 
to discuss their support for the bill with him but the chief gop 
sponsor rep marge roukema of new jersey said they never got 
their meeting before the veto 
i dont believe the president understands the implications of 
this veto said roukema the american people will not 
understand this action 
she called the veto an overreaction to business opposition and 
predicted it will create a politically difficult issue for 
republicans i think we run the danger of being perceived as the 
party that supports capital gains tax reduction and turns its 
back on working families she said 
in a written statement released just before he left for a maine 
vacation bush said he opposed establishing family leave as a 
federal requirement 
i strongly object to the federal government mandating 
leave policies for americas employers and work force he said 
we must ensure that federal policies do not stifle the creation 
of new jobs nor result in the elimination of existing jobs 
backers said they would attempt to override the veto but would 
need a demonstration of wide public support during the fourth of 
july congressional recess if they were to prevail 
the 237187 vote in the house last month for the family and 
medical leave fell 46 votes short of the twothirds majority that 
would be needed to override bushs veto 
i would think its doubtful but were going to persist 
said roukema if were unsuccessful well be back next year 
the bill passed the senate on a voice vote after leaders reached 
a bipartisan agreement to avoid a roll call dodd said he was 
within two or three votes of the twothirds override majority but 
that it would be up to the house to act first 
the bill would require business and government employers to 
provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or with 
leave for the care of a new child or an ill child parent or spouse 
it would exempt businesses with fewer than 50 workers and 
workers who among the highestpaid 10 percent within a company 
employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for 
those on leave and restore returning employees to their previous 
jobs or equivalent positions 
bush said the bill would restrict flexibility needed by american 
business to be competitive in world markets it was strongly 
opposed by business groups 
but supporters said the united states was the only 
industrialized nation that does not provide such minimum job 
guarantees to workers 
im stunned by the cynicism that this veto reveals said 
judith lichtman president of the womens legal defense fund and 
head of a coalition that lobbied for the bill president bush 
doesnt care about american families he really only cares about 
big business

nasa technicians are trying to find the cause 
of hydrogen leaks in two space shuttles that have grounded the 
fleet for at least two weeks 
the second leak was detected friday while engineers were 
testloading hydrogen rocket fuel into the propellant tank of 
shuttle atlantis a similar leak found in columbia last month 
forced postponement of its mission 
theres no question that we wont fly until we understand it 
the leak have it fixed have tested it verified it and were 
ready said bill lenoir spaceflight chief for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
once the leak has been found atlantis will be rolled back from 
the launchpad to the hangar at cape canaveral fla so engineers 
can remove its fuel tank and make the necessary repairs 
atlantis midjuly launch will be delayed at least two weeks 
but possibly longer if a new design is needed for the assembly of 
fuel pipes lenoir said 
columbia is already back in the hangar where it was taken after 
its leak was discovered on the launch pad just six hours before 
its scheduled may 30 liftoff its mission was postponed until 
august 
as nasa officials were explaining the leaks at a news briefing 
friday other agency officials were on capitol hill explaining 
troubles with the hubble space telescope 
sen albert gore jr dtenn charged that design flaws 
discovered earlier this week in the 15 billion spacecraft were 
symptomatic of broader problems at the agency that include a weak 
quality control system 
nasas eyes are bigger than its stomach gore said 
referring to the space telescope he said we have been 
assured now for 12 years that everything was all right we owe it 
to the taxpayers to find out what went wrong how to fix it and 
make sure it never happens again 
since both shuttle leaks occurred while the vehicles were being 
fueled on the pad it seems likely that these are related and of 
a similar class lenoir said in a news conference at the kennedy 
space center in florida 
they involve what is called the umbilical of the space 
shuttle an assembly of pipes and valves that directs the flow of 
propellants into the tank from a ground supply and at launch from 
the tank to the shuttle engines 
the safety of the umbilical system on shuttle discovery is also 
now in question the third member of the threeshuttle fleet is 
scheduled to launch a science spacecraft called ulysses into a 
polar orbit of the sun in october 
the timing of the ulysses mission is sensitive because its 
launch window depends on the alignment of the planets a delay 
could mean that the craft could not be launched for years 
lenoir said he would keep my eye on the launch schedule but 
we are not going to let the fact that weve got ulysses and we 
want to get to flights off before that affect the rigor with which 
we attack the problem 
and if that costs us a flight thats a shame but thats what 
its going to take he said 
nasa launched shuttle missions in february and april and had 
planned for six more this year with columbias launch postponed 
until august and other flights set for august october november 
and december some missions seem certain to slip into next year 
crews drained liquid hydrogen from the atlantis tanks and left 
them open to evaporate any remaining hydrogen before a purge with 
inert helium to carry away any remnant 
the vertical service structure was to be wrapped around the 
shuttle today pending further work on monday

the government ended a threemonth 
155institution series of savings and loan rescues and closings 
with a record 17 billion taxpayer bailout of centrust bank of 
miami 
regulators are paying great western financial corp of beverly 
hills calif to take over the 71 branches and 52 billion in 
deposits of floridas largest thrift institution 
centrust marks the biggest bailout of a single thrift so far 
but it likely will be topped when regulators find an acquirer for 
charles h keating jrs lincoln savings and loan association of 
irvine calif that rescue could top 2 billion 
in all friday the resolution trust corp created 11 months ago 
to clean up the thrift industry sold 14 institutions and closed 
one at an estimated cost of 3 billion 
the rtc has spent 16 billion to resolve 155 failures since its 
chairman l william seidman launched operation clean sweep at 
the end of march in response to complaints that the agency was 
moving too slowly before april 1 it had resolved 52 failures at a 
cost of 9 billion 
the activity of the last three months is rivaled only by the 75 
deals completed in december 1988 by the rtcs predecessor the 
federal home loan bank board 
when regulators seized centrust in february they blamed its 
failure on speculative investing including purchase of more than 
1 billion in junk bonds most of the bonds were sold by the 
investment banking firm drexel burnham lambert inc which later 
crashed itself 
they also cited the lavish spending of the institutions 
chairman david l paul who spent millions of dollars of deposits 
on a museumquality art collection kept at his home a company 
yacht limousines a corporate jet and goldplated toilets in the 
executive washrooms 
a fraud squad of investigators is examining the legality of 
328000 in political contributions by paul 
great western purchased about half of centrusts 67 billion in 
assets with the right to return them within three months if they 
turn out to be worth less than expected the assets include cash 
and investmentgrade securities residential mortgages and consumer 
loans 
the rtc will keep the rest including the junk bonds and try to 
sell them to other buyers 
in another major package of deals security pacific national 
bank acquired gibraltar savings of simi valley calif and an 
affiliated but separately chartered sampl of the same name in 
seattle wash 
security pacific gets 65 billion in deposits and control of 
six branches in washington and about 80 in california separately 
great western received an 18branch florida subsidiary of the 
washington sampl the estimated taxpayer cost of the gibraltar 
transactions totals 628 million 
despite the apriljune spree which included a oneday record of 
26 sales and closings on june 22 the bulk of the agencys work 
remains to be done 
with the failure of five more sampls on friday the rtc has 247 
sampls yet to sell or close and it expects at least that many now in 
private hands to fail in coming months 
i think theyve done a good job so far but they certainly 
have their work cut out for them said economist paul getman of 
regional financial associates in west chester pa 
rtc critics in congress have complained that sale of the sampls is 
the relatively easy part of the bailout program the agency so far 
is keeping about 70 percent of the institutions assets usually 
sour loans and distressed real estate far more difficult critics 
say will be selling the assets 
i think this is an important first step but it has to be 
understood as modest in relationship to the totality of the 
problem said rep jim leach riowa a senior member of the 
house banking committee 
we still wont know the true depth of the problem until the 
real estate and loan assets are sold he said 
seidman has said the rtc expects to scale back to resolving 
between 50 and 70 institutions in the julyseptember quarter over 
the last week the agency asked for bids on 73 institutions with 
combined assets of about 48 billion 
after that the corporation could be forced to suspend sampl sales 
for lack of money the 50 billion congress allocated last summer 
to cover thrift losses is running out congress and the 
administration are considering a second bailout as part of 
negotiations on the 1991 budget

marion barrys lawyer is portraying rasheeda 
moore as a vengeful exlover who trapped the mayor in an fbi sting 
operation because he had abandoned her for another woman 
moore a former model denied the suggestion friday at the 
mayors cocaine and perjury trial insisting i was not out to 
get mr barry 
but she acknowledged that she had repeatedly steered the 
conversation around to drugs during the secretly videotaped 
encounter with barry in a washington hotel room last jan 18 she 
conceded that barry was primarily interested that evening in having 
sex with her 
in her second day of crossexamination by barrys chief lawyer 
r kenneth mundy moore also acknowledged that she broke the fbis 
instructions and tried to persuade the mayor to use drugs 
midway through the fbi videotape in which barry ultimately 
smoked crack cocaine moore asked the mayor if he wants to use 
drugs 
no not tonight barry replied in the tape which was played 
in court thursday 
you felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade 
influence coerce or beguile barry into using drugs mundy asked 
moore 
i did she replied 
why did you do that the lawyer asked 
just in the gist of the evening said moore who said she 
got overcarried in performing her duties for the fbi 
in your zeal to get mr barry mundy said accusingly for 
all you knew he had been off drugs since may 1989 when moore 
moved to california 
not in my zeal the witness insisted i was not out to get 
mr barry 
what was your intent mundy asked moore 
working this operation with the fbi she replied 
the defense lawyer suggested that moore had been badly treated 
by the mayor and motivated by revenge 
were you mad at mr barry because he didnt return your 
calls throughout an eightmonth span in 1989 mundy asked 
no i wasnt moore replied 
she also denied that she was angry because the married mayor was 
involved with another woman maria mccarthy or because he had 
slapped her when they broke up their romantic relationship 
had moore been scorned a reporter asked mundy after the days 
court session 
a woman scorned mundy agreed immediately hell hath no 
fury like a woman scorned 
mccarthy was jailed for refusing to testify before a federal 
grand jury looking into the mayors alleged drug use she later 
relented and is now listed as a possible witness at barrys trial 
barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and 
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use one of 
the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation 
meanwhile friday us district judge thomas penfield jackson 
presiding in the barry case barred black activist clergyman george 
augustus stallings a barry supporter from attending the trial 
stallings a former roman catholic priest broke with the vatican 
by starting his own africanamerican church 
mundy and the american civil liberties union said they were 
asking the us court of appeals to overturn jacksons decision 
regarding stallings as well as his order thursday barring nation of 
islam leader louis farrakhan 
jackson said stallings and farrakhans presence in the 
courtroom would be potentially disruptive 
barry told reporters he could not understand why any citizen 
who wanted to use one of the four courtroom passes provided to the 
defense cannot do so 
so i think that we are in a totalitarian situation where 
bishop stallings or minister farrakhan cannot attend barry 
said its like in nazi germany

former president richard m nixon used his 
influence with the chinese government to press for the release of 
prominent dissident fang lizhi documents show 
the former president suggested last october that chinese leader 
deng xiaoping let the astrophysicist and his wife go as a goodwill 
gesture to improve uschinese relations nixon spokesman john 
taylor confirmed friday 
president nixon is not one to mince words he was there to 
raise the fundamental issues that were dividing our countries 
taylor said in a telephone interview from nixons office in 
woodcliff lake nj 
nixon followed up with a letter mailed april 3 
he wrote to deng in the spring and in an appropriately 
diplomatic way i recall president nixon did tell deng xiaoping 
there was no reason why the chinese should not be able to find a 
solution to the problem of fang and his wife taylor said 
the dissident and his wife arrived in england on tuesday after 
taking refuge inside the us embassy in beijing a year earlier at 
the time of the crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
during a meeting last oct 31 in the great hall of the people 
nixon told deng that in his 17 years of watching sinous 
relations there has never been a worse crisis according to a 
transcript of the conversation obtained by the associated press 
i have some suggestions as to small steps symbolic steps 
that would give president bush ammunition to fight longtime 
opponents of china and reassure those who would want to be 
friends the former president told deng 
deng responded by suggesting a simple way out the 
transcript said 
fang lizhi must give a written statement confessing to crimes 
and the american side must give assurances that fang lizhi will not 
be permitted to carry out activities against the prc peoples 
republic of china government abroad after this china can take 
some measures deng said 
i have not consulted with my colleagues about this idea or 
proposal deng told the former president 
according to a chronology that accompanied the excerpt nixon 
instructed the exchange be reported to the us embassy he also 
relayed the conversation to president bush the chronology said 
taylor said the former president traveled as a private citizen 
but had been invited by bush to dinner at the white house upon his 
return 
taylor said nixon had not received specific administration 
instructions to help secure fangs release but was relaying 
congressional concerns 
he said nixons experience working with deng to normalize 
relations between the two nations in the 1970s put the former 
president in a unique position to influence the chinese government 
meanwhile friday a us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said fang likely will move to the united states after 
serving as a visiting fellow at cambridge university he is 
expected to spend the transition period in england to appease 
chinese authorities upset by the us decision to grant him refuge

democratic national chairman ron brown 
today ridiculed president bushs handling of the savings and loan 
crisis and said taxpayer anger offered democrats a chance to win 
voters trust on managing the economy 
the sampl crisis and especially president bushs continuing 
total bungling of the cleanup is right at the center of the debate 
over the future of our country brown said in a speech prepared 
for leaders of the partys state affiliates 
it is a debate between those who preach policies of timidity 
and hiding underestimating problems procrastinating idly hoping 
someone else anyone else will take care of them and those who say 
we need bold aggressive active economic leadership brown said 
in his text 
a debate my friends between the republican 80s and the 
democratic 90s 
brown said footdragging by bush increased cost of the bailout by 
billions and he accused the administration of taking a casual 
approach toward investigating and prosecuting sampl fraud 
and he said bush now wants higher taxes to pay for the bailout 
yet refuses to provide more money for housing education and 
antidrug programs 
we have found the one cause for which george bush is willing 
to break his no new taxes pledge to clean up a mess caused by 
americas wealthiest people the bankers and speculators who ran 
the savings and loan industry into the ground brown said 
browns rhetorical assault escalates an attack democrats hope 
will resonate with voters not only this year but when the president 
seeks reelection in 1992 
several current and former democratic lawmakers during the 1980s 
intervened with regulators on behalf of sampls run by political 
benefactors and have now come under investigation 
but party strategists believe that overall the issue is ripe for 
inclusion in a renewed attempt by democrats to paint bush and the 
gop as wasting the tax dollars of low and middleincome americans 
on efforts to help the rich 
there will be democrats who pay the price said paul tully 
the partys political director but he endorsed the strategy which 
has gained steam as several prominent democrats govs mario cuomo 
of new york and douglas wilder of virginia among them have seized 
on voter frustration over the cost of the 200 billionplus bailout 
brown today gave the effort the partys blessing not only 
joining in the rhetorical assault on bush but by asking the partys 
executive committee to endorse a resolution laying blame for the 
crisis and rising bailout costs on the republican president 
the democratic partys position is clear we oppose paying 
for the sampl mess by unfair tax increases on working americans 
brown said 
he called on democrats to demand that more regulators be hired 
to police the industry and that the government seek to seize the 
assets of individuals who ran sampls the government is paying to bail 
out 
brown said bush personally shares some of the blame for the 
crisis because of his role when vice president in leading a task 
force that recommended less regulation of the sampl industry 
the savings and loan crisis was largely created by deliberate 
cutbacks in the supervision of the sampl industry under republican 
economic philosophy under two successive republican 
administrations he said

rebels closing in on the capital 
have captured the countrys main water treatment plant and shelled 
the international airport in a new wave of fighting after peace 
talks derailed 
power blackouts and shortages plagued the capital monrovia on 
friday and civilians who fled the fighting in this west african 
nation said the guerrillas appeared to be preparing to attack the 
city 
soldiers have abandoned a government checkpoint at nearby mount 
barclay 
the rebels who accuse president samuel doe of corruption and 
rights abuses had advanced to within 15 miles of the capital early 
this week by friday they had captured the main water treatment 
plant 12 miles out of town and fighting was reported in several 
locations 
in six months the rebels led by charles taylor have advanced 
from the northeastern tip of liberia to the southwestern capital on 
the atlantic ocean and say they will attack monrovia unless doe 
resigns 
they have refused to attend a second round of peace talks 
mediated by the liberian council of churches 
doe 40 has been resisting internal and external pressure to 
give up power and help end a tribal war in which soldiers and 
rebels have killed more than 1000 civilians in this ohiosized 
nation of 25 million 
the fighting has brought the countrys economy to the brink of 
collapse most businesses closed in monrovia after troops fired at 
protesters who marched wednesday to demand does resignation at 
least five demonstrators were critically wounded 
food and fuel shortages worsened friday in monrovia which has 
been without water since wednesday night rebelheld areas also 
were reported to be experiencing severe food shortages 
sources in the defense ministry said the water supply from white 
plains 12 miles from monrovia was turned off by technicians 
acting on the orders of seven soldiers guarding the facility the 
technicians fled as did the soldiers after two days of 
intermittent fighting 
monrovias electricity supply also was in danger according to 
frederick gobewole deputy managing director of the liberian 
electricity corp 
he said rebels had attacked the mount coffe hydroelectric power 
station thursday morning and were repulsed he said he has been 
unable to contact his staff at the plant north of white plains 
since thursday afternoon 
friday night monrovia was plunged into darkness power cuts are 
frequent in the city but usually last no longer than one hour the 
city remained darkened after more than 2 hours and it was unclear 
when the electricity would be restored it was unknown if rebels 
had seized the plant 
fighting also was reported friday at clay ashland 12 miles 
northwest of monrovia a defense ministry source said rebels 
ambushed a group of soldiers on foot killing the commander 
some approaches to the capital appeared to be defenseless 
at mount barclay northeast of the city an army checkpoint was 
deserted civilians leaving the village with cooking pots strapped 
to bundles of belongings said they saw about 10 soldiers leaving 
their posts and walk toward monrovia 
western diplomats and other sources reported heavy fighting at 
harbel the company town of the usmanaged firestone rubber 
plantation the worlds largest that borders robertsfield 
international airport 35 miles east of monrovia 
they said the airport terminal was heavily damaged by rebel 
shell and mortar fire but it was not clear who was holding the 
airport rebels had captured the airport wednesday but were driven 
off by soldiers on thursday the diplomatic sources said 
airlines stopped flying into the airport a month ago when 
fighting began at the plantation 
the only other scheduled international flights by air guinea 
into the spriggs payne airfield in monrovia ended thursday the 
airline said the liberian government asked it to stop the flights 
which have carried thousands of refugees no reason was given the 
airline said 
despite the departure of thousands of residents the capitals 
population probably remains at about 400000 because of the influx 
from refugees fleeing fighting in other parts of the country 
the insurgency has escalated into a tribal conflict most rebels 
are from the gio and mano tribes while government supporters are 
mostly krahns and mandingos doe himself is a krahn 
 
doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the 
descendents of american slaves who founded the west african nation 
in 1847 the american descendents historically monopolized power 
and discriminated against indigenous liberians

senior military commanders are under orders 
from the pentagon to give personal attention to arranging 
pooled news coverage of military operations 
although the media was deployed it was unable to cover 
military action until the second day and consequently did not 
perform as planned during the december invasion of panama said 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
powells message was sent to service chiefs and 
commandersinchief of military commands 
he needed no convincing to sign the message pete williams 
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs said in a letter 
to larry kramer chairman of the press bar and public affairs 
committee of the american society of newspaper editors 
williams said the message was sent may 18 
on the face of it it looks like they are making a pretty 
strong effort to improve the situation said kramer i really 
couldnt tell you how well its going to work until we have to use 
it it has been my impression that whether it worked well or not 
had an awful lot to do with the field commanders as opposed to the 
pentagon and this seems to address that 
kramer editor of the san francisco examiner wrote to defense 
secretary dick cheney on may 2 asking for a meeting to discuss 
possible revisions in the pool operation 
a pentagoncommissioned report issued in march said cheneys 
excessive concern with secrecy along with a lack of planning 
prevented reporters from covering the opening battles of the 
invasion of panama 
the report recommended that plans for military action include 
assurances that a pool travel with the us forces 
williams replying to kramer on cheneys behalf said the 
pentagon is considering the recommendations and making decisions on 
them as it completes the analysis of each 
richard schmidt legal counsel of the asne said i think it 
shows a spirit of cooperation and a desire to get the pool working 
as it should be 
powell told commanders that a new directive would be sent to all 
commands and to the services in the next few months 
in the meantime he said he was outlining basic guidelines 
to be followed in arranging pool coverage 
among other things he said pools should be given access to 
combat areas 
the media realize and accept there is an element of risk 
involved in accompanying military forces into combat powell 
said their personal safety is not a reason for excluding them 
from an area of ongoing operations 
essentially the goal should be to treat reporters as members 
of units allowing them to move with the units without recklessly 
exposing them to hostile fire whenever possible their coverage 
should be from positions of reasonable safety

industrialized nations pledged 240 million to 
help developing nations stop producing chemicals that damage the 
earths ozone layer and 56 countries agreed to ban those 
substances by centurys end 
many observers believe the conference was a prelude to more 
difficult negotiations later on global warming and reducing the use 
of fossil fuels 
representatives from 56 countries on friday approved provisions 
strengthening the 1987 montreal protocol on the production and use 
of the ozonedepleting chemicals chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
cfcs used in refrigeration insulation cleaning solvents and 
as aerosol propellents rise into the stratosphere where they break 
down in constituent chemical parts 
one of these chlorine destroys the thin shield of ozone in the 
atmosphere that filters out harmful ultraviolet rays helps 
preserve the earths flora and protects humans from developing skin 
cancer 
about 100 countries attended the twoweek conference but only 
the 56 parties to the montreal pact were allowed to vote on the 
agreement 
the 1987 protocol had called for a 50 percent cut in the 
chemicals by 2000 the new treaty bans chcs by 2000 and increases 
the list of controlled chemicals from eight to 20 
but like the 1987 protocol fridays agreement contains no 
penalties for violations and has no enforcement powers 
cabinet ministers from at least a dozen countries urged that a 
ban be imposed by 1997 but the united states japan and the soviet 
union insisted on an effective date of 2000 
we believe it is necessary and possible to do better than this 
timetable said west german environment minister klaus topfer 
unfortunately three countries refused to go along 
environmentalists said that during the threeyear delay 11 
billion tons of chemicals will be released into the stratosphere 
william reilly administrator for the us environmental 
protection agency noted that the treaty parties will meet again in 
1992 and the schedule for the ban could be speeded up then if 
necessary 
the conference agreed to a phaseout schedule that would cut 
cfcs by 20 percent in 1993 and 50 percent in 1995 before the final 
ban the 30page amendment to the montreal protocol also banned 
carbon tetrachloride by the end of the century and eliminated 
methyl chloroform by 2005 
some studies have suggested that even a ban by 2000 will not do 
enough to make the atmosphere safe 
in april two nasa scientists said in a study published in the 
british science journal nature that even if all emission were 
stopped in the year 2000 the ozonedepleting chlorine in the 
atmosphere would not drop to relatively benign levels until about 
2070 
in another move the conference approved an unprecedented 240 
million fund to assist developing nations build industries that do 
not rely on chemicals that deplete the ozone 
the fund sponsored by developed nations is seen by many as a 
model for solving other more costly environmental problems 
china and india will each receive 40 million over the next 
three years after they sign the protocol which they have said they 
will do bringing those two populous countries into the treaty was 
considered vital 
the fund will be controlled by an executive committee made up of 
developing and industrialized nations that will each serve 
threeyear terms 
earlier this month the white house dropped its opposition to 
the international fund to help poor nations phase out 
ozonedepleting chemicals 
us opposition to the fund had threatened to disrupt the london 
conference 
until the reversal the bush administration had maintained that 
any assistance to third world nations for phasing out cfcs should 
come from existing world bank resources but world bank officials 
said it would not afford such a program

memorial coliseum friday night as he pressed his campaign for 
economic sanctions to end whiteminority rule in south africa

fists into the air as mandela took the stage late friday night at 
the memorial coliseum 
we will not give up until apartheid gives in mandela boomed 
to the crowd which responded in cheers and applause 
thank you los angeles for staying with us up to the last hour 
for this we admire you we respect you and above all we love 
you he declared 
mandela praised hollywoods role in fighting apartheid 
while the world slept and apartheid ravaged us it was the 
noble sons and daughters of california who rallied to us he said 
africaninspired garb set the fashion tone for the evening with 
women donning brightlypatterned head scarves and kaftans many men 
also wore kaftans made of traditional tribal fabric 
its the same struggle free south africa and free the 
world said naacp member frank stokes this is a historymaking 
event me paying 10 dollars is a small contribution for a man who 
has been in prison for 27 years 
earlier mandela and his wife winnie stood in bright sunlight 
on the steps of city hall as a crowd estimated at 15000 chanted 
mandela and local officials and movie stars hailed him 
for us in our youth hollywood was the stuff of dreams 
mandela 71 told them in a sense our youthful dreams are to 
some extent being realized but we are particularly overjoyed to be 
in this city because los angeles is a staunch supporter of the 
antiapartheid movement 
mandela who spent 27 years in prison is deputy president of 
the african national congress 
he made no overt reference to the use of violence an issue that 
generated controversy in washington when he met with president 
bush and rejected the presidents plea that all parties reject 
violence 
however he said the finest tribute he could give to supporters 
of his cause is to intensify the antiapartheid struggle on all 
fronts 
he appeared however to try to mend fences with bush over the 
disagreement 
having met president bush and secretary of state james baker 
we would like to say that they are also a part of the 
antiapartheid forces of this country 
mandela thanked hollywood for its support during a fundraising 
dinner at the armory building where celebrity guests included 
diana ross ron kovic billy davis and marilyn mccoo 
more than 1 million was raised for the african national 
congress organizers said 
earlier mandela met privately with another former political 
prisoner natan sharansky who was jailed eight years in the soviet 
union the meeting at the biltmore hotel was arranged by the 
antidefamation league after jewish groups protested mandelas past 
praise for palestinian leader yasser arafat 
sharansky who now lives in israel noted later that the 
palestine liberation organization supported the african national 
congress struggle against apartheid and he believes mandela feels 
an obligation 
i dont consider him an enemy of israel sharansky said at a 
news conference which mandela did not attend i feel we 
established a good relationship with him and i hope it is the 
beginning of a serious dialogue 
los angeles was the seventh stop of a 12day eightcity us 
tour scheduled to end saturday in oakland canceling the last stop 
was considered friday because mandela was fatigued but it was 
decided to go ahead said katie broeren of mandelas advance team 
the us visit was part of a planned sixweek international tour 
that began june 6 
we are on the last leg of an exhausting but exhilarating 
tour mandela said at city hall where he focused on thanking 
americans for support 
we admire you we respect you and above all we love you he 
said 
the restless crowd sometimes booed the mayor city council 
president and celebrity speakers and chanted mandela in 
anticipation of his talk 
your soul has flown free and far kindred with the spirit of 
martin luther king and bobby kennedy and many others who challenge 
us to be better than we are mayor tom bradley told mandela 
the man whos awakened the conscience of america is here 
actor gregory peck told the throng gathered in 85degree heat 
the crowd ranged from movie stars such as paul winfield to skid 
row resident carl famous 44 
being a child of the 60s taking part in the struggle i 
think this guy is refreshing i thought the struggle was dead 
said famous 
winfield who once played the rev martin luther king jr in a 
movie said mandela inspired a new feeling of hope in many 
black americans 
several hours before the ceremony councilman gilbert lindsay 
89 the citys first black councilman and was sent to a hospital 
he was in stable condition and it was unknown why he collapsed 
before mandelas arrival the council acted to further ban 
contracts with companies doing business in south africa it 
approved a city charter amendment to ban such companies from making 
competitive bids for contracts over 25000 which were exempted 
from a 1986 ordinance approval puts the measure on the november 
ballot 
mandela was freed in february after spending 27 years in a south 
african prison for plotting sabotage to overthrow the countrys

tempers may simmer during heat 
waves but the anger people feel may have as much to do with 
watching the mercury rise as from the soaring heat 
dr dennis driscoll a biometeorologist at texas aampm university 
says many people become aggressive just from reading the 
temperature 
theres no doubt the heat makes us feel irritable and has 
consequences for the way we react to people said driscoll and 
yet the knowledge that it is going to be hot can be as negative an 
influence as the heat itself 
a recordsetting heat wave has scorched the desert southwest 
this week with temperatures hitting 122 degrees in parts of 
arizona and soaring into the 110s in many areas 
driscoll said tempers are also affected by sudden temperature 
fluctuations 
i think the heat has an impact in its own right he said 
but abruptly going from relatively comfortable to stressful 
environmental conditions also plays a role 
driscoll who specializes on the weathers impact on human 
behavior said staying cool requires more than seeking 
airconditioned refuge and drinking lots of fluids 
much of your thermal comfort depends on your frame of mind 
he said and if the weather report says its going to be 
especially hot you may be uncomfortable whether it is or not 
or to turn this around many people consider it relaxing to 
sit in saunas and submit themselves to temperatures far beyond what 
they would experience in nature he said 
driscoll said people seem to react more to high readings than 
freezing temperatures 
we notice that civil unrest occurs more frequently during 
times of extreme heat he said more people are outside and 
rubbing elbows during the summertime we also see a negative impact 
on test scores production in factories and performance levels in 
general

its a dark day for the black marketeers 
illegal dealers in east and west german currencies were plying 
their shady trade for a few final hours today before sundays 
economic merger of the two german states puts them out of business 
the black marketeers dot the street corners of east berlin and 
congregate on the sprawling alexanderplatz square but most do 
their currency dealing outside west berlins zoo train station 
there they set up a cacaphony of calls in german romanian 
polish and bulgarian trafficking in soontobeworthless east 
german marks 
starting sunday the legal tender in both german states will be 
the west german mark 
im not panicking yet said one black marketeer from 
budapest nervously clutching a wad of several thousand east german 
marks 
despite his current woes the trader said illegal money deals in 
the last two months have netted him nearly 15000 
changes were also in the works for the thousands of poles who 
have flooded into west berlin for weeks to make black market deals 
polish officials are tightening import controls on goods from 
west berlin in addition west german officials are considering new 
visa requirements for poles and other eastern europeans 
since the democratic reforms sweeping eastern europe loosened 
border controls west berlin has become an oasis of affluence in a 
region starved for consumer goods 
more than 120000 poles flock to west berlin each week jamming 
grocery stores and export shops many buy western goods ranging 
from satellite dishes to disposable diapers and then sell on the 
black market in poland 
joanna lewa a 53yearold unemployed mother of four from the 
polish port of gdansk expressed bitterness at the prospect of 
travel and import restrictions 
theyre tearing down the berlin wall and moving it to our 
border she complained as she waited in line with dozens of other 
poles in line outside an electronics shop 
things in poland are very bad said mrs lewa everywhere 
the people are unemployed and poor very few are optimistic 
the east germans she said were lucky they had a west germanys 
powerful economy to lift them out of poverty 
we arent getting the west german mark like the east 
germans she said our problems will remain

an abortion clinic director said 
she was devastated after being excommunicated by the roman catholic 
church but is more committed to her work 
bishop rene h gracida of the corpus christi diocese 
excommunicated rachel vargas director of reproductive services 
inc in a decree sent to ms vargas june 1 the decree bars her 
from the sacraments of the church including communion holy 
matrimony and last rites 
your cooperation in procuring abortions is a sin against god 
and humanity and the laws of the roman catholic church said the 
formal excommunication decree 
gracida told ms vargas in the decree that she can be reinstated 
by a sincere and total repentance and confession concerning the 
sin of abortion 
vargas said friday she considers herself a good catholic and 
plans to keep attending mass 
one part of me is devastated ms vargas said but another 
part is telling me im just more committed to the issue of choice 
what i believe does not guarantee me a place in hell 
ms vargas said she does not plan to fight her bishop however 
if anyone else has been excommunicated simply because they worked 
at an abortion clinic then we should band together she said 
frances kissling president of catholics for a free choice in 
washington dc called the decree part of a church campaign to 
silence catholics on the abortion issue and predicted it will drive 
more people away from the church 
what tends to happen when you do this is catholics become 
angry and tend to stop listening to the church she said it 
threatens the moral voice and authority of the church 
ms vargas said she received two warning letters from gracida 
before the excommunication decree another corpus christi abortion 
clinic director elva bustamante 48 said friday she has received 
two similar letters from gracida and expects to be excommunicated 
soon 
bill ryan a spokesman for the national conference of catholic 
bishops in washington said a precedent was set in 1986 when bishop 
louis gelineau of providence ri announced that a woman mary 
ann sorrentino excommunicated herself by directing planned 
parenthood in providence 
the churchs stand on abortion has drawn more attention recently 
as catholic officials have told public officials who support 
abortion rights that they might be denied communion 
last november bishop leo maher of san diego prohibited 
communion to a state senate candidate favoring abortion rights and 
cardinal john j oconnor of new york recently said in a church 
newspaper column that roman catholic public officials risked 
excommunication if they took such a stance 
he has since said his intention was to prevent rather than 
advocate the excommunication of catholic politicians who support 
abortion rights 
i cannot speak for whatever any bishop might do in his area of 
cognizance oconnor said friday following his appearance at an 
antiabortion conference in suburban chicago 
gracidas secretary said he is on vacation and cannot be reached 
for comment

for one last day today east germans were 
spending their ostmarks a currency about to become obsolete 
waiting in the wings was the mighty west german mark the new legal 
tender for both german states 
the economic merger effective when the clock strikes midnight 
tonight 6 pm edt will be the latest move toward unification of 
the two germanys 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere predicted friday 
that full unity will come by the years end that is the same 
timetable outlined earlier in the week by the west germans 
in another sign of the changing times east germanys state news 
agency said friday that former east german leader erich honecker 
will be investigated for murder in the deaths of more than 200 
people slain as they tried to escape his authoritarian rule 
honecker who was toppled in last falls revolution that ended 
four decades of communist government supervised construction of 
the berlin wall in 1961 after taking over as the countrys leader 
in 1971 he maintained shoottokill orders against wouldbe 
escapees 
as the two germanys prepared to merge their economies east 
german stores cleared their shelves and east german consumers 
snatched up what was left 
the countdown to the currency switchover caused shortages of 
food and household products in east berlin and other cities but 
that wasnt expected to last long 
on friday night west germanys ard national television showed 
long lines of west german trucks loaded with western goods jamming 
the highways to east germany 
the black marketeers who illegally trade in the currencies of 
the two germanys were out in force today getting in a few final 
hours of business 
at east german banks there were long lines as people filled out 
applications to convert their savings to west german marks banks 
will be open on sunday so east germans can withdraw their first 
convertible cash 
funds from east german wages pensions and savings up to 4000 
marks are being swapped at a onetoone rate for west german 
currency with additional savings at a twotoone rate the west 
german mark is worth about 60 cents 
east german lawmakers tried to prevent former communist 
officials who may have accumulated fat bank accounts from 
benefiting from the currency conversion 
parliament voted friday to require the east german state bank to 
report the names of east germans with more than 100000 marks in 
their bank accounts the average east german bank account is 5000 
and 10000 marks 
east germans are being urged to be thrifty with their new west 
german money economists fear a spending binge would dilute the 
strength of the mark and trigger inflation 
sigfried guterman a spokesman for the west german central bank 
the bundesbank said early indications are that east germans will 
save their money those filling out the currency conversion forms 
are required to list the size of their initial withdrawal and 
guterman said it averages about 800 marks or 500 
people seem to be quite thrifty he said the figure is 
far below what was expected we do not expect a spending spree 
analysts say 1 million to 4 million east germans could lose 
their jobs as outmoded inefficient entrprises try to compete on a 
free market but west german officials sought to assure east 
germans that the blow of factory closings will be softened by a 
surge in western investment 
east germanys economics minister helmut haussmann said half a 
million new jobs could soon be created and he predicted an east 
german economic boom

the national endowment for the arts working under 
antiobscenity funding restrictions denied grants to four 
performance artists whose acts have strong sexual content 
the four artists each of whom had received grants in the past 
were initially recommended by the endowments peer panel their 
grants were denied friday by the neas 26member council and 
chairman john frohnmayer fourteen other artists the panel 
recommended were awarded 104000 
frohnmayer speaking in portland ore said the federal 
agencys survival is threatened by a handful of controversial art 
pieces two days earlier in seattle frohnmayer said political 
realities meant he would likely have to veto some grants 
recommended by the panel 
a remarkable experiment that has lasted the last 25 years and 
has so enriched our country is indeed threatened because of 20 
images out of a million we have funded frohnmayer told the city 
club in portland 
the neas 1990 appropriations bill included antiobscenity 
restrictions adopted amid protests over works such as robert 
mapplethorpes homoerotic photography and andres serranos crucifix 
submerged in urine both of which received federal funds 
fridays decision prompted charges the artists were the latest 
victims in a movement to clamp down on artistic freedom 
im outraged said john fleck a los angelesbased 
performance artist whose pieces touch on such topics as aids 
religion the environment and homosexuality 
i think theres a strong movement going on to wipe out 
different voices to have a homogeneous voice that suits certain 
peoples morals fleck said 
last year fleck received an nea grant but his application was 
rejected friday along with those of artists tim miller holly 
hughes and karen finley 
we feel basically that its like the wall is going down in 
berlin while its coming up here in the united states said 
michael overn who is finleys husband and manager 
philip arnoult director of the theater project in baltimore 
said distorted descriptions of the artists work in the media had 
done terrible damage to the performers themselves 
these are fellowships for artists who are making a significant 
contribution to the field in the solo performance world said 
arnoult who was chairman of the panel on theater and some of 
them are dealing with issues of sexual identity of oppression in 
society of the plague of aids 
in recent weeks such venerable arts groups as the new york and 
oregon shakespeare festivals the university of iowa press and the 
paris and gettysburg reviews have returned their 1991 nea grants to 
protest the federal antiobscenity guidelines

workers at a third us company 
were threatening to join a growing strike that has paralyzed 
honduras only petroleum refinery and the huge chiquita banana 
exporter 
president rafael leonard callejas who faces the worst crisis 
since taking office in january said in a brief telephone interview 
friday that he has appealed to other unions not to expand the 
walkout 
callejas said he hoped there will be a satisfactory 
resolution to the growing number of strikes for the good of the 
country 
leaders representing hundreds of thousands of workers have 
threatened to call a strike in solidarity with 10000 employees at 
cincinattibased chiquita who walked off the job thursday 
demanding their pay of about 15 a day be increased 60 percent 
the 4000 workers at castle and cooke a subsidiary of standard 
fruit of new york will strike beginning monday if chiquita 
brands doesnt accede to its workers demands said mauro 
gonzalez president of the standard fruit union 
friday 2000 workers shut down texaco caribbean inc honduras 
only oil refinery in solidarity with the chiquita walkout and a 
company official warned lack of fuel could paralyze the country 
if there isnt a rapid resolution to the strike honduras will 
be out of fuel in three days said manuel crespo the head of 
texaco 
the workers at the three us companies belong to the 
70000strong national federation of workers unions which has 
threatened further action other labor groups including the 
600000member workers confederation have said they will strike if 
chiquita refuses to negotiate 
chiquita brands international inc and standard fruit control 
virtually the entire honduras banana industry and bananas are its 
principal crop export 
formerly called united brands and before that united fruit 
chiquita has enjoyed a near monopoly on honduran bananas since 
1912 controlling 60 percent of the fruits exports 
although it has waned in recent years the two banana exporting 
companies still wield a big influence in this impoverished nation 
of 48 million people whose annual per capita income of 740 is the 
lowest in the western hemisphere after haiti 
honduras was the first central american nation to be dubbed a 
banana republic because of the vast influence of the us fruit 
companies 
many fear prolonged labor unrest could destabilize the country 
one of the united states closest allies in central america 
chiquitas employees average 1532 a day and their last raise 
was in 1984 even though honduras has suffered annual inflation of 
about 50 percent since then 
renee ayestas head of the chiquita union said the company 
notified a presidential commission trying to find a solution to 
the dispute that it is willing to start negotiations beginning 
this afternoon 
but the report could not be immediately confirmed no company 
spokesmen were available for comment when ayestas made the 
announcement in a telephone interview friday night 
texaco has a complete monopoly of honduras petroleum industry 
it controls all 100 service stations refines 8000 of the 12000 
barrels a month the nation consumes and imports the rest already 
refined

quebecs premier and the leader of a separatist 
party have agreed to set up a panel to map out quebecs political 
future at a time when nationalist sentiment is resurfacing in the 
frenchspeaking province 
at a crucial time in its history quebec is united premier 
robert bourassa said following a 90minute meeting friday with the 
head of parti quebecois jacques parizeau 
parti quebecois spearheaded a 1980 referendum to open talks with 
the federal government on political autonomy for quebec the 
countrys largest province but the measure was rejected 
fridays meeting an unusual show of unity was in response to 
the defeat of the meech lake accord an attempt to gain quebecs 
signature on canadas 1982 constitution 
the measure would have designated quebec a distinct society 
a provision that would have had little practical impact but had 
great symbolic value to the 65 million quebecois 
the accord died last weekend after it failed to garner approval 
of all 10 provinces many in quebec viewed the accords failure as 
a rebuff by englishspeaking canada and some predicted it would 
revive separatist sentiment in the province 
the nonpartisan parliamentary commission agreed upon by 
bourassa and parizeau will be made up of representatives of labor 
business universities municipalities and members of political 
parties 
the commission which will travel around the province to sound 
the opinions of quebecois on a variety of issues including 
separatism 
what we have done is an important first step in defining what 
quebec wants not as far as the rest of canada is concerned but 
what quebec wants as far as quebec is concerned said parizeau 
the leaders of the two parties will meet with their caucuses 
july 10 to set guidelines for the panel the leaders said they 
hoped the commission would begin work this fall and produce a 
nonbinding report by the end of the year 
both leaders said it would be up to bourassa to use the 
commissions recommendations as a basis for a referendum an 
election or as a bargaining chip to resume negotiations with the 
federal government over possibly reconsideration of a special 
status for quebec within canadas federation

kenosha paid homage to its economic revival 
by detonating a 250foot smokestack that stood as the last remnant 
of a oncemammoth chrysler corp plant that shut down in 1988 
the former factory town of 77000 has embarked on a 
revitalization effort that has lured new business with development 
projects like a planned multimilliondollar marina along lake 
michigan 
hundreds of residents including some of the 5500 auto workers 
who lost their jobs gathered at the site of the old plant friday 
as engineers detonated explosives and the smokestack of stone 
metal and wood came crashing down 
many cheered its departure from the local skyline others were 
sorry to see it go 
the last symbol of what had been will now be a memory in our 
past said mayor patrick moran the old symbols come down and 
the new symbols of kenoshas rebirth can be seen 
but joel hoholik 37 who worked at the plant for 17 years 
thought the stack could have served as a memorial its too bad 
that kenosha considers monuments secondary he said 
i think its about time they got rid of it said tr garcia 
42 a kenosha resident who came to cheer the blasting what we 
need to do is develop the lakefront and this thing is the last to 
leave 
garcias thoughts were echoed by many in the crowd who chanted 
goodbye chrysler and american motors and chrysler are 
history 
kenosha has erased many of the bitter memories of the december 
1988 closing of the centuryold chrysler complex formerly operated 
by american motors corp 
the keys to the recovery have been a multimilliondollar aid 
package from chrysler an aggressive retraining program for 
displaced workers and an economic development plan that has lured 
dozens of new businesses 
the communitys image is probably the best its been in 100 
years city planner ray forgianni jr said the closing was 
almost like a catalyst the handwriting was on the wall the 
economy needed to diversify 
in addition to the marina plans other signs of rejuvenation 
include the 45 million dairyland greyhound park race track that 
opened this month creating 700 jobs and the construction of a 
food company warehouse and navy research center that will employ 
hundreds more 
figures released thursday by the state showed unemployment in 
the kenosha metropolitan area declined from 71 percent in april to 
59 percent in may

mainly in community donations from peoria residents 
all our prayers to god were answered said larry chianakas 
38 a nextdoor neighbor of heimdals parents roy and marge 
were ecstatic theres going to be a big celebration when he 
comes home and im sure this home and this neighborhood is not 
going to be big enough to hold it 
his sentiments were echoed up and down the street where the 
heimdals live in a middleclass neighborhood of this central 
illinois city 
the familys plea for help generated 60000 in just four days 
money continues to pour in from around the country 
these are very private people and they had to bare their souls 
to the whole world that they have nothing said another neighbor 
mary noirot i felt so sorry because theyve had so much bad luck 
weve watched the agony of this now we want to see the 
ecstacy when he returns she said

motorcycles and dabbled in karate before a stint in the us army

in the sunset years of british rule over this 
last outpost of a colonial empire hong kong finally has a baroness 
to call its own 
the title goes to dame lydia dunn who was awarded a life 
peerage in the queens birthday honors list this month 
a key adviser to the colonial governor and a leading 
businesswoman she becomes the first ethnic chinese the first hong 
kong woman and the second hong kong representative in the house of 
lords 
as with everything that happens in hong kong these days the 
honor is being evaluated in light of 1997 when britain will hand 
over the territory of 57 million people to communist china 
dame lydia 50 believes her seat in the lords will provide the 
colony another avenue to press hong kongs case to the british 
i do not look at this in terms of a personal honor she said 
during a recent interview at her posh downtown office i see this 
as a major gesture to hong kong by the british government to 
give hong kong every chance to air its voice in a more direct way 
in particular she has been arguing that london has a moral duty 
to grant british residency rights to millions of hong kong people 
as an insurance policy of last resort in case of calamity with the 
chinese takeover 
although the british government has proposed offering 
citizenship to only 225000 people dame lydia believes thats 
not the end of the road one hopes that the door is still open 
others believe the life peerage will ultimately work against her 
effectiveness as a local leader they note that britains influence 
in hong kong is waning and that the new masters in beijing have 
shown little inclination to work with residents with strong ties to 
london 
i dont think lydia dunn has any future as far as china is 
concerned said norman miners an instructor of political science 
at the university of hong kong she has no future after 1997 
dame lydia educated at the university of california at 
berkeley is an executive director of swire pacific ltd one of 
the colonys venerable trading hongs as well as a director of hong 
kongs premier bank and airline 
she also is chairman of the hong kong trade development council 
and has traveled the world drumming up business for the territory 
her political career took off in 1976 when she was appointed by 
the governor to the legislative council a rubberstamp legislature 
that primarily serves as a forum for public debate she now is 
senior appointed member of the executive council a cabinetlike 
body that advises the governor

the government is banning use of mercury in 
indoor paints because of possible poisoning from inhalation and 
other exposure 
the registrants of mercury paint preservatives have agreed to 
ban the use of mercury in indoor paint effective aug 20 1990 
linda fisher assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic 
substances at the environmental protection agency said friday 
mercury a highly poisonous substance also is being eliminated 
from dualpurpose or exteriorinterior paints 
paint for outdoor use only may contain mercury but must carry 
new warning labels to inform consumers when they do 
mercury compounds are used as a preservative in about 30 percent 
of the waterbased latex paint products currently on the market 
oilbased paints do not contain mercury but manufacturers 
previously were not required to include such information on labels 
store merchants must add the new labels to paint currently on 
their shelves that contain mercury at levels higher than 200 parts 
per million 
new labels must stress that mercurycontaining products should 
be limited to outdoor use warn of potential health hazards and 
caution against exposure to children 
in addition mercury preservative manufacturers must submit new 
testing data to determine the potential risks for continued outdoor 
use of mercurycontaining paints and other products 
other products acoustical plaster adhesives and spackling and 
joint compounds generally used in construction work also contain 
mercury 
the epa did not recommend paint removal or repainting areas 
covered some time ago but said painted rooms should be thoroughly 
and frequently ventilated 
consumers who want to dispose of old paint and other 
mercurycontaining products should do so through community 
hazardous waste programs or other government offices 
the agency estimated it would take three months to get the new 
products on the market 
the epa will provide information to the public on specific 
paints on the national pesticide telecommunication network at a 
tollfree telephone number 18008587378 
only a ban on use of existing stocks and product recall will 
prevent unacceptable public exposure said catherine karr a 
toxicologist for the national coalition against the misuse of 
pesticides 
the epas actions were prompted by a case of severe mercury 
poisoning or acrodynia in a 4yearold michigan boy when his home 
was being painted last year after four months of intensive 
bloodcleansing therapy the child has almost fully recovered said 
dr william roper director of the federal centers for disease 
control

one of the few people who believe william 
shepard can topple gov william donald schaefer in the november 
election is his wife 
thats why shes his running mate 
shepard a republican has until monday to file for candidacy in 
the gubernatorial race against schaefer a heavily fancied democrat 
seeking a second term he chose his wife over at least two other 
possible candidates 
the decision he admitted is a trifle hazardous some 
republicans were quick to criticize 
politically its a disaster said a former gop chairman 
dr allan levey because after the novelty wears off the people 
of the state of maryland are going to reject that totally as an 
alternative for governor schaefer 
levey said he was so disturbed by the husbandwife concept that 
he would volunteer to serve as chairman of republicans for 
schaefer 
the governor appeared only slightly unperturbed 
aw come on he said before adding thats very nice 
shepard is a retired foreign service officer his wife lois 
was appointed director of the federal institute of museum service 
by president reagan in 1985 and served in the 68700ayear post 
for four years 
her nomination which followed her work on the reaganbush 
campaign was criticized because of her lack of experience in the 
museum field the realtor and former teacher defended the 
appointment on the basis of her administrative abilities and 
experience 
looking at lois candidacy on the merits people will conclude 
what i have concluded shepard said she directed a federal 
agency and she is familiar at first hand with budget matters 
authorization and appropriations 
gop state chairman joyce terhes said she had found two other 
running mates for shepard but said he was not considering other 
candidates 
it is fait accompli she said its hard when youre 
breaking new territory i dont want it to overshadow the issues 
his campaigning staff will definitely have to look up strategies 
how they can accentuate the positive

officials said today 
to western eyes the picture which appeared in all of japans 
major newspapers today might have seemed to capture a spontaneous 
and tender gesture by a new bride 
but officials of the imperial household agency the caretakers 
of the royal family were horrified 
prince aya 24 the youngest son of emperor akihito married 
graduate student kiko kawashima 23 in an elaborate ceremony on 
friday at an official picturetaking session after the wedding 
the newlyweds were preparing to pose with ayas parents emperor 
akihito and empress michiko 
the princes hair was a little ruffled and the princess 
smoothed it 
photographer toshiaki nakayama one of two palaceauthorized 
photographers present snapped a picture of the fleeting gesture 
before taking the official portrait 
palace officials called it a betrayal of trust 
to make an extreme analogy its only natural for instance 
that one wouldnt take a picture of the prince with his pants 
down said an agency official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the agency said it was uncalledfor to release a picture that 
was taken by mistake 
but nakayama defended the photo 
if it was taken at the wrong time he asked why didnt 
the chamberlains standing at my side say something then 
nakayama was barred from covering official postwedding events 
today and the agency said the ban may be permanant 
although nakayama works for the kyodo news service the imperial 
household agency says it considers photographers authorized to take 
pictures of the royal family as semiemployees of the palace 
since 1959 the two authorized photographers have been selected 
from the tokyo press photographers association an organization 
made of japans 11 largest newspapers and wire services no foreign 
organizations are members 
the palaceauthorized photographers take pictures at locations 
and times dictated by the imperial household agency and are 
required to turn over their negatives to the agency 
but the agency allows the pictures to be distributed before it 
checks the negatives by the time palace officials saw nakayamas 
offending photo it was too late 
nakayama said the photo was the first commemorative picture of 
the royal family in more than 30 years with the subjects not 
standing fully face front 
emperor akihito who ascended the chrysanthemum throne after the 
death of his father emperor hirohito last year has been credited 
with trying to soften the rigid and formal image of japans 
imperial family 
princess kiko the daughter of a college professor is only the 
second commoner ever to marry into the imperial family

a talking coughing barking magpie named 
joe seized from his longtime owners in a legal tangle over his 
protection was heading home with a little help from his friends 
two us senators and 316 signers of free joe petitions got 
the bird sprung from a zoo and back into the care of a retired 
couple 
the us fish and wildlife service confiscated joe on june 11 
from bill and mil peterson who adopted him 16 years ago after he 
fell out of his nest 
the couple didnt know the federal migratory bird treaty which 
protects a variety of bird species included magpies newspaper 
coverage over joe brought the unique pet to the attention of the 
wildlife service which packed him off to the grand island zoo 
the petersons didnt give up they collected petition signatures 
in support of joe and enlisted the help of nebraskas us senators 
in getting a special permit to keep joe 
interior secretary manuel lujan on friday said joe could go home 
i was afraid they would destroy my bird mrs peterson said 
joe due home today often tells visitors come in when he 
hears a tap on the petersons door he calls mil when teased 
and kitty kitty to the family cat snoopy 
cleveland vaughn a fish and wildlife service agent said free 
joe supporters have been many and vocal 
i have never had so many calls in my life he said my 
friends are saying to me hello mr magpie evening my kids are 
teasing me telling me youre picking on those poor people 
vaughn said he received at least 100 calls about joe at work and 
at home about 75 percent in favor of handing over joe to the 
couple 
the zoo will retain ownership of joe but the petersons get 
custody vaughn said 
craig faanes an ornothologist with the fish and wildlife 
service in grand island said friday that this is a specific 
solution to a specific problem the law remains unchanged 
the law allows zoos and educational institutions to have these 
birds but not private citizens 
it just kind of mushroomed into something that i really didnt 
even think about vaughn said it makes me look like a very 
mean person and then it makes my agency look also like an outfit 
thats out of control in some kind of way and that wasnt my 
intention 
us sen jim exon took the senate floor early friday in joes 
behalf 
let joe the magpie go home said exon who called and wrote 
lujan for the special permit and sponsored a bill with sen bob 
kerrey to have the bird returned 
as wonderful as the grand island zoo is for joe it is not 
home exon said

an opposition party founded during the 
prodemocracy uprising that was crushed two years ago won a 
landslide victory in mays parliamentary election according to 
final official results released today 
the national league for democracy captured 396 out of the 485 
parliamentary seats contested in the may 27 election officials 
said poor communications transportation and weather had delayed 
the vote counting 
the league now faces delicate negotiations with burmas military 
leaders who still wield absolute power in the country and who have 
been vague about when that power will be turned over to the elected 
government 
the state radio said the national league for democracys main 
rival the national unity party won only 10 seats in the election 
before the election some analysts had predicted the national 
unity party which has military support and large financial 
reserves would do much better 
the rest of the seats were shared among various smaller 
prodemocracy groups and parties representing burmas many ethnic 
minority groups 
more than 2000 candidates from 93 political parties as well as 
87 independent candidates contested the election in which more 
than 70 percent of the 21 million eligible voters cast ballots 
the elections were preceded by arrests of national league for 
democracy and other prodemocracy advocates intimidation and 
severe restrictions on campaigning but the election itself 
observed by foreign media and rangoonbased diplomats was widely 
regarded as orderly and fair 
the league will clearly dominate the 492member parliament but 
just how far it can go to dismantle a quarter century of military 
dominance of political life remains to be seen 
the league is seeking a dialogue with the military junta which 
seized power in september 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide 
uprising for democracy the military has said a constitution must 
be adopted by the new parliament before power can be handed over to 
a civilian government 
at a twoday meeting that ended friday the league declared it 
would seek the release of its leader aung san suu kyi who has been 
under house arrest for almost a year the daughter of burmas 
independence hero aung san was widely regarded as the driving force 
behind the leagues victory although she was barred from taking 
part in the elections

lech walesa in political conflict with 
backers of the solidarity prime minister convened a packed meeting 
of solidarity activists today aimed at creating a new national 
movement 
walesa told the meeting of local citizens committees 
representatives from around the country that poland has reached a 
turning point and its revolution may need repairs to keep from 
going bad 
meanwhile it appeared that polishborn pope john paul ii may be 
lending his immense moral authority among poles to the prime 
ministers camp by calling for national unity and support for him 
in letters newly made public 
the walesa gathering was held in a steamy hall at the parliament 
where the polish senate normally meets 
although many senior solidarity activists who recently have 
broken with walesa were not present the chamber was overflowing 
the meeting began with walesa associate zdzislaw najder making 
public a june 18 letter from john paul to walesa in which the pope 
praised walesa as a guide and point of reference but appealed 
for unity in poland 
let everyone to whom poland is precious work together and 
unite themselves in solidarity around a program of repairing the 
republic said the letter written to thank walesa for his may 
birthday greetings to the pontiff 
another papal letter this one to prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki and released friday by state media said the prime 
minister had become a personification of efforts to build a new 
social community in poland based on truth justice and mutual love 
this effort should rally around itself all poles the pope said 
vatican officials responding to press reports in italy that the 
pope has endorsed mazowiecki denied any favoritism in the letters 
walesa and najder called the meeting two weeks ago in what 
appeared to be a move to preempt a similar meeting of citizen 
committee representatives scheduled sunday by supporters of 
mazowiecki 
the backtoback sessions amount to a battle between walesa and 
mazowiecki for the hearts and minds of solidaritys grass roots 
local citizens committees sprang up to wage last years 
parliamentary campaign that opened the way to a solidarity 
government in august they were overseen informally by a national 
citizens committee of leading intellectuals and union activists 
who served at walesas invitation 
now mazowieckis backers hope the local representatives 
assembling sunday will set up a new national political federation 
based on traditional solidarity values but freed from walesas 
often autocratic leadership it would act as a popular base for the 
government which now is introducing painful economic reforms 
walesa argues for a national citizens movement that is free to 
either criticize or support the government and that would be a 
forum for arguing policies among various political groups 
including some that were excluded from the old solidarity movement 
as being too extremist 
activists did not rule out that two new rival national citizens 
committee movements would emerge from this weekends meetings one 
affiliated with walesa and one loyal to mazowieckis government 
at a stormy meeting on the national citizens committee june 24 
in which 63 of walesas oldest advisers broke ranks with him 
critics accused walesa of trying to turn the committees into tools 
for his widely expected campaign for president 
walesa apparently trying to cool emotions today took a 
moderate tone in opening the meeting he said only that polish 
reforms have reached a turning point and it is necessary to 
open up the political system to other voices 
all kinds of revolutions were beautiful until they started to 
take the place of their predecessors it was just a matter of time 
to show they were very bad ours was too wonderful and ours may 
have this same fate 
he said he feared that unless some changes are made there 
will be no time to repair it 
najder urging the citizens committees to open themselves up to 
other ideological groups told the assembly the issue was whether 
polish democracy will be built up from the bottom or handed down 
from the top is it supposed to be a spontaneous or planned 
democracy

britains leading animal protection group warned 
animal lovers saturday that pigs are better suited to the farmyard 
than the backyard 
the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
issued the statement in response to press reports that potbellied 
pigs were becoming increasingly popular as pets especially in the 
united states 
an rspca inspector recently rescued a 5monthold vietnamese 
potbellied pig from a tiny london apartment where it was sleeping 
in a tea chest with no electricity or drainage 
rspca spokeswoman amanda aviss said reports had spoken of 
americans using vietnamese or chinese potbellied pigs as fashion 
accessories driving around in fast cars with the top down and the 
pigs in the passenger seat 
pets arent fashion accessories or designer items they are a 
tremendous commitment and responsibility 
no one in their right minds should enter the responsibility 
lightly and a vietnamese potbellied isnt a light 
responsibility she said at the rspcas annual meeting in london 
pigs are very loyal they can be house trained but theyre 
not suitable as a domestic pet mrs aviss said they look 
gorgeous as little piglets but people are taking on more than they 
bargained for because they do grow to a tremendous size 
the rspca was only aware of odd incidents of people keeping 
potbellied pigs as pets in britian but she added were always 
concerned that whats in america today could be here in britain 
tomorrow

the misshapen mirror in the hubble space 
telescope and the hydrogen leaks that grounded the shuttle fleet 
are jolting the us space agency just as it is recovering from the 
challenger disaster and fixing its sights on mars 
in the 4 years since challenger exploded on launch at the 
kennedy space center in florida killing seven astronauts the 
national aeronautics and space administration has struggled to 
rebuild an image that has been marked since its infancy by 
tribulations as well as triumphs 
in january president bush asked congress to increase the 
agencys budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 by 175 
percent to 141 billion including a start on his plan to send 
astronauts back to the moon and then on to mars within 30 years 
a bill containing 1429 billion passed the house on thursday 
committee action is scheduled in the senate in september 
on wednesday nasa announced that a focus flaw had crippled 
hubble the 15 billion orbiting laboratory it sent into space in 
april with such high hopes officials of hughes danbury optical 
co which manufactured the telescopes two main mirrors said 
experiments had shown that one of the mirrors was incorrectly 
shaped 
the telescope had been designed to permit astronomers for the 
first time to peer 14 billion light years into space instead said 
nasa it will do little better than telescopes on earth 
it is very disappointing extremely disappointing said kim 
leschly of the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
sen albert gore dtenn chairman of the senate commerce 
subcommittee on science technology and space opened hearings on 
the matter friday investigations were also planned by 
appropriations subcommittees 
then on friday nasa announced at the kennedy space center that 
a hydrogen leak had been found on the space shuttle atlantis a 
similar leak had grounded the shuttle columbia in may 
nasa said all shuttle flights would be suspended until the leak 
problem was fixed 
after challenger blew up nasa was criticized for an 
overambitious shuttle flight schedule for failing to heed warnings 
about the design of the shuttles booster rockets and for not 
keeping a ready reserve of expendable rockets to back up the 
shuttle 
now questions have been raised about testing programs that 
should have detected the shuttles hydrogen leaks nasa also has 
admitted it tested the two hubble mirrors individually on the 
ground but not together in order to save money 
nasas eyes are bigger than its stomach gore said at 
fridays hearing later he added we owe it to the taxpayers to 
find out what went wrong how to fix it and make sure it never 
happens again 
since its formation in 1958 nasa has had moment after moment of 
glory on may 5 1961 when alan shepherds suborbital flight made 
him the first american in space the next year when john glenn 
became the first in orbit on christmas eve 1968 when a threeman 
crew orbited the moon and mans first landing on the moon at 417 
pm edt on sunday july 20 1969 
but there also have been disasters on dec 6 1957 with nasa 
still in the future and the navy running the fledgling space 
program the first us effort to launch a space satellite ended in 
failure with a rocket explosion at cape canaveral fla on jan 27 
1967 a spark traced to faulty wiring touched off an inferno that 
incinerated astronauts gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee 
inside the apollo 1 cabin at the kennedy launch pad on jan 28 
1986 challenger exploded moments after liftoff killing the seven 
aboard including schoolteacher christa mcauliffe 
in ensuing months unmanned titan and delta rockets also 
exploded in july 1987 four workers were injured and an 
atlascentaur rocket was severely damaged when a work platform 
struck the booster stage on the cape canaveral launch pad on oct 
17 1988 a flash fire caused minor damage to the magellan venus 
spacecraft 
nasa once the coddled darling of congress began facing more 
critical scrutiny officials of the space agency complained that it 
had been weakened its work force down many of its top managers 
gone and its array of contractors dwindling 
bush said he wanted to reverse the trend in addition to the 
sharply increased appropriation for next year he called for an 
even bigger boost in spending authority for projects that wouldnt 
be paid off until later years he spoke of returning to the moon 
and then beginning manned exploration of mars early in the next 
century 
the past weeks debacles cast a shadow on this optimistic 
picture 
sen barbara mikulski dmd chairwoman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that screens nasa spending bills summed up the 
frustration of critics in congress 
they have had 10 years to put this together and spent 28 
billion to be able to get it right now we find that the hubble 
telescope has a cataract

a few years back redfaced pentagon officials 
admitted they were buying 436 hammers and 640 toilet seats 
reforms went into effect 
now theyre buying 999 pliers and 117 soap dish covers 
two republican senators want to know why 
we have been informed by defense officials that overpricing 
and other systemic problems are as prevalent today within the 
supply system as they were in the mid1980s sens charles 
grassley of iowa and william roth of delaware said in a letter to 
the defense departments inspector general 
the two gop senators urged the department to audit its 
purchasing records to determine whether the prices were reasonable 
in comparison to commercial market costs 
the audit also should provide some indication of whether the 
exorbitant price phenomenon of spare parts purchased by the 
defense department is still with us the lawmakers said in the 
letter released this weekend 
accompanying the letter is a sampling from the military 
services shopping list 99920 for pliers for tinker air force 
base in oklahoma 1500 for a hydraulic hand jack for the navy 
aviation supply office in philadelphia and 117 for a soap dish 
cover for a defense supply center in columbus ohio 
the list also includes 186815 for a toilet seat cover for the 
c5 cargo plane 
the cover according to pentagon documents is made of 
fiberglass reinforced honeycomb polyurethane plastic and stainless 
steel to withstand a corrosive environment through the lifetime 
of the aircraft 
in addition to those purchases the pentagon paid 12040 for a 
stainless steel lacquered dixie cup dispenser the dispenser 
retails for no more than 25 apiece 
defense department spokesman jim turner said inspector general 
susan j crawford was concerned with the issues raised in the 
senators letter and planned to conduct an audit 
the inspector general also planned to examine the results based 
on a comprehensive audit the department conducted in 1985 to 
determine whether agreedto corrections were implemented 
the two senators said various legislation and such reform 
efforts as the packard commission and the recent defense management 
review were intended to address the problems of overpricing that 
created a controversy during the reagan administration 
if this problem has not been corrected then the 10 billion 
of savings claimed by the defense department from 1991 to 1995 from 
better management of supply costs must be called into question 
roth and grassley said 
roth the cochairman of the defense reform caucus in congress 
and member of the senate committee on governmental affairs said 
the charges of waste is like a bad bmovie the return of the 
640 toilet seat cover 
grassley the ranking republican on the senate judiciary 
subcommittee on courts and administrative practice said that based 
on a preliminary inquiry the data sure harkens back to the good 
old days or maybe the good old days never left us of course we 
thought that they did 
grassley in a telephone interview from iowa on friday said he 
did not doubt defense secretary dick cheneys efforts to reform the 
pentagon but feared that the pentagon chief was being undercut by 
the services 
the lawmakers also questioned the air forces justification for 
the price of the 99920 pliers 
shortly after published reports in the miami herald about the 
prices the air force said the contractor pratt amp whitney did 
make sure the item was made in accordance with the drawings with 
all the necessary checks and compliance and whatnot 
perhaps 999 was a bargain for this item after all said 
cliff goodhue a cost analyst at the air force logistics command 
headquarters in ohio 
the maker of the pliers city tool of florida charged pratt amp 
whitney 669 a pair for the pliers the contractor added 330 to 
the price of each pair to the air force 
the amount fell 1 short of the cost that requires the military 
to buy directly from the manufacturer for items of 1000 or more 
in a separate letter to cheney roth expressed disbelief with 
the air force comments 
the fact that defense acquisition officials continue not only 
to accept these prices but also to defend them as reasonable is 
unacceptable to the american taxpayer roth said

corruption and provocation by reactionary 
forces have damaged the communist partys relations with the 
masses the general secretary said in a speech made public today 
the eve of the partys 69th birthday 
jiang zemins speech delivered to a symposium on partybuilding 
in december also asserted that the party will maintain its 
dominant role and that any political reform must be aimed at 
strengthening party leadership 
although the speech was reported by the official xinhua news 
agency in december today was the first time it was released in 
full 
the anniversary of the july 1 1921 forming of the communist 
party in shanghai was also marked by a central committee directive 
ordering all party officials to attend criticism and selfcriticism 
sessions twice a year to ensure adherence to party principles 
improving innerparty discipline and extending the partys 
control over all aspects of chinese society have been two central 
goals since the military was called in to crush the widely popular 
prodemocracy demonstrations a year ago 
jiang said that in recent years corruption and selfinterest 
have led to discontent and worry among the people 
according to xinhua jiang added that provocations from 
reactionary forces both at home and abroad and trouble caused by 
those with ulterior motives further eroded the masses trust in 
the party 
widespread corruption within the party and bureaucracy was a key 
issue raised during the prodemocracy movement last year 
jiang made another indirect reference to the movement when he 
said some party members especially some leading persons had 
made arbitrary decisions and failed to adhere to the principle of 
democratic centralism 
jiangs predecessor zhao ziyang was purged in june for urging 
compromise with the student activists and opposing the use of the 
military to end the protests 
jiang said democratic centralism which demands that party 
members give unquestioned support to decisions made by the 
leadership is the basic code that must be followed within the 
party 
the party chief also said that political reforms including the 
separation of party and government functions must be designed to 
strengthen party leadership 
all cadres or ranking officials jiang said must be under the 
control of the party leading bodies at all levels he said must 
be in the hands of those loyal to marxism 
zhao an advocate of rapid economic and political reform has 
also been criticized for trying to weaken party power by decreasing 
the role of party secretaries in running factories and government 
offices 
on friday jiang told a meeting of model party members that 
chinese communists believe that socialism will inevitably win 
referring to the collapse of socialist governments in east 
europe he said socialist countries have existed for only seven 
decades and it is not strange that there have been some zigzags 
in their development 
but china he said will by no means flinch from temporary 
difficulties and socialist china will stand towering among 
nations in the world forever

75000 at the memorial coliseum mandela this morning took a stroll 
through downtown streets he stopped several times to shake hands 
with admirers including a homeless man in a wheelchair 
mandela then returned to his hotel to prepare for a flight to 
oakland his last stop in the united states the next stop on his

just a few days ago hungarys foreign 
minister dropped by nato for a chat with western diplomats his 
visit unthinkable a year ago barely caused a stir 
but its significance was not lost on geza jeszenszky one of 
only a handful of high officials of warsaw pact nations to visit 
the headquarters of the north atlantic treaty organization 
as a man growing up in the cold war i never imagined that 
i would step into this building he said 
the political upheavals that have rocked eastern europe have 
also shaken the alliances complex of threestory concrete 
buildings on the outskirts of brussels 
western officials are scrambling to come up with a new role for 
the alliance forged in 1949 to counter the expansionist policy of 
the soviet union it provides a military link across the atlantic 
ocean tying north america to western europe 
president bush and other leaders of the 16 nato nations will 
meet in london this week to launch formally an overhaul of the 
organization to make it appear less threatening to the soviet union 
in doing so the west hopes to win the kremlins acceptance of 
full and immediate membership for a united germany in nato west 
germany belongs to the western alliance but its eastern neighbor 
is in the warsaw pact 
not so long ago nato and the warsaw pact were sworn enemies 
each warned about the military threat posed by the other 
tanks missiles and weapons were counted and compared 
frontline troops were at full alert in case of a surprise attack 
new nuclear weapons were on the drawing board 
but in the past year or so the perception of the military 
threat posed by moscow and its oncestaunch eastbloc allies has 
withered soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has eased western 
fears with his agenda of glasnost and perestroika and his promises 
of reductions in troops and military spending 
moreover the ousting of longtime communist regimes in eastern 
europe has loosened the ties those countries had to the soviet 
union and its military structure 
with the warsaw pact in virtual collapse why bother with nato 
at all 
you dont cancel your home insurance policy just because there 
have been fewer burglaries in your street in the last 12 months 
british prime minister margaret thatcher insisted recently 
us gen john galvin natos top military commander in europe 
said the alliance was needed for at least a decade to keep an eye 
on moscow 
we are going to have to be watchful of a nation that has the 
possibility to destroy us and that is at this point very 
unpredictable he said in a telephone interview 
the allies already have begun revamping the western alliance to 
make it less military and more political although they are vague 
about what it might do differently 
the truth of the matter is no one really knows what a more 
political nato really means said col michael dewar deputy 
director of the international institute for strategic studies in 
london nato is going to be no more or less political in 
substance than it ever was 
a nato diplomat demanding anonymity said im not sure its 
going to develop political attributes it doesnt have instead 
he said the publics perception of the alliance as strictly a 
military machine needed to be changed 
another diplomat also demanding anonymity predicted nato would 
evolve into a place where people exchange ideas and try to come 
to some kind of general direction 
the new nato will be heavily involved in arms control issues and 
play a prominent role in ensuring compliance with disarmament 
accords officials said 
it also may discuss such farflung issues as the environment but 
will probably steer clear of economics issues already handled by 
the european community the 12nation trading bloc also 
headquartered in brussels 
whatever happens all are agreed there will be less emphasis on 
the military side 
there will be fewer soldiers tanks and artillery 
the united states and the soviet union already have agreed to 
pull out thousands of soldiers to get down to 195000 on each side 
in the strategic central region of europe the united states will 
maintain an additional 30000 troops in britain and southern europe 
caps will likely be placed on the stationed forces of other 
nations in the central zone the soviet union also wants limits on 
west germanys army 
the remaining nato armies will be multinational with soldiers 
drawn from different countries 
there will be fewer weapons to maintain 
nato and the warsaw pact are pushing for an arms deal this year 
to reduce sharply tanks artillery and other nonnuclear forces in 
europe 
western officials have said there is less need for battlefield 
nuclear weapons in their arsenal 
the united states has agreed to speed up a timetable with the 
soviet union for negotiating cuts in those arms it has canceled 
plans to build a more powerful lance shortrange missile and a 
modernized 155mm nucleartipped artillery shell 
military strategies will be redone 
some frontline troops as of sunday have been given twice as 
long to react to an enemy attack as they had before 
the policy of forward defense under which nato troops are 
stationed along the western borders will be revised the 
frontline the border between east and west germany will 
disappear shortly 
the wests threat of using nuclear weapons first if faced with a 
massive soviet attack will be reviewed nato officials said no 
decision has yet been made despite us reports that the policy 
will be retained

the evening of june 20 was pleasant in the 
alborz mountains northwest of tehran the days heat ended abruptly 
at sunset and the high winds that roar down the slopes each 
afternoon had calmed 
most people went to bed early but many younger men and teenage 
boys stayed up to watch the recorded world cup soccer match between 
brazil and scotland that iranian tv was broadcasting 
a flash of lightning brightened the sky at 1231 am and was 
followed in seconds by a terrible roar it wasnt thunder but the 
sound caused by great plates of earths crust moving far below the 
caspian sea to the north 
the violent shaking began it lasted for one minute houses were 
thrown then simply fell people screamed roofs collapsed some 
walls fell away from buildings others fell inward 
soheila karimi 27 was sleeping with her husband two sons and 
two daughters her husband yelled to her to go to the doorway with 
her sons because it was one of the strongest parts of the house 
she made it but the roof fell and killed her sons as she held them 
it was horrible said seddigheh musavi 25 people were 
crying and running and trying to find relatives 
ms musavi 25 wept as she spoke from her hospital bed where 
she was recovering from leg and head injuries she was knocked 
unconscious by falling debris and only awoke once she was in the 
hospital but she had since learned that her three sons were killed 
and her husband injured 
the picture tube on the tv set of the taromian family exploded 
ali 18 and his brother had been watching the soccer game they 
struggled to the secondfloor hallway that ran down the middle of 
their house 
the outside walls and most of the rooms next to them fell away 
but ali and his brother waited on their perch as the dust settled 
after several hours neighbors put boards up to them so they could 
walk down their parents and another brother and sister were dead 
mahasti ramezani 15 was sleeping on the second floor of her 
home in a village above manjil and the rest of her family was on 
the ground floor 
when the quake started her family ran outside but she was 
pinned by falling debris her father came back to find her but she 
couldnt answer him because of the weight of the roof on her chest 
he freed her and she was taken by jeep to the main road but 
landslides blocked that and she waited until morning when she 
could be taken by helicopter to a hospital in tehran 
these scenes were repeated in tens of thousands of homes up and 
down the fertile ricefarming sefid white rier valley from 
villages south of loshan to rasht in the north on the shores of the 
caspian 
in villages on the slopes of the mountains above the valley the 
destruction was even more complete the simple structures made 
mainly of clay or mud bricks toppled and slid down the barren 
graybrown slopes of the mountain it looked afterward as if 
someone with a giant broom had been sweeping a pile of rocks 
relief workers at rostamabad olia a village north of manjil 
said 80 percent of the villagers were killed all the buildings 
were destroyed 
in the town of rostamabad below a 65yearold man said he and 
his 5yearold grandson were at home alone he crawled out of the 
rubble but his grandson was dead when he pulled him out 
a 55yearold man stopped digging through the rubble of his home 
in manjil and surveyed the destruction around him he wrote 50 
on his dusty palm with a ballpoint pen then conveyed in minimal 
english and with gestures that he had lost that many relatives in 
that part of town 
thirty graves in the manjil cemetery are outlined with a 
rectangle of brick showing they were all from the same family 
thousands of deaths were reported as far away as zanjan about 
60 miles across the mountains to the west 
structural damage to buildings occurred as far away as qazvin 
the old capital about 55 miles to the southwest of manjil 
even in tehran 125 miles to the southwest some windows broke 
akbar degheghi a 50yearold retired air force engineer awoke and 
ran to the door of his bedroom when the quake began 
the ceiling lamp swung crazily 
degheghi called his 9yearold daughter shoreh to him and 
comforted her she thought it was a resumption of the iraqi missile 
and bombing attacks on tehran from the iraniraq war of the 1980s 
many people didnt know what had happened to family members the 
government set up a free telephone service to provide information 
about missing relatives 
sima babaii 28 hospitalized in tehran with leg and pelvis 
injuries knew that both her children were killed and her husband 
was injured but she had no idea what happened to her mother and 
other relatives 
thousands of people had to be buried in manjil alone 5000 to 
6000 graves were added to the town cemetery 
some bodies had to be put three deep into mass graves at the 
beginning because there were so many of them the heat increased 
the danger of disease spreading 
tents were set up for survivors and water and food were brought 
in heavy equipment cleared landslides from roads and helped teams 
with shovels remove rocks 
work proceeded slowly with the first efforts concentrated on 
finding bodies and survivors a week after the quake people still 
picked through the remains of their homes trying to recover 
possessions 
there were no signs of looting which has been a problem in 
other countries after natural disasters iranians were spared 
further possible loss of life because the dry brick construction 
apparently served to prevent fire 
one of the few things escaping damage was a familys prized 
persian carpets and relatives and friends joined together to pull 
them out

we cut close to 2 billion gov jim florio said we cut 
out jobs scaled down programs everyone will feel the pinch a 
13 billion income tax increase for next jan 1 is awaiting 
florios signature nearly all of that will go to school aid 
the texas sales tax goes up a quarter point to 625 percent 
primarily for a courtordered reform in school financing 
the increase put texas in a tie with illinois for the 
fourthhighest state sales tax gov bill clements fought the 
boost but gave in to the legislature to avoid having the court 
implement its own plan 
i dont like it today i dont like it tomorrow and im not 
happy about it but nevertheless thats the way the system 
works clements said 
texas cigarette tax is jumping 15 cents a pack and the tax on 
mixed drinks was raised two points to 14 percent

not be issued until next july 1

against flag burning failed in congress laws banning desecration 
of the us flag go into effect in indiana and maryland the

the forces of change mikhail s gorbachev himself 
unleashed now are pressing him to make a choice that could split 
the communist party at its 28th congress 
the most powerful man in the soviet union can stand on his 
crumbling middle ground between traditional communists and radical 
reformers who are charging off in opposite directions risking 
losing them both in a bid to retain communist party unity 
or he could step firmly in either direction virtually certain 
that he would lose part of the communist party the dominant force 
in soviet society 
when gorbachev opens the congress in the kremlin on monday 
morning he will face 4700 party members many of whom may 
challenge his continued leadership 
the possibilities for compromise which during the whole time 
of perestroika have been gorbachevs essential tactical weapon are 
in fact exhausted said vladimir lysenko of the reformist 
democratic platform reform group 
the centers base is rapidly eroding and in these 
circumstances gorbachev has to make his final choice he said 
gorbachev has urged communists to band together to avoid the 
first split in their ranks since lenin he says a break would be a 
gift to the opponents of his reform policy 
but democratic platforms 100 delegates are expected to walk out 
of the congress and probably announce the formation of a separate 
party 
the congress which normally meets every five years is 
theoretically the highest communist party body it has the right to 
elect the leadership the policymaking central committee and 
change the party rules and platform 
the last congress was in early 1986 but the 28th gathering was 
moved up almost a year to give gorbachev a chance to overhaul the 
central committee and push more reforms 
the new date was set when gorbachev had the initiative but in 
recent months critics from both sides have charged that his reforms 
have stalled and his advisers seem unsure where to turn next 
party documents released early this year set the party in a new 
direction giving up its monopoly on power and endorsing the 
concept of private property the new program to be brought up for 
a vote at the congress makes scant mention of marx or lenin 
gorbachevs actions according to the traditionalists prove 
that he is trying to gut the communist party 
the party is sick ivan osadchi said during the 
conservativedominated meeting of russian communists in moscow in 
midjune it is losing its fighting spirit surrendering its 
position without a fight 
as a result conservatives say republics are pulling away the 
economy is a mess ethnic groups are killing each other and the 
crime rate is way up 
the party bureaucracy squeezed by gorbachev to turn its power 
over to government bodies initially resisted passively but at the 
meeting of russian communists the challenge was direct and the 
criticism stinging 
the russian communists with gorbachevs blessing set up their 
own party structure within the national party for the first time 
that gives gorbachevs conservative opponents an organizational 
structure to oppose him 
gorbachevs most visible foe on the politburo yegor k 
ligachev said the gorbachev could not give adequate attention to 
his two jobs party leader and soviet president his inference was 
that gorbachev should give up the party leadership 
in an interview published by the communist party newspaper 
pravda on saturday ligachev reiterated that the party must not 
retreat further it is an avantgarde party not a political 
club he said 
democratic platform and sympathizers such as boris n yeltsin 
the newly elected president of the russian republic long have 
criticized gorbachev for what they say is a tendency to try to 
placate the traditionalists while being blind to increasingly 
reformoriented public opinion 
gorbachevs new party documents do not endorse reforms 
democratic platform argues are vital giving up the partys cells 
in the police the military and the kgb and in nearly every 
workplace throughout the vast country 
according to lysenko the communist party has shown it is 
simply incapable of reforming itself 
nevertheless diplomatic observers and reformers say at the 
russian party meeting of 2700 delegates who will form a majority 
at the national congress it finally became clear to gorbachev how 
severe the threat from the party traditionalists has become 
one senior western diplomat said the bitter criticism apparently 
was enough to persuade gorbachev to seek a rapprochement with more 
radical reformers 
i think he has been moving the diplomat said speaking on 
condition of anonymity one can see a number of signs he realizes 
that he can no longer make common cause with oldline party 
apparatchiks 
gorbachev understands that the democratic platform is weak at 
the congress but may be a more potent force in the countryside 
the diplomat said 
leaders of democratic platform say their polls indicate about 40 
percent of the countrys 18 million party members support them but 
that the party bureaucracy managed to freeze all but a tiny portion 
of them out of the congress 
what these guys have going for them is not numbers at the 
congress but the feeling that the party is on its last legs the 
diplomat said if it wants to reconstitute itself as a real party 
with real leadership it will have to have help from these guys

many communist party congresses have come at 
historic junctures and indicated the road the soviet union would 
follow here is a look at some that preceded the 28th which begins 
monday 
1st 1898 emigre russian marxists met in minsk capital of 
byelorussia and formed the russian social democratic labor party

check the bottom of your old green ceramic 
donkey planter look at the label on that heartshaped statue of 
liberty ashtray in the attic if theyre stamped made in occupied 
japan theres a collector looking for it 
true the items probably cost something like 25 cents but you 
could own an increasingly valuable collectible and a relic of the 
days when americans derided japanese products instead of their own 
people used to think oj was junk but now a lot of them are 
caught up in the chase says florence archambault of newport 
ri whose occupied japan collectors club has grown from 45 to 283 
members over the last two years 
archambault entered what she calls the upside down world of 
oj in 1978 when she bought a pigs n a poke saltandpepper 
shaker set for 50 cents at a yard sale it now is worth 25 she 
says 
cheap ceramic figurines massproduced for fiveanddime stores 
sell for 3 to 5 a paper party horn that originally cost a few 
cents now is worth 6 a 29cent washington monument candy dish 
goes for 12 porcelain statuettes of redcheeked american children 
have risen from 10 to 50 in six years 
prices of better larger and rarer oj items have increased even 
more an ice maker is on the market for 350 and mugs bearing the 
likeness of gen douglas macarthur go for up to 75 
the emergence of oj collecting is a reminder that todays 
economic superstars began by churning out knickknacks for the low 
end of their conquerors domestic market 
by order of us authorities anything made in japan for export 
to the united states between aug 17 1947 and the end of the 
allied occupation on april 28 1952 had to bear the marking made 
in occupied japan 
robert gee of los angeles a student of oj says the word 
occupied was designed to reassure americans leery of buying 
enemy windup toys celluloid kewpie dolls sewing machines 
cigarette lighters dishwear lamps linen and rugs 
some items especially those produced toward the end of the 
occupation were wellmade and relatively expensive but 90 
percent of it was junk according to gene florence of lexington 
ky a dealer who has written four oj price guides 
most of the figurines break and chip easily and some were made 
carelessly red riding hoods cape might be blue little boy blue 
might be wearing red 
if oj items will never be confused with the work of faberge or 
steuben or sony for that matter it is kitsch of unusual origin 
and limited edition and it is simply defined unless an item bears 
the words occupied and japan it has no value to a 
collector 
but the nation faces no imminent shortage of oj items that cost 
less than 20 
florence buys whole oj collections photographs the items for 
his price guides and then sells them off ive got enough easter 
ducks for the next 25 years he moans same with these dog 
planters ive got 200 of em in four colors including purple and 
i dont know why anyone would make so many green donkey planters 
what florence calls those magic words keep turning up 
unexpectedly one collector finally noticed the stamp on the 
rudolph the rednosed reindeer shed been hanging on her christmas 
tree for 20 years another was fixing his favorite fly rod when he 
noticed the marking 
its a collectible you can still find and afford says 
florence people have it in their homes and dont know it if 
they do know it they usually think its junk even if it isnt 
jim baker of grand rapids mich has filled his house with 
3800 pieces of oj including a chandelier hes always vigilant 
if i see a package of fish hooks that looks a little strange 
ill go over and take a look you never know 
possibly because they are too busy collecting french 
impressionist paintings and manhattan real estate the japanese 
themselves have demonstrated little interest in oj in fact gee 
says that when the occupation ended a japanese businessman dumped 
three truckloads of the stuff into a river 
his explanation that mark was really exasperating

the election of delegates to the communist party 
congress that starts monday was supposed to be more democratic but 
somehow the results were skewed more than ever in favor of 
hardline apparatchiks 
the 28th congress may go down in history as the forum of party 
functionaries said stepan troyan a losing candidate from the 
ukraine 
in theory the 4700 delegates constitute the highest authority 
of the communist party but past congresses have been rubber stamps 
for decisions already worked out by the central committee or its 
governing politburo 
this year in the turmoil of the communist partys changing 
role delegates will have a chance to influence history so 
rankandfile party members fought for seats 
the central committee voted in february to let local party 
organizations decide for themselves how to run elections to the 
congress 
it said party committees could either allow direct elections 
from among the rank and file or hold conferences that gave the 
leadership more power to control who was elected 
even in such bastions of radical reform as moscow and leningrad 
the overall results favored the old guard 
members of the party reform group democratic platform said about 
half the delegates are party functionaries known as 
apparatchiks who make up only 3 percent of total party 
membership 
they said 20 percent are ministers directors and other 
officials and fewer than 7 percent are workers and peasants who 
account for more than half the communist partys membership 
of 266 moscow delegates 104 are fulltime functionaries the 
apparatchiks along with the military are considered the mainstay 
of the party hard line 
party leaders were so concerned about the discrepancy that they 
decided to invite an extra 350 workers and peasants to the congress 
and let it decide whether they will be allowed to speak and vote 
at the party congress of the russian federation last week 200 
people invited on a similar basis were allowed to speak but not 
vote 
troyan the ukrainian who lost out wrote in the weekly moscow 
news that party officials showed they had not abandoned their old 
ways 
at the first stage they secured themselves tickets for the 
congress and at the final stage they remembered the delegation 
must include a few workers he said 
although the selection process was supposed to be more 
democratic it was so complicated that a central committee official 
said many people still did not understand it even after two news 
conferences were held to explain it 
that allowed party officials to mastermind and control the 
elections troyan contended 
when he sought election from the kherson region in the ukraine 
troyan said party functionaries kept the campaign period extremely 
brief so he could not meet his electors he said the election 
commission which he accused of being under party control 
forgot to circulate his platform 
vladimir lysenko a leader of the reformist democratic platform 
said the makeup of the russian federation delegation was evidence 
that the party will not change from within 
everything is in total control of the party hierarchy that 
favors the existing intricate system of perks and camouflaged power 
and privileges the weekly commersant quoted him as saying 
these people are armed with thousands of subtle tricks developed 
as early as 19181920 to influence the elections of the delegate to 
the congress 
a western diplomat raised another possibility that the largely 
conservative delegates really do represent the communist party 
masses 
my strong sense is that unlike previous congresses the 
central leadership did not cook the delegates this time the 
diplomat said but added that regional party chiefs may have 
stepped in to control the selection

south africas defense minister 
lashed out at nelson mandela saturday for touring the united states 
instead of working to end violence he also questioned mandelas 
commitment to peace and democracy 
in a highly critical speech defense minister mangus malan said 
mandelas refusal to renounce armed struggle was an obstacle to 
ending racial conflict he charged mandelas african national 
congress was undermining peace 
at this stage the anc advocates stayaways strikes which 
damage peoples interests and needs it is therefore against the 
people it is antipeople malan said with their further 
demands they transgress the boundaries of democratic behavior 
he criticized mandela for spending much of his time overseas 
instead of working for peace 
at this point of time he is the most overpublicized 
politician in the world media malan said 
the defense ministers speech at the annual armed forces day 
parade was the harshest attack by a government leader on mandela 
and the anc since president fw de klerk began major reforms in 
february 
military officials said they did not know if de klerk had 
cleared malans speech 
a top anc official secretary general alfred nzo charged 
saturday that the whiteminority government was blocking efforts to 
find a peaceful solution to the countrys problems nzo told a 
rally in the johannesburg black township of alexandra that the anc 
could not renounce violence unilaterally 
it means other people use us as target practice for their 
gun licenses so long as other people have a license to kill the 
anc will call on its people to carry ak47 rifles nzo said 
in a separate development police said a bomb exploded friday 
night at the johannesburg home of local antiapartheid democratic 
party leader clive gilbert there were no injuries and police had 
no suspects 
malan flanked by senior generals said in his speech that the 
military could halt fighting but only political leaders could 
build peace 
he said mandelas statements overseas and his refusal to 
renounce the ancs armed struggle were a major barrier to starting 
talks on ending white minority rule he questioned the ancs 
commitment to a peaceful solution to south africas racial 
divisions 
is it the objective to use negotiations as a cloak to replace 
the existing order by an anc regime he said 
malan a former general who reportedly has a strong following in 
the military delivered the speech at a major display of troops 
tanks guns planes and other equipment to mark the armed forcess 
78th anniversary 
mandela is under pressure by some south african and foreign 
leaders to formally renounce violence he says he cannot renounce 
violence until the government meets conditions including pulling 
troops out of black townships 
the ancs military campaign is virtually nonexistent but 
mandela is reluctant to formally renounce the movements armed 
struggle for fear of losing support among militant young blacks 
he currently is on a tour of the united states where he has 
received a frenzied welcome after visits to europe and africa he 
is due to return to south africa july 18 
top anc military leader chris hani said friday the anc would 
maintain its military strength to ensure the government did not 
fall back into its evil ways he said anc military training and 
expansion would continue 
de klerk who came to power late last year radically altered 
government policy in february by freeing mandela and lifting bans 
on the anc and other black opposition groups de klerk says he 
wants to negotiate an end to white rule and share political power 
with blacks

walter mondale knows well the political price 
for backing higher taxes his advice to president bush and other 
republicans prepare to pay 
republicans are going to have to stand up and confess that 
they not only have and will vote for taxes but that they havent 
been telling the truth to the american people the democratic 
former vice president said in an interview last wee for that 
they should and will pay a price 
mondale whose underdog 1984 presidential bid was torpedoed by 
his support for higher taxes said gop credibility will suffer now 
that bush has abandoned his read my lips no new taxes campaign 
pledge 
public trust is a cherished commodity and theyre going to 
find that harder to come by said mondale who now practices law 
in minneapolis 
since bush doesnt face reelection for more than two years 
what personal political toll he will pay for his about face on 
taxes is uncertain 
mondale and other democrats say bush could help himself in the 
long run if his decision leads to a comprehensive deficitreduction 
plan and keeps the economy growing 
still many think bush will be open to attacks that he lied in 
the 1988 campaign or didnt keep his word in 1990 
much of the criticism is coming from within his own party where 
there is little disagreement that bush has dealt a serious blow to 
1990 republican candidates whose campaigns are anchored with a 
nonewtaxes pledge 
the president himself is showing some sympathy for their 
predicament 
arrows have been flying back front sideways but thats 
what i get paid for bush told reporters friday i can totally 
empathize with what theyre going through 
democrats have been letting the republicans do most of the 
criticizing and feel they have the upper hand in a tax debate for 
the first time in at least a decade 
all of a sudden the republicans dont have a gyroscope said 
michael mccurry the democratic national committee spokesman 
ronald reagan and his were the party of lower taxes rhetoric 
was for a decade the gyroscope by which everyone else in the 
republican party got direction george bush shifts too much for him 
to be the guiding star of the party 
bushs pollster and adviser robert teeter is quick to dismiss 
such arguments 
the democrats are not going to get a ride on the tax issue 
teeter said ultimately it will be a benefit politically because 
it will produce good results for the economy 
party officials worry that while bush may emerge stronger 
ultimately the economic and political benefits of any deficit deal 
will come too late for gop candidates running in 1990 
no way is there any possible upside in this for republican 
candidates in 1990 said a senior gop official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity these are people out there promising to 
hold the line on taxes whos going to believe them now 
the republican dilemma is demonstrated in the partys own 
platform 
the 1988 platform states republicans unequivocally reiterate 
the notax pledge we have proudly taken 
it goes on to tweak the democrats while we wouldnt believe 
the democrats even if they took the pledge they havent taken it 
republican candidates in tight races have been quick to 
criticize bushs decision more than 90 gop house members signed a 
letter to bush expressing shock at his announcement and even 
republicans not up for reelection this year are taking jabs at 
bush 
now is simply not the time to cave in on taxes said gop 
sen robert kasten jr of wisconsin if the president and the 
democrats in congress want to raise taxes they are going to have to 
get someone else to help them 
so intense has been the criticism of bush within the republican 
party that there are rumblings about a conservative primary 
challenge to the president in 1992 while few expect such a 
challenge to occur conservatives are adamant in their criticism of 
bushs reversal 
the white house is kidding themselves if they think this is 
going to go away quickly said conservative activist craig 
shirley in one fell swoop he has thrown away the one issue that 
above all else defined the republican party 
david keene chairman of the american conservative union called 
bushs decision a disaster for bush a disaster for the 
republican party but most importantly a disaster for the economy

eastern airlines once the selfproclaimed 
largest carrier in the free world sees its crumbling empire 
shrink sunday by five nations 
american airlines begins taking over easterns latin american 
service in the largest chopping yet on the struggling carrier in 
the first of four phases in the takeover american starts service 
to argentina brazil chile costa rica and guatemala 
by midaugust american will have easterns routes to 20 cities 
in 15 latin nations 
for american the latin routes are a major step in the 
fastgrowing fort worth texasbased carriers effort to become a 
leading worldwide airline the carrier is holding ribboncutting 
ceremonies including a new miamilondon route and spending an 
estimated 20 million in promoting its new service 
for eastern the transfer means badly needed cash 
with the airline still struggling to emerge from chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization after 16 months theres little time for 
sentiment as eastern hands over one of its prize possessions it 
was the same last year when easterns trademark northeast shuttle 
service was sold to new york developer donald trump 
when the latin transfer is completed the miamibased airline 
will no longer have a hub in miami where daily service will be 
down to about two dozen flights 
obviously this a tough one there are a lot of sentimental 
ties for eastern employees said company spokeswoman karen 
ceremsak its very difficult as was parting with the shuttle 
but its all necessary although it will be a bitter pill to 
swallow we all know its better for the airline in the long term 
eastern on friday received 120 million from american and the 
balance of the 310 million sale price will be received as the 
transfers are completed that will bring to near 1 billion the 
amount in assets sales for eastern since it went into chapter 11 
ms ceremsak said the only other major asset sale contemplated 
is the effort to peddle easterns 14 l1011 aircraft 
eastern has set no deadline for emerging from chapter 11 
earlier such deadlines were missed repeatedly leading to a 
creditors call for replacement of the parent texas air corp 
management now continental airlines holdings inc the federal 
bankruptcy court appointed martin shugrue to run eastern as a 
trustee on april 12 
eastern is trying to find jobs either within its system or with 
other carriers for the 150 miamibased employees whose positions 
half of them part time are being cut with the latin transfer 
american is absorbing foreign eastern employees while eastern has 
200 flight attendants and 150 pilots who will move to other routes 
from the latin system 
before the march 4 1989 machinists union strike that spurred 
the chapter 11 filing eastern had nearly 100 daily miami flights 
less than 10 years ago eastern had more passengers than any 
other us carrier leading to its claim of being no 1 in the free 
world 
eastern still flies to cancun mexico puerto rico and other 
caribbean points although it has cut back on caribbean service in 
recent years 
the latin routes which eastern bought from braniff in 1982 for 
only 30 million are inherently profitable ms ceremsak said 
we have not been able to reap those benefits because of our 
situation 
americans miami growth is a challenge to pan american world 
airways which is also losing money pan am has been flying to 
latin america since its first passenger service 63 years ago from 
key west fla to havana pan am had 3 million passengers on latin 
routes last year double easterns passengers

the woman who lured mayor marion barry into a 
drug sting was on the stand explaining that she screamed when 
federal agents arrested him to release some of the pain for him 
it was too much for the mayors wife 
she smiled so widely she almost laughed and shook her regal head 
from side to side in disbelief 
did she think the witness was lying or merely foolish with 
effi barry its hard to tell 
the mayors reserved enigmatic wife is spending most of his 
drug and perjury trial hooking yarn into a pastel design 
each day she arrives at her frontrow seat in courtroom 2 of the 
federal courthouse pulls her craft supplies from a white plastic 
bag squares her shoulders and begins 
shes ready then armed for whatever the day brings 
so far the trial has brought rasheeda moore and her sensational 
allegations that she and the mayor had a longterm affair and used 
drugs together more than 100 times over the last few years 
it has brought the notorious videotape showing the mayor trying 
to fondle moore in a bugged hotel room before taking two deep hits 
of crack drugs and pipe compliments of the fbi 
it has brought one virgin islands woman calling the mayor a pig 
and another saying he forced her to have sex it has brought 
charles lewis another alleged druguse companion explaining that 
he often left the room when barry had a female visitor 
as we say in the islands he said i didnt want to cramp 
his style 
how can you do it why do you stay with him with all the 
things that have happened questioner lark mccarthy blurted out 
during a fox morning news interview that was supposed to focus on 
nelson mandelas visit 
mrs barry took the high road 
just as winnie and nelson have bought into a mission my 
husband and i had a view and mission for the city she said 
for certain our years have not been without controversy have 
not been without difficulty she added but you take everything 
in stride and getting through the trial is just something else to 
do it doesnt sidetrack you 
effi barry 45 has worked as a model teacher travel agent and 
environmental health inspector as the mayors wife she has focused 
on the arts health education teenage pregnancy aids and other 
family issues 
as the mayors troubles have multiplied washingtonians have 
marveled at her loyalty and grace under pressure 
i would be a liar if i said its not a difficult time for our 
family effi barry told reporters in brief remarks friday she 
added that prayers have sustained us 
she always says its her spiritualism its her faith that 
carries her through thats been her answer to me every time ive 
asked that question said barbara harrison a television reporter 
who has interviewed mrs barry extensively 
peggy cooper cafritz told the washington post in january that 
mrs barrys strength comes from her love for her husband and her 
undying love for christopher the couples 10yearold son she 
would lay down her life for him said cafritz who is one of 
christophers godparents 
ruby mczier a lawyer characterized by the post as a good 
friend said a circle of supportive protective women gives mrs 
barry strength she knows she will not be allowed to fall on her 
face without us forming a blanket 
several people reportedly close to the barry family did not 
return calls or declined to comment last week 
i havent talked to effi recently you might want to talk to 
someone more current mczier said asked for suggestions she 
replied i really dont know who is close right now 
mrs barry barely glanced up from her hooking until moore took 
the stand last week since then there have been frequent stony 
staredowns between the two exmodels 
moore is not the first woman who got into trouble over barry 
but she is the first to have betrayed him two female friends 
karen johnson and maria mccarthy have gone to jail in the past six 
years rather than testify to a grand jury investigating barry 
the mayor has said the relationships were not intimate and his 
wife has said she believes him 
i think that she was foolish to stay in this town effi 
barry has said of karen johnson i think she should have gotten 
out of town for the sake of her own sense of dignity and start a 
new life elsewhere

at reproductive health services the clinic 
that challenged missouris abortion statute pregnant women have a 
new choice when they walk in the door adoption 
not that reproductive health services the defendant in the 
july 3 1989 webster decision that gave states more power in 
restricting abortion rights has stopped offering abortions it 
continues to handle nearly half the 18000 abortions performed each 
year in missouri drawing patients from 10 states 
but within the past year the notforprofit clinic also has 
begun an adoption agency if a woman wants to bring her pregnancy 
to term reproductive health will help find parents for the child 
the agency called adoption associates has a separate entrance 
but shares office space with the abortion clinic 
adoption is veiled and cloaked in as much secrecy as abortion 
was pre1973 and that makes me hurt for the birthmother said 
bj isaacsonjones executive director of reproductive health 
services 
i would like to see the countrys attitude change so there was 
more dignity and respect for her choice she said 
estelle morgan 22 is one such mother she already ha called 
several adoption agencies but said they told her they couldnt 
help her because she was black and black children were hard to 
place she was frustrated but determined when she called 
reproductive health 
they were very very supportive they let me make my own 
decision they didnt push me or tell me what to do they helped me 
through it morgan said 
she gave birth to a baby boy in may and in about a month he 
was living with his adoptive family morgan who has a 2yearold 
daughter said the process was difficult but that she feels good 
about her decision and continues to attend a support group at 
reproductive health 
when people ask me how many children i have i say one because 
its too hard to explain and i dont know if people would 
understand but i think about my baby every day she said 
society has taught us several myths about adoption like the 
mothers are young girls or the mothers dont care about their 
babies and they dont take care of themselves during pregnancy 
said marcia levin a social worker at the agency thats not 
true 
many of the women involved with adoption associates are in their 
20s already have children and know they cant care for another 
child or are trying to get on their feet financially levin said 
reproductive health services founded and run by women is one 
of three clinics in the country that provide both abortion and 
adoption services the others are located in san antonio texas 
and salt lake city 
in less then a year adoption associates has placed 15 babies in 
adoptive homes and is working with 75 pregnant women who are 
considering adoption 
a majority of them will probably keep their babies levin said 
we think were able to give women a better picture of all of 
their options and we can help them make the best decision 
possible said levin 
isaacsonjones said she resisted establishing the adoption 
agency for three years because she didnt think reproductive health 
could offer anything that wasnt already being offered in the 
community 
but she was convinced when she learned that many of the women 
who the clinic referred to adoption agencies never went they 
just kind of disappeared she said 
the addition of the adoption agency has generally increased the 
staffs commitment to the prochoice movement both levin and 
isaacsonjones agreed because it reinforces the belief that a 
woman should make the choice about what to do about her unplanned 
pregnancy 
the new agency a flood of volunteers more donations and a 
reaffirmed commitment all have made the year since the webster 
decision an encouraging and positive time isaacsonjones said 
i didnt think this was going to be a very good year but its 
turned out to be a great year weve discovered were real good 
losers she said

part of the jefferson memorial will be closed 
for at least a year for inspection and repairs ordered as a result 
of falling marble the national park service says 
park service officials said friday the chamber surrounding the 
19foot thomas jefferson statue is expected to remain open 
they said however that since tuesday the circular colonnade 
around the outside of the memorial has been off limits to the 
million tourists who visit the site each year 
visitors are also being kept 10 feet from the edge of the 
chamber by fencing draped with plastic sheets 
park service director robert stanton said an examination had 
been planned for next year but was moved up after a chunk of marble 
scroll fell from one of the structures columns 
we do emphasize however that the memorial remains in good 
condition stanton said 
two studies released in april found that the jefferson memorial 
and the nearby lincoln memorial needed at least 12 million in 
tests and repairs because of developing structural flaws and marble 
erosion caused by acid rain insects jet fuel from nearby national 
airport and other factors 
the memorial to the nations third president was dedicated in 
1943 its international walls are of white georgia marble it has 
four colonnaded openings of a domed ceiling of indiana limestone 
the exterior walls and dome are of danby imperial vermont marble

after repeated promises to be the 
environmental president george bush has engendered suspicion and 
distrust among environmentalists who say he gives with one hand but 
takes with the other 
bush proclaims himself an environmentalist but also says he 
wants to balance ecological and economic concerns 
some administration officials say he is guided by a pragmatic 
wish to weigh environment against such factors as economic growth 
potential job losses and the attendant political climate 
a pair of decisions last week exemplified the presidents 
environmental record 
in one he barred ocean oil exploration and drilling for a 
decade off most of california and southern florida as well as off 
cape cod washington and oregon 
then days after his administration declared the northern 
spotted owl a threatened species he put off protecting the bird 
while the search is on for a way to minimize disruptions to the 
logging industry including a predicted elimination of 28000 jobs 
what bush calls balance environmentalists call politicizing 
the environment 
hes totally politically motivated said wilderness society 
spokeswoman mary hanley 
but michael deland who heads bushs council on environmental 
quality countered any elected official needs to be sensitive to 
the concern of constituents he acknowledged a general 
sensitivity to political climate but said that sentiment did not 
dominate bushs decisions on the spotted owl or offshore oil any 
more than any other policy 
bushs 10year offshore drilling ban and his declaration that a 
proposed marine sanctuary in monterrey bay will be permanently off 
limits heartened lawmakers and conservationists who have battled 
every year for congressional passage of shortterm moratoriums 
but many give bush limited credit saying if he was a real 
environmentalist he would have made the ban permanent and addressed 
other areas also vulnerable to oil activity 
administration officials said bush did not want to tie the 
hands of future presidents or foreclose options for a nation that 
might face a different energy picture down the road 
but californias lt gov leo mccarthy one of the skeptics 
said bush was making it look a though hes just delaying oil 
drilling off our coast until after the 1990 governors race and his 
own reelection campaign in 1992 
in the spotted owl case conservationists cheered the 
administrations designation of the bird as threatened until it 
became clear that bush was not likely to set aside the millions of 
acres in protected habitat it is said the bird will require for 
survival 
the administration announced a logging cutback only in a portion 
of the habitat in oregon and northern california expected to 
result in loss of about 1000 jobs 
intense internal wrangling by bush aides over how far the 
endangered species act could be stretched in protecting the vast 
remainder of the owls habitat led to a decision to form a task 
force to study how best to prevent significant curtailment of 
timber harvests the panel will work with congress and altering 
the endangered species act is one possibility 
tinkering with the act has environmentalists gnashing their 
teeth they say protecting both the owl and the logging appears 
impossible 
deland insisted the administration hopes to achieve the dual 
goal without changing the act but admitted it is a tough prospect 
were going to do our best he said 
environmentalists believe bush is betraying them after campaign 
promises indicating his approach to dealing with environmental 
concerns would be different from president reagans championing 
developers over environmentalists 
while cheering the offshore drilling ban as a good first step 
they cringe at his enthusiasm for future drilling in the pristine 
arctic national wildlife reserve 
they see the owl case as portending bad news for the endangered 
species act 
on the other side development interests also are wary of a 
president who delivers mixed decisions 
even the oil industry had come to anticipate a blow from the 
president who once headed his own oil firm in texas 
he has said he wants to be the environmental president 
grumbled gus ensz spokesman for the american petroleum institute 
i dont think we were overly surprised

death or a savage beating seemed certain to all 
who told of meeting a violent gang of teenagers in central park 
the night a female jogger was gangraped and nearly bashed to death 
there last year 
in the hour or so the pack roamed the park on the night on april 
19 1989 at least four people were accosted before the woman was 
attacked and at least four others were jumped as she lay 
unconscious in the mud and blood of a ditch 
their testimony came in the trial of three teenagers allegedly 
involved in the socalled wilding spree that shocked the 
country 
the defendants antron mccray 15 raymond santana 16 and 
yusef salaam 16 are being tried in manhattans state supreme 
court on charges of attempted murder rape sexual abuse assault 
robbery and riot 
though the case is being heard in an adult court the defendants 
will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10 years in prison 
if theyre convicted three other youths are to stand trial later 
this year 
the most seriously injured witness who testified last week was 
john loughlin a teacher and former marine who said injuries the 
teens inflicted hospitalized him for two days 
he looked like he had been dipped in a bucket of blood when 
police found him an officer testified during a pretrial hearing 
loughlin 41 said he was jogging around the reservoir shortly

the district of columbias homicide rate the 
highest in the nation in 1989 is on the same track again this 
year officials say 
there were 218 reported slayings in the district as of june 29 
a pace that would virtually equal the 434 homicides that were 
recorded in the city in 1989 four of those slayings were at the 
hands of police officers 
the homicide rate had been 85 percent below last years pace on 
may 1 with 152 reported deaths as opposed to 165 at the same time 
last year but a spurt of slayings in may and june brought the rate 
nearly even with the 1989 pace 
the district has recorded 65 killings in the past 45 days 
drugs were cited as a major factor in the citys record homicide 
rate in 1989 the highest per capita for any us city police 
spokesman lt reginald smith said the departments crackdown on 
drug activity was a prime reason that the situation hadnt gotten 
worse this year 
we have more investigators available to follow up on homicide 
cases and are getting good cooperation from the us attorneys 
office as prosecutors are making good solid cases against drug 
arrestees smith said last week 
police patrols also have been increased in known openair drug 
markets and civilian community patrols are making inroads in 
crimeridden neighborhoods smith said 
dc superior court officials said the percentage of adult 
suspects testing positive for cocaine use increased in may after 
generally declining in the previous six months 
fiftyfour percent of the 857 suspects screened for possible 
drug use in may tested positive for cocaine use said rhonda 
winston of the city pretrial services agency up from 51 percent in 
april the lowest percentage of cocaine use in three years 
it would be hard to say if any trend of that nature was 
developing winston said our figures show that the number of 
arrestees who tested positive for cocaine were down for the last 
four months of 1989 but went up slightly in january and declined 
in february march and april 
she said cocaine appeared to be the drug of choice of most 
criminal arrestees who test positive for substance abuse 
all criminal suspects arrested in washington are tested for drug 
use as part of the pretrial screening process 
in neighboring prince georges county md where 127 killings 
occurred last year there were only 49 reported slayings as of june 
29 as opposed to 66 at the same time a year ago 
capt larry doman head of the central investigative division 
said one reason for the decline in killings in his jurisdiction was 
citizen response to the drug trafficking problem 
our department is pretty committed to doing something about 
the drug and violence problems doman said and were being 
helped by increased citizen awareness 
doman said the county works closely with district authorities to 
make sure drug dealers dont travel between the jurisdictions

hundreds of employees worked aroundtheclock 
this weekend to prepare east germanys most prestigious department 
store for a grand reopening that will showcase western goods 
the centrum store on alexanderplatz used to show off consumerism 
in east germany which had the highest living standard in the 
communist bloc 
but with sundays economic merger of the germanys being the 
best east germany has to offer is no longer good enough 
business throughout east germany ground to a halt on saturday as 
citizens scoured emptierthanusual store shelves to spend their 
last few ostmarks 
the east german currency was replaced at the stroke of midnight 
by west germanys powerful deutsche mark paving the way for a 
flood of highquality goods imported from the west 
day and night for the past week workers at the centrum unloaded 
truckloads of west german luxury goods and prepared the store for 
its reopening on monday and zero hour as the introduction of 
capitalism is known here 
yesterday we closed down the fourth story today the third 
and tomorrow the other two store spokeswoman carla kniestedt 
said friday 
lastminute bargain hunters browsed in the book department 
which had little to offer beyond the biographies of a few obscure 
communist heroes 
gone were the imitation oak cabinets laden with 1950sstyle 
porcelain tableware praktika cameras and narva lampshades that 
once drew gasps of admiration from polish soviet and vietnamese 
visitors 
in came bright glassandchrome displays of stereo equipment 
sports gear and clothing most of it provided by the west german 
kaufhof chain ms kniestedt said 
part of it is still in the warehouse part is sitting in the 
street and were just hoping to get everything done in time she 
said 
the paint work isnt up to scratch yet but we cant do 
everything at once she said as she inspected the domestic 
appliances department where workers lined up shiny washing 
machines and refrigerators 
tennis rackets thats another thing we never had she said 
centrum wont become a kaufhof store but is buying most of its 
merchandise from the chain which is also loaning the new display 
units 
when the store reopens approximately 20 percent of the 
merchandise will still be of east german origin although most 
domestically made consumer goods are of inferior quality and less 
efficiently produced than their western equivalents 
economic experts have predicted as many as onethird of east 
german businesses will fold when the economic merger is fully in 
effect 
i assume some east german companies will manage to adjust 
to market economy and survive ms kniestedt said we certainly 
will

the birds came back at dawn singing 
of a new day as the people of san marcos pass returned to stand in 
mournful silence amid the rubble of their burned homes 
on the winding hillside streets with spanish names blackened 
skeletons of trees and grotesquely twisted shells of houses stood 
saturday as mute testament to the fiery holocaust of the days 
before 
a few houses stood with their rose gardens miraculously unharmed 
by the erratic fire that struck shortly before dusk wednesday 
started by an unknown arsonist and blown in by the dreaded winds 
known as sundowners 
the acrid smell of smoke remained at one corner a carefully 
painted signpost with the owners name and address was perched in 
front of a pile of ashes a mailbox full of unopened letters 
remained alongside a charred building 
this was my house it was a beautiful house said margaret 
morris standing near a brick chimney the only evidence that a 
structure once occupied the debrisstrewn lot 
mrs morris her burned face and arms wrapped in bandages was 
poking through bits of glass and metal for remnants of the oriental 
art collection that was her pride and joy she found a small jade 
buddha burned to a pristine white 
i think ill make a collection of glass to show how it changes 
color when it burns she said holding up a melted green shard 
once a priceless vase her grandchildren and a soninlaw helped 
salvage bits and pieces of crockery a chandelier lay charred on 
the ground 
mrs morris and her husband harold barely escaped as flames 
raced toward their hillside home wednesday night in the rush she 
was unable to find her cat marcella 
i still havent made my peace with the cat she said 
stifling a choking sob you know your animals trust you so 
much 
mrs morris and her husband in their 70s and retired may not 
try to rebuild their house but most residents of the picturesque 
community said they planned to put up new homes as soon as possible 
last weeks great santa barbara fire as they are calling it 
was one of the most destructive in california history it leveled 
438 houses 28 apartment buildings 13 businesses two farms a 
mobile home and 10 public buildings officials say the damage 
estimate could reach 500 million amazingly only one person died 
the bel air fire of 1961 destroyed 484 homes and the berkeley 
fire of 1923 claimed 584 houses 
traces of the 4900acre fire remained along the crest of the 
santa ynez mountains this morning but authorities hoped to have it 
contained by the end of the day from his retreat in kennebunkport 
maine president bush on saturday declared santa barbara county a 
disaster area 
the santa barbara fire invaded a land of california dream 
houses many on sprawling lots with room for horses swimming pools 
and even a tennis court or two 
its a beautiful place to live said chamber of commerce 
director steve cushman its quiet and at night the stars are 
gorgeous its like being in the countryside but close to the 
city 
sally kinney who has lived in san marcos pass for 21 years and 
raised her family here is determined to stay 
were going to rebuildshe said it will take a while the 
builder told us today to plan on nine months 
she added id never put on another wood shake roof such 
combustible roofs were blamed for much of the destruction 
the kinneys abandoned their house only after smoke and flames 
closed in but next door neighbor fred gordon staged a fivehour 
battle with the elements and won his house remains standing wood 
shake roof and all 
gordon a banker who has lived here for 24 years said he and 
his 25yearold son mike decided to face off the fire with garden 
hoses 
we were up there on the roof for five and a half hours he 
said we wet some beach towels in the pool and wrapped our heads 
in them 
what was it like 
have you seen the movie apocalypse now he asked it 
came pretty close to that the smoke clouds were billowing in the 
house over there was virtually exploding trees were going up and 
embers were falling on us i guess im too stupid to be 
afraid 
mayor sheila lodge says many residents fear fire in summer 
when the temperature goes up i get very scared she said 
everyone has to be super careful 
this year a lingering drought made the threat worse and it is 
far from over with an arsonist on the loose 
thats whats additionally scary said ms lodge we know 
theres someone out there who for some perverted reason gets their 
jollies out of setting fires

scowcroft as he relaxed before upcoming summit meetings with 
western allies

the soviet union has resumed oil shipments to lithuania after a 
10week boycott to force the baltic republic to abandon an 
independence drive

his golf game he ended up in a tie with scowcroft after 18 holes 
they played two more holes in what bush called a sudden death 
tie breaker 
when the pressures on i do a lot better bush said to 
watching reporters before whacking a long drive off the first of 
the extra holes 
when the going gets tough the tough are in the rough he 
quipped in apparent effort to combine golf jargon with a common 
saying 
but it was scowcroft who had the last laugh as bush looked on 
in dismay scowcroft cackled in joy after hitting a long putt to 
win the tiebreaker 
bush stopped his motorcade en route to his familys house on 
walkers point to shake hands with workers at a local berry stand 
while the president was golfing the white house staff released 
a disaster proclamation affecting two california counties ravaged 
by wildfires the emergency declaration opens the way for the 
federal government to provide loans and grants to individuals 
businesses and local governments in los angeles and santa barbara

medellins army commander on saturday 
called the leader of the cocaine cartel based in the city a 
genocidal maniac and suggested that colombias security forces 
were out to gun him down 
is there anyone more cowardly than the crazy one pablo 
escobar a communique by gen harold bedoya asked before accusing 
the cartel leader of a series of terrorist attacks in medellin 
the communique published saturday by local newspapers urged 
citizens to help authorities hunt down escobar 
in the face of violence by a genocidal maniac there can be 
only repudiation bedoya said 
the government is offering a reward of 400000 for information 
leading to escobars capture dead or alive 
the communique listed the drug trafficking figures shot and 
killed in recent battles with colombian authorities topping the 
list is gonzalo rodriguez gacha a medellin cartel leader killed in 
december on colombias northern coast 
now it is the turn of pablo escobar wrote bedoya who 
commands the army brigade based in medellin colombias 
secondlargest city with almost 3 million inhabitants 
colombias security forces and drug traffickers have been locked 
in battle since the slaying last august of a presidential candidate 
who supported extradition of drug suspects to stand trial on 
charges in the united states 
the government began a crackdown on the drug lords and they 
have responded with 283 terrorist attacks that have killed 274 
people 
bedoya blamed escobar and his underlings for six car bombings in 
medellin this year and noted that the explosions had destroyed 
more than 200 businesses and properties killed eight children 15 
women five elderly citizens and 16 men 
bedoya said escobar hired people desperate for money to drive 
the cars filled with dynamite to their destinations without telling 
them the nature of their mission 
escobars terrorists were responsible for activating the bombs 
by remote control explaining why several of the drivers have been 
killed in recent attacks bedoya said 
the general also accused escobar of the june 23 massacre of 19 
people many of them teenage students at a medellin bar he said 
the mass murder was carried out in retaliation for authorities 
killing the cartels terrorist operations chief john jairo arias 
in another gun battle 
bedoya also said escobar was responsible for a string of 
assassinations in recent years including those of four 
presidential candidates judges political leaders journalists and 
an attorney general 
judges have been unable to convict escobar in any of the cases 
many judges charged with investigating the cartel leader have been 
forced to resign because of death threats 
meanwhile an unidentified armed group threatened to kill anyone 
found on the streets of medellin after 9 pm a communique sent 
late friday to a medellin newspaper said that anyone disobeying the 
order will be liquidated regardless of their status or social 
position 
nightlife has virtually disappeared in the city because of 
terrorist attacks and many bar and club owners have said they are 
on the verge of bankruptcy

west of paris the cleanup crew used huge fish nets to scoop up 
the fish and boats to push them toward barges where they were then 
scooped into nets 
officials said they could not give a precise cause for fish kill 
but they speculated it was related to pollution following severe 
rainstorms over two days in which backedup sewers combined with

new yorks socalled zodiac gunman may be going 
by the book that details the san francisco zodiac killers rampage 
top city police officials said 
the book zodiac by robert graysmith includes boastful 
letters sent by the san francisco killer to newspapers during the 
late 1960s and early 1970s claiming responsibility for a series of 
murders and taunting the police to catch him 
we have looked at that book yes police commissioner lee p 
brown told reporters he added that the new york zodiac killer 
probably has too 
the recent shootings in the city have caused sales of the book 
currently in paperback to more than double 
the original zodiac is believed to have killed as many as 40 
people since the late 1960s new yorks zodiac has shot four people 
since march one of whom later died 
the letters from the san francisco murderer began with the 
sentence this is the zodiac the same phrase begins the six 
letters sent to the new york city police and two news 
organizations claiming responsibility for the shootings here 
the san francisco zodiac was never caught but neither graysmith 
nor police believe he has somehow been transplanted to the east 
the new york zodiac while borrowing some of the san francisco 
killers methods has established a pattern all his own 
authorities say 
its absolutely not the same man the handwriting is wrong 
the modus operandi is wrong graysmith declared zodiac was 
attacking people by a body of water on saturday nights during a 
full moon usually young couples who were out having a good time 
which is something that he didnt have 
in contrast the new york gunman chose some of the citys most 
vulnerable citizens in some of the most crimeprone areas as his 
prey 
in his first note to police dated nov 19 1989 the new york 
gunman threatened to kill 12 people one for each astrological 
sign 
its the astrology thing that seems to be the one link 
between the new york and the san franciscan gunmen said graysmith 
the author who worked as a political cartoonist at the san 
francisco chronicle and saw the zodiac gunmans frequent letters to 
the paper spent 10 years researching his book which was published 
in 1986 
each of the new york gunmans early letters contained a circle 
with three astrological symbols gemini taurus and scorpio in 
pieshaped wedges within the circle 
after the latest shooting june 21 a fourth astrological sign 
was added to the circle cancer the horoscope sign of the 
gunmans victim the wounded man a homeless man who was shot as he 
slept on a park bench recalled being asked his birth date by a 
stranger a few days before the attack police believe the gunman is 
picking his victims by astrological sign and stalking them 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli said friday that 
investigators assigned to the zodiac task force believed the gunman 
stalking new york city had read and copied parts of graysmiths 
book 
the current gunman in a recent letter to the new york post 
disputed statements that he was not the same gunman that terrorized 
san francisco the letter began you are wrong it is one of 
the same zodiac one zodiac 
he included a drawing of man in a square executioners hood 
wearing the sign of a gunsight on his shirt the drawing is similar 
to a sketch of a witnesses description of the costume worn by the 
zodiac which included a square hood and a shirt with a gunsight 
emblazoned across it 
thats right out of the book thats very scary graysmith 
said during a recent interview theres no place else he could 
have seen that thats the only place its ever appeared 
the citys chief of detectives agreed 
graysmith thinks its a blatant copycat attempt 
i get the feeling that theres something in this book this man 
identifies with if you could somehow find that it might even be a 
clue the author added 
candice skrapec a psychology professor at john jay college for 
criminal justice said it was clear the new york gunman had read 
the book from his letters to police and the media 
the diagrams he had incorporated were in the book the rifle 
sight the astrological motif there was a clear attempt to 
establish an identity she said 
but skrapec whose specialty is serial killers doubts the new 
york gunman thinks hes the zodiac killer of san francisco 
instead the psychologist believes the new york gunman thinks of 
himself as continuing the unfinished work of the zodiac

heimdal as their towns son saturday after raising the ransom to 
free the gold miner kidnapped two months ago in ecuador 
heimdal didnt know it during his captivity but he was adopted 
by residents of this bluecollar city of 120000 who raised the 
60000 in ransom demands made after he was kidnapped on a jungle 
river along the ecuadorcolombia border 
heimdal 27 was turned over to ecuadoran authorities friday in 
the same area where he was taken april 28 said luis felix 
ecuadors vice minister of the interior he was then taken to the 
capital city of quito to meet his parents ray and marge heimdal 
who arrived june 18 to take over negotiations with the kidnappers 
they could be home as early as tuesday according to angie 
heimdal scotts 21yearold sister who spoke to her brother and 
mother by phone friday night 
the family said earlier they hoped heimdal could be home in time 
for his 28th birthday thursday 
well have a heck of a party said scotts other sister 
linda 27 
angie said her brother sounded great in their telephone 
conversation friday night 
i said how are you doing he said im fine just like it 
was no big deal she said saturday 
he said i cant wait to see you i said i cant wait to kill 
you she said laughing 
meanwhile peoria residents also eagerly awaited his arrival 
im just so swelled with pride that we got him out said 
mary noirot these are very private people and they had to bare 
their souls to the whole world that they have nothing 
the familys life savings were wiped out by medical bills after 
marge heimdal was seriously injured in a 1983 wreck involving an 
uninsured drunken driver 
weve seen the agony of this family now we want to see the 
ecstacy when he returns mrs noirot said i want to meet 
scott we all want a piece of him hes not just their son anymore 
he belongs to all of us 
i cant wait to meet scott said lynn van norman who stood 
in hot sun and chilly rain during four days of frantic fund raising 
and collected nearly 10000 in ransom 
i heard the news when scott was kidnapped and sent a card but 
then i thought cards and crying are not going to do a doggone 
thing she set up a collection spot in the parking lot of a 
shopping mall after roy and marge heimdal pleaded for help raising 
the ransom to free their son 
others held bake sales or opened lemonade stands 
after the money was collected the kidnappers raised their 
ransom to 612000 but eventually settled for the 60000 in 
colombian pesos 
when the kidnappers raised their ranson demand roy heimdal a 
52yearold cabinet salesman and marge 47 a nursinghome 
employee went to ecuador mrs heimdal declared they would not 
return without their son 
it shows what the determination of a mother will do mrs 
noirot said shes the hero in this story 
few in peoria know scott who joined the army after high school 
and never really came back he left the service after a fouryear 
tour then worked in boston as a telephone company technician until 
he could save enough money to move to quito to pursue his dreams of 
fortunehunting 
scotts one of us it was like peoria became one big family 
when it heard what happened to scott said larry chianakas who 
lives next to heimdals parents ive never seen a city gather 
itself in support of one person like this its been unbelievable

edda wallors husband 
got his layoff notice before he got his west german marks a 
sobering reminder that hard times will follow a historic day 
east germany opens its borders to west germanys free market and 
potent currency on sunday a shotgun marriage between a sputtering 
socialist economy and a vibrant capitalist one 
widespread joblessness and factory closings are a foregone 
conclusion in east germany but a simultaneous burst of new western 
investment is considered almost as certain 
economists say the variable in that equation is whether east 
germans themselves are able or willing to take advantage of the 
new opportunities that are born as the old ones die 
as the free market hurtled toward her mrs wallor sat on a park 
bench on this city on the eastern edge of the east germany just 
over the oder river from poland 
the only thing the 51yearold homemaker planned to buy with her 
new west german marks was a little security until she and her 
husband a construction worker could find jobs 
he was among scores being laid off because a former stateowned 
contruction company is streamlining its operations to compete with 
western firms she said 
well just wait to see what happens and both try to find 
jobs she said my husband is 52 but he will try 
how tough the times ahead will be depends on how much 
courage east german businesses and individuals have to adapt 
said cord schwartau a west berlin economist and a leading expert 
on the east german economy 
schwartau said he believes the economic unification of the two 
nations on sunday the prelude to full unification in december 
will create an economic juggernaut much faster than many realize 
he said the territory that is now east germany will most 
likely surpass the economic production of great britain or italy 
within five years 
i am convinced that will happen 
but he said the transition to prosperity will require shutting 
down huge sections of the economy that are least likely to compete 
he said 30 percent of the brown coal electronics textile and 
chemical industries will have to shut down because of inefficiency 
its not unlikely that 800000 of those employed in the 
industrial sector will lose their jobs within two years he said 
schwartau predicted a wave of bankruptcies beginning next 
week because industries that were once state supported probably 
will no longer be able to meet payrolls 
but there are also bright spots he said the machine tool 
industry is strong he also said 1 million new workers will be 
needed in the service and construction industries to keep pace with 
anticipated new development 
there already are signs that many east germans are ready to 
adapt in 1972 the communist government nationalized 10000 
businesses of less than 1000 workers 
so far schwartau said 7000 of those have been reclaimed by 
their former owners a sign he said that there is an 
entrepreneurial spirit lurking behind decades of socialism 
but he said many of these businesses will need private 
investment to survive 
wolgang hufenbecher head of the new east german operations for 
west germanys commerzbank said his bank has been searching for 
viable east german enterprises in which to invest 
the big factories have been virtually ruled out and will have to 
rely on government help he said but mediumsized and smaller 
businesses could get cash 
we will be very careful in the beginning with these 
companies he said a lot of these companies probably wont be 
able to live over the next six months 
while many large factories are believed doomed and smaller 
businesses may have to lay off workers retail shops feel their 
best chance for immediate survival is to sell western products 
months ago when economic unification became likely merchants 
would peddle western products on the streets in front of stores 
but in frankfurt an der oder and countless other cities during 
the last few days east german products were being moved to the 
street to make room for western products 
as it begins its economic adventure the level of optimism among 
east germans is as varied as the jobs they hold 
at baerbel schwenzers shoe store workmen put in new counters 
and display cases while she busied herself with a dust cloth 
waiting for a grand reopening on monday 
we will sell both west products and east products she said 
but i think it is because of the west products that we will 
succeed 
carrying a pane of glass into the store was joachim robatzck 
33 an employee at a glass installation shop in frankfurt 
i just do not see how we can compete with the big west german 
glass companies he said

somethings fishy with the steelhead trout its 
not a trout after all its really a salmon 
its not a decision anyones been waiting for with baited 
breath researchers say the fish that generations of northwest 
fishermen have called steelhead trout really belongs to the genus 
of pacific salmon 
and the name change was not announced on any great scale 
rather it was quietly noted by officials in washington state 
where one agency governs trout and another governs salmon its 
been accepted by the conservation group trout unlimited but not 
without some grumbling 
theres been some dispute by a number of folks out in the 
northwest who dont agree with the scientists who count the dna and 
all said jerry pavletich west coast representative of trout 
unlimited in olympia 
department of fisheries spokesman tony floor said there was a 
lot of kidding when the first reports of the change came out but 
he said state workers havent done much to educate the public about 
what the fish are called 
we have a difficult enough time educating people about the 
need for licenses or how many fish they can catch without educating 
them about the scientific name he said 
other native trouts including cutthroat golden mexican 
golden gila and apache also fall in the pacific salmon 
classification 
pavletich said he personally questions the need for the name 
change but the scientific community calls the shots on these 
critters 
steelhead are rainbows that migrate from streams to salt water 
where they grow huge and acquire a steely blue color theyre 
highly prized by fishermen for their fight and flavor theyre also 
a favorite of sea lions 
steelhead and salmon are anadromous fish meaning they return to 
freshwater streams to spawn but unlike the other pacific salmon 
and like its former close relative the atlantic salmon steelhead 
dont die after spawning

pope john paul ii isnt taking sides in 
polish politics his spokesman said saturday denying reports the 
pontiff was backing prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki over lech 
walesa 
the assertion by the vatican accompanied by its release of 
excerpts of a letter from the pope to walesa comes in the middle 
of a power struggle in warsaw between backers of the prime minister 
and walesa founder of the solidarity trade union 
joaquin navarro the popes spokesman said john paul sent brief 
letters similar in form and content on june 18 to walesa 
mazowiecki and polish president wojciech jaruzelski the notes 
thanked them for their birthday greetings a month earlier he said 
leading italian newspapers reported saturday only on the letter 
to mazowiecki interpreting the message as a sign that john paul 
was taking the prime ministers side in the political dispute 
the pope is with mazowiecki the frontpage headline of the 
rome daily la repubblica said it began its report from warsaw by 
saying the pope excommunicates walesa 
navarro told the associated press the pope is not backing 
one side or the other 
in his note to mazowiecki the pope said the prime minister 
blessed by god embodied the nations aspirations and that all 
poles should rally around him know that i am at your side the 
pope wrote mazowiecki 
navarro said the pope called walesa the guide and reference 
point on this long road that our country has traveled in the last 
decade 
he said the popes personal letters usually are not released 
but the vatican released excerpts saturday as a sign of its concern 
over reports that the pope was playing favorites 
navarro said john paul during his nearly 12year papacy has 
consistently made an ethical stand about democratic changes in 
his homeland without entering politics 
the pope has visited his homeland three times during his papacy 
his first pilgrimage there in 1979 was seen as giving a great 
push to poles striving to achieve democracy especially those 
involved in solidaritys rise

lawyers for a man sentenced to 80 years in 
prison for fatally poisoning his son in a botched effort to extort 
money from a baby formula manufacturer said they will continue to 
try to prove his innocence 
ricky irby sr was convicted of murder in may for the sulfuric 
acid poisoning of quinten irby the boy was 3 months old when the 
poisoning occurred but lingered for more than two years before 
dying in august 1986 
irby was sentenced friday by lake county circuit judge harry 
hartel who could have ordered irby 29 to death 
in explaining why he was sparing irby hartel said irby had no 
substantial criminal record before the childs death and was 
unlikely to commit another such crime 
irby would be eligible for parole in 40 years prosecutors said 
irbys lawyers said they intend to appeal 
were very relieved that theres no death penalty said 
irbys attorney robert will its going to make the appeal much 
less complicated now we can concentrate on the guilt or innocence 
in our appeal 
the boys mother sheila smith earlier this year pleaded guilty 
to the boys murder in return for a 20 to 65year prison sentence 
her sentencing was scheduled for july 19 
ms smith now 27 was said to have administered the poison to 
the boy after the couple contrived a scheme to accuse a formula 
manufacturer of selling tainted formula 
in 1987 irby filed a lawsuit against abbott laboratories maker 
of quintens baby formula but the lawsuit was dropped a year later 
on friday prosecutors said they were pleased with the sentence 
irby was responsible for the most horrible crime one could 
imagine said assistant lake county states attorney matt chancey 
he did not personally inflict the acid but he is still 
morally and legally responsible and he more likely was the 
instigator and leader of the plan chancey said obviously we 
would have been happier had he received the death penalty but 
were pretty happy with 80 years

the last food price controls will be 
lifted and energy rates will increase 80 percent to 100 percent 
the government announced saturday as part of its reform to create a 
freemarket economy 
the new rates were to go into effect sunday 
the cost of postal services will rise an average 60 percent and 
radio and television subscription fees are to go up 50 percent all 
part of the drive to bring prices up to market levels as poland 
moves closer to capitalism 
after decades of unrealistically low prices for basics such as 
food rent and electricity the increases are shocking to poles 
but the national budget was virtually bankrupted by the huge 
subsidies used to keep the prices below the cost of production and 
the postcommunist government has stripped away one protection 
after another to make industries more selfsufficient 
switching the economy to market rules requires freeing prices 
from the administrative interference of the state the government 
said in an explanation of the price increases carried by the 
official pap news agency saturday 
the government estimated that 80 percent of what poles now buy 
is priced by the market and the goverment has indicated this will 
be the last major round of price increases this year 
controls on food prices were removed during the last six months 
of 1989 except those on milk with 2 percent fat and lowfat 
cottage cheese considered subsistence elements of the diet 
although the government will stop setting the price for those 
two products sunday it will retain some control by introducing a 
new requirement that producers and sellers inform the treasury of 
increases the regulation allows the government the right to delay 
the price rises up to three months 
the government will use the same mechanism to stabilize the 
prices of coal and coke key sources of export income produced by a 
traditionally restive segment of the polish labor force 
until now energy rates still were controlled for consumers the 
new prices increase the cost for gas and heat and hot water by 100 
percent electricity is up 80 percent 
the government said subsidies to help support the coal industry 
had made the industry inefficient the government statement said 
basic changes in the industry are going into effect and will 
bring improvement but only under the conditions of a free 
market it said 
the price increases follow two marathon meetings last week 
between representatives of the government and the solidarity union 
movement union activist michael boni described the meetings as 
an attempt to find a compromise between economics and social 
endurability 
meeting thursday with prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki miners 
expressed fear that they would lose jobs their wages would drop 
and unemployment would increase their representatives argued for 
delaying the price reforms until the industry has been restructured 
however mazowiecki said said a delay would make the 
conditions of the whole operation worse and the consequences for 
the population more painful according to pap 
joblessness officially unknown under the communist system has 
increased at a rate of about 100000 people monthly since january 
and reached 38 percent 511000 this month

though police havent said whether last 
weeks record 108 million armored car holdup was an inside job 
officials who worked on similar cases say thats one of the first 
things investigators suspect 
its like dusting for fingerprints in a regular case said 
agent les amann of the fbis syracuse office when theres an 
armored car robbery you think inside job 
amann investigated the 1989 robbery of 29 million from the 
armored motor service of america office in the syracuse suburb of 
dewitt a security guard pleaded guilty last year to assisting in 
the crime for a 100000 cut two men were convicted thursday of 
the robbery 
in tuesdays theft in rochester the biggest armored car robbery 
in us history at least two men with a shotgun held up an armored 
truck when its crew stopped at a convenience store for coffee and 
sandwiches 
fbi officials said one suspect was wearing clothing similar to 
the brown company uniforms 
as of midday saturday there have been no arrests said fbi 
agent dale anderson in rochester 
the robbed employees who have not been identified were given 
liedetector tests but the results have not been released fbi and 
monroe county sheriffs officials have been questioning current and 
former workers 
armored car robberies take more planning than the average bank 
holdup amann said 
its not like the wild west he said you cant just sit 
up there with a gun and wait and jump on the car when it comes by 
you have to know where its coming when its coming and 
youve got to get into the truck 
it would be difficult to commit an armored car robbery without 
having a good bit of knowledge about routes directions what it 
was carrying where it was going that information is most easily 
gotten from past or present employees or their relatives 
and armored car robberies require more people if only to carry 
the money amann said the cash taken in rochester last week was 
estimated to weigh at least 1500 pounds 
arrests in armored car robberies when they come at all often 
come quickly 
in the dewitt robbery the suspects were identified within a 
week when a security guard confessed his involvement twentyfour 
hours later the suspects were found in virginia beach va where 
they had driven on a sixday cocaine champagne and shopping spree 
seven weeks after 11 million was found missing from a sentry 
armored car courier co office in new york city in 1982 four 
suspects were arrested including a sentry guard authorities 
believe most of the money had been embezzled prior to the robbery 
in 1983 wells fargo armored truck guard victor gerena tied up 
two of his coworkers with tape and white nylon twine and 
disappeared with 7 million from the companys west hartford 
conn office gerena has never been found and none of the money 
has ever been recovered 
in 1985 four masked gunmen stole almost 8 million from a safe 
in the wells fargo depot in new york four suspects were arrested a 
month later and two of them were convicted 
officials believe an insider was involved but that person was 
never found fbi agent john coleman in new york city said only 
15000 was recovered 
the money stolen in such robberies is rarely recovered coleman 
said in the dewitt case the suspects were caught with all but 
135000 of the money in their possession 
more commonly robbers dispose of the loot immediately 
shipping it out of the country or feeding it into the drug market 
or a loansharking operation coleman said 
they get rid of it real fast he said most of the time 
unless you get it right away within two days youre not going 
to get the money back

the soviet union has restored the citizenship of 
three emigre dissidents punished by the kremlin for antisoviet 
slander in the 1970s the official tass news agency reported 
saturday 
tass identified the three as zhores a medvedev a biologist and 
author vladimir e maximov a novelist and human rights activist 
and alexander a zinoviev a satirical novelist and professor of 
logic 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev made the decision after a 
citizenship commission said their punishments represented 
injustices that needed to be corrected tass said 
under gorbachevs reforms many prominent dissidents stripped of 
their citizenship under previous leaders have been allowed to 
return to the soviet union for visits or have had their citizenship 
restored 
some disgraced artists have had their works published or 
exhibited in the soviet union 
medvedev the 64yearold twin brother of dissident historian 
and soviet legislator roy a medvedev said he welcomed the 
restoration of his citizenship but regretted that so few others had 
regained theirs 
it is recognition by the soviet officals that they did certain 
injustices which they now are trying to correct he told the 
associated press in london where he now lives 
at the same time i would feel some disappointment because as 
far as i know there are nearly 100 people for whom the citizenship 
committee made applications including alexander solzhenitsyn and 
many others he said 
solzhenitsyn the nobel literature prizewinning writer was 
expelled from the soviet union in 1974 and stripped of his 
citizenship he lives in vermont 
it would be just and right to reconsider all these acts 
together rather than to have individual decrees like this 
medvedev said 
he was stripped of his citizenship in 1973 while traveling in 
britain 
medvedev had angered authorities by criticizing soviet science 
under dictator josef stalin especially the work of biologist 
trofim d lysenko he also wrote a selfpublished study on soviet 
censorship of mail and was arrested in 1970 and briefly 
incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital 
his book nuclear disaster in the urals presenting evidence 
about the 1957 explosion at an atomic waste facility in the 
southern urals was published abroad in the 1970s 
he was allowed to visit the soviet union in 1989 and testified 
before the supreme soviets ecology and energy commission on 
nuclear plant safety soviet media that had condemned him under 
former soviet leader leonid brezhnev clamored for interviews with 
him 
medvedev who said he intends to continue living in britain has 
a son in the soviet union and another in london 
zinoviev 60 emigrated with his wife and daughter to west 
germany in august 1978 they now live in munich 
he earlier was dismissed from moscow state university and the 
society of philosophers and stripped of his academic titles and 
degrees after his satirical novel the yawning heights was 
published in the west in 1976 
set in an imaginary country called ibansk the book was 
denounced by his soviet colleagues and in the soviet press 
although zinoviev had said he hoped to keep his soviet 
citizenship while abroad brezhnev stripped him of it in september 
1978 for behavior damaging to soviet prestige 
zinoviev published other satirical works while in exile with 
many of them giving colorful descriptions of the absurdities of 
communist society 
maximov 59 is editorinchief of the parisbased journal 
kontinent he had worked for the soviet magazine october and also 
was active in dissident causes before he emigrated his books 
seven days of creation and quarantine were circulated in 
the soviet union in the 1960s as samizdat or selfpublished 
works and later were released abroad 
he was expelled from the official writers union in 1973 and 
emigrated to paris in 1974 with his wife after accusing soviet 
authorities of creating a system of political hostages maximov 
was granted an exit visa on the same day the kremlin announced that 
novelist alexander solzhenitsyn had been exiled 
a january 1975 supreme soviet decree said maximov was stripped 
of his citizenship because he systematically commits actions 
which inflict damage to the prestige of the ussr and are 
incompatible with being a member of soviet society 
other books by maximov include farewell from nowhere 1976 
ark for the uninvited 1979 and the saga of the 
rhinoceros 1976 
the commission that restored the citizenship for the three said 
it was acting on humanitarian considerations and showing good 
will according to tass

detective michael van strattons work 
is in his blood and his blood is in his work splashed on walls 
gargled in his mouth and spewed on cardboard 
van stratton who runs the battle creek police departments 
laboratory is blood spatter specialist who has studied hard how 
blood is spilled in order to help solve crimes 
hes been known to draw his own blood and spray it onto pieces 
of white cardboard to analyze how it spatters hes held his blood 
in his mouth and spit it onto the cardboard like an assault victim 
who is coughing up blood 
its something you dont do in your good clothes van 
stratton said its gets kind of messy 
van stratton is fast becoming an authority on blood spattering 
such analyses are used by police to help reconstruct how a crime 
was committed much like skid marks can help reconstruct a traffic 
accident it can also help identify weapons the number of blows 
struck and the location and orientation of injury 
van stratton often serves as an expert witness at criminal 
trials last september his analyses were used extensively in the 
triplemurder trial of paul blanton of battle creek 
van strattons analysis helped prosecutors prove that blanton 
did not shoot the victims in selfdefense as he maintained 
the detective has assisted other police departments in michigan 
including kalamazoo and coldwater sgt jack shepperly said 
saturday 
its very good for us to have him here to help investigate 
crimes shepperly said 
van stratton uses a laboratory in the basement of the police 
department it has a tendency to get a little messy shepperly 
said 
in may van stratton attended a twoweek course on blood spatter 
interpretation at the royal canadian mounted police forensic 
science laboratory in ottawa ontario he was one of just four us 
citizens at the workshop 
the class taught by physics and mathematics professors 
examined how those two subjects play a role in analyses of blood 
spattering 
blood spatter analysis dates back to 1892 van stratton said 
but is becoming more precise and technical with the use of 
computers

several hundred antigovernment 
demonstrators returned to downtown bucharest on saturday to demand 
the release of a student leader who has been detained since june 18 
but the 200 students and government opponents were careful to 
avoid university square the site of an earlier demonstration that 
was put down violently with the help of miners summoned to the city 
by the president 
the students who plan a meeting this week to discuss a 
nationwide strategy in reaction to the violence of the past month 
also demanded an official investigatation of the june 1315 
government crackdown on demonstrators 
it came after students staged a 53day rally in university 
square and violent clashes broke out when police tried to clear the 
demonstrators from the area according to an official count six 
people died 
the demonstrators had blocked the square the capitals central 
intersection demanding that former communists including president 
ion iliescu be barred from government 
the miners summoned by iliescu were armed with iron bars and 
cudgels and they roamed the city for two days beating people they 
believed were opposed to the government iliescu thanked them for 
their support then sent them home 
marian munteanu the bucharest student league president was 
badly beaten by the miners and later arrested on charges of 
instigating violence 
mihai gheorghiu league vice president called the arrest 
abusive and illegal and said munteanus health was very bad 
munteanus wife claudia who took part in saturdays rally 
said she was prevented by authorities from visiting him and from 
sending him a bible 
gheorghiu said munteanu was being held under a penal code used 
during the rule of toppled communist ruler nicolae ceausescu that 
allows people to be held for 30 days without contact with their 
families he said munteanu also would be tried under the code 
he said that what shocked the students was not the miners 
vigilante actions in hunting down students and intellectuals but 
the support the miners received from many citizens 
we cannot believe this tolerant people is capable of such 
violence and hatred he said 
the rally was held in a side street near university square and 
organizers took care not to disturb traffic or revive the militancy 
of the 53day rally

members of local solidarity committees 
convened by lech walesa reached no decision saturday on the future 
role of their groups and many will wait to hear what walesas foes 
in the union movement propose 
the meeting was the latest in the political conflict between 
walesa and his former ally prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki who 
are both battling for the allegiance of the solidarity grass roots 
walesa says the local solidarity citizens committees which now 
dominate polish politics should admit supporters of political 
groups in order to freely discuss public issues he also says they 
should be free to criticize the government 
otherwise he said solidarity could itself become a monopoly 
and eventually be taken over by people with dictatorial tendencies 
this is about our childrens poland they are going to lock 
them up to send zomo after them if we err and not use this 
chance walesa said referring to the riot police under former 
communist governments 
supporters of mazowiecki accuse walesa of demagoguery and reject 
changing the nature of the solidarity citizens committees but they 
want the local committees to create a national federation to defend 
mazowieckis government especially now that it is carrying out 
difficult economic reforms 
at a stormy meeting of the national citizens committee last 
sunday 63 of walesas oldest advisers broke ranks with him and 
his critics accused him of trying to make the committees into tools 
for his widely expected campaign for president 
walesa told delegates to saturdays meeting not to rush into a 
decision on the future of the citizens committees 
they should first consult with their constituents in the local 
citizens committees at home he said 
try to think in a patriotic way this system to be created 
is going to be valid 50 years at least walesa said so that is 
why you should get down to consultations get down to how to do 
this 
dont make any mistakes 
many of the delegates intended to take part sunday in a rival 
meeting called by mazowieckis faction a meeting walesa said he 
would not attend 
it was unclear whether mazowiecki would attend sundays meeting 
either 
the local citizens committees sprang up to wage last years 
parliamentary campaign that opened the way to a solidarityled 
government in august they had been informally overseen by a 
national citizens committee of leading intellectuals and union 
activists who served at walesas invitation 
at saturdays meeting a nonbinding vote showed most delegates 
favor uniting local citizens committees only through occasional 
national conferences with no permanent progovernment federation 
as mazowieckis supporters want 
walesa opened the meeting by saying that poland had reached a 
turning point and its revolution may need repairs to keep from 
going bad 
all kinds of revolutions were beautiful until they started to 
take the place of their predecessors it was just a matter of time 
to show they were very bad he said ours was too wonderful 
and ours may have this same fate 
the chairman of the national citizens committee walesa 
associate zdzislaw najder told the local delegates the main issue 
was whether polish democracy will be built up from the bottom or 
handed down from the top 
also saturday the government announced that it will lift the 
last food price controls and that energy rates will increase 80 
percent to 100 percent the new rates were to go into effect sunday 
the changes are part of the governments reform to create a 
freemarket economy

a former kgb counterintelligence chief has been 
stripped of his military rank and decortions after telling foreign 
and soviet media that the spy agency should be abolished tass said 
saturday 
oleg kalugin a majorgeneral and top spy in the united states 
during the 1960s said in interviews two weeks ago that he was 
hounded out of the kgb because of his reformist political views 
kalugin 55 spoke to foreign and soviet journalists and 
appeared on soviet television saying the kgb had too much power and 
should be disbanded 
by decision of the president of the ussr at the request 
of the kgb oleg kalugin was deprived of all state decorations for 
actions compromising the honor and dignity of the state security 
organs the state news agency said 
by decision of the council of ministers of the ussr he 
was deprived of his military rank of majorgeneral reserve for 
the same actions it said tass said he also was stripped of all 
departmental decorations 
kalugin said kgb agents are still tapping telephones 
infiltrating the russian orthodox church and labor unions and 
carrying out other actions 
kalugin a member of the democratic platform reform movement 
said he was drummed out of the intelligence agency this year after 
being demoted to reserve status because of his reformist leanings 
kalugin said he was seeking publicity not only to speak out on 
political issues but partly to protect himself from repercussions 
for his reformist views 
the kgb has too much political power and this way will remain 
a threat to democracy he said i would abolish the kgb as 
such 
the kgb said in a news release kalugin was trying to launch a 
political career and was using the domestic and foreign media to 
become a public figure 
kalugins personality is well known to us his pronouncements 
with gross distortions and hostile remarks about the activity of 
the present state security agencies logically follow from his acts 
and conduct during his work with the kgb agencies the kgb said 
the former agent who speaks english well said he worked as an 
spy in the united states from 195870 first under the cover of a 
radio moscow correspondent then as a first secretary in the soviet 
embassy in washington 
kalugin said he returned to the foreign counterintelligence 
department in moscow and led it for seven years before he was 
demoted for speaking out in favor of reforms

mexican police will be allowed to operate in 
the united states under new guidelines that permit american drug 
agents to work in that country a drug enforcement administration 
spokesman said saturday 
the guidelines amount to a reciprocal arrangement under which 
the mexicans may send into this country the same number of police 
that the united states has operating in mexico dea spokesman 
cornelius dougherty said 
in mexico city the foreign ministry on friday night said the 
guidelines had been delivered to american officials but the 
ministry denied us reports that dea agents would be allowed to 
carry guns in mexico 
the government newspaper el nacional said the guidelines would 
allow the united states to have 60 agents in mexico and mexico a 
like number in the united states 
dougherty said that currently there were 40 to 50 dea agents and 
support workers in mexico 
the guidelines were produced in the aftermath of the abduction 
of humberto alvarez machain a guadalajara gynecologist wanted in 
connection with the 1985 torture slaying of dea agent enrique 
camarena salazar 
alvarez was arrested april 3 after being brought to el paso 
texas to face charges that he administered drugs to camarena 
during the kidnapping torture and murder of the dea agent and his 
pilot 
the incident set off a strong reaction in mexico president 
carlos salinas de gortari said may 25 that it does not help in 
the fight against drug smuggling 
the los angeles times reported in fridays editions that the 
mexican government has agreed to allow american agents to carry 
guns while operating in that country under the guidelines 
the foreign ministrys statement friday night however denied 
that american agents would be allowed to carry guns in mexico 
the washington post in saturdays editions quoted gustavo 
gonzalezbaez a legal attache at the mexican embassy in 
washington as saying that by no means will dea agents operate 
with weapons in mexico 
we will not allow that neither officially nor unofficially 
he said 
dougherty said he had not seen any provisions in drafts of the 
agreement concerning whether dea agents would be allowed to carry 
guns in mexico 
he said that when the guidelines are final they will be 
observed and respected 
dougherty described the guidelines as basically produced by the 
mexican government 
they consulted with us as a courtesy he said 
the foreign ministry said the mexican government offered the 
guidelines june 15 on a takeitorleaveit basis and would not 
become the subject of negotiations 
dougherty said the agreement shows that relations have not 
been hindered by the controversy and that they continue to be 
based on a spirit of cooperation mutual respect and 
reciprocity 
officials believe that as much of half of the cocaine flowing 
into the united states is being smuggled across the southern border 
from mexico after being flown north from colombia

moslem separatists shot and killed a 
hindu man in kashmir valley saturday police said the latest 
victim of violence that is driving hindus out of the only region of 
india where they are a minority 
police said nilakanth raina a former professor was shot by 
unidentified militants in his house at safakadal in srinagar on a 
day when he had planned to move for safety reasons from the valley 
to hindudominated plains to the south 
the police official who spoke on condition of anonymity had no 
further details on the victim or the attack which he blamed on the 
separatists 
thirteen other people were killed in kashmir valley on friday 
and saturday the united news of india and officials said but few 
details were available 
in one of those incidents separatists fatally shot a hindu man 
and wounded his mother friday night while they were being 
transported from their home in a mostly moslem area to a private 
guest house the police said 
police superintendent mohammad amin bhat said the family had 
apparently been warned by the militants not to move into a 
governmentprotected enclave 
vivek labroo about 20 was killed instantly and his mother 
kampa was wounded in the leg bhat said the vans driver moslem 
policeman ahmad mumtaz also suffered a gunshot wound in the leg 
he said 
bhat said seven members of the labroo family had accepted a 
government offer to provide safe housing in guest houses the 
family was being taken in a police van from their home when gunmen 
opened fire he said 
the deaths bring to 665 the number of people killed since the 
government launched a crackdown on the separatist movement jan 20 
most of the victims have been militants or separatist supporters 
but thousands of hindus also have fled their homes in the 
predominantly moslem kashmir valley since the separatist movement 
escalated last winter and prompted a heavy government crackdown 
kashmir the center of the secessionist movement forms the 
northern part of jammukashmir state and the plains of jammu are 
in the south jammu the winter capital of the state is 95 miles 
from srinagar the summer capital 
the militants have repeatedly accused the government of scaring 
hindus with warnings about terrorism and have claimed that members 
of the minority group will be safe unless they collaborate the 
government 
the militants are demanding independence for jammukashmir the 
only predominantly moslem state in india the separatist movement 
has alternately simmered and flared since 1947 when britain 
relinquished colonial rule and the independent nations of pakistan 
and india were created 
the partition was along religious lines with pakistan emerging 
as an overwhelmingly moslem nation and leaving india with a hindu 
majority that today accounts for 82 percent of its population 
both countries claimed jammukashmir its hindu maharajah opted 
for union with india but pakistan took control of the western part 
of the state while india took the eastern region the border is 
still disputed 
about 64 percent of the 6 million people in indianruled 
jammuikashmir are moslems but nationwide moslems form 12 percent 
of indias 880 million people

with palpable humility the pianist benny green 
paused three times during his hourlong concert at the jvc jazz 
festival to thank his parents a former teacher and a supportive 
friend in the audience 
but this meeklooking 27yearold musician delivered a 
repetoire of classics and original work on solo acoustic piano 
friday night that was far from humble though sometimes showing a 
perfectionists coldness green revealed why he has been roundly 
praised and even hailed by one critic as a major ascending jazz 
pianist of the 1990s 
playing rapidfire runs with both hands synchronously on such 
tunes as star crossed lovers and bud powells tempest tea 
may become his trademark the execution was stunning and accurate 
often for several minutes at a time and only after an hour of

agile even for the best players 
green who began gaining notice in the mid1980s thanks to the 
veteran duchess of jazz betty carter admirably chose various 
styles to show off his abilities but some obviously were closer to 
his heart than others 
he did delightful justice to powell and clifford brown in bebop 
his strong suit but seemed to lack subtlety with billie holidays 
billies blues 
green played several numbers from his own recently released 
first album lineage many featuring unique minimalist melodies 
in a jazzbluesgospel vein he also performed an untitled number 
that added more of his twohanded barnstorming the pieces were 
powerful but sometimes also hardhitting leaving an impression of 
youthful rambunctiousness 
born in new york and raised in berkeley calif green started 
classical studies at age 7 and was playing by 13 his ascent has 
been aided by the likes of carter trumpeter eddie henderson 
saxophonist bobby watson saxman frank morgan art blakeys jazz 
messengers and trumpeter freddie hubbard 
with his debut album and this jvc appearance green should 
establish his credentials in mainstream jazz and pique jazz fans

voices were lowered and eyebrows raised saturday 
as about 100 exintelligence officers swapped cold war stories and 
agreed there were still plenty of secrets to be kept 
it was the annual convention of the new england chapter of the 
association of former intelligence officers where trenchcoats hung 
off the backs of chairs and enemy capabilities for chemical 
warfare was required reading 
the soviets are much more active than they were things are 
easier for them now barriers are dropping said david whipple 
the executive director of the 3500member national association 
americans dont any longer believe that to answer a direct 
question from a soviet is an act of treason and with good reason 
so they are more open whipple said soviet people under 
tour cover and trade cover americans give them honest answers 
im not decrying that im not complaining whipple said 
but he said it makes it hard to monitor the whole thing when 
more and more people come here 
for spies no longer in the field the task at hand is less clear 
what do you do with a former intelligence officer asked 
arthur hulnick now with the academic affairs program of the 
central intelligence agency one way to deal with them is to send 
them off to the university to become teachers 
most of the speakers made sure to give themselves credit for the 
collapse of communism in eastern europe 
i think we really did we won the cold war said a spry 
woman in a canary yellow suit jacket she specialized in latin 
america for the central intelligence agency before retiring in 
1969 she said 
we forced the collapse of the soviet union certainly if we 
hadnt done anything they would have overcome us she said 
but some old habits die hard 
ill leave my name out of this she said

interim government in the civil wartorn west african nation of 
liberia pending elections under international monitoring 
we strongly urge the use of established liberian 
constitutional processes during the transition period the state 
department said in backing a proposal by the economic community of 
west african states ecowas 
the 16member regional group has been pressing to mediate the 
civil war that has raged in liberia over the last six months and in 
recent days set forth its plan calling for an interim government 
followed by elections 
rebels on friday captured liberias main water treatment plant 
as they closed in on the capital city of monrovia they are 
demanding the ouster of president samuel doe 
the willingness of the united states government to assist a 
future liberian government must of course be related to the 
governments representative character and to its respect for human 
rights the statement from the state department said

former us rep robert garcia was released from 
a federal prison in florida on saturday a day after his extortion 
conviction was overturned his wifes attorney said 
garcia was released saturday morning from the prison at eglin 
air force base outside pensacola fla attorney ronald fischetti 
said 
garcia and his wife janie lee were expected to rest for a 
while in florida where mrs garcia has relatives fischetti said 
he said didnt know when they might return to new york 
the garcias tried together were found guilty in october of 
extorting 76000 in payoffs and a 20000 interestfree loan from 
wedtech the nowdefunct south bronx military contractor 
on friday a federal appeals court said it had found no evidence 
that garcia threatened the wedtech corp with economic harm 
the central fact is clear even in the face of garcias 
disgraceful request for money wedtech was not risking the loss of 
anything to which it was legally entitled the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals ruled 
the court also overturned the conviction of mrs garcia who was 
tried with her husband but had remained free pending the appeal 
garcia resigned his seat in congress on jan 2 and began serving 
his sentence in march 
we are exuberantly happy that the court has reversed our 
convictions the garcias said in a statement friday we never 
lost faith in the justice system or in god and face the future with 
renewed hope and confidence 
the garcias were sentenced to three years each in prison but 
judge leonard b sand had ordered that they be eligible for parole 
after six months 
the appeals court sent the case back to sand for further 
proceedings which could include a new trial 
the key government witness against the garcias was former 
wedtech vice chairman mario moreno who testified that the 
congressman came to him in 1984 with a detailed plan to get payoffs 
from wedtech 
moreno said he agreed to make payments to the garcias because he 
felt garcia would not help his company get government contracts if 
he refused 
this is not the mindset of a victim of economic extortion 
the appeals court said in a 14page ruling rather it is the 
thinking of a shrewd unethical businessman who senses and seeks to 
capitalize on a moneymaking opportunity 
wedtech grew from a small south bronx machine shop to a 
multimilliondollar defense contractor through various bribe 
schemes it went bankrupt in 1986 after the allegations of 
corruption surfaced 
garcia 56 who was the former chairman of the congressional 
hispanic coalition was serving his sixth term in office when he 
resigned 
jose serrano another democrat was elected to succeed garcia in 
congress

the democratic party on saturday declared 
a class war against the bush white house pinning its hope of 
gaining a political edge on taxes and the economy on a blistering 
attack on the presidents handling of the savings and loan crisis 
with the blessing of party chairman ronald brown the democrats 
formally adopted a highly partisan stance on the sampl bailout likely 
to cause discomfort for a handful of democratic lawmakers but 
considered by party strategists a longsought opportunity to 
whittle bushs record popularity 
the sampl crisis and especially president bushs continuing 
total bungling of the cleanup is right at the center of the 
debate over the future of our country brown said in a speech 
that brought repeated applause from the association of state 
democratic chairs 
brown said it was a debate between republicans and democrats 
a debate between the upper crust and the rest of us it is a 
debate between those who preach policies of timidity and hiding 
underestimating problems procrastinating idly hoping someone 
else anyone else will come forth with a solution and those who 
say that we need bold aggressive economic leadership 
browns address and a resolution incorporating his arguments 
that was endorsed saturday by the partys executive committee 
stamped the partys blessing to a line of attack that recently has 
found wide acceptance among democrats thought to be considering 
presidential runs in 1992 those include govs mario cuomo of new 
york and douglas wilder of virginia and sens lloyd bentsen of 
texas and bob kerrey of nebraska 
the democratic partys position is absolutely clear we 
oppose paying for the sampl mess by unfair tax increases on working 
americans brown said 
in the speech and an interview beforehand brown laid part of 
the blame for the sampl crisis directly on bush saying that as vice 
president bush led a commission that recommended laxer regulation 
for the industry and he said bush was quick to call for higher 
taxes revenues to help pay for the 200 billionplus sampl bailout 
while refusing to spend more on housing education or antidrug 
programs 
we have found the one single cause for which george bush is 
willing to break his no new taxes pledge and guess what it is 
to clean up a mess caused by americas wealthiest people the 
bankers and speculators who ran the savings and loan industry right 
into the ground brown said 
in the interview brown said low and middleincome taxpayers 
who are paying for the bailout now know they have been involved 
in a sham they have been deceived and they are angry 
he accused the bush administration of laissezfaire 
investigation and prosecution of sampl fraud and of trying to soak 
low and middleincome americans with the bailout bill 
he called on democrats in congress to adopt a whitecollar crime 
package adding more regulators to police the sampl industry and 
demanding that the government seize assets of wealthy individuals 
who controlled sampls taxpayers now are paying to bail out 
the democratic leaders are aware that current and former 
congressional democrats are under scrutiny for intervening with 
regulators and taking other steps to assist political supporters in 
the sampl industry but they believe that by seizing the issue and 
trying to frame the costly bailout as the result of reaganbush 
handsoff management style they can strike a chord with taxpayers 
angered by the frequent upward revisions in the estimated costs of 
the bailout 
there will be democrats who pay the price said paul tully 
the partys political director 
the partys effort has not gone unnoticed at the republican 
national committee which even in advance of browns speech issued 
a statement criticizing the approach and naming a handful of 
democrats it said had contributed to the sampl debacle 
that move had democrats convinced that republicans also believed 
bush was vulnerable on the issue that optimism was tempered 
somewhat by a democratic pollster who said the party would need an 
aggressive votereducation effort to channel anger over the sampl 
crisis at bush 
its clear that they know theyre in trouble on this issue 
brown said in the interview theres a tidal wave out there of 
discontent and theyre scared to death of the political 
implications 
that optimism was tempered somewhat by a democratic pollster who 
said the party would need an aggressive votereducation effort to 
channel anger over the sampl crisis at bush they have trouble 
figuring out who to blame pollster stan greenberg told the state 
party leaders this has not yet become a clear democratic issue 
but the national party has been urging congressional democrats 
and its state and local leaders to join the attack and the state 
chairmen gathered here for the weekend expressed optimism the 
approach would work 
this is the greatest opportunity weve had probably in a 
generation to get the american people to look again to the 
democratic party on fiscal issues said virginia chairman paul 
goldman a close adviser to wilder

more than 300 scots and americans 
stood silently in a rainswept country churchyard saturday to 
dedicate a memorial room to the 270 people who died in the december 
1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 
the small room formerly a gravediggers hut is in the 
churchyard at tundergarth where the nose section of the doomed 
boeing 747 came down and strewed the surrounding fields with 
bodies the town is five miles from lockerbie where most bodies 
and debris from the aircraft fell 
more than half the congregation were relatives of the american 
victims many said it was the first time they had felt able to 
visit scotland since the terrorist bombing 
they told a news conference that they support the view of a us 
presidential commission that preemptive strikes be carried out as 
a last resort against nations harboring terrorists 
in a gesture of friendship the relatives also publicly offered 
to throw open their homes to any resident of lockerbie intending to 
visit the united states 
the relatives distributed 3500 badges to the townspeople with 
the inscription god made the scots a wee bit better 
the mood of many relatives was summed up by chip fuller 19 
from birmingham mich who with his mother georgann and sister 
stacey 20 made the familys first trip to lockerbie 
his father james fuller head of volkswagen in the united 
states died as the aircrafts nose section crashed to earth barely 
200 yards from the church 
it is incredible to come here and to meet the townspeople 
fuller said they are so understanding i feel my fathers spirit 
is here i cannot think of a better place in the world for him to 
be 
i wasnt able to come before but this helped a lot not just 
the beautiful area but the wonderful people 
for the rev cameron gibson minister of tundergarth saturday 
was his last day before retirement 
speaking of the new ties of friendship forged since that 
dreadful and never to be forgotten night he told his american 
listeners 
i hope that some of you have found comfort in the words of 
abraham lincoln which we posted at the door of our church life is 
eternal love is immortal death is but a horizon and a horizon is 
only the limit of our sight 
the statement gibson attributed to lincoln was first made 
popular by rossiter worthington raymond 
at the news conference later aphrodite tsairis of franklin 
lakes nj who lost her daughter alexia 20 in the tragedy said 
the relatives were confident investigators would pursue every 
approach in identifying the perpetrators 
the sandstone hut originally a chapel and meeting place for the 
church fell into disrepair and was recently used as a storeroom 
for gravediggers tools 
it has now been refurbished and will be kept as a place where 
relatives and other visitors can spend time in peace and quiet a 
book bearing the names of the 270 victims is being kept there 
there are two other memorials to the lockerbie victims a 
granite plaque in dryfesdale cemetery lockerbie bearing the names 
of the dead and another in park place where a block of houses was 
demolished

a bishop who excommunicated the 
director of an abortion clinic earlier had taken the same action 
against an obstetrician who performs abortions the obstetrician 
said 
dr eduardo aquino said he would switch religious denominations 
rather than appeal the decision of bishop rene gracida of the 
corpus christi diocese 
i will continue to perform abortions because i feel it is the 
right of a woman to decide what to do with her reproductive 
functions said aquino 
gracida excommunicated rachel vargas director of reproductive 
services inc in a decree sent to ms vargas on june 1 the decree 
bars her from the sacraments of the church including communion 
holy matrimony and last rites 
ms vargas and aquino were the first catholics to be 
excommunicated by gracida for their abortionrelated activities 
elva bustamante director of new womens clinic said she was 
warned that she faces excommunication but has yet to receive a 
final notification 
aquino said he was notified of excommunication in a decree 
issued feb 21 
the diocese issued a statement friday saying gracida would not 
comment on the relationship of particular catholics with the church 
the bishop is very disappointed that correspondence that was 
intended to be personal and private was released to the news 
media the statement said 
ms vargas said the decision devastated her but she does not 
plan to battle her bishop 
if anyone else has been excommunicated simply because they 
worked at an abortion clinic then we should band together she 
said 
bishop edmond carmody of the diocese of san antonio said that 
catholics involved in obtaining abortions excommunicate themselves 
we have as a basic principle love for our brothers and 
sisters he said now if you decide youre going to kill one 
of our brothers and sisters youre cutting yourself off from our 
way of thinking 
this would mean every hospital administrator who works in a 
hospital that performs abortions can be excommunicated or the 
pharmacist who sells the drugs said frances kissling president 
of catholics for a free choice in washington dc 
this is part of the stepped up campaign on the part of the 
bishops to attempt to silence catholics what tends to happen when 
you do this is catholics become angry and tend to stop listening to 
the church said ms kissling 
cardinal john j oconnor of new york recently said that roman 
catholic public officials risked excommunication if they supported 
abortion rights and other bishops have made similar statements 
church officials said the excommunications of aquino and ms 
vargas werent the first of their kind 
mary ann sorrentino director of planned parenthood in 
providence ri was told by bishop louis gelineau in a 1986 
letter that she had excommunicated herself through her actions 
said bill ryan a spokesman for the national conference of catholic 
bishops in washington

kazimieras augustinas saturday poured 
what he hoped was his last canister of blackmarket gasoline 
smuggled past moscows blockade of lithuania by someone from 
neighboring soviet byelorussia 
augustinas paid four times the state price for the nine gallons 
then wound his way from the site outside vilnius where thousands of 
lithuanians poles russians vietnamese and chinese trade goods 
from bicycles to chandeliers 
with a bit of capitalist free enterprise and socialist vacation 
pay lithuanians survived the kremlins tenweek blockade 
summer weather and power from a nuclear plant also helped 
residents weather the crisis 
the kremlin cut off shipments of oil most natural gas and other 
products such as coffee and sugar to force lithuania to rescind its 
march 11 declaration of independence 
lithuanias parliament agreed friday to a 100day moratorium on 
the declaration the moratorium goes into effect when the soviets 
begin negotiations on the republics independence 
the first oil began flowing toward lithuanias mazhiekiai 
refinery saturday 
last week as lithuanian leaders flew to moscow to hammer out a 
deal with the soviet leadership vilnius was crowded with traffic 
fueled by blackmarket gasoline only the dark streets hinted that 
something was amiss 
but as residents adjusted lithuanian officials warned the 
harvest was endangered for lack of fuel and the summer and 
vacation pay that financed the blackmarket would soon be 
exhausted the 50000 people left jobless by the blockade were soon 
expected to be joined by hundreds of thousands 
although the blockade left lithuania with an estimated 344 
millionruble deficit in consumer goods almost 573 million at 
the official exchange rate it also pushed the republic toward a 
market economy 
when gasoline disappeared people bought gas in neighboring 
republics at 7 cents a quart and sold it for 50 cents soon 
lithuanians could buy all the gas they wanted and the price dropped 
to 33 cents per quart 
the center of the gasoline trade is a bustling dusty field 
outside vilnius that has been transformed into a market where one 
can buy egyptian jeans jelp laundry soap auto sunroof ginseng 
teabags and even american currency 
prices at the market are staggering in a nation where the 
average person earns 240 rubles a month 400 at the official 
exchange rate or 13 at the blackmarket exchange rate leather 
adidas hightops sold for 700 rubles a sausage cost 20 rubles 
vitas markauskas said he spent 500 rubles on electric drills and 
barbecues toys and radiators in lithuania and sold them for 2000 
rubles in poland he then bought 2000 rubles worth of polish goods 
and was selling them in vilnius for 4000 rubles 
markauskas figured he earned 3500 rubles for a weeks work and 
quit his job in the state factory where he earned 250 rubles a 
month 
if im at work i have no time to make money he explained 
at the plasta factory in vilnius massive presses stood idle 
while a lone worker stacked plastic packaging material the kremlin 
cut off the factorys supply of polyethylene even though 92 
percent of its output of sewer pipe and industrial parts goes to 
the other soviet republics and not lithuania 
twothirds of the 2300 workers at the factory were sent on 
vacation said assistant commercial director edmundas armoska 
like most soviet factories accustomed to irregular supplies 
plasta had a large inventory of raw materials on hand when the 
blockade began 
plasta expanded its small plastic recycling operation and 
transforming used bottles into shopping bags to keep the factory 
running during the blockade 
now we are using everything we can get said purchasing

the soviet government resumed oil 
shipments to lithuania on saturday one day after the baltic 
republics parliament agreed to freeze its declaration of 
independence 
it was the kremlins biggest step toward lifting the economic 
blockade it imposed against lithuania 10 weeks ago to force the 
baltic republic to back off its independence drive 
were getting oil alma belskita of lithuanias mazhiekiai 
refinery said from the baltic republic 
lithuania is entirely dependent upon the soviet union for its 
oil and gas which it receives at highly subsidized prices the 
cutoff of oil on april 18 was one of the toughest actions president 
mikhail s gorbachev took to make the republic of 38 million 
people rescind its march 11 independence declaration 
about 50000 of the estimated 11 million workers in lithuania 
lost their jobs because of the shortages of fuel and raw materials 
in kennebunkport maine president bush praised moscows easing 
of the oil embargo bush and other western leaders had been urging 
both sides in the conflict to compromise and negotiate 
im very encouraged by that he said 
oil began flowing in at 7 pm moscow time ms belskita said 
she said the mazhiekiai plant would begin refining the oil later 
and that it would not reach consumers for at least two weeks for 
technical reasons 
were glad there will be work she said of the mood at the 
plant in northwestern lithuania it refines about 12 million tons 
of petroleum products a year a quarter of it used in lithuania 
the refinery employs 2000 people who were thrown out of work 
by the cutoff the plant processed its last oil april 23 as the 
blockade exhausted reserves the refinery produces gasoline for the 
republic as well as estonia latvia and byelorussia 
when the single pipeline feeding the plant from the russian city 
of polotsk was shut down lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
criticized the soviet union for economic coercion and economic 
warfare against a neighboring country 
vilnius radio and lithuanias official news agency elta said 
soviet first deputy oil minister lev churilov promised to resume 
oil shipments in a phone call earlier saturday to the republics 
council of ministers or cabinet 
elta said soviet officials asked refinery operators if they 
could accept the maximum amount of oil 
the lithuanian parliament on friday voted 69 to 35 to accept a 
compromise with the kremlin it placed a 100day moratorium on its 
declaration of independence the moratorium takes effect once 
talks with moscow begin but it left in place all of the laws 
passed since then 
in exchange gorbachev promised to end the economic blockade and 
start negotiations with the republic lithuanian leaders said 
landsbergis has not said when the negotiations might begin 
but saturday lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
said preliminary negotiations could start within two weeks the 
estonian news agency reported 
soviet leaders are expected to be at a critical communist party 
congress starting monday and that could affect the timetable the 
meeting is expected to revamp the party structure and could even 
challenge gorbachevs leadership 
lithuania and its baltic neighbors latvia and estonia were 
independent from moscow between the two world wars but were 
forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
all three are seeking to secede from the soviet union although 
estonia and latvia have taken a slower approach to independence 
than lithuania 
top lithuanian officials said that in two meetings with 
landsbergis last week gorbachev abandoned his demands that 
lithuania completely rescind its declaration of independence 
in midapril the kremlin began blocking all oil and most 
natural gas shipments authorities also cut off supplies of sugar 
fish coffee tea and dried and citrus fruit lithuanians 
officials said 
despite the damage done to lithuanias economy by the embargo 
there are few visible effects in the republics capital vilnius 
many workers still earn vacation pay heat is unnecessary in 
summer and a thriving black market is providing plenty of gasoline 
for private cars at four times the official price 
because of this many lithuanians opposed the moratorium 
several opponents of the resolution said they feared they were 
being tricked

the west german defense ministry wants 
to halve the size of east germanys army and limit the total 
strength of a unified german military to no more than 400000 news 
reports said saturday 
der spiegel west germanys leading news magazine and welt am 
sonntag a sunday newspaper said defense officials want to cut 
east germanys 100000strong army to 50000 soldiers who would 
belong to a united german army 
the two reports which did not name their sources also said 
west germany wanted to scrap east german tanks airplanes and 
artillery 
a spokesman at the west german defense ministry said saturday he 
had no information on the reports and could not comment 
the 50000 east german soldiers would operate similarly to west 
germanys 100000 strong territorial force which is not under nato 
control welt am sonntag reported 
west germany has already said it plans to reduce its total troop 
strength from about 495000 to 400000 within the next five to six 
years the newspaper said that number would be the uppermost limit 
of a combined german army 
the size of a united germanys military has become one of the 
many contentious issues in talks on the international implications 
of german unification 
the soviet union does not want to pull its troops out of east 
germany until it has some guarantee on the size of germanys army 
at the last round of talks between the four world war ii victors 
and the two germanys on june 22 soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze proposed cutting troops of a united germany to between 
200000 and 250000 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has said the 
ultimate size of a united german army should be a subject of the

nicaragua has asked the world 
court to postpone hearings on a demand by the countrys former 
sandinista government for reparation payments from the united 
states a spokeswoman said saturday 
the new usbacked nicaraguan government last week informed the 
court it would be extremely inconvenient to pursue the case in 
the coming months according to a statement released by the court 
in response world court president jose maria ruda of argentina 
agreed not to fix a date for the reparations hearings 
in 1986 the court issued a ruling condemning us support for 
the contra rebels that for nine years fought to overthrow 
nicaraguas thensandinista government and ordering the payment of 
reparations 
nicaragua asked for 122 billion in damages in a confidential 
march 1988 submission to the court according to a diplomatic 
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the united states has denied the courts jurisdiction in the 
case and boycotted the proceedings in protest 
the new government of nicaragua is carefully studying the 
different matters it has pending before the court said court 
spokeswoman nadia elerian reading from a statement 
president violeta barrios de chamorro took office in managua on 
april 25 after defeating the former leftist government in elections 
two months earier chamorro received heavy backing from washington 
a nicaraguan statement said the case is very complex and that 
added to the many difficult tasks facing the government it 
would be extremely inconvenient for nicaragua to take a decision 
on what procedure to follow on this case during the coming months 
in its 1986 ruling the court said us activities including 
the reported mining of nicaraguan waters in 1984 by the central 
intelligence agency were violations of international law 
as part of the ruling the court ordered the united states to 
negotiate compensation payments with the central american nation 
for what the court termed injury caused to nicaragua 
the court formally known as the international court of justice 
is the judicial arm of the united nations and has no enforcement 
powers 
it depends instead on voluntary compliance with its rulings by 
states coming before it

it was a threeday festival dedicated to 
peace love and music and there was plenty of long hair and mud as 
well 
but it wasnt woodstock not even close it was the creation 90 
festival an annual gathering of bornagain christians in the heart 
of the pennsylvania mountains 
we dont mind people calling it a christian woodstock as long 
as people understand its not centered around drugs and rock stars 
who are not godly said the rev harry thomas a beach boys 
lookalike who runs the show with a bible in his hand 
stage right are food booths and record stores and straight out 
from the arena is a tent for christian seminars to the left is the 
agape farm baptismal pond 
music for us has a message in itself but we want it to lead 
somewhere thomas said friday the middle day of the festival 
first we want it to lead to the word of god and then to action 
one path seldom taken is to the barber shop steve pannier of 
the altar boys southern californias bad boys of gospel has 
spiked hair that would put billy idol to shame and apparel and 
jewelry to match 
we all grew up in a rock n roll atmosphere we gave our 
lives to the lord and didnt feel like changing our clothes he 
said 
christian rock began moving toward the mainstream with larry 
norman in the late 1960s and 70s and later with randy stonehill 
much of todays christian sound comes from the rock music classics 
i grew up listening to jimi hendrix the who the beatles and 
the byrds and after i became a christian i listened to jimi 
hendrix the who the beatles and the byrds said mike stand 
another altar boy 
the gospel market today has caught the eye of mainstream record 
companies several of the 28 groups featured thursday friday and 
saturday have biglabel contracts 
were sold as a pop act to warner bros but theres no doubt 
where were coming from said dave mullen lead singer of one 
blood and a former radiation physicist from florida 
christian music festivals in the late 1970s and 1980s most 
resembled woodstock because the only goal seemed to be fun and 
music thomas said he and his coproducer tim landis want more 
from this years 35000 campers 
i see a depth in the crowd today that wasnt there in the 
jesus festival days when people were turning from drugs to 
jesus thomas said our people are being challenged to do 
things 
for example some groups are invited in to share stories and 
attract support from the festivalgoers one of the biggest is 
compassion international a colorado group fighting world hunger 
theyve put a special emphasis on our programs put 
together an allstar band and sold record albums nationally and 
internationally to help sponsor children thomas said 
like woodstock creation 90 even had ripoff artists stealing 
from the record and book store adjacent to the concert field 
not everybody here is born again said ed kabakjian 
supervisor of the bookstore

the 1862 civil war battle that resulted in more than 20000

sites especially important because of a fever pitch of public 
interest in the battlefields 
the largest piece of land is a 93000acre tract in coastal 
north carolina near the alligator river the property will be known 
as the pocosin national wildlife refuge and was purchased for 88

william hartwig realty chief for the us fish and wildlife 
service said of the site conservationists hope to reintroduce the 
endangered red wolf on the property which is rich in waterfowl 
the total gift comprises 102714 acres and is worth more than

the densely populated east coast states of pennsylvania maryland 
north carolina and virginia

in 1947 and it since has given more than 150 million to 
environmental causes 
seward prosser mellon the foundations president and richard 
mellons son said in a statement that the decline in federal land 
purchases and the threats to wetlands show the importance of the 
private sectors role in conservation 
our program will fill the gap whenever possible mellon 
said we feel that this program is an opportunity to say thank 
you to the many outstanding people at the federal and state levels 
who are engaged in land conservation and wildlife preservation and 
for our foundation to help protect some of these important sites 
during these times of tight budgets so that future generations may 
enjoy the outdoors as we have

the republican gubernatorial nominee 
broke ranks with the state gop over part of its abortion plank 
saturday saying he opposed a constitutional amendment that would 
prohibit abortion except to save the womans life 
i dont accept it clayton williams told reporters after 
speaking to the 1990 texas republican convention williams says he 
opposes abortion but would make exceptions in the case of rape and 
incest as well as if the mothers life is endangered 
about 5000 state party delegates on saturday adopted a platform 
that includes two separate statements on abortion 
one proposes a legislative agenda calling for a prohibition of 
abortion but with exceptions for rape and incest williams 
supported that proposal but opposed a separate statement calling 
for an eventual constitutional amendment banning abortion in all 
instances except where the womans life was endangered 
bill price president of texans united for life said the 
twopronged republican platform offered steps toward the ultimate 
goal of banning almost all abortions 
gop abortion rights advocates said the platform would lead to 
defeat in november 
kathy grant executive director of texans for choice said the 
platform was an unacceptable attack on personal freedom 
it pretends to be moderate its the old harsh antichoice 
agenda wearing new camouflage ms grant said 
but williams said the party should pick up some democratic 
voters 
theres a great majority in the democratic community that are 
prolife particularly the mexicanamericans for example by 
basis of their religion and family values and a number of the 
black community feel that way williams said 
williams is campaigning against democrat ann richards a strong 
abortion rights supporter

eventual withdrawal of all the united states nuclearloaded 
artillery shells from western europe the washington post reported 
sunday 
the proposal was one of several backed by the us and being 
circulated among allied governments for comment before their 
leaders hold a summit meeting thursday and friday in london the 
newspaper said 
the gradual withdrawal of the nearly 1400 shortrange shells 
would help ease soviet concerns about the membership of a unified 
germany in nato the newspaper said 
most of the battlefield nuclear weapons are in west germany 
eliminating those shells would still leave about 700 shortrange 
warheads capable of being delivered by missiles and 1400 nuclear 
bombs capable of being carried by aircraft the newspaper said 
moscow has called for ridding german territory entirely of 
nuclear weapons 
in kennebunkport maine a senior aide traveling with president

meharry medical college one of the 
nations few schools that primarily trains black surgeons has 
dropped its surgeon training program after losing an appeal to 
reinstate its accreditation 
the program officially ended friday the last day of the school 
year meharry spokesman richard frankel said saturday 
the college has educated 40 percent of the africanamerican 
doctors and dentists in the nation said meharry president dr 
david thatcher howard university in washington dc and 
morehouse college in atlanta also have predominantly black medical 
schools 
meharrys student body is approximately 75 percent black and its 
faculty 60 percent black school officials said 
meharry lost accreditation for its surgery residency program in 
1988 due to a lack of diversity among cases and too few patients 
the residency review committee for surgery an arm of the 
accreditation council for graduate medical education in chicago 
rejected the schools appeal in march 
in order to qualify for a residency program the residents 
must be exposed to an adequate number of patients and an adequate 
number of procedures or maladies frankel said 
frankel said the surgical schedule at meharryhubbard hospital 
meharrys main teaching hospital will be unaffected by the 
departure of approximately five resident physicians in surgery 
frankel said the 18 residents in meharrys fiveyear training 
program have been accepted into other programs the quality of 
our residents has never been questioned 
surgery training of meharry medical students will continue at 
the hospital despite the end of the residency program he said 
we will be operating as any nonteaching hospital he said 
two other training program pediatrics and obstetrics and 
gynecology are to be dropped effective june 1991 because their 
accreditation was withdrawn 
the school is still seeking to regain accreditation 
meharry officials met last week in new york city with officials 
of the interfaith medical center to discuss a proposed affiliation 
between the school and the 620bed hospital 
the number of patients and the range of operations at the 
hospital in new yorks brooklyn borough may give meharry the 
numbers needed to reopen the surgery program and save the other 
training programs frankel said

crowd he would return to the united states in october to take up 
the cause of the american indian

each leg of his eightcity us tour said he had received letters 
describing the conditions of the american indians and i can 
assure you they have left me very disturbed

umbrella mandela spoke before an estimated 70000 people at the 
oaklandalameda county coliseum in the last major event of his tour 
in a brief news conference afterward mandela declined to give 
any details of his planned return

which we have been welcomed by the people of this country by all 
sections of the population black and white and by people of 
different political affiliations mandela said 
he and his wife winnie left on a 625 pm flight to ireland 
via canada they were to have stayed until sunday but changed 
plans saturday morning 
saturdays speech was one of the first occasions mandela had 
spoken about the plight of ethnic groups in the united states 
although his visit has galvanized black activists mandela has 
preferred not to discuss the social and economic status of blacks 
in the united states he has said his visit was to focus attention 
on apartheid in south africa not on american domestic problems 
during the speech mandela promised not to give up the battle 
against apartheid until victory is achieved 
the crowd waved black green and gold african national congress 
flags beat on drums and stood to roar their support as mandela

leader said the us visit had succeeded beyond our wildest 
dreams 
i feel like an old battery that has been recharged mandela 
said 
tour director roger wilkins said the mandelas had been forced to 
leave saturday afternoon so they could reach ireland in time to 
meet with prime minister charles haughey on sunday 
that meant the mandelas were forced to bypass a reception for 
mrs mandela in berkeley and a reception and dinner for more than 
3000 people in oakland 
wilkins said the dinner was called off because of a 
misunderstanding over scheduling of the ireland meeting he denied 
mandela changed his plans because of exhaustion 
only about two dozen of the people who reserved seats for the 
100aplate dinner at the hyatt regency in oakland asked for 
refunds organizers said

two weeks we cant be selfish to expect him to stay here when 
hes already done so much at the age of 71 years old said 
laurence aikens 25 
several hundred people dressed in formal wear milled around the 
hotel lobby some of the guests had shelled out between 2500 and 
10000 for a reception that was to have been an intimate gathering 
us rep ronald v dellums the fiery leftwing democrat who 
spoke at the afternoon rally defended mandela saying his schedule 
would break the back of a considerably younger person

27 years in prison for plotting the overthrow of south africas 
whiteminority government

about 300 blacks protesting the alleged beating of 
a haitian immigrant encircled a store owned by an hispanic man 
during a tense daylong confrontation ended when city officials 
promised talks with haitian leaders 
the protesters mostly haitians had gathered for the second day 
at the store near miamis little haiti section where an altercation 
occurred friday between a haitian shopper and the stores hispanic 
employees 
conflicts between blacks and cubans over thursdays visit of 
south african antiapartheid leader nelson mandela appeared to have 
contributed to the tension 
the protesters many of them haitians appeared around noon at 
the store in the biscayne plaza shopping center they shouted 
mandela castro come get your cubans and called for 
racial justice 
about 75 riot police blocked off entrances to the mall and 
guarded the store with owner luis reyes and two others barricaded 
inside 
the protesters dispersed at about 930 pm after miami police 
chief perry anderson promised to meet with haitian leaders monday 
this has been a historic day in miami there will be no more 
beatings of innocent haitians here said the rev gerard 
jeanjuste a haitian exile leader who led negotiations between 
anderson and the crowd 
anderson and miami city manager cesar odio said they told reyes 
he was better off closing his rapid transit factory outlet until 
racial tensions in the area are eased 
it would be healthy for him for his own safety and 
considering 95 percent of his customers are haitian hes not going 
to sell very much anyway odio said 
the demonstrators complained not only of the beating and the 
cuban snub of mandela but also about preferential treatment given 
illegal cuban immigrants most of whom are given quick entry to 
american society many haitians are shipped home or kept in the 
krome avenue detention center 
anderson said he had talked with the alleged beating victim 
abner alezi who said he was angered because the employees he 
claimed beat him were not arrested the chief said he advised alezi 
to file a complaint with the state attorneys office 
alezi 44 entered reyes store friday and allegedly fought with 
hispanic employees over why some pants he had ordered altered were 
not ready 
reyes called police and alezi left but was arrested outside the 
store along with three other people said police spokesman george 
law 
haitian radio commentator pierre alcindor later called haitians 
to a protest and several hundred people descended on the store 
police later released alezi and two of the others who had been 
arrested 
lloyd majors assistant director of the community relations 
board said the disturbance saturday capped a difficult week for 
race relations in miami 
it seems like its unending majors said 
black and hispanic relations were aggravated by disputes over 
mandelas visit which drew protests from cubanamericans 
cubanamerican mayors including miami mayor xavier suarez 
refused to issue a proclamation in mandelas honor because of his 
support for cuban leader fidel castro black leaders called the 
official boycott a slap in the face 
tensions between blacks and hispanics mounted during the trial 
of colombianborn officer william lozano found guilty of 
manslaughter in december for the deaths of two blacks an episode 
that had led to race riots

the jury weighing the fate of imelda marcos and 
adnan khashoggi plunged into its work friday asking for a review 
of early testimony and clarification of the law against 
racketeering 
the jurors listened as clerks read from the transcript 
concerning mrs marcos efforts to buy a fifth avenue office 
building for about 50 million in 1981 
the crown building was the first of four manhattan properties 
prosecutors say the former philippine first lady and her late 
husband president ferdinand marcos bought with money stolen from 
their countrys treasury 
the purchase was the basis for the first of 12 racketeering 
charges against mrs marcos the others allege that large sums of 
money were transferred to acquire the other three buildings and an 
art collection and that us banks were defrauded in the deals 
us district judge john f keenan sent the case to the jury on 
thursday after 2 months of testimony by 95 witnesses all for the 
government thousands of documents were entered as exhibits 
keenan has sequestered the jury 
on friday mrs marcos who turns 61 monday and khashoggi a 
54yearold saudi arabian financier waited in rooms nearby and 
returned to the courtroom whenever keenan brought the jury back 
in addition to the racketeering and racketeering conspiracy 
charges against mrs marcos she and khashoggi are accused of mail 
fraud and obstructing justice 
mrs marcos attorneys argued that she was unfamiliar with her 
husbands financial activities and couldnt know that any of the 
money she spent was stolen prosecutors said that as a government 
minister and mayor of manila she knew what was going on 
the government says khashoggi faked documents to help the 
marcoses conceal their ownership of the manhattan buildings and 
some paintings after a us court order froze their assets in 1986 
following marcos fall from power in manila khashoggis lawyers 
contended he did not know about the injunction 
mrs marcos faces up to 50 years in prison and a 1 million fine 
if convicted khashoggi could draw a 10year term and fines up to 
500000 
in the testimony reread to the jury oscar carino then manager 
of the new york branch of the philippine national bank recalled 
that marcos ordered him in september 1981 to buy the crown 
building canceled the deal then reversed himself again under 
apparent pressure from his wife 
carino quoted a close friend of mrs marcos as saying she 
cried to him and asked that he buy it for her as pamana 
the tagalog word for gift or inheritance 
keenan also read to jurors the entire list of witnesses but 
refused to let them hear a rereading of summations by defense and 
prosecuting attorneys saying that the statements were not evidence

the origin of 1400yearold silver artifacts 
worth an estimated 70 million and possible fraud by sothebys 
auction house are being investigated by london police it was 
revealed friday 
the antiquities now in new york are the subject of an 
international ownership dispute pitting a british nobleman and 
sothebys against yugoslavia and lebanon 
the british investigation was revealed friday when raymond 
harding an attorney representing yugoslavia gave a manhattan 
judge a copy of a report from scotland yard 
criminal offenses may have taken place in london in relation 
to dealings on the 14 pieces of silver now in new york which have 
become known as the sevso treasure the report said 
possible crimes under investigation include conspiracy to 
defraud because forged export papers were prepared to make the 
pieces saleable the report said 
sothebys issued a statement in new york saying we strongly 
reject any allegations of misconduct and believe that we have acted 
with the utmost integrity 
british police say the collection is part of a larger find of at 
least 30 pieces they cited photographic evidence and witnesses who 
say they have seen other pieces 
the collection consists of 14 silver pieces four plates five 
ewers water pitchers an amphora a tall slender narrownecked 
jar with two handles two situlas buckets a basin and a ladys 
toilet case there is also a copper alloy cauldron in which the 14 
pieces were contained 
according to sothebys the treasure trove was found in lebanon 
in the 1970s and dates from the roman occupation of the middle east 
the custom of purchasing false lebanese export documents for 
antiquities is wellknown in the antique world the report said 
there is no evidence that the sevso treasure ever went anywhere 
near lebanon 
the report says evidence points to yugoslavia as the country of 
origin dealers and others report that the treasure previously was 
offered for sale without documentation but with a statement that 
it was found in yugoslavia the report said 
the word sevso of germanic origin is believed to have been 
the name of a military commander possibly a barbarian mercenary in 
the service of the roman emperor 
the marquess of northampton settlement a british trust 
established under the laws of the channel island of guernsey 
claims to be the true owner 
spencer douglas david compton the 7th marquess of northampton 
asked sothebys ag of switzerland to sell the treasure the art 
dealer initially put a value of 70 million on the collection 
sothebys sent the treasure on an international tour to 
stimulate interest in a planned auction sale 
when it arrived at sothebys in new york lebanese officials 
charged in state supreme court that the collection was taken 
illegally from their country they asked the court to block its 
sale and declare lebanon the owner 
yugoslavia followed suit with similar legal actions 
in may state judge carol huff barred sothebys from selling the 
treasure or moving it out of new york she said sothebys has not 
produced any export licenses in court 
lawyers for sothebys appealed huffs decision saying the case 
should be heard in switzerland 
sothebys commissioned scientific analysis of the treasure and 
has refused to let english police see the results but police will 
get the analysis reports by court order if necessary the report 
said

the potential threat to endangered red 
squirrels by construction of a 200 million mountaintop observatory 
prompted lawmakers to call friday for an update of federal 
environmental studies 
the us fish and wildlife service declared in 1988 that 
construction of the multipletelescope mount graham international 
observatory would not significantly threaten the endangered mount 
graham red squirrel 
but a review of that assessment by the general accounting 
office congress watchdog agency said the biological opinion was 
flawed and should be redone 
gao investigators testified in washington on tuesday that the 
endangered squirrel subspecies population dropped from about 215 
in 1988 to between 132 and 146 by may 
they said the fish and wildlife conclusion that the project did 
not threaten the squirrels found only on mount graham was 
unsupported by scientific evidence 
after the gao testimony before two congressional oversight 
subcommittees sens dennis deconcini dariz and john mccain 
rariz and rep jon kyl rariz sent a letter to fish and 
wildlife director john f turner requesting an immediate review 
the university of arizona announced thursday it was postponing 
construction of the observatory in the pinaleno mountains 110 miles 
northeast of tucson although the delay could make it lose the 
support of major partners 
the lawmakers urged turner to complete the review within 30 
days school officials said if that deadline was met they could 
possibly retain the max planck institute of west germany and the 
vatican observatory as partners 
school officials said that if the planck institute and vatican 
observatory back out it would likely doom the observatory planned 
to top 10717foot emerald peak on mount graham 
ruling on lawsuits brought by environmentalists a tucson 
federal judge in march issued an injunction and urged congress to 
take another look at the fish and wildlife services biological 
report 
that suggestion prompted mcclain and deconcini to call for the 
gao review

a signal power outage stretching from 
philadelphia to new york city knocked out four commuter railroads 
and stranded tens of thousands of passengers during the friday 
evening rush hour authorities said 
snarled were the southeastern pennsylvania transportation 
authority new jersey transit the long island rail road and 
amtrak said kurt laird amtrak operations superintendent in 
philadelphia 
the outage stretched more than 70 miles from cornwalls heights 
penn a northern suburb of philadelphia to pennsylvania station 
in new york laird said the path subway system which links new 
jersey with manhattan also was affected 
clint reed spokesman for the philadelphia electric co said a 
transformer shortcircuited in a power generating station in 
northern philadelphia 
reed blamed the short circuit on an amtrak crane that he said 
hit a power line while trying to right a derailed train near the 
30th street station in philadelphia laird disputed that 
the outage began about 620 pm and lasted 40 minutes but it 
took longer for service to be restored said lirr spokeswoman susan 
mcgowan 
she said that thirdrail power was not affected and that lights 
and air conditioning on the trains were working 
about 20000 lirr passengers and 44 lirr trains were affected 
with several trains stuck in tunnels under the east river she 
said although the outage directly affected lirr trains going into 
and out of pennsylvania station it stopped traffic 120 miles away 
in montauk point at the end of long island 
passenger gary lewi said he had to take a subway from penn 
station to another lirr stop in queens to try to catch a 740 pm 
train 
the dead giveaway for me was that all the amtrak phone booths 
were seven or eight people deep when he entered penn station 
lewi said 
people were literally wall to wall and a stream of wouldbe 
passengers were exiting the station he said adding there was no 
official announcement of the power outage 
the power outage came on the same day the lirr had scheduled 
nine weeks of service dispruptions because of work on the harold 
interlocking an 80yearold system of switches and signals that 
controls traffic through the east river

are silently destroyed by abortion cardinal john j oconnor 
said in a speech to unity 90 an antiabortion conference sponsored 
by the american life league 
his speech came on the same day the excommunication from the 
church of the director of an abortion clinic in corpus christi 
texas became public 
oconnor recently wrote in a newspaper column that roman 
catholics who are government officials risk excommunication for 
supporting abortion rights he has said his intention was to 
prevent rather than advocate the excommunication of prochoice 
roman catholic politicians 
oconnor said the church has strict guidelines for 
excommunication 
the bishop must determine not only whether the condition is 
present but also whether the decision would be prudent oconnor 
said at a news conference following his speech friday 
in his speech oconnor urged activists fighting segregation 
funding for the contras in nicaragua aids homelessness hunger 
and nuclear proliferation to devote some of their efforts to the 
fight against abortion 
as you have given so much of yourselves so passionately to 
other great causes give yourselves now to the ultimate cause the 
cause of human life oconnor said

molly yard condemned the roman catholic churchs new political 
activism on abortion friday and blasted president bushs veto of 
the familyleave bill 
in her keynote address at nows national conference yard 
declared the 1990s the decade of women in politics and said 
abortion rights would be a critical issue in elections nationwide 
women running for governor in three states dianne feinstein in 
california evelyn murphy in massachusetts and barbara roberts in 
oregon joined yard in declaring abortion the predominant human 
rights and freedom issue of the 1990s 
yard criticized catholic church leaders for pressuring catholic 
politicians to support the churchs antiabortion stance in their 
public lives or face possible excommunication 
yard said she didnt object to church leaders speaking against 
abortion or birth control 
what we do object to is their trying to impose their view on 
the rest of us by coercing elected catholic public servants to vote 
against the right to choice yard said 
what we object to is the priests telling their members how to 
vote and they do that it is a violation of their taxexempt 
status she said we are sick of some priests telling women 
what they must do 
rachel vargas director of reproductive services inc in texas 
recently was excommunicated by bishop rene h gracida of the corpus 
christi diocese 
excommunicated catholics are banned from receiving sacraments 
like communion or last rites 
yard and feinstein criticized bushs veto of what yard described 
as a very little bill giving employees the right to unpaid 
leave to care for children or seriously ill relatives 
i am shocked and surprised at the presidents veto said 
feinstein the former mayor of san francisco as governor im 
going to sign legislation that says were not going to lose our 
jobs if we do whats right and moral in caring for our family

illinois attorney general said friday he will 
ask a federal court to lift an injunction that prevents enforcement 
of a state law requiring minors to notify their parents before they 
are given an abortion 
but attorney general neil hartigan also said he will ask the 
federal courts to first review the procedure to ensure speedy 
hearings for pregnant teens seeking to bypass the notice 
requirement 
the illinois supreme court has issued rules for judicial bypass 
but hartigan said there is no system in place in the courts its 
critically important that there be a system he said 
the whole process could take up to three months hartigan said 
activists on both sides of the issue said that us supreme 
court decisions monday upholding parental notification laws in two 
other states meant hartigan alone could ask us district judge 
hubert will to remove the injunction 
the situation has posed a political dilemma for hartigan the 
democratic gubernatorial candidate who has voiced support for 
abortion rights 
a 1983 illinois law requires unmarried girls under 18 to notify 
their parents 24 hours before having an abortion the law was 
struck down by will who issed an injunction barring enforcement 
a federal appeals court agreed that the 24hour waiting period 
was an impermissible restriction on access to abortion 
but it said the notice requirement could stand if adequate 
procedures were in place to allow mature minors to ask a judge 
to permit an abortion without notifying parents 
a 1987 us supreme court ruling left the appellate court 
decision intact 
hartigan also said friday that he would ask the legislature to 
amend the statute so that only one parent be notified before a 
minor can receive an abortion 
i believe the illinois law is constitutional hartigan said 
but in its present form the illinois law is not ideal 
he said he did not believe it was unreasonable for the state to 
require that one parent be notified before a minor receives an 
abortion but he does not think both parents should have to be told

spindly barefoot girls play in 
green sewage that runs down muddy alleys of santa marta their 
hillside slum 
two young men cradling shotguns whisper about how a member of 
their cocaine gang died the night before in a shootout with a rival 
group 
an old man picks up pieces of his plywood shack destroyed by a 
mudslide during a rainstorm that wiped out 10 huts and killed two 
people 
santa marta is among the worst of rios slums most of its 
10000 residents are black poor feared by outsiders and ignored 
by the government except at election time 
its women offer a ray of hope some are fighting back against 
the chronic misery and violence 
with help from edmund leising a roman catholic priest from the 
united states three slum mothers set up a community center called 
united social works of santa marta 
it provides day care for 68 children offers classes in music 
cooking typing and sewing and helps a new cityrun health clinic 
dozens of potential school dropouts are tutored at the center 
which channels catholic church donations from the united states to 
finance tuition books and meals for 143 schoolchildren aged 6 to 
18 
for families left homeless by disasters the women have created 
a cooperative that lends money to rebuild homes 
we never imagined wed be doing so many things but the 
community seemed to need more and more so we just kept giving and 
growingsaid anita de souza barbosa coordinator of the group and 
one of the women who founded it in 1974 
the project had to start with us said mrs barbosa who was 
born in santa marta we had to believe in ourselves and want to 
change our lives for the whole thing to work 
leising director of catholic relief services in brazil helped 
raise money in the united states and brazil 
the women began with a sewing class for unwed mothers then gave 
classes in how to prepare highprotein meals at low cost 
after a baby strangled to death on a rope used to tie him to his 
bed while his mother was at work they built a day care center in 
1983 they lugged bricks cement boards and pipes up the hill and 
did the construction work themselves 
irene mattos said they started the day care center to give 
kids a place to eat lunch as time went by the kids became a part 
us 
more than 200 women and 400 children now belong to the day care 
center the children get two hot meals a day baths hygiene 
lessons arts and crafts classes and trips to museums and the 
circus 
the women persuaded the city government to pay for music and 
dance classes and theater productions in the nossa senhora das 
gracas church at the slums edge 
as a result 74 teenagers are learning to play guitar and dance 
the samba pagode and folia de reis a folkloric dance to 
percussion instruments 
volunteers from united social works of santa marta help out at 
the new health clinic financed by the city 
i wasnt eating right and my breast stopped giving milk 
said marta pereira borges 20 as she nursed her 24dayold son 
miguel they taught me what i should eat and how to feed miguel 
united social works has developed slowly and thats fine with 
the women who run it 
as long as we help at least a handful of these kids it will 
all be worth it mrs barbosa said

police lying in wait that 
friday night in april were after the usual tobacco smugglers what 
came along the road was a fortune in cocaine and a new much bigger 
problem 
a car the officers pursued went into the ditch and the trunk 
flew open revealing 180 pounds of highgrade colombian cocaine 
the seizure confirmed rumors that the legendary smugglers of 
galicia the remote northwestern corner of spain had moved up from 
american cigarettes to europes hottest luxury import 
two weeks later drug agents captured 400 kilograms 880 pounds 
of colombian cocaine near this fishing village 
suddenly galicia found itself at the top of the list of cocaine 
entry points in spain and western europe said jose manuel taboada 
head of the areas narcotics squad 
to their deal with the cocaine cartels the tobacco smugglers 
brought connections running from switzerland where they have 
dealers and numbered bank accounts to athens where the smuggling 
ships are registered to gibraltar where money is laundered law 
enforcement officials say 
the smugglers are authentic impresarios taboada said 
they dont think like criminals they consider themselves 
businessmen 
last month 350 policemen raided villagarcia before dawn acting 
on information obtained from a convicted cigarette smuggler who was 
pardoned in return 
they arrested 16 people in the village and two in madrid on 
charges of smuggling cocaine and laundering millions of dollars in 
drug money 
colombian cocaine barons were publicly linked to the galician 
operation for the first time when judge baltasar garzon of madrid 
who directed the raid issued international arrest warrants for 
pablo escobar gaviria and fabio ochoa vazquez of the medellin 
cartel 
in the last two years galicias traditional smuggling 
business has evolved into drug trafficking using the same 
infrastructure resources and people said santiago de torres of 
the governments national plan on drugs agency 
spanish police have confiscated 2200 pounds of cocaine this 
year half in galicia seizures for all of 1989 totaled 3300 
pounds less than 110 of it in galicia 
laureano oubina an alleged cigarette and cocaine smuggler was 
arrested during the june 12 raid at his 8 million manor house 
while still in his silk pajamas 
oubina 46 is under investigation in the laundering of more 
than 12 million from accounts in the netherlands and panama 
through small bank branches in villagarcia between 1986 and 1989 
taboada said galician cigarette smugglers streamlined their 
operations in 1980s establishing bases along the hundreds of miles 
of jagged atlantic coast with dozens of fishing trawlers and 
enormous economic resources 
their network reaches as far as puerto rico in march a coast 
guard cutter intercepted the galician trawler terral about 250 
miles off the us commonwealth seizing 175 pounds of cocaine and 
10 spanish crewmen 
jorge parada civil governor of pontevedra province said 
efforts to crack down on galician smugglers had been hampered by 
lack of trained police especially those versed in tracking 
laundered money 
police got little support until local residents realized cocaine 
was being brought in along with the cigarettes the smugglers 
have imposed kind of a law of silence parada said 
after the raid however an antidrug group in villagarcia took 
up a collection and held a celebration party with fireworks 
smugglers began operating in galicia during world war ii 
conducting a profitable trade with both the allies and germany in 
tungsten used to strengthen steel for arms production spain 
remained officially neutral 
after the war american cigarettes became their main commodity 
the illegal cigarettes are ordered through swiss companies loaded 
on greekowned ships in antwerp belgium and transferred to 
fishing boats or other craft just outside spanish waters 
the profits have bought beautiful estates and legitimate 
businesses in galicia and gone into bank accounts in switzerland 
where tobacco smuggling is not a crime 
before the move into cocaine many people in this poor rural 
region regarded the smugglers as clever adventurers who outwitted 
the authorities caused little harm and provided money and jobs 
taboada said 
not long ago smugglers could be seen playing cards in local 
bars with officers of the civil guard the national paramilitary 
police 
when police prepared for the occasional crackdown taboada said 
the smugglers were alerted and disappeard 
in recent years the smugglers began distributing moroccan 
hashish using a fleet of small speedboats 
on two occasions the speedboats used piercing spotlights to 
blind pursuing customs patrol boats the customs boats crashed and 
several officers were killed 
a government decree in september closed spanish waters to the 
type of speedboat used by the smugglers the hashish trade moved to 
nearby portuguese ports

it shouldnt be long before wall streeters get 
some answers to their questions about the likely course of the 
financial markets in the second half of 1990 
in the week ahead bracketed around the july 4 holiday on 
wednesday both the federal reserve and the government statistical 
mills are expected to be making news of keen interest to investors 
before the month is out many of the nations most prominent 
companies will also issue their midyear earnings reports 
the feds policysetting open market committee or fomc meets 
monday and tuesday under close scrutiny from the bush 
administration congress and private economists many of whom have 
been urging a move toward easier credit conditions 
there are plenty of doubts however that chairman alan 
greenspan and his fellow fed officials will accommodate them 
analysts wonder whether the fed will be in any haste to act in 
advance of the labor departments report friday on employment in 
june 
at present all evidence points toward an unchanged policy at 
the upcoming meeting but with some bias toward easing if economic 
conditions worsen say analysts at kidder peabody amp co 
if the handicappers are right the government will follow with 
data that shows continued sluggish growth in employment and 
business activity 
the number of nonfarm payroll jobs in the economy probably grew 
by a modest 80000 or so last month according to the reckoning of 
the merrill lynch market letter 
but while that may prove a good omen for the interestrate 
outlook it wouldnt do much to allay worries about corporate 
profits 
when all the reports for the second quarter are in some 
analysts project earnings should come out roughly flat with the 
comparable period last year 
we expect stronger earnings comparisons in the third and 
fourth quarters and into 1991 merrill lynch says but for the 
moment investors appear to be more concerned about nearterm 
results than longerrange prospects 
stock prices overcame such worries enough to gain ground in the 
past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 2351 to 
288069 reaching the halfway point of 1990 with a gain of 12749 
points since new years 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 124 at 19548 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 296 at 46229 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 192 at 36121 
volume on the big board averaged 14055 million shares a day 
against 14339 million the week before 
bullish investors have come up with one answer to earnings 
uncertainties rather than selling stocks concentrate on buying 
issues in industries where profit prospects seem least vulnerable 
to the threat of recession 
thus the list of nyse issues at new 52week highs lately has

still observers worry that a lot will have to go right in the

you didnt have to scrounge to find skeptics 
sneering at the latest usjapanese attempt to improve trade and 
business relations between the worlds two largest economies 
even as negotiators completed what they called a farreaching 
agreement last week in tokyo a prominent us investor stormed out 
of a clubby japanese corporate annual meeting nearby denouncing 
japans business practices as arrogant antiforeign and entrenched 
the experience of takeover strategist t boone pickens who 
unsuccessfully sought board representation on a japanese auto parts 
maker in which he owns the biggest single stake may not be a 
typical example of frustrations faced by americans trying to do 
business in japan but it reflects the cultural clashes and 
hostility that have marred the japaneseus relationship in recent 
years 
it was a sham an absolute farce pickens proclaimed after 
he exited the meeting of koito manufacturing co where japanese 
shareholders shunned his proposals and management snubbed his 
questions here today koito completely showed the world what 
its all about in corporate japan 
pickens cynicism is shared by many other americans from 
business executives to congressmen who reacted coolly to the pact 
resulting from the socalled structural impediments initiative 
undertaken by both countries to improve economic ties 
it almost wouldnt matter what they said they were going to 
do said michael radnor a professor at northwestern universitys 
kellogg school of business and an expert on japanese business 
practices 
there is such a residue built up of suspicion and negative 
feelings over the years that nobody believes it radnor said 
its the boy who cried wolf syndrome 
the agreement capping three months of talks between highlevel 
government negotiators echoes several earlier joint pledges to 
improve economic relations this one is designed to lower the 49 
billion us trade deficit with japan and pry japanese markets open 
to the rest of the world 
japan promised to spend more money on public works like sewers 
and roads reform distribution networks that discriminate against 
outsiders and dismantle the system in which companies are linked 
like cartels and monopolies 
the united states promised to close its yawning budget deficit 
improve workforce training and take other steps designed to make 
american products more competitive 
the us pledge seemed to be strengthened at least 
symbolically by president bushs announcement that he would 
consider tax revenue increases to balance the budget scrapping his 
famous read my lips pledge to avoid new taxes for whatever 
reason 
for its part the japanese business community made a few 
gestures that reflected a desire for amiable relations toyota 
motor corp for example said it would buy semiconductor 
components and custom electronic gear from us manufacturers for 
its cars 
the japanese economic press which historically hasnt 
challenged the insular relations among corporations also began to 
question the validity of a business culture that succeeds partly by 
shutting out foreign competitors 
japanese news accounts this past week of pickens battle for 
more influence in koito for instance suggested that some business 
people are giving the texas oilmans arguments serious 
consideration for the first time 
nonetheless hes still considered a greenmail parasite who 
would walk away if koito bought his stock at a high price in some 
respects this is how many americans view pickens as well 
the japanese have good reason to suspect t boone radnor 
said hes playing a game too but if it werent t boone if it 
were me if i had bought koitos stock they probably would shut me 
out 
in other business and economic events this past week 
bankers gave donald j trump lastminute breathing room to 
avoid default on part of his 2 billion debt but they coupled it 
with new liens on his empire and strict limits on the real estate 
landlord and developers extravagant personal spending habits 
trump could face further difficulties in weeks ahead especially if 
the weakness in property values and the gambling business dont 
improve 
more evidence emerged of an economy mired in sluggish growth 
the government reported only marginal gains in new home sales for 
may leaving the housing industry in its weakest shape since the 
last recession the government also said its forecasting gauge rose 
08 percent in may but the consumerconfidence component of that 
measurement fell sharply suggesting americans are becoming more 
cautious in their spending 
if you cant sellem rentem thats the view chrysler corp 
seemed to take with its announcement it will buy dollar rent a car 
systems inc one of the last major independent rentalcar 
companies the move partly reflected the predicament faced by 
carmakers who have too many cars and not enough buyers
