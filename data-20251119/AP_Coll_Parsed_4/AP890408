the best way to prevent a resurgence of power 
by the khmer rouge in cambodia is to hold free elections and let 
the cambodian people reject the faction the state department said 
friday 
but the departments statement did not rule out a role in an 
interim coalition government for the khmer rouge under whose 
former rule international human rights groups estimate onefourth 
of cambodias 8 million people died from famine or execution 
fear of a return to power by the khmer rouge the strongest of 
three insurgent groups in a cambodian resistance coalition led by 
usbacked prince norodom sihanouk has been a major stumbling 
block to a negotiated settlement with the vietnameseinstalled 
government 
sihanouk is scheduled to meet with hun sen the vietnambacked 
cambodian leader on may 2 in jakarta indonesia 
the state department comments followed vietnams announcement 
this week that it would pull its remaining troops out of cambodia 
by the end of september ending an 11year occupation that ousted 
the communist khmer rouge from power 
the united states totally opposes a return to dominance by the 
khmer rouge the statement said 
the united states envisions an arrangement in cambodia in which 
an interim coalition government is headed by sihanouk the 
logical leader of such an arrangement the statement said 
whether the khmer rouge minus pol pot and the other 
discredited khmer rouge leaders who clearly must be excluded are 
permitted to participate in such an interim arrangement is 
something the cambodian factions themselves will have to decide 
the department said 
we are convinced that in free and fair elections for a 
permanent government the cambodian people would reject the khmer 
rouge it said 
any future arrangements for a return to democracy in cambodia 
would also have to include effective guarantees to prevent 
power from falling into the hands of the khmer rouge the 
department said 
us officials say such safeguards would include an 
international force to monitor the vietnamese pullout a halt to 
outside supply of arms to the cambodian factions and improved 
international access to the khmer rouge camps along the 
thaicambodian border 
international human rights groups and us officials have 
accused the faction of committing atrocities against prisoners 
taken to those camps 
the us view has concerned some asian countries who reject any 
role for the khmer rouge even an interim one but us officials 
say the group is a fact of life and has too much power in the 
resistance coalition to be ignored 
china announced this week that it would continue arming the 
khmer rouge until vietnam makes good on its promise to pull out its 
troops estimated to number 50000 to 70000 
meanwhile rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on asia called friday for the bush 
administration to send military aid to the forces backing sihanouk 
and one of his allies son sann 
the united states should do everything it can to support the 
resistance against the khmer rouge said solarz who just returned 
from discussions in china and thailand on the situation in cambodia 
he proposed that the united nations establish an interim 
government in cambodia to set up a political settlement through 
elections

criminals convicted of violent crimes would 
have their blood drawn for genetic fingerprinting to help solve 
future crimes under legislation endorsed friday by state attorney 
general john van de kamp 
analysis of the unique genetic blueprint can be a powerful tool 
for investigating and prosecuting violent crime van de kamp said 
friday in support of legislation proposed by state sen gary k 
hart 
dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is found in the chromosomes of 
cells including saliva hair blood semen tissue and bone 
marrow only identical twins can have the same dna pattern or 
genetic blueprint 
under the bill blood samples already required of sex criminals 
would be taken also from people convicted of murder assault or 
battery dna analysis of the samples would be stored in a 
computerized data base available to police 
the information could link a suspect to a crime in which tissue 
is left behind rape investigations in particular would benefit 
from the system van de kamp said 
the state of virginia will begin providing dna testing for its 
police and sheriffs departments on may 1

judge gesell well now colonel that would require going to 
the president wouldnt it did you understand you had the 
power to assert executive privilege for the president 
north it was my understanding sir that executive privilege 
could be exerted 
judge gesell by the president 
north well by the office of the presidency yes sir 
there followed an exchange describing concerns by north about 
the response to congress suggested by mcfarlane including concern 
about the disclosure of clandestine ammunition shipments to the 
contras 
north i was disturbed that the answer he was going to give 
given what the press was saying the media was out there reporting 
in volumes on what was going on down in central america and all 
this was going to do was add you know fuel to the fire it was 
like throwing gasoline on the fire in fact it ended up that way 
my point was this answer that you mcfarlane are proposing is 
not going to help us it is not going to help get the job done it 
is not going to help get aid to the resistance it is just going to 
make things worse 
sullivan did mr mcfarlane reject your advice then with respect 
to the draft that he had made 
north yes sir he did 
judge gesell what did he say colonel 
north my recollection is sir that he said that he had talked 
with the president about the approach we were taking on the letters 
and that my approach was far too confrontational 
sullivan congressman barnes received a response to his letter 
at about the same time didnt he 
north yes sir 
sullivan was congressman barnes letter similar to the 
hamilton letter 
north yes sir it is 
north refers to several additional inquiries from barnes and 
hamilton and that mcfarlane briefed the congressman 
sullivan now after then in order two letters these letters 
had been sent by mr mcfarlane two to hamilton one to barnes 
north right 
sullivan he mcfarlane had been up to capitol hill twice 
north yes there was a fairly steady flow of paper from mr 
barnes asking for documents yes sir 
sullivan what are you telling mr mcfarlane that he should do 
with respect to barnes further inquiry 
north what i said was that i had attached a letter from mr 
mcfarlane back to congressman barnes in response to his request for 
documents i told mr mcfarlane to remind mr barnes that the 
classified letter he had sent earlier had been revealed to the 
media 
sullivan is this your draft that you recommended mcfarlane 
send to barnes in response to the inquiries 
north yes sir it is 
sullivan does your draft give barnes what he wants or what he 
is asking for 
north no sir it does not 
sullivan does it take a hard line position saying in essence 
that the information should not be given 
north yes sir it takes the approach of executive privilege 
 
sullivan in essence you are telling him we are not going to 
give you documents 
north we are not going to give you documents and here is why 
north says his draft letter was never sent 
sullivan so that you never did get your way in recommending 
that the executive branch simply say to congress we have a right 
not to provide information 
north no sir i didnt he mcfarlane did call me over to 
his office and showed me this stack of documents which i at that 
point did not realize was sitting over in his office i know i was 
surprised that they were there but not shocked i mean they were 
his documents 
sullivan tell the jury what happened in that meeting with 
regard to these documents 
north mr mcfarlane showed me the pile of documents and said 
there are several in here that are my recollection of the word is 
problematical that this handful and he had pulled out several 
are a problem and they are inconsistent with what we have said to 
the congress and certainly they were i think he handed them to me 
and i looked at them and they were documents that clearly showed 
what i had been doing at his direction in central america and 
he said these need to be fixed in fact he handed me a list that 
had those documents on it and as i recall also cited several 
others that i wrote down on the back of that list he gave me that 
list and said fix these documents so that they are consistent with 
what we have basically told the congress 
sullivan did you explain to him right there at the time that it 
didnt make sense to change any documents because the files were 
filled with similar documents 
north yes i did 
sullivan what was his response to that 
north he just told me to fix the documents and i mean whats 
important those were his documents i had written them all but 
they were his documents 
sullivan what happened to the request that he made to change 
documents did it just sit there 
north basically it did 
sullivan so why didnt you do what he said 
north because i just didnt i didnt think it made any sense 
a year later when north was about to be dismissed he said he 
altered the document 
sullivan that was in november 1986 
north yes sir 
sullivan did you believe it was unlawful to do that 
north no i had written those documents i had prepared them 
for him they were his documents it never occurred to me that that 
could be unlawful

president bush says he wants complete 
restoration of alaskas oilfouled prince william sound and is 
sending in federal troops and inviting an army of volunteers to 
help clean up the massive pollution 
the job of cleaning up the oil from both the sea and the 
affected land areas will be massive prolonged and frustrating 
bush said friday as he put the government in virtual control of the 
operation 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner tapped to mobilize 
and coordinate federal efforts said the resources of the united 
states government have been put at my disposal to ensure that the 
area is returned to its pristine condition and i plan to use 
them 
administration sources declining to be identified said 
thousands of military personnel would be involved 
bush announced his decision at a hurriedly called news 
conference where he doggedly refused to answer questions about his 
role in the reagan administrations secret program to aid the 
contra rebels 
he said any comment could prejudice the trial of onetime white 
house aide oliver north at which new details of bushs role 
emerged thursday 
bush told a questioner the legal process ought to run 
unfettered without you or me endangering the trial process 
turning to foreign policy bush said the situation in the middle 
east was slightly improved because of a proposal by israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to hold elections among palestinian arabs 
in the west bank and gaza 
in the middle east a little step sometimes can be fruitful 
he said i think the climate is better than it has been 
on other subjects bush said 
i have no intention of budging one inch on democratic 
attempts to get him to raise his minimumwage proposal above 425 
an hour coupled with a sixmonth subminimum training wage the 
house has passed a bill to raise the minimum wage to 455 
he will not be prodded by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to speed up a foreign policy review and return to strategic arms 
talks were making a prudent review and i will be ready to 
discuss that with the soviets when we are ready bush said 
developments in poland were encouraging and represented a 
mindboggling shift in the attitude of the communist 
government the warsaw government this week approved a sweeping 
agreement for democratic changes and legalizing the oncebanned 
solidarity trade union 
opening the news conference bush branded the 10million gallon 
oil spill in alaska a tragic environmental disaster and said it 
had produced deadly results for wildlife and hardship for local 
citizens 
he said our ultimate goal must be the complete restoration of 
the ecology and the economy of prince william sound including all 
of its fish marine mammals birds and other wildlife 
bush noted that exxon had acknowledged responsibility and 
liability for the spill bush said exxon should remain 
responsible for both damages and for employing civilian personnel 
necessary to control further damage 
however exxons efforts standing alone are not enough 
he said the federal effort should not in any way relieve exxon 
from any of its responsibilities or liabilities 
bush said the military would provide personnel and equipment for 
direct cleanup activities as well as logistical support defense 
secretary dick cheney said the military could beef up the valdez 
airport to a 24houraday operation and provide housing and food 
for cleanup personnel 
bush said he hoped facilities would be ready by summer to 
accommodate a corps of volunteers 
skinner said the volunteers might be mobilized later this spring 
to help clean up oilfouled coastlines and wildlife on the dozens 
of islands affected by the spill 
bush emphasized that we are not federalizing the cleanup 
skinner explained that the administration was not using the word 
federalization because of some legal connotations 
apparently dealing with liability for the spill and cleanup

a sex survey designed to help stem the spread 
of the deadly aids virus must be revised to ensure the government 
does not pry needlessly into the personal lives of americans 
health secretary louis sullivan has ordered 
heeding the advice of budget director richard darman sullivan 
on friday ordered the public health service to conduct a thorough 
review and revision of the survey so that it is scientifically 
sound and sensitive and appropriate to the proper role of 
government 
darman had been pressured to act against the survey by a few 
conservative republicans in congress who have organized 
letterwriting and telephone campaigns expressing outrage at the 
survey proposal 
paul mero a spokesman for rep william dannemeyer rcalif 
who has been rallying opposition to the survey said we hope 
secretary sullivan will take it darmans concerns to heart and 
put this thing out to pasture where it belongs 
he said that when the revisions are completed he will conduct 
a final personal review 
sullivan said he recognizes the survey is needed to help health 
experts better understand americans sexual behavior so they can 
improve strategies to stem the sexuallytransmitted aids virus but 
the survey should gather only data which is essential to public 
health needs he said 
my initial review of the survey instrument does indicate to me 
potential problems with the tone and content of the questions he 
said noting it was prepared before he took over at the department 
of health and human services in march 
sullivan acted after receiving criticism from darman in a letter 
thursday in which he said i have a great deal of difficulty 
understanding how many of the questions are related to essential 
public interests 
the office of management and budget which darman heads must 
approve all government surveys as part of the paperwork reduction 
act but only for purposes of reducing burdensome federal paperwork 
citing that law darman told sullivan in the letter that omb 
officials do not have the authority at this point to stop the 
proposed study 
the proposed project includes a pilot survey of 2300 americans 
to learn the intimate details of their sexual lives including when 
they last had sex what they did and whether their partner was a 
man or woman other questions asked about such things as 
masturbation oral sex and anal sex a subsequent survey at an 
estimated cost of 15 million would question 20000 people 
the department said the survey is intended to produce a 
comprehensive picture of americans sexual behavior to help health 
experts better plan strategies to fight the spread of the deadly 
aids virus and other sexually transmitted diseases 
darman said he recognized that need but as important as it 
is that is a considerably narrower subject than the more general 
subject of sexual mores preferences and behavior patterns in 
american society 
while i in no way question the rights of private researchers 
to explore this subject i do question the extent to which it may 
be appropriate for the public sector to subsidize such research 
the budget chief said

activists were thronging to the nations 
capital today for a demonstration that organizers hope will cement 
public opinion once and for all in favor of a womans right to an 
abortion 
march leaders say the demonstration on sunday will launch a 
campaign that includes nationwide distribution of a videotape aimed 
at countering the antiabortion movements trademark video 
silent scream 
the 20minute videotape abortion for survival includes 
footage of a woman undergoing an abortion to show the procedure is 
safe and simple and the indiscernible remains taken from the 
uterus in a firsttrimester abortion 
the videotape puts it where its at said eleanor smeal 
president of the fund for the feminist majority it talks about 
abortion as a public health necessity and essential for the 
wellbeing of millions of american women 
it features the central issue of this debate what is 
abortion why its needed and why the public health and medical 
establishment of our society and worldwide is for keeping it 
legal 
the tape is being distributed to government officials and 
members of congress and state legislatures as well as on college 
campuses nationwide she said 
silent scream expresses the antiabortion view by depicting 
a fetus being aborted 
march organizers said other parts of their campaign include 
applying pressure on government agencies and pharmaceutical 
companies to improve available contraception and standing up to 
operation rescues attempts to close down abortion clinics 
the march is aimed at womens rights in general and a pending 
supreme court decision that could reverse its 1973 landmark ruling 
roe vs wade which legalized abortion oral arguments in the new 
case are scheduled for april 26 
president bush told antiabortion activists a few days after he 
moved into the oval office that he wanted the decision overturned 
bush faced white house reporters on friday but was not asked 
about the march or his views on abortion at a news conference that 
covered issues ranging from the irancontra affair to the minimum 
wage the alaska oil spill to foreign policy in the middle east and 
the soviet union 
march organizers said students were coming from about 500 
college campuses many of them in the northeast where many college 
students are within easy traveling distance of washington 
other delegations of students as well as activists representing 
churches labor unions and other groups across the country are 
coming dozens of celebrities are also scheduled to appear 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said she expected the size of the demonstration will be easily 
double and probably be considerably larger than the 
washington march three years ago which drew a crowd police 
estimated at 90000 
a counterdemonstration by antiabortion advocates is expected to 
draw about 300 people during sundays prochoice march from the 
washington monument down the mall to the capitol

the bush administration wants house lawmakers 
to begin slicing chunks of money off a fiscal 1989 spending bill 
that has more than doubled in size in recent days 
figures gathered friday showed that after a week of work by the 
subcommittees of the house appropriations committee a measure 
proposed by president bush for 22 billion in new spending this 
year has grown to 46 billion 
richard darman director of the white house office of management 
and budget sent a letter thursday to rep silvio conte rmass 
ranking republican on the appropriations panel warning the 
lawmakers that because of the added expenditures he would urge 
bush to veto the bill 
darman noted that under a 1987 budget summit agreement between 
thenpresident reagan and congressional leaders additional 
spending for this year could be allowed only in case of a dire 
emergency 
in action taken this week we believe several of the house 
appropriations subcommittees have adopted items that are a clear 
violation of the summit agreement darman wrote 
conte said in an interview that he agreed that the extra 
spending should not be on the bill 
theyre not going to get anywhere with this he said 
referring to house democrats who are pushing the more generous 
version of the spending measure 
the new spending appended by the lawmakers includes 726 million 
for antidrug efforts including money for prisons police officers 
and prevention programs 256 million to pay reparations to 
japaneseamericans interned during world war ii and 350 million 
on top of a 250 million request by bush to pay the costs of 
fighting last years western forest fires 
the subcommittees also ignored a 11 percent acrosstheboard 
slash that bush had proposed in many domestic programs 
that cut would have saved 829 million but was attacked by 
critics for deriving onethird of its savings from programs for the 
poor 
the deficit for fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 was recently 
projected by omb at 1702 billion excluding this bill the budget 
resolution passed by congress last spring called for a 1989 deficit 
of 142 billion for technical reasons the total for new spending 
in a bill frequently differs from the impact the measure will have 
on the governments red ink 
among other expenditures added to the bill by the subcommittees 
were 96 million for the customs service and other justice 
department law enforcement agencies plus 36 million for 
drugtesting and other antidrug efforts by the federal aviation 
administration 
in addition the lawmakers inserted 35 million for the faa to 
hire more security officers safety inspectors and air traffic 
controllers 35 million for the prosecution of savings and loan 
fraud cases and 32 million for improvements in weather 
forecasting equipment and for other national weather service 
expenses 
bushs bill had included 892 million for the guaranteed student 
loan program for college students 850 million for costofliving 
increases in veterans benefits and other department of veterans 
affairs programs 423 million for foster care and adoption 
programs 100 million for the costs of increased immigration from 
the soviet union southeast asia and africa and 55 million for 
the governments uranium program 
the full appropriations committee is expected to consider the 
bill no earlier than the week of april 18 the senate has yet to 
work on the measure

senate democrats and the white house will 
clash directly for the first time next week over raising the 335 
hourly minimum wage with more skirmishes expected before the 
nations 5 million lowest paid workers get an increase 
leaders of both parties in the senate agreed friday to hold 
backtoback votes tuesday the first on the latest democratic 
version for annual increases of 40 cents an hour to 455 by 
october 1991 and the second on bushs offer of yearly 30cent 
boosts to 425 by january 1992 
republican leader bob dole conceded his party and bush are 
likely to lose both votes but dole expressed confidence of a 
victory when the president vetoes the measure as he promised again 
friday and democrats attempt to override the veto 
the chief sponsor of the raise sen edward m kennedy dmass 
acknowledged he lacks the 16 additional votes needed to muster a 
twothirds majority for overriding a presidential veto 
i would hope they dont again lay down this line in the 
sand kennedy said challenging the administrations insistence 
on no more compromises theyve come a long way weve come a 
long way 
democrats on friday subtracted a dime from the 465 federal 
floor on wages they had wanted and they accepted for the first 
time a 60day subminimum training wage for workers entering 
their first job 
bush however told reporters he had no intention of budging 
one inch on allowing a minimum wage that high or on accepting 
that short a period during which employers could pay a training 
wage 20 percent below the federal floor 
i will veto any bill which exceeds a 425 wage level and 
which does not contain a sixmonth training wage for new hires 
he said in a letter friday to dole 
the latest democratic plan was put together by kennedy and sens 
bob graham of florida and david pryor of arkansas except for minor 
differences on the subminimum scale it is identical to a bill 
passed by the house last month 
in the house version an employer could pay the lower subminimum 
skill only to workers in their first job the senate measure would 
require a worker to have at least 60 days experience in one or 
more jobs before any employer would have to pay the higher scale 
bushs subminimum would allow employers to continue paying 335 
to any new hires regardless of their previous experience for six 
months that subminimum would rise to 340 an hour in 1992 under 
the presidents proposal while the democrats would do away with it 
entirely then

the soviet union bugged the us consulate in 
leningrad the state department charged in a statement that called 
the action reprehensible no matter how long ago the listening 
devices were planted 
the state department said friday the listening devices were 
discovered in early february during an inspection by security 
personnel 
such hostile attempts at intelligence gathering however long 
ago they may have been initiated are deeply resented by the 
american people the department said it had told the soviets in a 
protest 
the devices in the consulate which was opened in 1973 were 
discovered by officers from the bureau of diplomatic security the 
statement said 
according to a us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity the devices were implanted deep in the structure a 
long time ago he declined to provide further details 
in 1985 the united states accused the soviets of planting 
listening devices in the new us embassy chancery in moscow in 
1987 a marine guard sgt clayton lonetree was accused and 
courtmartialed on charges he permitted soviet intelligence agents 
to gain access to the us embassy 
the latest accusation of soviet intrusion was unexpected the 
two governments were in the process of deciding whether to open new 
consulates in kiev and new york 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile was in the 
midst of deciding what to do about the us embassy in moscow 
the two aides he sent there on an inspection trip returned two 
weeks ago with a recommendation to salvage part of the chancery an 
administration official said wednesday 
the inspection was conducted by nicholas m salgo a former us 
ambassador to hungary and ivan selin who has been nominated to be 
undersecretary of state for management 
they told baker on their return that refurbishing the building 
or even constructing an annex would be cheaper than razing the 
chancery and starting over the estimated cost of tearing down and 
rebuilding the structure is 500 million 
a trade group headed by dwayne o andreas chairman of archer 
daniels midland co offered to buy the building for use as 
business offices 
andreas is cochairman of the usussr trade and economic 
council which promotes trade between the two superpowers he made 
the offer on behalf of a consortium of us companies which would 
use the building as a moscow headquarters

administration officials knew at the time 
about a november 1985 shipment of missiles to iran according to 
oliver norths defense 
during his examination friday of north defense attorney brendan 
sullivan brought out that top officials were given data from 
intelligence intercepts tracking the 1985 shipment almost hourly 
north examining one of the intercepts noted the exact minute a 
plane touched down in iran 
north denied however that he falsely stated to congress that 
no one in the us government learned before 1986 that hawk 
missiles had been shipped to iran in november 1985 
north testified that although he was at a meeting nov 20 1986 
where congressional testimony was discussed he played no part in 
shaping prepared testimony 
according to the evidence those receiving summaries of such 
intercepts included national security adviser robert mcfarlane or 
north and cia director william casey or his deputy also receiving 
them were defense secretary caspar weinberger and the chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff john vessey and his deputy 
casey sat in on the nov 20 1986 meeting which was intended to 
prepare him and national security adviser john poindexter for 
congressional appearances on the iran initiative the next day 
according to testimony 
the cia participants brought to the meeting a proposed insert 
saying the spy agency had been told the shipment was oil drilling 
equipment 
the cia had arranged at norths request to have one of its 
airlines transport the hawks in 1985 but did so without first 
getting a presidential finding 
north recalled that as the irancontra affair unfolded in 
november 1986 he spoke to his former boss mcfarlane about the 
shipment of hawks 
mcfarlane said that it didnt happen north said 
you knew it happened asked sullivan 
yes sir replied north he called me up from europe and 
made it happen 
in testimony during norths trial mcfarlane had a different 
recollection mcfarlane said north told him that he believed he 
and i hadnt learned the precise details of what happened until 
12 months after the shipment 
mcfarlane said he doubted at the time of the 1986 conversation 
that north was correct but that his own memory of the 1985 
shipment was hazy so that he couldnt contradict north 
as a result mcfarlane said he changed a chronology of the iran 
arms shipments removing a reference to the november 1985 shipment 
of hawks and substituting instead a more general reference to other 
transfers of equipment

sullivan when you were having the discussions with mr 
mcfarlane back in august and september of 1985 as to how to answer 
these congressmen you were arguing to him that he should not 
respond did it ever occur to you that his response was unlawful 
north no in fact it never occurred to me the letter 
could be a violation of the law 
sullivan had you ever heard of a circumstance in which a letter 
from a cabinet officer to a congressman would be the basis for a 
criminal charge 
north no these were political disputes this was a political 
battle the likes of which i guess washington has a lot of them it 
was a nasty political dispute it was politics at its worst but it 
never occurred to me ive never heard of it before or since until 
this that that kind of a thing could be unlawful i mean my 
argument against responding to barnes and hamilton wasnt based 
on something being unlawful my argument was based on the fact that 
if theres ever a chance to use this kind of privilege authority 
it ought to be used on this it never occurred to me that it 
was unlawful 
sullivan the next thing that happens lets go to june 1986 
what does the congress do at that time with regard to a resolution 
of inquiry the house resolution formally requested information on 
norths activities what was the conclusion you drew from this 
resolution 
north well the conclusion i drew is this was just one more 
chapter in this very bitter political dispute in which both sides 
were pulling out all the stops our response was the fact 
that weve answered these questions before meaning mr mcfarlanes 
answers the year before 
north then discusses an informal meeting with rep hamilton in 
the white house situation room on aug 6 1986 
sullivan what did that mean to you informal off the record 
north i guess my sense of it was that this was simply an effort 
to stop the inquiries 
sullivan did you ever think you would be in a courtroom some 
day in 1989 being charged with a crime because of a meeting that 
occurred on august 6th 1986 which was off the record informal 
north no sir 
sullivan did you tell them the truth at that meeting on august 
6th 1986 
north no 
sullivan when you didnt disclose information they were looking 
at did you believe that your conduct was unlawful 
north no i didnt think it was unlawful but i was raised to 
know the difference between right and wrong i knew it wasnt right 
not to tell the truth on those things but i didnt think it was 
unlawful 
sullivan how did you feel about being told by your boss to go 
into a meeting on august 6th 1986 
north i felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by 
giants i had been told specifically that the saudi aid that 
the president had gotten and that mr mcfarlane had gotten will 
never be revealed and by this time we were also using monies from 
the sale of arms to the nicaraguan resistance to the iranians to 
help the nicaraguan resistance and that would never be revealed 
sullivan was it your understanding that if you answered frankly 
the questions that were asked in that session that it would lead to 
being confronted with having to reveal some of those things 
north yes and thats why i didnt think that that meeting was 
a good idea 
sullivan and did you tell admiral poindexter that 
north i did 
sullivan and what was his decision 
north you can take care of it 
north describes exchanges in which his superior adm john 
poindexter mcfarlanes successor as national security adviser 
discussed concerns that too many people were beginning to find out 
what north is doing in central america 
north he told me that i must generate a cover story 
just dont be letting people know where you are going what you are 
doing and why you are doing it and so i did so 
sullivan now poindexter speaks of operational roles 
what did you understand it to mean 
north well he specifically said to me that goes for the 
terrorism business that goes for the hostage business that goes 
for all the reasons that youre doing with the resistance

animalrights activists say letting bulls 
loose in an arena with rodeo clowns will exploit and mentally 
torment the animals 
it is morally ethically and legally wrong to torment an 
animal to the point where its going to charge you said raini 
sequoya president of the tampabased national animal rights inc 
if these clowns really want to have some fun they should get in 
the ring and torment each other why pick on a helpless animal 
but organizers of this weekends odessa rodeo amp yukon days said 
nothing is wrong with the crowdpleasing event 
i dont understand is waving a flag in a bulls face more 
cruel than getting on his back and riding him said organizer 
john burchell 
steve fleming spokesman for the professional rodeo cowboys 
association in colorado was taken aback by the criticism 
this is great a clown goes out and stands in the middle 
of an arena and they let a bull out to chase him kind of like 
turning a bulldog loose on a mailman and people are worried for 
the bull said fleming 
the event is for clowns to display their bravery and talent he 
said the clowns have 70 seconds to show judges how they avoid 
getting killed they cant touch the bull or use weapons and have 
only a barrel to crawl into 
the activists had vowed to seek an injunction to stop the event 
on the grounds that it breaks floridas 88yearold animal cruelty 
law but they had not done so by friday and were considering plans 
to file legal action after the event

her voice trembling with pain and then anger 
eleanor bright recalled her late husband and lambasted what she 
called the callousness of us officials following the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 
after suffering the unimaginable loss of my husband i have 
had to fight to get information thats not right said mrs 
bright the mother of a 19monthold son echoing complaints from 
other victims family members 
a senate hearing room was hushed friday the only sound an 
occasional muffled cry from other family members as the 
32yearold widow from brookline mass told about the 
difficulties of getting information from the state department 
following the dec 21 terrorist bombing over scotland that claimed 
270 victims 
i call washington i call scotland and in anger and 
frustration i call other victims she told the senate foreign 
relations terrorism subcommittee 
the stories never end she said memorials unattended by 
state department officials someone told to come pick up the 
shipment when her husbands body arrived from scotland someone 
else watched as the body of her loved one was lifted off a platform 
using a forklift one widow was told it was time to realize that 
her husband was dead and get on with her life 
mrs bright unable to steady her voice told a subcommittee 
headed by john f kerry dmass of her own experiences how it 
was nine hours after the accident before the airline called how 
the state department did not call for days and how the only answers 
at the accident scene in lockerbie scotland came from scottish 
officials 
i learned through my husbands employer that nicholas was 
seated in seat 14a directly over the bomb she said i need to 
know what that meant was he ever aware of what was happening was 
he ever afraid was he in pain 
it was not until february that i learned by chance that an 
autopsy had been performed on nicholas all of this information 
should have given by the state department or pan am but it wasnt 
why were they silent instead of me being allowed to grieve for the 
loss of my husband i was forced to seek out answers on my own 
as my husband so strongly believed there is a right answer 
and its worth fighting for the right answer is that we need a 
responsive informative and compassionate state department mrs 
bright said it would not have taken a lot of manpower or dollars 
to have dealt with this differently 
assistant secretary of state joan m clark defended the 
governments response saying the state department had planned to 
contact nextofkin but pan am wanted to do it and the government 
has no legal authority to compel an airline to give us a 
passenger list 
our objective was to spare the families as much anguish as 
possible she said we refrained however from taking a more 
active role with family members for fear of intruding unnecessarily 
during that time of tragedy and shock 
but she conceded that the state department has learned a great 
deal from this experience and are reviewing our methods for 
handling crises and are making appropriate changes 
she said the government is seeking an agreement with the major 
airlines to coordinate emergency action plans in addition the 
department has organized an 18member special family liaison group 
to provide oneonone information for each family of the flight 103 
disaster and is considering an 800 telephone number in disaster 
situations 
kerry joined the family members in calling for a new policy to 
tell passengers about terrorist threats and to increase airport 
security checks even if it means much longer waiting times for 
passengers 
monte r belger associate administrator at the federal aviation 
administration said he believes new government regulations 
mandating devices to detect plastic explosives and other changes 
ordered in the wake of the flight 103 disaster are sufficient

powerful currents and a channel thats tough 
to negotiate may have been partly to blame for the grounding of an 
exxon tanker on a sandbar in the mississippi river a coast guard 
official said 
the 617foot exxon wilmington carrying 13 million gallons of 
oil products got stuck friday on the muddy bottom near the mouth 
of the mississippi river four tugboats freed it after seven hours 
no oil spilled from the ship 
where the rivers at now its tricky down there said capt 
john klotz of the coast guards district headquarters 
klotz said the river is rising and currents are powerful where 
the ship went aground a point where the main channel splits into 
three smaller channels emptying into the gulf of mexico 
he said the river is 38 to 39 feet deep there though the army 
corps of engineers tries to maintain a 45foot depth 
klotz who inspected the grounded exxon wilmington from a 
helicopter said checks of the ships double hull indicated it was 
undamaged 
the wilmington steamed friday night to an anchorage in the gulf 
of mexico where coast guard inspectors were to give its hull a 
final check for damage before letting it proceed to a refinery at 
bayway nj 
the coast guard is investigating why the wilmington ran aground 
the ship was loaded with more than 8 million gallons of jet fuel 
and nearly 5 million gallons of other petroleum products mainly 
paraffin it took on the cargo at the exxon refinery at baton 
rouge said exxon spokesman john reidy 
it was the second exxon tanker to run aground on march 24 the 
exxon valdez struck a reef in alaskas prince william sound and 
spilled 101 million barrels of oil in the worst spill in us

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev ended a 
sixday tour of ireland cuba and britain by announcing nuclear 
cutbacks and inviting queen elizabeth ii to visit moscow 
prime minister margaret thatcher said friday that the queen gave 
a very definite yes but that no date had been set 
she would be the first british sovereign to visit the soviet 
union since the 1917 revolution her russian ancestors the family 
of czar nicholas ii were slain by revolutionaries eight decades 
ago 
gorbachevs invitation to the queen indicated his success in 
winning mrs thatchers trust in addition televised pictures of 
the gorbachevs being escorted around windsor castle by the 
63yearold queen and her husband prince philip further warmed 
the royaltyloving british to the soviet leader 
despite the invitation and the cordiality mrs thatcher and 
gorbachev disagreed on issues of nuclear disarmament and the 
balance of eastwest forces in europe 
mrs thatcher moreover downplayed the importance of the soviet 
leaders promise to halt production of weaponsgrade uranium and 
shut down two more plutoniumproducing reactors by the end of 1990 
nevertheless she declared gorbachevs third visit to britain 
very successful warm and friendly echoing his assertion that 
it had strengthened britishsoviet ties 
the gorbachevs 40hour british stay ended with a day steeped in 
pageantry 
the president gave an unusually brief 27minute speech in the 
splendid setting of londons guildhall the 1000yearold seat of 
city government filled with city leaders in wigs and robes 
in remarks broadcast live in britain and the united states 
gorbachev called his proposals for cutting production of 
radioactive material another major step toward the complete 
cessation of production of fissionable materials for use in nuclear 
weapons 
however mrs thatcher later ascribed little importance to the 
moves saying existing soviet stockpiles would mean the cutbacks 
will have no effect in practice a us defense department 
official said the weapons reactors could be started when the soviet 
military runs low 
the soviet step followed gorbachevs december announcement to 
the united nations that the soviet union would soon cut 500000 
soldiers from its standing army and withdraw troops and tanks from 
european and chinese frontiers 
gorbachev lauded britain for unilaterally eliminating chemical 
weapons stocks he said his country had built a facility for 
destroying its own chemical weapons and he would soon invite 
british experts to inspect it 
the president also said the west should drop plans to modernize 
shortrange nuclear missiles but mrs thatcher maintained a 
nuclear deterrent was essential 
after lunch at windsor castle the gorbachevs were driven to 
londons heathrow airport where they flew home to moscow

north resumes his testimony after a lunch break 
sullivan would you read this letter is it a letter or the back 
and front of a postcard of some sort do you recall 
north this appears to be a copy of a card with the front and 
back written on it yes sir 
sullivan all right would you read that to the jury please 
this is from vice president bush in november 1985 
north it says en route to andrews 112985 dear ollie as 
i head off to maine for thanksgiving i just want to wish you a 
happy one with the hope that you get some well deserved rest one 
with the hope that you get some well deserved rest one of the many 
things i have to be thankful for is the way in which you have 
performed under fire in tough situations 
your dedication and tireless work with the hostage thing and 
with central america really gives me cause for great pride in you 
and thanks get some turkey george bush 
sullivan that was received in november 1985 correct 
north yes sir 
sullivan now would you explain to the jury please how it 
is that you got involved in your office with trying to rescue 
hostages 
north the hostage problem was part of the overall program of 
combating terrorism that the administration had and it was a very 
important element of it because we had an increasing number of 
hostages being held a consultant who was working for the nsc 
mr ledeen had brought back from israel information that they 
thought that they could achieve an opening to iran to moderate 
elements within the iranian government that there was great 
polarization great disarray in iran that the israelis were fairly 
sure of their information and had an agent working for them that 
could put us in touch with them and it involved the exchange of 
certain israeli weapons to iran which could result in the release 
of both israeli hostages in lebanon and the american hostages in 
lebanon 
sullivan colonel would you explain why you are dealing with 
the country of iran if the hostages were in lebanon 
north within lebanon there were several groups of shia 
fundamentalists moslem fundamentalists who had political loyalty 
to the ayatollah khomeini in iran and so the israelis and we 
agreed though that if you could influence some of the more 
moderate elements in iran to cut them off financially or to 
convince them to turn loose the american hostages and the jewish 
hostages that were being held along with some other europeans like 
the french and italians and british 
sullivan were there missiles sent to iran and did a hostage 
come out as a result 
north yes it did the hostage was rev benjamin weir i 
took at the direction of the president a letter from the 
president to meet mr weir reverend weir met with him had a cia 
airplane take me to the meeting in an effort to assure reverend 
weir that his cooperation was necessary for us to be able to help 
rescue the other or recover the other hostages 
north describes how he continued meeting with israeli 
intermediaries in an attempt to open up discussions with moderates 
in iran in an attempt to gain the release of us hostages being 
held in lebanon 
north i went and talked to mr mcfarlane about this in terms of 
how far we were going on this initiative and what role we were to 
play and he told me simply that we were going to allow the 
israelis to proceed with this that it was their initiative and 
that we were to simply position the necessary people in the right 
places to be able to safely recover the hostages and be prepared 
for a high level meeting with the iranians 
sullivan colonel lets focus on the dates a little bit 
here september 85 tow missiles are shipped is that correct 
north i believe so yes sir 
sullivan you were not involved in the earliest stages of that 
correct 
north no but at one point i did ask mr mcfarlane if the 
president approved it and he told me he had 
north describes a shipment of hawk missiles to iran through the 
israelis to get the hostages freed 
sullivan were the transportation and logistical problems with 
the shipment eventually worked out 
north yes they were from purely the transportation problem 
but they werent worked out as far as the iranians were concerned 
the missiles were eventually shipped and they did arrive in a 
city in iran not tehran but another city and it wasnt the full 
80 that they had asked for it was only 18 i believe 
sullivan and was it anticipated that hostages would be released 
as a result of this november 85 hawk shipment 
north yes and we had gone to some lengths to position the 
appropriate people to receive them we had no operational role 
in this other than to recover the hostages when they were released 
we werent planning any of this we were kind of responding to it 
sullivan now colonel focusing your attention after the hawk 
shipment could you describe to the jury what problem arose after 
the hawks arrived in iran did a hostage get out as anticipated 
north on the november shipment no apparently what the 
iranians had been told by the israeli agent was something different 
than what they expected and they were to put it mildly very angry 
over what was delivered in that november shipment the november 
shipment was 18 hawk missiles and they had apparently expected 
something entirely different the iranians came back to the 
israelis very very upset about what had transpired and they said 
that theyd been cheated and that therefore nobody was going to be 
released no israelis no americans no europeans nobody

the nuclear regulatory commission hopes its 
streamlining of the nuclear licensing process will keep the 
industry alive by cutting the time needed to build a nuclear power 
plant by roughly half 
the new licensing procedures approved by the fivemember 
commission without dissent on friday have been under development 
for more than two years and have been the subject of hearings and 
briefings 
the commission staff utility executives and other analysts have 
said that there was no chance anyone would ever build another plant 
without some licensing simplification although there is no sign 
that any utilities are close to seeking approval 
the procedures try to resolve all major issues before a decision 
on whether to go ahead with a plant they provide for advance 
approval of plant designs that could be used with little further 
examination and of sites that utilities could designate far in 
advance of need 
also the commission would go a long way toward the 
muchdiscussed onestop license issuing a combined 
construction permit and operating license 
license applicants could still use the old procedure but the 
commission does not expect anyone to do so 
site approval would be good for 20 years 
without new legislation which the commission has been unable to 
win the procedure cannot be completely onestop under current 
law the commission still will have to hold both a licensing 
hearing and a hearing after a plant has been built before it can be 
started 
the new combined license would be issued only after safety and 
site issues such as planning for emergency evacuations had been 
resolved the range of issues that could be raised at the second 
hearing on whether license conditions had been met would be 
narrowed and commission chairman lando zech told reporters he did 
not think legislation was necessary now 
at the second hearing issues would be limited to allegations of 
material and uncorrected nonconformance with license 
conditions or that adequate protection of the public is in 
jeopardy 
failure of state and local governments to cooperate in emergency 
planning has held up licensing of the completed shoreham plant on 
long island and the seabrook plant on the new hampshire coast 
under the new procedure an applicant would have to show a 
good faith effort to win such cooperation in evacuation 
planning and that the plan could work even without it 
these issues are not even considered under the current procedure 
until the plant is finished and the question before the commission 
is whether to allow operation 
huge cost escalations a drastic slowing of growth in 
electricity demand in the past decade and fears generated by the 
partial core melt of the three mile island plant in pennsylvania in 
1979 and other accidents combined years ago to kill new orders for 
an industry that provides 18 percent of the nations electricity

the soviet embassy confirmed that a 
nuclearpowered submarine suffered an underwater accident and sank 
in international waters off northern norway according to a radio 
report saturday 
defense minister johan juergen holst said on norwegian radio 
that estimates of about 12 fatalities from the sinking friday of 
the soviet mike class submarine appeared accurate some crewmen 
apparently were rescued holst said but he provided no details 
a norwegian orion reconnaissance plane saw soviet ships and 
planes circling the accident site north of the arctic circle before 
nightfall friday a second orion passed over the area after 
midnight and spotted an oil slick on the sea holst said 
he said a soviet cruiser was en route to the scene and that 
norwegian vessels had made no attempts to approach the site 118 
miles southsouthwest of bear island in the norwegian sea and 312 
miles off norway 
norwegian experts were meeting saturday morning to discuss the 
situation and keep the government informed about the possibility of 
a radiation leak the broadcast said 
by saturday more than 12 hours after the accident there was no 
word on the accident from the soviet government or the official 
tass news agency 
the sea is 6600 feet deep at the site of the sinking and holst 
said there was no hope of raising the sub from the bottom 
military officials in norway and washington said it appeared the 
boat caught fire underwater before breaking up and sinking 
the submarine nicknamed mike by the united states and nato 
carries a crew of 95 is powered by two nuclear generators and is 
reportedly equipped with torpedoes and longrange ballistic 
missiles western sources say 
the west german government radio also quoted holst as saying 
pilots of reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site 
us officials said there definitely were casualties aboard 
but declined to estimate how many 
the only thing we saw was an oil slick about three to four 
hundred meters long by 50 to 100 meters wide capt haavard holm 
the orion reconnaissance pilot said on norwegian radio after 
flying over the accident site 
he said there were three russian ships and one aircraft in the 
area including a trawler a freezer ship and what appeared to be 
an observation or intelligence vessel 
holst said he doubted the soviets had sent the cruiser to keep 
other ships away 
they want to have as much support as possible and want to 
transfer the survivors and the possible dead he said 
defense ministry officials said earlier that the reconnaissance 
plane had seen soviet planes and boats including rubber dinghies 
with people in at least one of them 
it was not clear whether the people were from the submarine or 
the surface vessels 
with the observations we have made with the soviet vessels and 
planes in the area it seems the soviets can handle this case 
alone holst said 
the area is well above the arctic circle but is usually 
icefree because of the gulf stream temperatures in the area were 
nearfreezing on friday 
the mike is one of the soviet unions modern submarines and 
the only one in operation according to janes fighting ships the 
british reference book 
if western descriptions of the submarine are accurate the 
reactors are wellprotected and have less radioactive material than 
in older submarines said johan baarli director of norways 
institute for radiation protection 
he said on national radio that any radioactive material probably 
would remain in the sub and not escape into the sea 
norwegian and swedish defense sources estimate the soviet union 
has about 110 nuclear submarines operating in northern waters from 
bases on the kola peninsula one of the worlds heaviest 
concentrations of naval power 
the mike might carry 16 missiles for surface targets 
although the figure is unconfirmed said swedish defense ministry 
spokesman thomas gur

the bush administration plans to construct a 
new federal penitentiary in the washington suburbs and a temporary 
jail in the city to help fight the district of columbias drug and 
violent crime problem 
the new york times and the washington post reported in their 
editions today that national drug control policy director william 
j bennett will announce his plans monday 
the reports citing unidentified sources said the plan will 
call for national guard troops to perform clerical jobs to free up 
police officers and an enhanced role for federal law enforcement 
agents in the citys antidrug efforts 
bennetts deputy chief of staff david tell said late friday 
that he could not comment on the reports 
bennett has targeted the nations capital where an epidemic 
drugrelated killings have earned the city the title of murder 
capital in his national campaign against drugs 
the post reported that the wideranging federal effort will 
include the use of forensic experts at the fbi to help reduce the 
mounting backlog of unsolved homicide cases and drug enforcement 
administration funds will be used to pay for police overtime 
in addition a dea local task force will be expanded with more 
than a dozen supervisory dea agents brought in to help local police 
officials manage major drug cases and five intelligence analysts 
from the defense department will be detailed to help track drug 
dealing 
there have been 132 homicides most of them drugrelated in the 
district this year compared with 87 at the same time in 1988 when 
the city had a record 372 murders 
among the plans outlined by the officials according to the 
newspapers were these 
a new prison would be built to relieve overcrowding at a 
6000inmate facility the districtoperated lorton reformatory 
prison complex in suburban virginia beginning in fiscal year 1991 
about 200 to 300 prisoners would be transferred temporarily 
from lorton to federal prisons around the country such transfers 
have occurred in the past because of the overcrowding 
a contingent from the us marshals service would be assigned 
to the city to make evictions in the estimated 200 to 300 crack 
houses that thrive here and to help the local police apprehend 
suspects on outstanding warrants 
the defense department will use intelligence officials to 
analyze international drug trafficking 
the dea has agreed to assign about 15 officials temporarily to 
washington to double an existing task force that coordinates 
efforts by regional police departments to pursue drug offenders 
an administration official familiar with the plan told the post 
that fort meade an army post near annapolis md which houses the 
national security agency and various military facilities is one 
of the options under study for the new federal penitentiary but 
that no final decision has been made

twenty years after they seized an 
administration building in protest of the establishment former 
student rebels gathered to show they may be older but they still 
havent sold out 
some of the more than 200 people who participated in the 
takeover arrived friday sporting vintage antiwar buttons and worn 
tshirts 
it was the end of writing letters to the editor and the 
beginning of being really active said holly cheever 39 a 
veterinarian and animal rights activist in voorheesville ny 
im really proud of our generation said ms cheever who 
said she came to see old friends and remind herself that she 
participated in a time that changed america 
the twoday reunion included a kickoff rally where new student 
activists joined the veterans in invoking antiwar sentiments as 
well as raising questions about us policy in central america and 
apartheid in south africa 
also planned were a teachin debates and a party 
the alumni were marking an event that began shortly after noon 
april 9 1969 when about 300 students seized university hall 
harvards main administration building they threw out nine deans 
and locked the doors with chains ignoring orders to leave 
as dawn broke the following day more than 400 state and local 
police stormed the building at the request of thenharvard 
president nathan pusey 
some students were pulled out by their hair about 45 people 
were hurt some after jumping from windows and 197 were arrested 
the brutality of the arrests and harvards willingness to use 
police galvanized students a threeday boycott of classes 
stretched into a 15day strike in which students virtually 
commandeered the school 
when the strike officially ended april 25 classes were over and 
many exams canceled 
school administrators had satisfied most of the protesters 
demands including abolishing the campus reserve officers training 
corps setting up a department of african and afroamerican studies 
and agreeing to build lowcost housing for people displaced by the 
schools expansion projects 
what happened in 1969 revealed to me how the world really 
worked and the government and harvard and business and the role 
of the police said paul robins 40 a computer software designer 
in san francisco 
over the years its helped me understand what i read in the 
newspapers and to question everything i hear robins said 
the university has made its facilities available for the reunion 
but is not taking part officially and has no comment on the 
gathering 
pusey was not attending the reunion 
pusey 82 and living in new york city said there was no 
way he would participate in the reunion 
it was just a lot of screaming said pusey who ran harvard 
from 1953 to 1971 i was disappointed that any students or any 
faculty at harvard accepted the notion that somehow harvard was the 
source of evil and should be attacked 
pusey who says reports of violence were untrue blamed the 
events on a small group of student agitators 
i honestly did not think the students and faculty at harvard 
would be taken in by these ridiculous things being said he said

sullivan what happened next 
north immediately thereafter mr mcfarlane returned to the 
united states in late november early december and very shortly 
thereafter submitted his resignation from the nsc we were being 
pressed by the israelis i was personally as to where we were 
going from here and so mr mcfarlane agreed to go to a meeting 
with the israeli agents and the iranian in london i flew over to 
the meeting met general secord there he had established that it 
was a safe meeting we sat down and talked with mr mcfarlane and 
the israelis and their agent who was an iranian and we came back 
to the united states 
north describes three separate presidential intelligence 
findings that were signed in connection with the hawk missile 
shipments to iran 
sullivan now did each of these findings state that there 
should be no immediate reporting to congress 
north all of them said that congress shall not be notified at 
this time and that the president had the authority to withhold that 
notification until he deemed it was appropriate 
sullivan during the time that you had operational control over 
it was it considered to be among the most secret of government 
activity that was being undertaken in 1986 
north absolutely 
sullivan asks north in detail about terrorists threats leveled 
against him and a decision by north to accept installation of a 
security system at his home the system was provided by richard 
secord a former air force major general who had been enlisted by 
north to run arms to the contras 
sullivan did you pay for the security system 
north no i did not 
sullivan did you receive a security system for or because of 
any official act that you had performed or that you were going to 
perform in the future 
north no 
sullivan did you receive it as any form of compensation because 
you were a government official at the national security council 
north no 
sullivan did you intend to violate any law by receiving the 
security system without paying for it 
north no i intended to pay for it 
sullivan but did you ever pay for it 
north no i did not 
sullivan colonel north would you tell the jury briefly 
please why you and mcfarlane went to iran on a secret trip in may 
1986 
north the purpose of the trip was to carry out the express 
intention of the president that we open a dialogue with iran about 
the iraniraq war stop iranian terrorism and get the american 
hostages home 
sullivan colonel was there hope that on this particular trip 
that all the hostages would come back with you after the 
negotiations and after the united states provided certain parts for 
missiles 
north not so much come back with us but there was great hope 
because of what the israeli agent or intermediary had told us 
were the conditions that the iranians had that as a consequence of 
going on this trip we would have the hostages released that were 
bing held in beirut lebanon not in iran that we would get 
william buckley or his body we werent too sure which at that 
point although we had fairly good intelligence that he was dead 
and that we would get a 400page interrogation of buckley that 
they had done 
sullivan did you leave without accomplishing your objectives on 
that trip 
north yes we did 
sullivan now colonel i would like to focus your attention on 
the last couple of months of your service at the national security 
council in early october one of the planes flying resupply 
missions to the nicaraguan freedom fighters was shot down 
correct 
north yes sir it was 
sullivan and did you have a plan how to deal with it 
north yes we did and the press guidance was basically the same 
as what president eisenhower had done with francis gary powers when 
he was shot down over russia that was to deny it 
when the airplane was shot down over nicaragua i was in europe 
working with what we began to call the second channel on the 
iranian initiative and the initial exposure on the shootdown was 
that we would deny it when i got back from europe cia 
director william casey asked me to come out to the cia he 
asked me pointedly he said are we going to be clean on this 
we being the cia and i said yes i dont think that theres 
going to be any way for anybody to take the wreckage or the people 
the survivor and make any connection back to the central 
intelligence agency 
the cia had because the rules had changed the law had changed 
the cia had been providing weather data and drop zone data 
intelligence data but they didnt have any cia employees on the 
airplane they didnt have any cia mechanics working on it no cia 
purchased equipment was on it because we were still living within 
those constraints of the boland amendment and he wanted my 
assurance because he knew that i was basically the operations 
officer for this activity that there was nothing that was going to 
trace back to the cia and i assured him incorrectly that no 
everything would be fine 
and it turned out that there was data aboard the airplane that 
the information that mr hasenfus gave his captors traced back to 
where they had launched from the house that they were living in 
documents that were able to trace it back to the fact that they had 
gotten information from the cia 
sullivan colonel did you also learn that casey had received 
information that perhaps the iranian initiative would be exposed 
because certain creditors of the operation had not received their 
money 
north at that same luncheon director casey also told me that an 
old friend of his a source i think he told me of many years back 
had revealed to him that certain of the people who had been funding 
the purchases of us equipment for the iranian arms deal were 
upset by the fact that they had not been paid and that it was 
about to be revealed that there was a secret arms deal going with 
iran and that monies from the iran initiative were going to help 
the contras 
directory casey knew all that but his concern was that we do 
whatever we could to keep this from coming out

portauprince haiti ap loyalist troops at the national 
palace shelled an adjoining army barracks friday and apparently 
routed mutineers demanding the ouster of haitian leader lt gen 
prosper avril 
western diplomats said the presidential guard attacked 
dessalines barracks where the rebel soldiers were dug in there 
were unconfirmed reports the elite leopards unit also in rebellion 
against avril had abandoned their base in the suburbs without a 
fight when they realized all was lost 
a government source close to avril in power for six stormy 
months said early saturday that the government is in control of 
the situation 
us embassy spokesman susan clyde also said she thought the 
battle was over 
we stand by our statement of the past few days we support 
president avril so that he can return to his work for the 
establishment of democracy clyde said 
there were unconfirmed reports of casualties among soldiers and 
civilians one report said shells overshot their mark and hit 
nearby houses 
but officials at the state hospital across a blocked street from 
the barracks said they had no casualties from the fighting and no 
casualties were reported at the military hospital a nearby private 
hospital that caters to wealthy haitians or by the red cross 
diplomats said a ceasefire had been declared after three hours 
fighting although sporadic gunfire continued elsewhere 
a man listening on a citizensband radio heard soldiers saying 
the barracks had been overrun by loyalist troops and that the 
rebels were disarmed and forced to lie on the floor facedown with 
their hands over their heads 
the white neoclassical palace and the mustardcolored barracks 
adjoin one other and are surrounded by the same wall 
the action began at 740 pm and reporters watched from a 
secondfloor terrace of the holiday inn as at least one armored car 
of the 1000member presidential guard rumbled across the plaza in 
front of the palace and fired its cannon guardsmen took positions 
in the plaza 
it appeared five armored cars surrounded the barracks and 
within 20 minutes more than a dozen cannon shots accompanied by 
steady machine gun fire could be heard 
civilians fled the area some rushing the doors of the hotel 
reporters dived for cover as explosions reverberated through the 
building and tracer bullets zipped overhead 
staterun radio played romantic french songs during the fighting 
it was impossible to determine the extent of support within the 
7000man army for the rebellion centered on the 700man dessalines 
battalion the militarys secondbiggest unit and the 400man 
leopards unit 
the rebels earlier friday seized control of a radio station and 
youths supporting them built barricades of burning tires along a 
main street

support for avrils government which foiled a coup attempt sunday 
but has been stymied by the mutiny

motorbikes shooting in the air and warning people to go home 
witnesses said youths set fire to tires along the fivemile route 
of delmas avenue a main artery in the capital

on thursday night loyal troops fired on rebels who commandeered 
a government vehicle witnesses said four rebels were killed but a

ground

presidential guard in pay and living conditions and of arbitrarily 
dismissing senior officers in a usbacked crackdown on drugs and 
corruption

sullivan what was the danger in revealing the iranian 
initiative in terms of the second channel and the hostages 
north well the danger that we all saw was that youd end up 
with the political fire storm we ended up with i mean that 
actually happened that youd end up with exposure of the kind that 
even though officials within the iranian government knew what was 
going on and officials within our government knew what was going 
on that neither the iranian public nor the american public were 
going to be particularly happy with this and that the people 
in lebanon who held the hostages would be so outraged by this 
involvement 
sullivan was there a time when it was thought that there would 
be a cover story that would have to be used in order to protect the 
iranian initiative 
north there was a cover story there had been a cover story 
sullivan describe what you mean 
north there had been a cover story since february of 1986 when 
we started to get the hawk missiles back out of iran we told the 
iranians because they were so upset with that israeli shipment that 
we had nothing to do with it 
north describes a number of chronologies that were being 
developed by the cia poindexter and mcfarlane in connection with 
the iranian initiatives 
sullivan what was your understanding of what the president was 
saying publicly about these matters 
north well the president had publicly said that they didnt 
happen either which was initially part of the cover story 
sullivan what conclusion did you draw from that 
north i had no idea what was in the minds of other people 
but it was very clear to me that the president himself out publicly 
on a number of occasions and people were digging a pretty deep 
hole without me helping them in advancing the cover story

few visible scars remain from 
terrible tuesday the day 10 years ago when a tornado tore an 
eightmile path of destruction but residents will never forget the 
deadly twister 
the april 10 1979 tornado killed 46 people injured 1700 and 
left 20000 homeless it demolished more than 2566 houses 1100 
apartments 81 businesses several schools and churches and left 
the city without water and in some parts of town electricity 
the tornado which stayed on the ground 47 minutes caused an 
estimated 300 million in damages 
the asbestossided homes destroyed by the storm have been 
replaced with sturdier brickfront dwellings just one sign of the 
citys recovery 
but ask anyone who lived here then it was terrifying 
this reminds me every day of that cyclone said 80yearold 
oscar groves pulling up his left pant leg to display a swollen 
knee 
groves has scars like hash marks across his bald head reminders 
of the flying glass and wood that hit him as he tried to escape the 
storms fury 
he remembers lying on top of his terrified wife in his bathroom 
while the twister screamed overhead 
that thing just bounced me up and down groves said his 
knee has been sore ever since 
the twister turned their house in the faith village subdivision 
into debris groves and his wife merle had lived in the home 
since 1953 
all that was left standing of this house was the bathtub the 
hot water heater and the commode groves said 
we just had blocks and blocks of total devastation said 
wichita falls city spokeswoman norma crane we figured it would 
take about 10 years to get it all back 
in fact 80 percent of the lost buildings were replaced within a 
year today virtually every structure that was destroyed has been 
rebuilt in this town of 98900 which is about 140 miles northwest 
of dallas near the oklahoma border 
that part of the city has grown tremendously since the 
tornado ms crane said 
many of the homes schools churches and businesses were rebuilt 
with assistance from the federal government and a 14 million bond 
issue that effort won wichita falls the allamerica city 
designation in 1980 
theres been a lot of good come out of the tornado said 
merle pedigo a retired air force chaplain who helped organize 
rebuilding efforts lots of peoples homes were rebuilt 
churches helped many residents like the groves 
six months after the tragedy a group of mennonites from as far 
away as canada started rebuilding the groves home groves supplied 
the materials and used a 12000 loan from the small business 
association to replace appliances furniture and other items lost 
in the storm 
their threebedroom house now has a redbrick facade instead of 
its old asbestos siding 
we had to get everything new but this house is built strong 
now he said 
others on his devastated street began rebuilding as well 
including ben milam elementary where a stormtossed volkswagen 
remained embedded in a classroom wall for weeks after the tornado 
behind the new bricks and mortar of wichita falls residents 
keep various mementos of the storm 
for the groves one reminder comes once a month in the mail the 
payment notice for their sba rebuilding loan on which they still 
owe more than 5000 
and in his garage groves still stores his old refrigerator 
which he found in the school yard across the street after the 
twister passed and a 1965 gmc pickup dented during the storm 
i keep them as souvenirs he said

crews tackling the worst oil spill in us 
history got good news from washington on whos in charge of the 
cleanup and bad news from a weather forecast that could put 
untainted shoreline in jeopardy 
only 7 percent of the 101 million gallons of oil has been 
retrieved 
president bush announced friday he was sending military troops 
to help clean up the oil that leaked from tanker exxon valdez on 
march 24 
bush said the coast guard was taking control of the operation 
ending days of bickering and weeks of frustration over the oil 
companys efforts 
i think we had a problem with organization thats what 
frustrated everybody said rear adm edward nelson jr the 
commander of the coast guards alaskan district who now heads the 
cleanup operation we now see a clean line of whats going to go 
on 
under the new plan reached by compromise at the request of 
alaskan officials the coast guard will have final responsibility 
for running the cleanup effort exxon will continue to provide the 
materials and manpower and will not be relieved of liability 
well be directing the strategic application of forces 
exxon retains the role of support said nelson 
the change in command came as weather forecasters warned of a 
change in the winds that have pushed nearly half the oil south and 
out of the environmentally sensitive prince william sound in the 
two weeks since the tanker ran aground on bligh reef 
the shift in direction threatens to push oil slicks which have 
already traveled over a 3000squaremile area in the gulf of 
alaska toward kodiak island and the fragile bays and inlets of the 
kenai peninsula 
so far only an estimated 16000 barrels of oil have been sopped 
and vacuumed up from the onceclear water of prince william sound 
the spill has killed thousands of birds and sea otters along the 
central alaskan coast cost fishermen millions of dollars in lost 
catch and continues to threaten valuable salmon fisheries 
a shift in the wind could easily double the area affected 
said jim hayden coordinator of the states cleanup effort 
a large oil slick continued to threaten the edges of kenai 
fjords national park a remote refuge 100 miles southwest of 
valdez as workers set up floating oil booms to protected against 
the expected onslaught 
were preparing for the worse case said john quinley a 
spokesman for the national park service even if this doesnt 
foul the beaches this stuff could be there for a long time 
bush said at a news conference in washington that he was 
directing defense secretary dick cheney to make military forces and 
equipment available he also directed transportation secretary 
samuel skinner to coordinate the effort 
bush had been under pressure from members of congress and 
alaskan officials to intervene alaska gov steve cowper on 
wednesday asked the coast guard to take over management of the 
cleanup from exxon 
the president insisted however we are not federalizing this 
operation and that this should not relieve exxon from any of 
its responsibilities or liabilities 
state officials said they were pleased with bushs decision but 
worried that the use of military troops in the cleaup might disrupt 
the effort and deny jobs to state residents 
but nelson said he didnt anticipate the wholesale use of troops 
we have a plan and we want to proceed rather cautiously he

a nuclearpowered soviet submarine sank more 
than 300 miles off the coast of norway after suffering an 
underwater accident and catching fire us and norwegian officials 
said friday 
us officials said there were definitely casualties on 
board the stricken submarine but declined to estimate how many 
the soviet embassy in oslo confirmed the sinking but provided no 
details according to a norwegian radio report on saturday there 
was no other word on the accident out of the government in moscow 
or from the official tass news agency 
abc news reported friday night that pentagon sources said as 
many as a dozen were killed in the fire while others were rescued 
by sister soviet ships that rushed to the scene the submarine is 
believed to carry a crew of 95 according to the authoritative 
reference book janes fighting ships 
officials told the associated press that the submarine managed 
to surface for a time in the norwegian sea after the accident 
occurred and that at least one soviet ship had responded to a 
distress call and arrived on scene 
it was on the surface but now it appears its gone said 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity were trying to 
get confirmation but we believe it sunk 
norwegian defense minister johan joergen holst was quoted on the 
west german government radio as saying that pilots of 
reconnaissance planes reported seeing bodies at the site in 
addition the radio reported that holst believes the submarine 
broke in two as it sank and that the soviets turned down norwegian 
offers of help 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the accident 
appeared to involve a soviet mike submarine one of the 
russian navys newer attack subs designed to hunt and destroy other 
submarines in the event of war 
there are indications there was a major fire aboard but we 
have no details we understand there has been a loss of life but we 
cant confirm how many fitzwater said we express the sympathy 
of the united states government to the soviet government for any 
loss of life involved 
president bush had been notified of the accident fitzwater said 
one us source placed the last known position of the vessel 
about 310 miles to the north of norways north cape 
another us official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said it was not known what caused the problem precisely when the 
accident occurred or whether the nuclear propulsion section of the 
craft was involved 
a nuclear specialist at a washington thinktank called the 
technology used in the mike sub inherently very dangerous and 
said that if the reactor had been involved it could be quite 
catastrophic 
in oslo a norwegian army supreme command spokesman said the sub 
apparently was lost in the area between norway and greenland col 
gollow gjeseth press spokesman of norways supreme defense 
command said in a telephone interview that a norwegian observation 
plane sent over the area about 11 edt saw a soviet ship and two 
rubber boats 
ntb the national news agency said the plane saw several soviet 
planes and vessels in the area apparently part of a soviet rescue 
operation in the area which is in international waters 
the agency said people had been sighted in at least one of the 
rubber boats but it was not clear if the boats were from the 
submarine or from one of the surface vessels 
the biggest surface ship in the area was a soviet refrigerator 
trawler the ntb report said 
us sources offered no indication as to what the submarine 
might have been doing at the time of the accident they said the 
us navy had no warships in the area and had not received any 
request from the soviet union for assistance the sources declined 
to say when or how the united states first became aware of the 
submarines problems 
but abc news reported that pentagon sources said us 
intelligence learned of the accident through electronic intercepts 
of communications from the stricken submarine 
according to janes fighting ships the soviets have so far 
launched only one ship in the mike class 
that vessel was launched in may 1983 and went into service in 
late 1984 according to janes the pentagon reference book 
soviet military power says the mike vessel wasnt declared 
operational until 1986 
the proper russian name for the submarine was not immediately 
available the name mike is a us and nato nickname for the 
sub 
janes describes the mike submarines two nuclear reactors as 
probably liquid metal cooled an approach that allows for a 
saving in space as well as an increase in power 
the sources stressed however it was unclear whether the 
nuclear propulsion section of the russian sub had been the source 
of the accident or involved in any fires 
the mike submarine is described as being about 361 feet long and 
capable of steaming at 38 knots when submerged the sub displaces 
about 6400 tons when submerged 
janes and other pentagon reference books describe the mike as a 
submarine that seems to be a test vehicle for new design and 
propulsion features 
administration sources said us intelligence agencies have long 
assumed the mike sub was built to serve as a test platform for 
new types of submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
the accident with the mike comes 2 years after a soviet 
yankeeclass missile submarine sank off the coast of north 
carolina after an explosion and fire that fire was believed to 
have involved the liquid fuel propellant inside a nuclear missile 
that incident was just the latest in a string of accidents over 
the years involving soviet submarines and nuclearpowered vessels 
according to william arkin a specialist on nuclear weaponry 
with the liberal think tank institute for policy studies the 
soviet navy has suffered more than 200 serious accidents with 
submarines just since 1975 
us defense department officials have long asserted the russian 
navy does not attach as much importance to the safety of their 
nuclear operations as do western navies 
while stressing he had no idea whether the mike submarines 
nuclear reactor had been involved in the accident arkin said that 
particular technology was inherently very dangerous 
this sub carries two liquid metal cooled reactors you are 
literally using molten metal probably sodium arkin said 
it is a more efficient means of propulsion than using steam 
water but it is very dangerous and very difficult to operate we 
tried it once and gave up because we considered it too volatile so 
if it was a reactor incident it could be quite catastrophic

exxon corp and the operator of the 
transalaska oilpipeline terminal could face fines exceeding 700 
million as a result of the nations worst oil spill a review of 
state and federal law indicates 
state attorneys have been monitoring the spill cleanup in prince 
william sound and collecting evidence of damages since the tanker 
exxon valdez ran aground march 24 said doug mertz an assistant 
state attorney general 
more than 10 million gallons of crude oil leaked from the 
tanker killing fish marine mammals birds and other wildlife over 
a 3000squaremile area and affecting the livelihoods of 
fishermen and others who live in the region 
exxon corp and alyeska pipeline service co are the two 
companies that likely will bear the brunt of the state and federal 
governments legal attack 
theyre certainly the principal players mertz said friday 
exxon owns the tanker through a corporate division and also 
owns the oil alyeska a consortium of seven oil companies owns 
and operates the pipeline terminal where the tanker took on its 
load of oil 
both companies were responsible for the initial spill response 
which has been attacked by government officials and 
environmentalists as slow and ineffective 
alaskas legal ammunition includes several laws that provide for 
hefty fines against companies responsible for polluting the 
environment 
for large spills the state can assess a 1 to 10pergallon 
civil fine regardless of fault it is automatically multiplied by 
five in cases of gross negligence or when spill damages 
increase because of poor cleanup response mertz said 
a complex formula determines the fine based on how damaging the 
spill is to the environment mertz said the maximum civil fine for 
spills in a marine environment such as prince william sound is 
250 a gallon the 10agallon fine applies only to serious 
damage in freshwater fishbearing streams 
however it is possible the top fine could apply to the exxon 
valdez spill the state would have to prove the oil had damaged any 
of the dozens of freshwater streams that feed the sound mertz said 
if the maximum fine and the automatic multiplier were 
applied the oil companies could be assessed more than 500 
million the fine would be spread among the liable parties mertz 
said 
the state also can seek compensation for damages to natural 
resources including those damages that cannot be measured and for 
the states costs of containment and cleanup he said 
another state law allows for a civil fine of up to 100000 and 
the state can seek additional damages under federal environmental 
laws it also is possible the state will seek to recover lost 
oilroyalty income mertz said 
mertz declined to speculate how high the state fines could 
total noting the issue could be appealed in court 
i would not even come close to hazarding a guess he said 
the totality of natural resource damages is so difficult to 
compute it can be done but it requires a lot of expertise and 
takes a lot of time 
mertz estimated it could take six to 12 years to resolve the 
liability issues and fines in court 
spills of this magnitude take years and years to get to trial 
its just impossible to predict what way it will go he said 
ann prezyna an attorney with the us environmental protection 
agency in seattle said most federal fines would arise from 
violations of the clean water act

an armed man who hijacked a new yorkbound 
greyhound bus and held its driver and 10 passengers hostage was 
demanding reduced syrian involvement in lebanon police say 
the hijacking ended peacefully on parliament hill and without 
injuries when the last five hostages were freed friday evening 
eight hours after the ordeal started in montreal 
before surrendering the hijacker who claimed to be holding 
dynamite held police at bay for five hours after the bus veered 
onto the muddy lawn at the center of canadian government 
charles yacoub 36 of montreal was identified as the man who 
took over the bus as it left that city police said he was 
demanding action on behalf of the front for the liberation of 
christian lebanon a group that authorities arent even sure exists 
private ctv television quoted security sources as saying the 
gunman was demanding that syrian troops withdraw from lebanon and 
free all the prisoners they hold syria sent troops into lebanon as 
a peacekeeping force after the civil war between lebanese moslems 
and christians erupted in 1975 
gilles favreau assistant commissioner of the royal canadian 
mounted police did not say what charges would be filed against 
yacoub 
he also could not explain why the police did not know the bus 
was heading for parliament until its arrival which raised 
questions about security in the area 
youve got to realize that this bus was going to new york 
favreau said at a news conference 
henry jensen deputy commissioner of the mounties said yacoub 
emigrated to canada from lebanon in 1976 
the hijacker released the first hostage an elderly man at the 
champlain bridge just outside of montreal before heading on to 
ottawa 100 miles to the west 
three female hostages and one man were released gradually at 
ottawa and the male driver left the vehicle just before the 
hijacking came to an end police briefly checked the final five 
hostages before concluding they were not involved with the hijacker 
the hijacker had claimed to have explosives but none were found 
witnesses said they heard at least three shots and they 
believed all were fired by the hijacker as police rushed to the 
site where the bus was stuck on the lawn in front of the house of 
commons 
the red white and blue bus sat the extensive lawn of parliament 
hill surrounded by police hiding behind their vehicles or nearby 
walls a police van stopped behind the bus at midafternoon and 
officers jumped out and crouched behind the vans doors 
traffic was blocked off and and people cleared from the area 
including pedestrians at the front of the us embassy across the 
street from the house of commons stopped 
forty embassy employees took a difficult route out of the 
building dismantling a window in the building next door and 
crawling out 
prime minister brian mulroney has offices in the house of 
commons but was attending a private event and was not in the 
building his aides reported 
oscar arias the president of costa rica was speaking at a news 
conference a short distance from parliament hill as the crisis 
developed 
unaware of the hijacking arias told reporters political 
violence in canada in the worst of times has been limited to the 
madness of a few

zoologists at the university of 
malaya said today they have found a frog that grows out of an egg 
instead of going through the tadpole stage in water 
zoology professor yong hoi sen said he and a team of colleagues 
discovered a tree frog philautus aurifasciatus which can breed on 
land without water while on a jungle expedition last february in 
the genting highlands area about 20 miles east of kuala lumpur 
he said the eggs were found on a pitcher plant and were the 
first time such a frog had been found in malaysia 
most frogs lay eggs in water that become tadpoles which mature 
into frogs and leave the water yong said the tree frog the 
zoologists discovered lays its eggs on land and that the eggs hatch 
frogs 
he said news of the discovery was withheld to carry out breeding 
and tests 
the frog is one of 17 species found on malaysian trees there 
are 70 species of frogs in malaysia 
the philautus aurifasciatus also has been found in south america 
and australia and are known to exist in thailand cambodia 
indonesia and the philippines yong said

the soviet mikeclass submarine that caught 
fire and sank after an underwater accident off the coast of norway 
is one of the most modern nucleararmed and powered boats in the 
soviet fleet capable of hurling advanced warheads up to 1600 
miles western experts say 
the soviets have only one of the 361footlong titaniumhulled 
mikeclass submarines in service according to janes fighting 
ships it entered service in 1984 
it is used primarily to test various advanced weapons systems 
is believed to be powered by two liquidcooled nuclear reactors 
and has a double hull designed to reduce noise and make it harder 
to detect according to janes

a man with aids arrived from the 
netherlands after six days in a minnesota prison and a battle with 
immigration officials who refused to let him attend a us 
conference on the disease because of his illness 
hans paul verhoef who was required by an immigration judge to 
post a 10000 bond was given a bouquet of flowers by 
representatives of the national lesbian and gay health conference 
upon his arrival friday night 
verhoef who was detained by the immigration and naturalization 
service on sunday at the minneapolisst paul international 
airport declined to answer questions saying he was very tired 
a news conference with the 31yearold aids worker was planned 
today 
were very happy to have him finally here in san francisco 
said scott schafer an aide to the mayor 
a dozen or so supporters greeted verhoef at the airport 
i came because i think its taken tremendous courage to take 
on the great big united states of america when youre just a 
foreign visitor trying to help the world fight a terrible 
disease said jennifer maher 
verhoef flew into san francisco just hours after a judge 
overrode immigration officials and ordered him freed from the oak 
park heights state prison so he could attend the conference 
immigration judge robert vinikoor ruled friday that verhoef had 
met standards allowing him to be excluded from laws barring 
foreigners with dangerous and communicable diseases from entering 
the country 
vinikoors decision overrode ins officials in washington who 
denied verhoefs request for a waiver to attend the aids conference 
the ins then asked the federal board of immigration appeals in 
falls church va to stay the judges order but friday night the 
board refused to consider the request 
vinikoor ordered verhoef to post a 10000 bond to enforce the 
terms of the waiver effective until april 28 the money was 
provided by minnesota aids project said helene haapala one of 
verhoefs lawyers 
im very disappointed being imprisoned and getting this

a new medical study says a lowfat diet may not be 
healthy for everyone and that a 12year survey shows low 
cholesterol levels coincide with an increased risk of cancer in 
some men 
the researchers reported in the weekly british medical journal 
published friday that their results also show people with high 
cholesterol have a greater chance of getting heart disease that 
finding has been confirmed by other scientific teams and gained 
widespread public acceptance 
however the latest team of researchers said their results also 
show that low cholesterol levels sometimes coincide with a greater 
risk from cancer although this link was only significant for men 
they said they could not explain why these people are more at 
risk from cancer they said the lower cholesterol itself could be 
the culprit but that something else may be the cause instead 
the study is not the first to find a link between lower 
cholesterol and higher cancer risk some researchers have suggested 
lower cholesterol levels are in fact the product of undiagnosed 
bowel cancers because developing tumors trap cholesterol and 
remove it from blood 
while the issue remains unsettled many other scientists doubt 
high cholesterol levels help prevent cancer 
the report said the survey was conducted among 15262 people 
7000 men and 8262 women aged 45 to 64 in industrial southwestern 
scotland 
the scientists said they found the most convincing link for lung 
cancer the inverse association between cholesterol concentration 
and cancer in men was strongest for lung cancer 
the research team was comprised victor m hawthorne of the 
university of michigan in ann arbor christopher g isles and 
anthony f lever both of the blood pressure unit at the western 
infirmary at glasgow in southwest scotland and charles r gillis 
and david j hole both of the cancer surveillance unit at 
glasgows ruchill hospital 
the team said more research is needed in the area 
but it added we conclude that it may be a mistake to assume 
that dietary advice given to the general population to reduce the 
intake of saturated fat will necessarily reduce overall mortality 
lowfat diets help reduce cholesterol the team said such diets 
are probably a good idea for people with high cholesterol levels 
their advice however was contradicted by michael oconnor 
director of the londonbased coronary prevention group 
oconnor told the british domestic news agency press association 
in an interview i do not believe this single research study 
provides a proper basis on which to change wellestablished medical 
advice to eat less saturated fat 
he said a 1300page study by the us national academy of 
sciences released last month showed there is no relationship 
between low cholesterol and cancer 
our advice would be that people should eat less saturated fat 
if they want to live longer 
boston university microbiologist selwyn broitman told the 
american cancer societys science writers seminar in irvine 
calif on tuesday that he has found bowel cancer can lower 
cholesterol in rats 
a longterm study of residents of framingham mass revealed 
some people have low levels of cholesterol and an aboveaverage 
risk of colon cancer said john laszlo the american cancer 
societys senior vice president for research 
but he said studies of entire populations in several nations 
show that people who eat highfat highcholesterol diets tend to 
have a higher incidence of both heart disease and colon cancer

travelers aid bureau and said the basque separatist organization 
known by its basque initials eta had placed several bombs on the 
rail line that were to explode within a few hours the civil 
governors office said 
the bombings represent the first attacks linked to eta since 
jan 8 when the group called a halt to attacks in exchange for 
peace talks with the government the group wants independence for 
the threeprovince northern basque region but the government says 
it will only talk when eta ceases fighting

prolonged halt on antigovernment attacks 
also today police were investigating a mail bomb that exploded 
friday in an apartment in the northern basque town of irun

the american museum of natural history has 
refused to give a more than 150yearold relic to a cree indian who 
ran 2700 miles in his quest to retrieve the sacred object for his 
people 
museum spokesman herbert kurz said friday that the museum sent a 
letter to jim thunders home in edmonton canada notifying him of 
the museums decision

chief big bear the cree leader who created the artifact a sacred 
calicowrapped bundle holding bear claws sweet grass and a plug of 
tobacco it was meant to give his people spiritual strength and 
guidance

visions to retrieve the bundle and take it to his tribe in western 
canada where it would be used in prayers and sacred indian 
ceremonies

south africa angola and cuba gathered 
for emergency talks today in a bid to halt the fighting 
jeopardizing namibias independence plan which one official 
described as all but suspended 
officials from the three nations along with us and soviet 
observers planned daylong talks at an undisclosed site north of 
windhoek 
battles between the south africanled security forces and black 
nationalist guerrillas occurred for an eighth straight day today 
police said 
at least 262 guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples 
organization and 28 members of the security forces have been killed 
in the heaviest fighting of the territorys 23year war police 
said 
swapo officials outside namibia have disputed the figures and 
say many civilians also have been killed 
south africa called on the guerrillas to surrender by midday 
today or face intensified securityforce action but there was no 
indication whatsoever that swapo planned to lay down arms as the 
deadline passed police chief inspector derek brune said 
the south africaninstalled administrator of the territory 
louis pienaar said friday there was a de facto suspension of 
the un independence plan because of the widespread fighting near 
namibias northern border with angola he said elections planned 
for november could be affected by the conflict 
pik botha south africas foreign minister said he had informed 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar about a south 
african decision to activate an unspecified number of additional 
soldiers a major reason for the move botha said was that some 
guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples organization were 
approaching areas where white farmers lived 
the united nations has allowed south africa to move a limited 
number of army troops from their bases to support antiguerrilla 
police units but botha said friday that the security forces at 
the present level are not able to stem the incursion 
botha emphasized that south africa remained committed to 
implementing independence in namibia and that the un plan had not 
been formally suspended the un security council said friday it 
was satisfied that south africa still sought to grant independence 
to the territory it has ruled since world war i 
after six months of an informal ceasefire the fighting began 
april 1 the day the un independence plan and a formal ceasefire 
took effect 
south africa claims swapo has sent more than 1900 guerrillas 
into northern namibia since april 1 in violation of an accord 
requiring the insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles away 
in angola 
col herman du plessis a territorial army officer said an 
additional 1300 guerrillas were in southern angola near the 
namibian border and were an immediate threat swapo leaders 
contend most of the guerrillas had been in namibia for some time 
and have no intention of leaving for angola 
some un officials have suggested that swapo field commanders 
mistakenly thought their units could return unmolested to namibia 
as of april 1 and set up bases several captured guerrillas have 
said they returned to namibia in search of un personnel and 
expected no confrontations with the security forces 
the un has authorized 4650 troops for namibia but less than 
1000 have arrived of that total the only forces in the northern 
battle areas as of saturday were about 300 logistical personnel 
swapo has been favored to win the most votes in preindependence 
elections planned for november under the un plan 
the way for namibian independence was cleared in december when 
south africa angola and cuba signed an accord calling for 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops who have helped marxist angola 
battle usbacked rebels

solidarity leader lech walesa called on 
top union leaders and opposition intellectuals today to help map 
out a winning strategy for the parliamentary election 
more than 100 members of the citizens committee created in 
december by walesa to serve as a policy council to solidarity 
squeezed around tables laden with sandwiches and cakes in a musty 
church basement 
thanking you for our common great political and public 
victory let me ask you to make use of this victory so we can 
choose together some way of putting freedom into practice so there 
will be real effects walesa said 
the sejm or parliament passed bills friday that enacted 
economic and political agreements approved by walesa and the 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak after two months of talks 
between authorities and the opposition 
the laws allow restoration of solidarity which was banned after 
the december 1981 martial law crackdown give poland its first free 
elections since world war ii and create the post of presidency 
the new parliament will consist of two chambers a newly created 
100member senate and a 460 member sejm elections to the senate 
will be freely contested while the communist party and its allies 
will be assured 65 percent of the sejm with 35 percent reserved for 
independent nonparty candidates 
we should try to win in the elections to the sejm and the 
senate win on the social side because it would be very bad if we 
retreated from the field and were unable to cultivate those limited 
possibilities walesa said 
he said the citizens committee should be formalized so that it 
could ask future opposition legislators to speak on behalf of 
solidarity 
the meeting was also expected to consider potential opposition 
candidates for the elections scheduled for june in the past 
solidarity urged election boycotts to express disapproval of 
authorities policies 
the boycott appeals and public dissatisfication led to 
increasingly low voter turnouts and finally to the devastating 
rejection of a government referendum on economic reform in november 
1987 
the opposition agreed to participate in elections during the 
roundtable talks in exchange for the restoration of solidaritys 
legal status 
while the opposition will field candidates for parliament it 
has expressed reluctance to enter the government where the polish 
united workers communist party and its allies still would have a 
majority of ministers 
authorities first proposed talks with the opposition on 
political and economic reform during the second nationwide wave of 
strikes in august 
walesa refused talks until authorities agreed to accept a legal 
solidarity the goahead came when the communist party approved 
gen wojciech jaruzelskis recommendation to restore solidarity at 
a party plenum in january

said 
under house rules the formal filing of such a complaint by

the ethics committee known formally as the house committee on 
standards of official conduct is nearing the conclusion of its 
investigation of wright and is expected to decide as early as next

promotional deal for gingrichs 1984 book window of 
opportunity 
the deal involved 21 investors who put 5000 each into a

investment the partners were promised half the publishers 
profits but the publisher ended up losing money on the book and

a nuclearpowered soviet submarine caught 
fire and sank in international waters off northern norway and 
norwegian officials said today that at least 12 crew members were 
killed 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev sent messages to the prime 
ministers of norway and britain saying that an undetermined number 
of sailors died in the accident friday and that the nuclear 
reactors on the submarine had been shut down before the vessel 
sank officials and news reports said 
according to the opinion of experts the possibility of a 
nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is 
excluded gorbachevs message to norways premier said according 
to the ntb news agency 
officials in washington said it was probably a mike class 
submarine one of the most modern in the soviet fleet and capable 
of carrying 95 sailors 
they said the sub which was designed to hunt and destroy other 
submarines in the event of war is powered by two nuclear 
generators and can carry torpedoes and longrange ballistic 
missiles 
vadime rosanov the soviet press attache in oslo told norwegian 
television the sub was carrying torpedoes not ballistic missiles 
however he declined to say whether the vessel was equipped with 
nuclear weapons 
us and norwegian military sources who reported the accident 
before soviet officials did said the fire apparently broke out 
while the vessel was underwater and that it surfaced before sinking 
the official soviet news agency tass which reported the sinking 
19 hours after it occurred said the crew is being rescued by 
soviet vessels in the area there has been loss of life 
tass which did not identify the submarine said only that a 
fire broke out on board a soviet nuclearpowered torpedo 
submarine friday at 1141 am 341 am edt and it sank at 
515 pm 915 am edt 
specialists ruled out the possibility of a radioactive 
contamination of the environment tass said 
the soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov was quoted by tass 
as saying the crew fought the fire for several hours before 
abandoning ship he said a soviet warship was taking survivers to 
the arctic port of murmansk 
pictures taken friday by norwegian reconnaissance aircraft 
showed about 13 soviet sailors clinging in the sea to a life raft 
thrown to them from the norwegian aircraft norwegian officials 
said the sub sank 120 miles south of norways bear island and 320 
miles off the northern coast of norway 
the minimum number of casualties would be 12 its difficult 
to say and we dont know many were picked up said lt cmdr per 
andre ragdem spokesman for norways northern military command 
he said the soviets had declined offers of help from norway 
gorbachev confirmed in a message to prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland that sailors died in the accident but he didnt say how 
many ntb reported 
gorbachev who ended a 40hour visit to england on friday 
assured prime minister margaret thatcher of britain that the subs 
reactors had been shut down before the vessel caught fire and sank 
her office said today 
if western descriptions of the submarine are accurate the 
reactors are wellprotected and carry less radioactive material 
than in older submarines said johan baarli director of norways 
institute for radiation protection 
he said any radioactive material probably would remain in the 
submarine and not escape into the sea 
nevertheless anne alvik chairman of norways committee on 
peacetime nuclear accidents said nearby waters would be checked 
for pollution 
a soviet cruiser of the kirov class equipped with hospital 
facilities was at the site of the accident as well as soviet 
trawlers ragdem said norwegian coast guard vessels were also 
headed for the area he said 
norwegian and swedish defense sources estimate the soviet union 
has about 110 nuclear submarines operating in northern waters from 
bases on the kola peninsula one of the worlds heaviest 
concentrations of naval power 
the mike might carry 16 missiles for surface targets 
although the figure is unconfirmed said swedish defense ministry 
spokesman thomas gur 
scores of crew members have been reported killed in previous 
soviet submarine accidents in 1983 a soviet submarine sank in the 
northern pacific killing 90 crew members according to us 
intelligence officials

the conversations begin tentatively 
but the fears and frustrations of the past 11 years soon come 
tumbling out 
it is the weariness that is most striking weariness of war 
weariness of a police state weariness of what is perceived as the 
worlds indifference to the superpower game being played in 
afghanistan 
other countries like to watch us afghans like we watch our 
dogfights and think oh the afghans are killing each other 
again said a kabul university professor who has studied in 
western europe 
kabul dogfights which are a bit like canine wrestling matches 
are seldom fatal but the war between the kabul government backed 
until earlier this year by soviet troops and westernbacked moslem 
guerrillas has claimed an estimated 1 million lives since the 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan took power by coup and 
assassination in 1978 
the united nations has estimated at least 5 million afghans have 
fled the country since then leaving a population of about 10 
million 
people are dying and suffering every day the professor 
said speaking on condition he not be identified further it is 
not human to just be an observer 
the world is silent we are silent we have had to learn the 
science of being alive i did not join the communist party the 
politics of silence i was following 
the professor spoke of the frustration of not being able to find 
out what was happening in his own country what washington and 
moscow might be contemplating what fighting was going on in other 
parts of the country 
we used to read the far eastern economic review le monde 
they come no more he said he said he distrusted the local 
governmentcontrolled news media 
across town a silver merchant also criticized what he 
considered the superpowers abandonment of responsibility 
the americans the russians think they are finished in 
geneva they make writings on paper they say they finish this 
problem he said but this problem is not finished it is 
worse not better 
under a unsponsored accord signed in geneva april 14 1988 
the soviet union withdrew the last of its troops from afghanistan 
on feb 15 of this year but moscow continues to arm its proteges 
and the united states says it cannot abandon the guerrillas who 
call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
you give bombs to the mujahedeen the silver merchant told 
an american reporter the russians give bombs to the government 
you dont die russians dont die only afghan people die maybe it 
is time for us to say ok finished president najib is not so 
bad let us have a quick finish 
the people are weary especially in kabul when they hear of 
jalalabad said a 41yearold man his niece and her three 
children were killed last week while trying to leave jalalabad 
about 40 miles from the pakistan border where the guerrillas have 
besieged government troops for the past month 
he said his relatives were traveling in an armyescorted convoy 
that was attacked by the mujahedeen others too were killed he 
said but he did not know the numbers 
there are problems because the main roads are going to be 
closed by the mujahedeen he added 
kabul has already felt the effects of closed roads food and 
fuel supplies have been curtailed since january as mujahedeen 
forces and snowfalls blocked highways 
although the situation has eased with airlifts of flour and 
wheat from the soviet union and weekly food and medicine flights 
from india the poorest people of kabul still spend hours getting 
bread from little bakery stalls dotted around the city some send 
their children in relays to await the crisp slabs of freshly baked 
nan the bread that is the staple of the afghan diet 
traffic on the streets of kabul remains light onefourth or 
less of what it was last fall because of gasoline rationing 
the petrol pumps are open if you have the piece of paper from 
the government said a shopkeeper who owns a car if you want 
the paper it may take three or four days i would have to close my 
shop for three or four days i have 10 children and i must keep my 
shop open i walk

it was meant to be a week of 
celebration a joyous confirmation that longdelayed independence 
finally was on its way 
instead the bloodiest fighting of namibias 23year bush war 
erupted making a mockery of a ceasefire jeopardizing the 
credibility of a un monitoring operation and killing scores of 
young guerrillas before they could savor the independence for which 
they fought 
in the warravaged northern region of ovambo where most of the 
insurgents supporters live a dusktodawn curfew is back in force 
after a sevenweek lull and deeprooted cynicism about the 
prospects for independence from south africa has returned 
namibian soil now bleeds when in fact the people should be 
rejoicing said the namibian council of churches 
there is agreement on what prompted the clashes the presence 
of hundreds of wellarmed southwest africa peoples organization 
guerrillas in northern namibia on april 1 the day that the 
unsupervised truce was to have taken effect 
but why it happened after six months without major hostilities 
remains in dispute why would swapo risk confrontation on the 
very day that an 11yearold independence plan was implemented 
calling for elections which the guerrilla movement was favored to 
win 
south africa namibias ruler since world war i says the 
guerrillas staged a crossborder incursion while they were supposed 
to have been at least 100 miles inside angola as part of an 
agreement to confine combatants from both sides to their bases 
swapos aim said south african foriegn minister pik botha was 
to set up bases after the ceasefire had neutralized security 
forces and then proclaim to the world that the bases were 
established through military prowess 
swapos president sam nujoma says most of the guerrillas 
involved in the fighting had been in namibia all along and were 
prepared to place themselves under un control on april 1 the 
insurgents thought they would be safe once the truce started and 
did not expect to be hunted down by militarystyle police units 
other swapo officials said 
villagers in ovambo have recounted how cheerful swapo guerrillas 
seemed to be expecting a heros welcome rather than a war when they 
arrived 
officials from the united nations the united states britain 
and elsewhere have supported south africas assertion that the 
guerrillas did infiltrate from angola swapo had no known bases in 
namibia and cedric thornberry secondincommand of the monitoring 
force said the un plan made no provisions for such bases 
botha boasted during the week that south africas international 
image had been enhanced by the namibian crisis while swapo had 
been discredited 
even the organization of african unity and the frontline states 
of southern africa two persistent critics of bothas government 
refrained from attacking south africa when they issued statements 
of concern about namibia 
however african nations expressed sympathy for swapo and 
accused the united nations of incompetence 
the leaders of the un monitoring force have encountered 
particularly harsh criticism for allowing south african military 
units to leave their bases and join police in antiguerrilla 
operations 
the namibian council of churches in a report based on a visit 
by clergymen to the war zone said that when ovambo residents in 
the north tried to report incidents two un officers refused to 
stop reading their novels and a third was intoxicated and of no 
help at all 
during the week of combat less than 1000 soldiers of the 
planned 4650member un military monitoring force were in 
namibia and only a handful of observers were in ovambo swapo and 
its third world allies had insisted even this full figure was 
inadequate and called for the united nations to expand the force to 
7500 as was originally planned 
a major question now is whether any reconciliation can be 
achieved if the independence plan is able to proceed 
swapo had been favored to gain the most votes in 
preindependence elections scheduled for november and the fighting 
does not appear to have dampened its support in ovambo where about 
half of namibias 13 million people live 
but elsewhere parties opposed to swapo hope to capitalize on 
what they view as a huge blunder by the guerrillas leaders of the 
democratic turnhalle alliance which depicts itself a moderate 
alternative to swapo said its supporters could be drawn into 
conflict with swapo backers because of the fighting in the north 
thornberry at one of several hectic news briefings during the 
week said namibia is in danger of bleeding to death

government and industry were caught unprepared 
when the exxon valdez spilled 10 million gallons of crude oil into 
prince william sound and congress is determined not to let it 
happen again 
in response to the worst oil spill in north american history 
lawmakers are scrutinizing federal statutes related to oil 
transportation so no future spill is allowed to get so far out of 
control 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has introduced 
legislation that would require the president to immediately 
initiate a cleanup of oil spills unless he is sure the owner or 
operator of the vessel is doing it 
president bush announced friday he was sending the military to 
valdez to help clean up but mitchell was angry that he waited 
until two weeks after the march 24 accident to take any action 
a federal takeover of the cleanup effort was warranted after 
it became clear on the day of the accident that alyeska the oil 
pipeline service company and exxon had not responded in the manner 
called for by the contingency plan and did not have sufficient 
equipment available to contain the spill mitchell said 
his proposal would set up a 500 million federal fund to pay for 
the spills when those responsible cant be found 
both mitchells bill and one offered by sen max baucus 
dmont are amendments to the clean water act 
baucus is proposing that minimum penalties for spilling oil be 
increased from 5000 to 50000 and in the case of big spills to 
50 per barrel that would have slapped a multimillion dollar fine 
on exxon for the valdez accident 
house republicans also are working on legislation to improve 
readiness for oil tanker accidents but dont want the federal 
government to get stuck with the bill 
the measure being designed by the house republican research 
committee would require industry to be more specific about 
emergency response plans and have more equipment ready as well as 
to pay for all the costs of cleanup 
legislation proposed by rep walter jones dnc would 
consolidate four federal laws on who gets blamed and billed for 
damage caused by spills 
his proposal also would increase liability the categories for 
which compensation should be paid and the size of the fund for 
making compensation money for the fund would come from a 
13centperbarrel fee on crude oil sold in the united states 
jones subcommittee on the coast guard will be working on 
legislation reauthorizing that service and likely will make changes 
reflecting reaction to the valdez disaster said a staff member of 
the subcommittee 
cornel martin noted that the bill could be a vehicle for 
strengthening rules against alcohol consumption by tanker crews or 
requiring more extensive background checks on those renewing their 
pilots licenses 
the pilot of the exxon valdez who was in his cabin when the 
tanker ran aground admitted drinking before the accident and as a 
motorist had a history of driving while intoxicated arrests he 
has been charged in the accident 
both sen frank lautenberg dnj and rep silvio conte 
rmass have introduced bills that would give the coast guard 
access to the federal national driver register to check on driving 
records of potential tanker pilots 
lawmakers opposed to oil exploration in the arctic national 
wildlife refuge say theres not much chance of legislation passing 
that would allow drilling in that environmentally sensitive alaskan 
region 
anwr is dead for the foreseeable future said sen timothy 
wirth dcolo 
but sen bennett johnston dla who supports anwr drilling 
disagrees 
it is too early too tell what the impact will be he said 
we will have to assess not only what the damage is but ways to 
prevent this kind of accident in the future and to assure the 
public that can be done the spill does not reduce our need for 
oil 
bushs budget for fiscal 1990 assumed the treasury would get 
21 billion from oil lease sales in the refuge 
since the valdez disaster white house and congressional budget 
negotiators have decided the money wont be available

tanks rumbled through thousands of people 
demonstrating for independence in soviet georgia today and the 
republics leaders discussed the crisis in a building besieged by 
protesters activists said 
they went right through the crowd tamara chiza 
correspondent for the unofficial journal expresskhronika said of 
the tanks 
she said five or six tanks pushed through the demonstrators in 
downtown tbilisi georgias capital in a show of force on the 
fifth straight day of nationalists protests she said the tanks did 
not fire and the people refused to disperse despite the presence 
of several hundred soldiers 
another activist said about 10 people were injured and that some 
protesters threw themselves in front of a tank 
a journalist at the republics official news agency gruzinform 
said the republics leadership was meeting urgently in government 
headquarters that were surrounded by the protesters he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
forces of the soviet interior ministry moved into tbilisi on 
friday after strikes and protests closed down much of the city 
witnesses reported seeing tanks and armored personnel carriers as 
well soldiers but official sources said they had no knowledge of 
tanks being deployed 
nationalists have been demonstrating and conducting a hunger 
strike to demand independence and an end to what they consider 
kremlin interference in their dealings with the abkhazia region of 
georgia they barricaded themselves behind buses on lenin square in 
front of government offices to prevent government tanks and troops 
from breaking up their protests activists said 
in the first report on the unrest by the central press the 
government daily izvestia did not mention calls for independence 
but said antisoviet antisocialist slogans were seen at the 
tbilisi demonstrations 
the report said the main goal of the tbilisi protest was to 
object to unspecified unconstitutional actions by abkhazia 
residents 
that appeared to be a reference to calls by abkhazians to secede 
from georgia and become a separate soviet republic 
in addition to pressing their independence demands the georgian 
protesters claim the kremlin is stirring up ethnic unrest in the 
autonomous region of abkhazia in their southern republic activists 
reported clashes between georgians and abkhazians last weekend in 
the black sea resort of sukhumi 
several people said unrest began in the region when thousands of 
abkhazians a small minority gathered in the settlement of lichni 
two weeks ago to petition for abkhazia to secede from georgia and 
become a republic 
ms chiza said in a telephone interview that most public 
tranportation was not operating in tbilisi today and other sources 
said only stores and food processing plants were open the whole 
city is paralyzed she said 
the crowd gathered in the square paralyzed traffic in the center 
of the city of 12 million people 
earlier today activist sergei dandurov estimated the number of 
tanks at 10 and said they had injured eight or nine young people 
he said in a telephone call from tbilisi that several people threw 
themselves at the first tank shouting death to the russian 
occupiers 
the unrest was the latest outpouring of nationalist feeling in 
the soviet union a country of more than 100 ethnic groups 
tensions have run particularly high in the southern caucasus where 
georgia is located because of earlier clashes between neighboring 
armenians and azerbaijanis 
georgy chanturia chairman of the national democratic party 
said thursday that 158 georgians began a hunger strike at 
government buildings tuesday and plan to continue it until april 
14 the anniversary of a demonstration for ethnic rights in 1978 
he said they are demanding an independent georgia 
last fall demonstrators marched in tbilisi with demands ranging 
from georgian independence to the manufacture of more 
georgianlanguage typewriters 
soviet authorities also responded to ethnic unrest in 
neighboring azerbaijan and armenia with troops in the past year 
more than 90 people were killed in the ethnic clashes mostly in 
november and those two republics remained under military control 
and curfews for months

seeing a potential bonanza if two 
scientists claims of a new way to create fusion prove true the 
legislature voted to appropriate 5 million to accelerate the 
research at the university of utah 
following assurances from gov norm bangerter that he wasnt 
asking for a blank check the legislature on friday approved the 
funds but stressed that no money would be spent until the 
experiment was confirmed 
neither of the two researchers who claim to have produced 
nuclear fusion in a test tube stanley pons of utah and martin 
fleischmann of the university of southampton in england was 
present 
bangerter and other officials say their claim if true could 
bring the state millions of dollars in patent and licensing 
royalties 
i want the state to get going were not asking for a blank 
check we just want to be able to expedite the process so that it 
can take us where its going to take us bangerter told a joint 
session of the legislature 
lawmakers also passed legislation creating a ninemember state 
fusion energy advisory council to oversee the research 
they approved the two bills overwhelmingly after hearing 
presentations from university of utah president chase peterson and 
members of the state board of regents 
fusion is the energy source that powers the sun and hydrogen 
bombs the energy produced by nuclear power plants comes from 
fission which splits atoms during fusion they are joined 
together 
ordinarily fusion requires extremely high heat but pons and 
fleischmann contend that they sustained a controlled fusion 
reaction at room temperature using materials found in any college 
laboratory and produced four times the amount of energy required 
to run the experiment 
their findings were immediately cited by some as the door to a 
longrange safe cheap energy source if they are confirmed by 
other tests and transferred to a largescale project 
however some scientists have said they cannot duplicate the 
experiment and doubt its validity 
legislators stressed that no money would be spent until the 
experiment is confirmed 
if youre asking if there is a possibility of a runaway train 
we havent even gotten the train to move yet said house majority 
leader craig moody before a single dime is spent we have to 
have fusion confirmed 
the appropriations bill allocates 2 million for the current 
fiscal budget and 3 million for fiscal 1990 and authorizes the 
new council to spend up to 300000 for legal services including 
patent research 
attorney general paul van dam told the body he needs at least 
75000 immediately to hire international patent experts to advise 
the state on how to protect the process

backtoback visits by egyptian president 
hosni mubarak and israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir have 
restored us momentum in the middle east but the outlook for peace 
talks is unclear until skeptical palestinians decide their next 
move 
they are faced with the hard choice of electing leaders to 
negotiate with an israeli government that has ruled out statehood 
or using force and diplomacy to try to dislodge israel from the 
west bank and gaza 
president bushs endorsement of shamirs proposal for elections 
in the territories was coupled during the visits with a reiteration 
of us opposition to establishment of an independent palestinian 
state 
these moves cheered the shamir government which had been urged 
by the administration to come up with new ideas for dealing 
with the 14 million palestinians who have been under israeli 
control since 1967 
while the details are not clear the goal set by the prime 
minister is a trial period of local selfrule with negotiations on 
a permanent settlement to be conducted afterward by israel 
palestinians egypt and jordan 
however bush also said israel should end its occupation of the 
territories and had no sovereignty claim to the land lost by the 
arabs in the 1967 sixday war bushs endorsement of shamirs 
election proposal tended to overshadow the strong statement but it 
registered on the israeli government because it is an unqualified 
demand 
previous administrations left open the possibility that israel 
might retain some of the land as a security zone while trading 
territory for peace 
shamir reiterated his position that retention of the west bank 
is essential for israels security his concern is not that a small 
palestinian state would overwhelm israel militarily rather a 
close aide said the palestine liberation organizations stated 
strategy is to gain a foothold on the west bank and to trigger a 
war between israel and the arab countries 
the israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the arabs enjoy a 101 advantage in weapons while shamir stressed 
in a speech thursday that the most densely populated center of 
israel without the west bank is as wide as the distance between 
the white house and suburban chevy chase 
the choice is not between israel keeping the territories or 
risking war he said the opposite is true if we leave there 
will almost certainly be war 
at the end of shamirs visit the israeli delegation seemed 
satisfied with the results privately the official said they had 
told their american hosts at the start that the bush administration 
was drifting toward support of plo positions and that israel was 
prepared to make a public issue of its concern 
the critical thing to change is the signal the us is sending 
the arabs the official said both sides decided to find a 
middle ground and we found it 
still the bush administration will keep talking to the plo to 
the dismay of israel which accuses the group of unrelenting 
terrorism and bushs statements on the west bank and gaza appear 
to leave no room for compromise 
mubaraks visit meanwhile produced us assurances that bush 
and secretary of state james a baker iii consider the situation in 
the territories untenable the egyptian leader worked hard at 
trying to convince them that an international peace conference 
would instantly produce direct negotiations between israel and the 
arabs 
bush gave the idea lukewarm endorsement saying a conference 
might help at the appropriate time and under the right 
circumstances more important from mubaraks viewpoint the 
president and baker left no doubt the administration would not 
permit the situation in the territories to stagnate 
bush underscored a need for creativity and imaginative 
ways of rethinking the peace process 
his exploration of the possibilities will resume april 19 with a 
visit to washington by king hussein of jordan over the long run 
though the palestinians response to shamirs proposal could hold 
the key 
shamir said a majority of the palestinians on the west bank and 
in gaza want a peaceful settlement in preference to their 15month 
bloody uprising he also predicted they are likely to participate 
in the election 
their initial response was a cool one while plo chairman yasser 
arafat on a visit to congo criticized the proposal as 
inappropriate and said the uprising would continue until the 
ultimate victory 
hanna sindora editor of the proplo daily al fajr newspaper 
said i think the intefadeh will continue until shamir comes up 
with a better proposal 
but bush declaring that the climate is better than its been 
for a while said the election plan represents a welcome step 
toward progress 
in the middle east a little step sometimes can prove to 
be fruitful he said friday

laws approved by parliament this week have 
ushered in a new era of competitive elections in poland that will 
break the communist partys long monopoly on power 
the laws also created a new legislative chamber that will be the 
east blocs first such democratically elected body 
polish lawmakers passed their historic reforms friday in a quick 
series of votes as amendments to the constitution they created a 
presidency a freely elected senate and new electoral laws 
a solidarity committee created by leader lech walesa plans to 
meet today to discuss potential opposition candidates 
the constitutional amendments follow major political reforms in 
the soviet union which last month held its first contested 
elections in seven decades of communist rule however only 
candidates approved by officially sanctioned groups were allowed to 
run in the soviet races 
the bills stem from an agreement wednesday in an 
oppositiongovernment committee on political reform the group 
formed part of twomonth talks between the solidarityled 
opposition and communist authorities 
the opposition agreed to participate in the sejm or parliament 
in exchange for restoration of the legal status of the independent 
trade union solidarity the union was banned after authorities 
imposed martial law in december 1981 
the amendments call for creating a 100member senate to be 
freely elected in june 
the senates primary function will be to act as a control on the 
sejm especially in the field of human rights as well as 
socioeconomic life wednesdays agreement said 
the current 460member sejm will remain in place as the 
supreme authority of legislative power however 35 percent of 
its seats will now be open to candidates independent of the polish 
united workers communist party 
the party and its allies will occupy the other 65 percent 
making the communists a minority party that must work with 
coalition partners to create a voting majority 
those allies the democratic party and the united peasant party 
thus expect to gain more independence and power the arrangement 
could produce some lively results in now placid chamber 
anyone who collects 3000 signatures can run for the senate or 
for the independent sejm seats 
previously only candidates approved by election commissions 
formed by the communist party and its allies could be placed on the 
ballot 
the election law also guarantees the opposition access to 
statecontrolled media and the chance to publish a newspaper during 
the campaign 
the constitutiomal amendments also create a post of president 
which existed in poland before world war ii 
while the legislative changes are meant to enhance democracy 
the sixyear presidency is a partyinspired brake to ensure that 
the party retains control for the immediate future 
the presidents term of office will last six years he can 
refuse to sign a bill into law however the sejm can overrule a 
presidential veto with a twothirds vote 
the sejm and senate jointly elect the president who is expected 
to be polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski he was leader when 
solidarity was banned

house speaker jim wright and his allies are 
hoping for the best but preparing for the worst as a ninemonth 
ethics committee probe of his finances enters what appears to be 
its final week 
with his power and leadership post on the line wright is 
already mounting a counteroffensive in anticipation of potentially 
damaging findings when the ethics panel delivers its report 
among the preparations 
wrights lawyer william oldaker is meeting with dozens of 
house democrats in an effort to answer some of the major 
allegations swirling around the speaker wright lieutenants are 
carrying thick black notebooks prepared by oldaker that respond 
point by point 
the wright camp is believed to have planted a midweek story 
saying the ethics panel has essentially dismissed three of the six 
original charges and wright business partner george mallick has 
been offering interviews in which he blasts the committees special 
investigator richard phelan as overzealous 
democrats are painting the case as purely a political 
vendetta ignited by jealousy over wrights legislative success and 
ability to influence reagan administration policy on central 
america 
in public statements wright has gradually come around to 
saying he may have made mistakes in a letter to his hometown fort 
worth startelegram he said however that if i have ever even 
technically violated any such rule it would have been 
unintentional 
the ethics panel formally known as the committee on standards 
of official conduct starts its third week of deliberations 
tuesday chairman julian dixon dcalif says it is likely to get 
down to reaching conclusions this week but the findings will not 
be announced until a report is prepared he said and that might 
not be until next week 
and in a move that seemed unlikely to bode much good for wright 
the panel last week sought an additional 400000 in investigative 
expenses including an extension of phelans contract through june 
two major questions are concerning the committee at this point 
according to sources who asked not to be identified 
one is whether wright through bulk sales of his book 
reflections of a public man evaded limits on outside speaking 
and writing fees the other is whether perhaps 100000 in benefits 
paid by fort worth developer mallick to wright and his wife betty 
amount to improper gifts 
wright has assembled a volunteer defense team including reps 
martin frost and jack brooks dtexas and rep steny hoyer dmd 
who have been circulating among colleagues and inviting them to 
meetings with oldaker 
theres been an effort to give democratic members some 
background on whats been happening frost said to let them 
know what the facts are what the ethics committee is most 
seriously examining we want to present what the speakers 
positions are rather than have them just read the newspaper 
oldaker says that on one crucial issue whether mallick had an 
interest in legislation before congress investigator phelan is 
trying to apply rules retroactively 
benefits wright and his wife received from mallick were offered 
mostly before 1986 while any possible legislative interest by the 
developer came after that date says oldaker 
if wrights standing on capitol hill is imperiled it will be 
because he has become politically too hot to handle for fellow 
democrats one senior democrat said lawmakers had found during 
their easter recess that its beginning to be an issue out in the 
country 
for all the gloom though wrights house backers note with 
satisfaction that democrats scored victories in a pair of recent 
congressional elections to fill vacancies in indiana and alabama 
if people were upset would they elect someone from jim 
wrights party asked hoyer its not a negative for us 
wright meanwhile is portraying himself as tending to business 
as usual he delivered a foreign policy speech on friday on one of 
his favorite topics central america to a democratic policy group 
and he met earlier in the week with costa rican president oscar 
arias only to face questions about his ethics case from reporters 
when cameras were admitted to the room for a picturetaking session 
what were seeing is a heightened virulence of the political 
debate and what is perceived to be fair game said hoyer 
he blamed much of the atmosphere on newly elected minority whip 
newt gingrich rga who demanded the ethics probe in the first 
place many believe his elevation to the no2 gop leadership post 
amounted to a reward for his handling of the wright case

islamabad warned saturday that 
kabuls marxist government risks serious consequences after a 
sovietmade scud b missile landed inside pakistan territory 
the afghan government called it an accident saying the missile 
missed its guerrilla target near jalalabad and landed across the 
border but it refused to apologize and again accused islamabad of 
aiding the usbacked moslem guerrillas 
the missile hit about 500 yards inside the border early friday 
it damaged a post office in the village of torkham but injured no 
one government officials said 
pakistans foreign ministry issued a statement saying the 
incident was a brazen act of provocation by the kabul regime 
which was clearly designed to internationalize the situation in 
afghanistan in order to save itself from the wrath of its own 
people 
pakistan pledged to take all the necessary measures to defend 
itself and the lives and property of its citizens against such 
attacks the statement said 
the missile with a range of up to 175 miles was believed 
launched from the afghan capital about 120 miles west of the 
pakistan border the guerrillas launched an offensive in march on 
jalalabad 45 miles west of the border and government troops have 
been blasting the jalalabad area with ss1 scud missiles 
in kabul afghan foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani 
said the missile landed over the border by mistake 
it was an accident he said adding we do not need to 
apologize when pakistan is conducting its onslaught without any 
apology 
afghanistan has repeatedly accused pakistan of sending military 
personnel into afghanistan to orchestrate moslem rebel attacks on 
government troops who have been left to defend the country after a 
soviet troop pullout was completed in february pakistan denies 
direct involvement 
amani said the missile strike caused casualties but he did not 
elaborate 
in the battle for jalalabad amani said 78 guerrillas and nine 
civilians were killed in the last 24 hours and asserted that no 
government troops were killed the report could not be verified 
amani also said that as of saturday afternoon foreign minister 
abdul wakil was still waiting in moscow for the united states to 
grant him a visa to travel to un headquarters in new york he is 
carrying an appeal from president najib for an urgent un security 
council session to address the afghan crisis 
the pakistani statement claimed the missile incident was a ploy 
to convince the security council to debate the afghan crisis even 
though the charter of the 15nation council prohibits debate on 
domestic issues 
the regime has resorted to its standard litany of baseless and 
irrelevant allegations against pakistan in an attempt to portray 
the situation inside afghanistan as a bilateral problem with 
pakistan that would threaten international peace the statement 
said 
the afghan charge daffaires was summoned to the foreign office 
and warned the responsibility for serious consequences that arise 
from such an attack rests entirely on the kabul government 
in march a scud missile landed about 300 yards from the border 
on the afghan side of torkham islamabad said at the time it was 
not concerned with what happened inside afghan territory 
moscow gave kabul the missiles in november despite protests from 
pakistan 
moslem insurgents headquartered in pakistan and iran have waged 
more than a decade of war against kabuls communist government 
beginning in december 1979 moscow sent more than 100000 troops 
into afghanistan to replace one communist government with another 
in april 1988 an agreement was signed in geneva providing for 
the withdrawal of the red army force moscow and washington have 
continued to supply weapons to their respective allies

just a year from now more than 100 million 
census forms will cascade into american homes in the 21st national 
head count most folks will find the questions familiar but there 
are some changes from the past 
the constitution requires that the census be taken every year 
ending in a zero and that the count then be used to decide how 
many seats in the house of representatives belong to each state 
practically from the nations beginning however the government 
has asked for more information than just how many people there are 
the additional questions provide data used to assess who 
americans are their economic and social condition and to help 
design programs to deal with problems 
while some people complain that the requests for information 
invade their privacy the census bureau refuses to ask things it 
considers too intrusive for example requests that it ask people 
about their religion sexual preference pets or handedness were 
turned down 
the questions to be asked in 1990 were developed during a series 
of public hearings in all 50 states over several years the planned 
questions were also submitted to congress for review 
while printing of the 1990 census forms has only just gotten 
underway preliminary copies were obtained by the associated press 
and american demographics magazine which specializes in population 
issues 
essentially there are two forms short and long the short form 
contains seven population questions and seven housing questions 
which officials want answered by every household in the country 
those questions are also the first part of the long form which 
will go to 17 percent of households and asks for considerably more 
detail 
american demographics noted that a major change from 1980 will 
distinguish between naturalborn children and stepchildren in this 
era of increasingly common divorce and remarriage 
new questions about pension will allow statisticians to get a 
better idea about the economic wellbeing of the elderly and for 
the first time the agency will ask about condominium fees second 
mortgages and mobile homes 
here is a questionbyquestion rundown on the 1990 census 
shortform 
1 name of each person living in the household 
2 how is this person related to the first person listed 
once upon a time the first person was listed as the head of 
the household but that term is no longer used the form simply 
seeks to relate everyone to whomever the family lists first 
choices include husband wife natural born or adopted child 
stepchild father mother grandchild and other 
3 sex only two choices here 
4 race the choices are white black american indian eskimo 
aleut chinese filipino hawaiian korean vietnamese japanese 
asian indian samoan guamian and other 
5 age and year of birth 
6 marital status choices include now married widowed 
divorced separated and never married 
7 is this person of hispanic origin choices include no yes 
mexican yes cuban yes puerto rican and yes other 
h1a did you leave anyone out of your list of persons for 
question 1 because you were not sure if this person should be 
listed for example someone temporarily away on a business trip 
or vacation a newborn baby still in the hospital or a person who 
stays here once in a while and has no other house 
h1b did you include anyone in your list of persons for 
question 1 even though you were not sure that the person should be 
listed for example a visitor who is staying here temporarily or a 
person who usually lives somewhere else 
h2 which best describes this building choices include mobile 
home onefamily detached home onefamily attached home and 
choices of several sized apartment buildings 
h3 how many rooms do you have in this house or apartment do

the drug dealers along 3rd avenue in miamis 
overtown neighborhood all know annmarie adker 
shes the nice old woman who will bid them a good day then call 
the police 
i walk down the street and give them a wave and they say hi 
mom and i keep walking adker said its when i get home 
behind closed doors that i let the police know youre just asking 
for trouble if you go confront those dealers your life to them is 
not worth a damn 
for more than 12 years adker has used her innercity crime 
prevention group to convince residents the best way to battle drug 
traffickers is behind the scenes direct involvement can lead to 
violence and retribution she says 
her message is ringing with added clarity among community 
leaders these days following last months slaying of an outspoken 
antidrug activist in the crackplagued community of west perrine 
about 10 miles south of downtown 
metrodade police a week ago arrested two 21yearold men on 
charges they opened fire on lee arthur lawrence outside his grocery 
store authorities called the slaying a contract hit and were 
searching for three suspects who allegedly ordered the killing 
police would not say how much they believe was paid to kill 
lawrence 51 who had been the target of several shootings and 
death threats since 1986 
one of the suspects ronnie johnson is also accused of killing 
a reputed perrine drug dealer the week before the slaying of 
lawrence whose funeral was attended by more than 800 mourners 
including president bushs son jeb 
at our meetings we never discuss who is doing drugs because 
you never know who might be listening adker said to be 
boisterous is to be foolish this is no pennyante game 
the united states has won wars on foreign soil but they cant 
subdue the drug dealers we are in a war and if youre not smart 
you can get yourself killed 
sure it puts fear in your mind said georgia ayres founder 
of the citizens advisory council an anticrime panel that works 
with police selfpreservation is the first law of nature most 
people are going to back down if they or their family is threatened 
the shooting of mr lawrence shows how little regard they have 
for human life if you get in their way theyll kill you 
police who have a tipline to encourage citizens to report 
suspected criminal activity expressed regret at lawrences 
shooting but said they couldnt offer roundtheclock protection on 
the basis of vague death threats 
metrodade police director fred taylor who had met with 
lawrence and other community leaders three days before the slaying 
said after the shooting you dont know how bad i feel they were 
going to assist us by identifying some of the individuals we just 
cant live in this kind of society 
but he said we cant assign a policeman around the clock to 
stay with somebody unless we have specifics i dont know what we 
could have done 
for some residents a call to irby mcknight at miamis urban 
league chapter is as far as they will go in reporting suspected 
drug activity 
he says he senses the growing apprehension among the formerly 
bold tipsters 
the fear of retaliation is strong in the community said 
mcknight a crimeprevention specialist they think the drug 
dealers are in control and the best thing to do is keep quiet 
but others hope the muchpublicized lawrence slaying will awaken 
more residents to challenge the strongarm reign of drug 
traffickers in some poor neighborhoods 
last weekend more than 100 west perrine residents and clergy 
members took part in an antidrug march that was being organized by 
lawrence before the slaying 
we cannot afford to be afraid said johnnie mcmillian 
president of the miamidade chapter of the national organization 
for the advancement of colored people we are all in danger and 
we cant save ourselves by being afraid 
at lawrences march 25 funeral many calls were made to use the 
death as a rallying point against drugrelated violence 
you could interpret the shooting as a message that the drug 
dealers are in control or that things have gotten to a point where 
we have to make a stand said john bennett executive director of 
the tacolcy community center in miamis liberty city section i 
dont think people want to live in fear and silence

more than 22000 school buildings in the 
nation are inadequate and 13 percent of those are structurally 
unsound according to a study released saturday by the education 
writers association 
the study found that one in four of the nations 88021 public 
school buildings need maintenance or major repairs are overcrowded 
or obsolete present environmental hazards or have multiple 
problems 
another third stack up as only adequate and because of growing 
enrollments and deferred maintenance could easily become 
inadequate said the study called wolves at the schoolhouse 
door 
the study cites antiquated facilities an enrollment boom and 
inadequate capital funds in concluding that the schoolhouse may 
be the most seriously threatened part of the infrastructure 
the ewa based its findings on federal statistics national 
surveys surveys of school building personnel at 38 state education 
departments state reports on school buildings and analyses of 
buildings in seven representative states 
onefifth of the nations schools were constructed more than 50 
years ago the association said nearly twothirds were built in 
the 1950s and 1960s generally a time of rapid and cheap 
construction many construction experts say the buildings were 
intended to last only about 30 years if so their time is up 
the group said replacement costs for all school buildings are 
estimated at 422 billion states estimate schools need 84 billion 
in new or retrofitting construction and 41 million in maintenance 
and repairs 
many states and school districts are investing below the 
recommended level of 2 to 4 percent of replacement value in annual 
maintenance the study found specifically it cited maine 
minnesota north carolina and tennessee with investments of 14 
percent 22 percent 22 percent and 13 percent respectively 
ewa noted that a school building boom is under way it cited 
census bureau statistics that school construction was up almost 50 
percent from 1982 to 1986 it said school districts estimate they 
will spend nearly 22 billion on new construction additions and 
modernization between 1988 and 1990 in addition school bonds led 
all categories of municipal bonds in 1987 with a value of 9 
billion 
but ewa pointed out that only a small percentage of students 
will ever attend new schools most will spend their school days 
in old sometimes remodeled buildings many will shuffle to and 
fro among portable buildings 
and it noted that new investment varies substantially by region 
the south led in dollar volume in 198687 at 133 billion the 
study said next was the southwest at 106 billion followed by 
new yorknew jersey at 857 million the west consisting of 
california arizona nevada and hawaii was fourth school 
investment dropped in alaska and the northwest while stabilizing in 
the mountain and great lakes states 
based on responses from 14 states only 39 percent of the 
projected funding needs for construction and renovation will be met 
between 1989 and 1992 ewa said sixteen states gave districts no 
capital financing assistance the study said including two with 
the most severe enrollment crunches nevada and texas 
ewa said erratic data collection inconsistent state involvement 
and the unevenness of the problem are depriving districts of an 
opportunity to make longterm plans and avoid past mistakes 
these problems cannot be overlooked much longer the group 
warned the uneven distribution of resources and planning 
capacities allows tremendous inequities in the local environment 
that prespares children for the future often within a few miles of 
each other 
ewa is an association of education writers for publications 
across the country its report was released at the groups annual 
seminar

eastern airlines is flying the barebones 
schedule it has kept since a strike began last month while its 
three unions and prospective new owners meet through the weekend in 
hopes of making a deal to revive the carrier 
the negotiations which entered their second day today center 
on concessions sought by former baseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth and his partners but before agreeing to any wage and 
benefit cuts the unions are seeking assurances the new owners have 
a plan to bring bankrupt eastern back to profitability 
the two sides met most of the day friday in sessions described 
by one source as highly preliminary and focused primarily on 
the language of the ueberroth groups tentative agreement to buy 
eastern from texas air corp 
talks resumed at about 10 am today david shapiro appointed 
by a bankruptcy judge as examiner to oversee eastern operations is 
mediating the discussions 
union officials said it was highly unlikely a deal would be 
struck during the weekend a deadline does loom however 
ueberroths 464 million purchase agreement allows him to call off 
the deal if he does not reach new contract agreements with the 
unions by midnight tuesday 
this will take some time because its not only money 
involved said an international association of machinists 
official who asked not to be identified how does our ownership 
part shape up how do we get our passengers back what kind of job 
security is involved 
iam spokesman jim conley said the unions would have no statement 
on the negotiations because both sides in the talks had agreed to a 
news blackout requested by the bankruptcy judge overseeing eastern 
that judge would have to approve any sale of eastern which has 
been all but grounded since the machinists struck march 4 the 
airlines pilots and flight attendants have honored iam pickets 
in other development texas air filed a lawsuit friday alleging 
that takeover specialist carl icahn was trying to interfere with 
the sale the lawsuit in fort bend county district court near 
houston charges that icahn has illegally communicated and 
negotiated with the eastern unions 
ueberroth who made millions in the travel business before 
entering the sports world as head of the 1984 olympics in los 
angeles was not on hand for the friday talks but was expected to 
participate if significant progress is made 
representatives of the air line pilots association and the 
transport workers union which represents eastern flight 
attendants also are involved in the talks 
the iam struck eastern after rejecting concessions demanded by 
texas air 
ueberroth according to sources wants 210 million in wage and 
benefit concessions 
wally haber general chairman of the machinists district 100 in 
miami which represents eastern mechanics and ground workers said 
210 million is the total amount of concessions requested earlier 
by texas air 150 million of that from machinists he said he did 
not know if ueberroth had adopted the texas air demands as his own 
haber said machinists were willing to accept 15 percent wage and 
benefit concessions 
union officials have indicated a willingness to accept 
concessions provided eastern was sold to a new owner also 
ueberroths agreements give employees a 30 percent ownership stake 
in return for concessions 
eastern has been flying about 110 flights a day during the 
strike eastern spokesman jim ashlock said the sale agreement 
caused no noticeable increase in passenger loads friday

even if the mikhail s gorbachev keeps his 
pledge to shut down three military reactors the soviet union will 
have at least 11 others able to make material for nuclear bombs 
according to experts and documents available in the west 
gorbachev in his latest arms control gesture announced in 
london on friday that the soviet union had shut down one 
plutoniumenrichment reactor in 1987 and would close two more over 
the next two years he said his country would stop producing 
weaponsgrade uranium 
the size and even the location of soviet military reactors is a 
closely guarded secret and gorbachev did not spell out which 
reactors would be closed and which or even how many would remain 
open 
the difficulty we have is that he has wrapped his program in 
such a veil of secrecy that we cannot get a reading of how much 
further he needs to go said tom cochran a nuclear physicist at 
the natural resources defense council 
on the uranium side the united states had produced a huge 
surplus of weapons uranium in 1964 and shut off all production of 
that what he is doing is do what we did 25 years ago said 
cochran 
the soviets already have an estimated 115 metric tons of 
plutonium and 500 metric tons of enriched uranium mostly in the 
32000 nuclear weapons thought to be in their arsenal said cochran 
and stan norris coauthors of a book on the soviet weapons complex 
the united states has about 110 metric tons of plutonium with 
further production frozen because the only three us reactors able 
to produce nuclear weapons materials at the savannah river site in 
aiken sc have been shut down because they cannot be operated 
safely 
cochran who has extensive contacts with soviet scientists and 
arms control officials and travels regularly to the soviet union 
said he had advised the russians to seek a freeze like the one 
proposed by gorbachev 
we pointed out to them the timeliness of this as the united 
states prepares to make major commitment to spend an estimated 8 
billion to build a new generation of weapons reactors at savannah 
river and idaho falls idaho 
gorbachev clearly has taken a step that sends a signal that 
they are ready to enter negotiations on ending production of 
fissionable materials used in nuclear weapons said cochran 
us officials were slow to respond to gorbachevs proposal 
president bush at his news conference friday said he had not 
analyzed gorbachevs proposal so i honestly cant tell you that 
i know the full significance 
one government expert on the soviet nuclear industry said it 
appeared that the plants mentioned in gorbachevs announcement were 
being closed for safety reasons 
my estimate is that he is making some political mileage out of 
steps they have taken for safety reasons said the official 
speaking on condition that he not be further identified 
intelligence analysts declined to divulge their data on the 
soviet nuclear weapons complex but two officials with access to 
the classified reports said the information provided by cochran and 
norris in telephone interviews went significantly beyond what has 
been disclosed in public 
the soviets maintain two major weapons complexes one at kyshtym 
in the ural mountains near chelyabinsk and the other at tomsk deep 
in siberia said cochran 
those two complexes apparently are the sites of 14 soviet 
weapons reactors mentioned by assistant secretary of energy troy 
wade in testimony before the house armed services committee earlier 
this year it was not clear whether that number included the one 
shut own in 1987 
six of the reactors known as the troitsk series are located at 
kyshtym and are run by the soviet ministry of medium machine 
building one of 12 soviet defense industry ministries according 
to government officials 
the actual number of soviet reactors able to produce weapons 
material may be much higher wade said because they use 
watercooled graphite reactors like the rbmk reactors at 
chernobyl to make nuclear weapons materials as well as electricity 
for civilian use 
two of the troistsk reactors were built in the late 1950s a 
few years after the three us nuclear weapons production reactors 
at savannah river and could be ready for retirement according to 
one government analyst

dr john brooks slaughter has been 
inaugurated as the first black president in the 102year history of 
occidental college and trustees said they hope hell prepare the 
school for a more diverse future 
more than 200 representatives of colleges and scholarly 
organizations attended fridays inauguration at the parklike 
campus said occidental spokeswoman frances hill 
slaughter the schools 11th president physically took over the 
job last august when dr richard c gilman resigned the post which 
he had held for 23 years 
slaughter 55 had been chancellor of the university of 
maryland and previously was director of the national science 
foundation 
since its founding in 1887 occidental college had been a small 
prestigious liberal arts college with a mostly white student 
population the fact that slaughter is black and his extensive 
background in engineering appealed to the board of trustees ms 
hill said 
there was a recognition by the trustees who are largely white 
males that change is coming that the next century is going to 
require a different approach she said 
the population of california shows you that white males are 
becoming a minority there was a feeling among the trustees that we 
needed to find somebody who bridges many fields many cultures 
slaughter born in topeka kan received his bachelor of 
science degree from kansas state university in 1956 he received 
his doctorate degree from the university of california in san diego

another daley will soon reign from the fifth 
floor of city hall and in the old neighborhood in places like 
vitas clips and snips grassanos jewelry and sheehans tap all 
seems right with the world again 
you go to work you raise a family you keep up your property 
you live with your own said ed burba ticking off the priorities 
for residents of bridgeport the workingclass southwest side 
enclave that mayorelect richard m daley his late father mayor 
richard j daley and three other chicago mayors have called home 
and he added you have a daley calling the shots 
downtown 
nearly a week after the mayoral election the familiar red 
white and blue daley campaign posters remain tied to trees and 
taped to windows but nothing is like it once was even in fabled 
bridgeport 
there are more blacks more asians many more hispanics and 
fewer city jobs to go around than there once were 
the stockyards nearby are shuttered a few storefronts along the 
commercial artery are boarded up pockets of poverty swell at its 
edges and even the most unabashed daley backers among its 32000 
residents know the son cant recreate the halcyon days of the 
father 
it has been 12 years since that fateful day when richard j age 
74 and less than a year into his sixth term suffered a heart 
attack and died 
shock waves rippled across all of chicago but nowhere with more 
effect than in bridgeport the old man as daley is still called 
with affection rarely missed a christening a wedding or a wake 
and almost everyone in bridgeport or so it seems knew him his 
wife or one of their seven children 
and more than a few owed their livelihood to the acquaintance 
weve got firemen people from the departments of streets 
and sanitation water whatever a lot of people still work for 
the city burba said but its nothing like it once was 
when edward j kelly became the first of five native sons to 
call the shots downtown in 1933 bridgeport was a democratic 
precinct captains dream an allwhite bluecollar neighborhood 
covering three square miles full of immigrants from ireland 
italy poland and latvia living in singlefamily brick bungalows or 
small apartment buildings 
so welloiled was bridgeports political machinery that when 
kelly left the mayors office in 1947 it went to another native 
son martin kennelly who was in turn pushed out of the way eight 
years later by richard j daley 
after daleys death in late 1976 yet another bridgeporter 
michael bilandic filled the rest of daleys term and to the 
victorious continued to flow most of the spoils 
but soon thereafter the courts narrowed the stream with a 
series of decisions severely limiting political hirings and 
firings and in 1979 an upstart democrat named jane byrne a 
onetime protege of the elder daley who spent much of her 
subsequent term fearing a challenge from the younger daley upset 
bilandic in the mayors race and shut the spigot completely 
residents differ sometimes heatedly on whether garbage pickup 
snow removal and other city services got better or worse under the 
late harold washington who defeated mrs byrne in 1983 to become 
chicagos first black mayor it was washingtons death in late 
1987 just months into his second term that set in motion the rise 
to power of the younger daley 
pearl koltz usually solves such debates simply by reminding both 
sides we got kind of spoiled 
almost no one in bridgeport expects it to happen again even 
with richie daley in charge 
times change said sherri yersich trying to corral her 
three youngsters in front of the twoflat across the street from 
burbas home 
people who come into the neighborhood now think its 
political but i hear stories from my uncle who used to be a 
precinct captain about how everybody even kids used to pass out 
literature and ring doorbells and that kind of stuff it just 
doesnt go on much anymore 
i mean my husband works for the city and hes a good friend 
of richies but other than go to his victory party the other 
night we didnt really do much 
but you know what i grew up in bridgeport and lived here all 
my life she added and just knowing richie is the mayor makes 
things seem a little more like theyve always been

mikhail s gorbachev looked more at home in the 
splendor of londons ancient guildhall than in shirtsleeves in 
cuba during the soviet presidents sixday trip abroad 
gorbachevs gains if any from private talks with cuban 
president fidel castro in havana may not be apparent for some time 
but he reaped positive news during his later stop in london 
gorbachev got a ringing endorsement from britains staunchly 
anticommunist prime minister and a promise of a visit from queen 
elizabeth ii the queen would be the first british monarch to visit 
russia since the communists killed czar nicholas ii and his family 
who were cousins of the queens forebears 
but us officials said they were disappointed that gorbachevs 
visit to cuba produced no signal the soviets were prepared to 
disengage from central america where the superpowers are pitted 
against each other by proxy 
gorbachev and castro stressed solidarity though cuba has shown 
no inclination toward liberalization policies being adopted in 
moscow beijing and much of eastern europe 
but gorbachev who has shown more interest in wooing western 
banks and business than in propping up third world revolutionaries 
made no move to ease cubas huge debt burden analysts had 
speculated some measure of debt forgiveness might be forthcoming as 
a goodwill gesture during the soviet presidents first visit to 
cuba 
instead gorbachev said the cuban government should be more 
careful in spending soviet aid 
as in the past the soviet union and cuba have a common 
approach to the key problems of international affairs gorbachev 
told the cuban national assembly we are resolutely against any 
theories and doctrines justifying the export of revolution or 
counterrevolution and all forms of interference in the affairs of 
sovereign nations 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he welcomed the 
statement but said it was not supported by action the bush 
administration which just committed to end military aid to the 
contra rebels in sovietbacked nicaragua had hoped for a clearer 
signal that the soviet government would reduce arms shipments to 
the sandinista regime he said 
but seasoned observers in havana said even if that was 
gorbachevs intention he would not have said so in cuba 
nicaraguas strongest ally 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
people have come to expect too much from the soviet leader 
its the rabbitfromthehat approach gerasimov said 
with other politicians you dont expect so much but when 
gorbachev speaks you expect him to pull out a rabbit every time 
but after leaving the island a gorbachev aide hinted that the 
soviet communist party chief may try to mediate the longrunning 
feud between cuba and the united states 
although castros public remarks were peppered with 
antiamerican slogans georgi shakhnazarov a foreign policy 
adviser to gorbachev said the cuban leader indicated privately he 
wants to normalize relations with the united states 
asked if gorbachev could bring the two neighbors back together 
shakhnazarov said the general secretary tries not to miss any 
opportunity to encourage better relations 
in london the soviet leader addressed magnificantly robed 
british luminaries in guildhall he then received from prime 
minister margaret thatcher the endorsement he has sought from the 
west since launching his modernization campaign four years ago 
speaking at guildhall gorbachev summarized his goals for an 
international television audience 
we are building an open democratic and free society which has 
learned the lessons of its past a society based on law and 
responsibility a society that keeps its citizens well informed 
gorbachev said we are building a society that rests on its 
citizens initiative and enterprise on soviet socialist patriotism 
and dedication to human socialism aimed at elevating the human 
being 
mrs thatcher called him one of those rare people who has the 
vision the boldness and the sheer power of personality to change 
the whole future of his country and to have a profound effect on 
the wider world as well 
we want you to succeed in your task she told gorbachev 
first because we believe that in your vision lies a better life 
for the soviet people but also because every step toward greater 
democracy human rights and freedom of choice in your country 
brings us closer together 
and she pledged were ready to help in practical ways too 
where our help is sought and desired

in a 1984 geography test 20 percent of 
kentuckys college students couldnt find the ohio river on a map 
many of them thought the appalachian mountains were in europe 
but fourth through eighthgraders at a contest friday knew that 
ecuador was the worlds leading producer of bananas and that the 
great victoria desert is in australia 
ninetyseven pupils competed in the geography contest for the 
chance to represent kentucky at the national geography bee in 
washington on may 19 
the winner 13yearold joe wong of conkwright junior high 
school in winchester admitted his final question was relatively 
easy 
the napa valley of california and the bordeaux region of 
france have what agricultural product in common the california 
native was asked 
they both grow grapes for wine he answered 
many of the earlier questions were tough though 
what islands were formerly called the sandwich islands one 
boy was asked he didnt know 
in which direction do ocean currents circulate in the middle 
latitudes of the northern hemisphere the next pupil didnt know 
what two islands are known for their use of geothermal 
energy that one was missed too 
the answers hawaii clockwise and new zealand and iceland 
the national geographic society organized the geography bees 
partly because of the appalling scores of us students of all ages

the sinking of a nuclearpowered submarine off the 
coast of norway is at least the third serious incident in the 
soviet nuclear fleet in 2 years and comes amid growing soviet 
public concern over nuclear safety 
the accident came five months after a reported nearmeltdown in 
a nuclear reactor aboard a soviet icebreaker in the port city of 
murmansk 
that accident touched off a public outcry that prevented another 
nuclearpowered ship from docking in the far east 
in october 1986 three sailors died in a fire and explosion 
aboard a yankeeclass nuclearpowered submarine in the atlantic 
ocean that was armed with ballistic missiles 
since the april 26 1986 explosion and fire at the chernobyl 
nuclear power plant in the ukraine that killed at least 31 people 
and sent a cloud of radiation into the atmosphere soviet people 
have become wary of nuclear power both on land and at sea 
in november the nuclear powered icebreaker rossiya pulled into 
murmansk near the border with finland for the routine changing of 
a filter in one of its two pressurized reactors 
a report in the newspaper vodny transport four months after the 
incident said the routine job almost turned into a disastrous 
nuclear meltdown 
according to the report the chief physicist aboard the ship 
gave incorrect instructions to a reactor operator who in turn 
drained vital cooling water from operating reactor rather than the 
one shut down for the repairs 
had the water drained 30 minutes longer a meltdown releasing 
radiation into the air over the city of 440000 people would have 
occurred the newspaper said the situation was liquidated in 
four minutes the newspapers murmansk correspondent said 
three days later the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said two 
cities and a region in the soviet far east refused entry to a 
nuclearpowered merchant ship sevmorput which had reported 
fractures in its hull 
a deficit of information piled on top of the invisible shadow 
of the chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation 
in the region detonated a powerful explosion of public 
indignation the newspaper said 
officials claimed that the hull fractures presented no danger to 
the nuclear plant on the ship but the public was not assured at 
last report the ship was still anchored off vladivostok its fate 
undecided 
refusal of officials in the ports of vladivostok and nakhodka 
and the region of magadan highlighted a groundswell of public 
opposition to nuclear power that began with the chernobyl disaster 
the policy of glasnost or openness initiated by president 
mikhail s gorbachev has resulted in a growing vocal opposition to 
nuclear power 
officials scrapped plans to build six nuclear power stations 
because of safety concerns another plant in armenia was closed 
after the dec 7 earthquake that killed 25000 people prompted 
fears of a nuclear disaster 
although the sinking of a nuclear submarine off the coast of 
norway did not affect public safety in the soviet union it 
reinforced concerns about the safety of nuclear power 
with those concerns in mind officials have apparently changed 
the course of the countrys ambitious nuclear program 
previously nuclear stations were concentrated in populous 
regions in the eastern part of the country hydroelectric plants 
now will be built to supply local power and nuclear stations will 
be constructed in remote regions where they will pose little danger 
to the public

scores of thousands of prochoice activists 
including a huge array of hollywood superstars have thronged into 
the capital for a march sunday billed as the largest demonstration 
ever in favor of abortion rights 
tomorrow is only a beginning declared molly yard president 
of the national organization for women it is a statement to 
president bush and to the supreme court that the women of this 
country are not going back 
at a news conference at which she and other march organizers 
were cheered by dozens of show business personalities ms yard 
added at last the majority of this country is going to stand up 
for our rights to control our reproductive lives 
she predicted a turnout that would easily more than double 
the size of a similar march in washington three years ago police 
estimated that crowd at 90000 
kate michelman director of the national abortion rights league 
declined to predict a number but said ill tell you this i 
think were going to close washington down 
the march launches an intensified campaign by the prochoice 
community to cement public opinion in favor of a womens right to 
abortion as the supreme court nears a major challenge to its 
landmark 1973 decision roe vs wade that legalized the procedure 
the new case is scheduled for argument april 26 
actress morgan fairchild among 250 show business personalities 
participating in the march and related events said we are here 
to support the majority in this country who believe that americans 
can be trusted to make their own decisions about reproductive 
health care without interference from government at any level we 
believe that we the people rather than the politicians should 
control our most intimate decisions 
we recognize that we may have been to complacent said ms 
fairchild in 1973 we thought this issue had been put to 
rest we thought that our years of risking infection sterility and 
death itself were finally over we thought that american women 
would no longer die each year from botched illegal abortions we 
thought we and our daughters were safe 
but with the pending missouri case before a more conservative 
court we are relearning what thomas jefferson taught this 
country more than 200 years ago eternal vigilance is the price of 
liberty she said 
among those joining the hollywood delegation were karen akers 
ellen burstyn glenn close jane fonda bonnie franklin lee grant 
veronica hamel mariel hemingway margot kidder michelle lee 
melissa manchester kelly mcgillis an 8monthpregnant susan 
sarandon and cybill shepherd 
the new campaign includes the nationwide distribution of a 
videotape abortion for survival aimed at countering the 
antiabortion movements trademark video silent scream 
the prochoice production includes footage of a woman undergoing 
an abortion to show the procedure is safe and simple and 
includes at look at the almost indiscernible remains taken from the 
uterus in a firsttrimester abortion 
the videotape puts it where its at said eleanor smeal 
president of the fund for the feminist majority it talks about 
abortion as a public health necessity and essential for the 
wellbeing of millions of american women 
it features the central issue of this debate what is 
abortion why its needed and why the public health and medical 
establishment of our society and worldwide is for keeping it 
legal 
the tape is being distributed to government officials and 
members of congress and state legislatures as well as on college 
campuses nationwide she said 
march organizers said other parts of their campaign include 
applying pressure on government agencies and pharmaceutical 
companies to improve available contraception and standing up to 
operation rescues attempts to close down abortion clinics 
president bush told antiabortion activists a few days after he 
moved into the oval office that he wanted the supreme courts 1973 
decision overturned 
march organizers said participants included tens of thousands of 
students from about 500 colleges many of them in the northeast as 
well as delegations from churches labor unions and other groups 
the weather forecast called for sunny skies moderate breezes and 
temperatures in the 60s by the noon start 
a counterdemonstration death march by antiabortion 
advocates was expected to draw about 300 people according to 
olivia gans director of american victims of abortion our 
organization is here to support equal rights for unborn women 
specifically the right to life she said 
the march route of the prochoice demonstrators will take them 
past a field of 4400 white crosses erected by antiabortion 
activists near the capitol symbolizing the number of abortions 
performed on an average day

the mushrooming political spending habits of 
special interest groups moderated during the last election cycle 
but still reached a record 3496 million a federal agency said 
saturday 
spending by 4828 political action committees rose 5 percent 
during 1987 and 1988 over what it had been for the previous 
twoyear cycle according to figures compiled by the federal 
election commission 
by comparison that 1985 and 1986 spending had represented a 22 
percent jump over the prior reporting period 1983 and 1984 
democrats who control both houses of congress benefit most 
from the generosity of the special interests according to the 
commissions figures the groups tend to favor incumbents and 
incumbents tend to win reelection 
the tilt toward incumbents and away from challengers increased 
this year and that bothers common cause a lobbying group that has 
opposed the political systems growing dependence on money from 
political action committees 
these committees also known as pacs are a legal device that 
under the sponsorship of corporations labor unions and other 
organizations are allowed to raise large sums of money and channel 
it into political campaigns 
under federal law a pac can give five times as much money to a 
particular candidate as can an individual 
while a pac can give a candidate up to 5000 for each primary 
runoff and general election an individual can give only 1000 in 
each instance 
in 1987 and 1988 some 12 billion overall was spent on 
campaigns for congress and president including money from the 
federal government individuals political parties and pacs of 
that total the pacs accounted for about 28 percent according to 
figures compiled by the election commission 
during 198788 the pacs put 74 percent of their money on 
incumbents while in the previous twoyear period 68 percent of the 
money went to people already in office according to the 
commissions study challengers reaped 12 percent of the pac money 
in the last election while 14 percent got it for their races in 
1986 
common cause spokesman randy huwa said the pac money spent on 
congressional winners also rose last year 
that went up from 101 million in 1986 to 122 million in 
1988 he said so members who were elected in 1988 are more 
indebted to pacs than any class in history so i dont see that 
necessarily as indicating that pac growth is slowing 
in addition to giving money directly to candidates the pacs can 
spend an unlimited amount on behalf of a candidate for example by 
producing and airing television commercials the law requires that 
these efforts must not be controlled by or coordinated with the 
candidates campaign organization 
these independent expenditures amounted to 202 million in 
1988 up from 94 million in 1986 according to the commission 
almost all of that increase came from one pac the national 
security political action committee a conservative organization 
that zoomed to the top of the charts in spending last year with 
outlays of some 103 million 
according to the election commissions records nearly 81 
million of that was spent for the benefit of george bush 
however the tone of the groups advertisements and its methods 
of fund raising caused bushs campaign to disavow it publicly and 
to file a formal complaint against it

south africa said saturday it has 
rejected a un ceasefire plan designed to halt the hostilities in 
northern namibia that threaten the territorys independence 
in a letter released saturday south african foreign minister 
pik botha dismissed an offer by un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar for amending a regional peace accord signed in december 
by south africa angola and cuba 
officials from those three countries as well as us and soviet 
observers held emergency talks into saturday night at mount etjo 
a safari lodge about 120 miles north of windhoek namibias 
capital there was no immediate comment from those officials 
the meeting was held in a bid to stop the fighting and preserve 
a unsupervised independence plan agreed to in december that 
plan took effect april 1 
de cuellars proposal suggested that swapo guerrillas who 
reportedly have entered namibia in violation of the peace accord 
be given two choices botha said 
the guerrillas should be allowed to keep their arms and be 
escorted to swapo bases in neighboring angola or they could lay 
down their arms and stay in namibia as civilians he said 
botha rejected the amendment saying the guerrillas must 
surrender their weapons and be taken to bases in angola 
south africa says swapo has sent more than 1900 guerrillas into 
northern namibia since april 1 in violation of the peace accord 
which requires the insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles 
inside angola 
swapo maintains that the insurgents were inside namibia before 
april 1 and will not return to angola 
since then at least 262 guerrillas of the southwest africa 
peoples organization and 28 members of the south africanled 
security forces have been killed in the heaviest fighting of the 
territorys 23year war police said 
swapo officials outside namibia have disputed the figures and 
say many civilians also have been killed there were no reports of 
battles on saturday and officials said they believed guerrillas 
were running low on supplies 
on friday the un security council said it was satisfied that 
south africa still sought to grant independence to the territory it 
has ruled since world war i 
some un officials suggested swapo field commanders mistakenly 
thought their units could return to namibia and set up bases there 
several captured guerrillas have said they returned to namibia in 
search of un personnel and expected no confrontations with 
security forces 
the un has authorized 4650 peacekeeping troops for namibia 
but less than 1000 have arrived of that total the only forces in 
the northern battle areas are about 300 logistical personnel 
swapo has been favored to win preindependence elections 
scheduled for november under the un plan 
the december accord by south africa cuba and angola called for 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops who have helped marxist angola 
battle usbacked rebels south africa agreed to stop supporting 
the rebels and pledged independence for namibia

helicopters buzzed overhead and 
hundreds of police and soldiers patrolled the streets saturday 
after dispersing 1500 antiamerican protesters commemorating last 
years burning of the us consulate 
troops will impede with force if necessary any protests 
against our democratic institutions and the lives of hondurans 
armed forces spokesman col manuel suarez benavides said at a 
news conference 
our forces will stay in the streets until we are sure that no 
disorder will occur he said 
police on friday night used truncheons and water hoses to 
disperse protesters who burned us flags and shouted 
antiamerican slogans in tegucigalpa 
the consulate was burned last year in a week of violent 
antiamerican protests that began after reputed drug kingpin juan 
ramon matta was extradited to the united states four hondurans 
died and 1000 were jailed in those protests and the government 
declared a 10day state of emergency 
under the honduran constitution no citizen can be extradited or 
forced to leave the country against his will but matta was 
captured on april 5 1988 by honduran authorities and two days 
later was extradited to the united states he is serving a 
threeyear sentence at the federal prison in marion ill for 
escaping from a florida prison in 1971 
matta allegedly is linked to colombias medellin drug cartel 
which reportedly controls 80 percent of cocaine traffic to the 
united states 
the demonstrations friday also were to protest us military 
presence in honduras 
since 1982 the united states and honduras have intensified 
military maneuvers provided for under a 1954 treaty in the past 
nine years more than 100000 us soldiers have come to honduras 
to train the 20000member honduran armed forces

with national elections 
looming three white antiapartheid parties merged saturday in 
hopes of boosting their collectively sagging fortunes 
the formation of the new democratic party is an attempt to 
broaden the political base of white liberals who have suffered 
repeated setbacks in recent years 
the party commits itself to the establishment of a genuine 
south african democracy which rejects race as its basis and 
protects the human dignity and liberty of all its citizens said 
willem de klerk a leading member of the new party 
the first major test for the democratic party will come in this 
years parliamentary elections expected between late july and 
early september president pw botha announced the election 
thursday but he has yet to set an exact date 
the democratic party will have three leaders who served as the 
heads of the merging parties they are zac de beer of the 
progressive federal party wynand malan of the national democratic 
movement and denis worrall of the independent party 
at a rally in johannesburg party leaders said they oppose all 
forms of apartheid support a free enterprise economic system and 
want increased emphasis on individual rights 
the organization seeks to attract voters disillusioned with 
bothas national party and its inability to break the blackwhite 
political stalemate 
the democratic party indicated it wants to work closely with 
blacks who have no vote in national affairs however the 
organization made clear that it rejects the violence employed 
african national congress the main black guerrilla group 
attempting to undermine the government 
democracy can never be built on the foundation of bombs 
said de beer the anc must end the campaign of symbolic terror 
the new party has drawn little attention from black 
organizations many of whom see white liberals as politically 
ineffective 
the liberal left in this country has not done much to make the 
government change apartheid said city press a leading 
blackoriented newspaper until such time that were all allowed 
to vote the new democratic party is just another white affair 
the progressive federal party had 17 of the 178 seats in the 
white chamber of parliament while the national democratic movement 
had three and the independent party none 
bothas national party which has ruled south africa for 41 
years maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats 
the extremeright conservative party is the official opposition 
with 24 seats 
botha announced his intention to step down after the election 
south africas tricameral parliament has separate houses for 
whites asians and people of mixedrace but not for the nations 
28million black majority 
white liberal parties draw their support almost exclusively from 
the major urban areas such as johannesburg cape town and durban 
and they have been losing some support in recent years 
the conservative party overtook the progressive federal party in 
1987 elections to become the leading opposition 
the progressive federal party was formed in 1959 and one of its 
founding members helen suzman has been a member of parliament 
since 1953 ms suzman one of the countrys bestknown 
antiapartheid campaigners said she would not hold any official 
position in the democratic party

about 200 police backed by helicopters and 
dogs searched saturday for six inmates who fled an overcrowded jail 
by sawing through the bars on a window and shimmying over a 
razorsharp fence 
thirteen inmates clad in prison green escaped friday night but 
two were captured a few hours after the escape and five others were 
nabbed on saturday 
helicopters hovered over snowdusted hills and search dogs 
sniffed along abandoned wharves while police combed streets and 
alleys 
the inmates including seven awaiting trial and six convicted of 
charges ranging from theft to armed robbery escaped in a group 
from the norfolk county house of correction where chronic 
overcrowding and racial tensions have fueled several outbreaks of 
violence in recent months 
sheriff clifford marshall said authorities viewed the break as 
inevitable because of the jails crumbling structures and its 
dangerous mixture of inmates 
the population of the 173yearold granite fortress is at any 
given time likely to include mass murderers and accused burglars 
teenagers and hardened older inmates drugs users and those with 
communicable diseases 
the stifling conditions likely drove the men some of whom had 
as few as 30 days left to serve to commit the felony break that 
could put them back in jail for up to 10 years marshall said 
it certainly can drive people to drastic things he said 
the facility houses 240 prisoners the federally ordered cap is 
172 but corrections officials have had to house inmates in the 
boiler room and the recreation hall 
someone outside the jail probably tossed hacksaws over the 
15foot brick wall marshall said cutting through the old prison 
bars would not have been difficult he said 
the bars are so brittle that the jails deputies routinely 
strike them with rubber hammers checking for a sound that 
indicates they have been sawed through 
in february the jail was forced to undergo a fiveday lockdown 
after an outbreak of violence marshall said

homicide detectives rank high 
among the types of workers most in need of a sense of humor to help 
lighten a difficult profession so someone concocted a slogan 
slapped it on a button and voila our day begins when yours 
ends 
thats the serious point behind humor how it can relieve 
stress for joel goodman founder and director of the humor 
project 
the group is sponsoring its fourth annual national conference 
this weekend on the positive power of humor and creativity it 
drew hundreds of participants from as far away as australia 
hawaii sweden and singapore 
one myth is that humor equals joketelling goodman told an 
auditorium packed to capacity with educators and business people 
health care workers chaplains consultants and administrators 
humor is not always appropriate but its more appropriate than 
people realize 
but this is not some bunch of jokers brought together to have a 
laugh even though consummate funnyman jay leno took a break from 
his tonight show guest duties and touring to perform for the 
group during the opening session friday 
the conference aims to help folks deal with stress in the home 
and workplace find ways to be creative and also to take their 
jobs seriously but themselves lightly goodman said 
for the bankers managers engineers and tycoons there also are 
workshops to help them use humor as a management tool as a way 
of improving the corporate culture goodman said 
theres a lot of pressure in business to be more creative to 
find better ways to increase productivity said jane conner who 
owns centerpoint associates a management training and consulting 
firm in austin texas 
she said she often runs across managers who are challenged 
beyond the skills and techniques that they have to handle those 
challenges 
if they can laugh a little bit its just another way to look 
at a problem and deal with stress she said 
goodman has several theories about the power of humor and he 
says everyone has an innate sense of humor thats often covered 
over by years of misuse 
but even if we missed the boat when that quality was handed 
out we can still develop it goodman told his audience of 1000 
on friday 
he offered examples of humor from everyday life adding that 
nothing is quite as funny as the unintended humor of reality 
take for instance the notice that appeared on a church 
bulletin board alerting parishioners to the sermons for the day and 
evening services 
930 am jesus walks on water 530 pm searching for 
jesus 
or how about the sign on a hospital bulletin board 
research shows that the first 5 minutes of life can be most 
risky penciled underneath the last 5 minutes aint so hot 
either 
guffaws abounded as goodman strutted across the stage much like 
a professional comedian 
humor is a way of maintaining control he said as another 
crop of oneliners began to build 
its a great way of building relationships 
its a great way of ending them

iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini on saturday ordered that aid to troops at the ceasefire 
line with iraq be discontinued within six months tehran radio 
reported 
khomeinis order is the first indication iran plans to cut its 
forces along the 670mile border with iraq since the countries 
halted their eightyear persian gulf war with a ceasefire in 
august 
deplete supplies within six months and end the work the 
radio quoted khomeini as saying in a letter to hojatoleslam 
mohammad ali rahmani head of the committee responsible for sending 
aid to the forces at the front 
the 88yearold revolutionary patriarch appeared to be referring 
to border supplies the government solicited from private citizens 
the radio statement monitored in nicosia was unclear whether 
khomeini wanted the supply program stopped for all armed forces or 
just the voluntary units known as the basij 
un observers monitor the ceasefire but separate 
unsponsored talks for a permanent peace have made no significant 
progress 
khomeinis directive follows meetings thursday between iranian 
foreign ministry officials and un officials to lay the groundwork 
for a new round of peace talks between irans foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati and his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz 
velayati and aziz have agreed to hold a new round of talks in 
the near future at an undisclosed site near un headquarters but 
no date or exact venue has been set 
the talks deadlocked over irans insistence that iraqi troops 
withdraw from iranian territory while iraq insists that the first 
step should be the clearing of the shatt alarab waterway

communist guerrillas said saturday 
they captured eight mountain climbers including three foreigners 
on the countrys tallest peak to check if any were military 
informants 
the menardo arce command a guerrilla unit of the communist new 
peoples army operating in southern mindanao said they also 
detained the climbers also to protect them from rebel mines 
but they said the three foreigners and the five filipinos 
captured tuesday will be released soon because interrogation 
showed they were not spies 
more than 300 climbers were on 9690foot mount apo for a 
mountaineering convention 
the presence of foreigners in the area gave us reason to 
suspect they were sent by the enemies in order to spy or study the 
terrain all in the guise of mountain climbing the command 
said in a statement 
the statement said the foreigners included gerald leo 
christopher kennedy of ireland new zealander trevor james anderson 
and james andrew smart of britain 
the group apologized for the detention but said it was necessary 
for the best interest of the mountain climbers 
to protect it the area from enemy troops we had earlier 
installed various defense mechanisms including booby traps and 
land mines in several strategic points of the mountain trail it 
said 
the rebel command said mount apo is part of rebel territory and 
any person entering the area should first ask for their permission 
tuesdays incident was reported to the military only friday 
said maj antonio inciong regional chief of the militarys civil 
relations service 
among the detained filipinos was the rev vic dimaranan a roman 
catholic priest inciong added 
the climbers who trekked to the mountain were attending the 
annual convention of the philippine national mountaineering 
federation inciong said 
the staterun philippine news agency said the climbers were met 
by some 100 guerrillas near tudaya falls on the outskirts of the 
village of baracatan

negotiators at world trade talks on saturday 
settled a dispute over textile exports and other issues that had 
held up a 2year effort to liberalize global commerce a spokesman 
said 
delegates adopted the accord in a closed session said david 
woods a spokesman for the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
in washington us trade representative carla hills said that 
a stalemate that has dogged the negotiations has been broken 
negotiators were deadlocked in efforts to achieve a major 
revision in the gatt under the uruguay round of talks which began 
in 1986 and are to run through 1990 the accord reached saturday 
will serve as a framework for further negotiations 
gatt regulates world trade treaties and settles commerce 
disputes 
the accord signed by 100 countries includes settlements of 
disputes over farm supports textiles intellectual property such 
as patents and safeguards against sudden surges in imports 
officials said 
settlements in the other 11 areas of negotiations were reached 
in december at a meeting in montreal 
on friday the european economic community announced it had 
reached an agreement with the united states on the issue of farm 
supports the settlement became possible after washington dropped 
its insistence on the elimination of all farm subsidies 
the agreement calls for an overall freeze on farm supports and 
import barriers through 1990 it calls for countries to reduce 
their subsidies in 1990 but does not specify by how much 
ms hills said she hoped the accord would result in a gradual 
correction in the ustrade imbalance in the context of export 
expansion rather than import contraction 
under another agreement reached saturday delegates resolved eec 
objections to earlier draft language that the 12nation group said 
would remove textile and clothing barriers too rapidly the 
agreement calls for further negotiations will be held later this 
month 
developing countries with large textile industries want liberal 
regulations industrialized countries such as the united states and 
eec members are concerned about the impact a lack of restrictions 
might have on domestic industries

an oil drilling platform with a 300ton 
crane flipped over in heavy seas as it was being towed but 
officials said saturday the rig contained very little oil and there 
was no threat of a leak 
no one was injured when the five sisters platform overturned 
friday 65 miles southeast of charleston on the edge of the 
continental shelf said seth tane owner of carolina sea service 
the company in charge of the salvage 
the platform was unmanned at the time of the accident tane said 
i feel fairly certain the rig is salvageable tane said he 
said he would work with fred devine diving and salvage a portland 
ore company that worked in salvaging the tanker exxon valdez in 
alaska 
high seas were preventing the salvage from beginning saturday 
he said 
the platform contained 500 gallons of lubricants said tane 
quoting the platforms owners maitland brothers inc of 
littlestown pa he earlier had reported the vessel was carrying 
10000 gallons of fuel oil and that there was danger of a spill 
there has been no sign of oil in the water tane said 
the platform resembles a huge cake pan with four legs that 
extend 95 feet into the air and 80 feet into the sea below the 
legs can be extended to reach the floor of the sea for drilling 
operations 
the platform was being towed by two tugboats from puerto rico to 
boston where it was to be used in an underwater pipeline project 
tane said 
on friday the tug captain released the 2inch cables that 
bound the tugs to the platform because he was worried about the 
stability of his vessel amid 12 to 14foot seas tane said the 
platform then overturned tane said 
stormy weather forced the submerged platform further out to sea

even though the reagan administration vowed it 
wasnt helping the contras in defiance of congress wishes the 
government now admits that president reagan george shultz william 
casey and dozens of others were leaning on other countries to give 
the nicaraguan rebels arms and money 
using code names like tipped kettle ii elephant herd 
and focal point us officials praised cajoled warned and 
admonished other governments in the massive secret effort to keep 
the contra movement alive 
details of the effort were laid out in an extraordinary document 
read into the record thursday in the trial of oliver north the 
fired national security council aide accused of breaking the law in 
efforts to help the nicaraguan rebels the government and norths 
attorneys agreed that the facts in the document are true 
the outlines of this armtwisting effort had emerged in previous 
news reports and in the congressional investigation into the 
irancontra case but the extent of the governments efforts and 
the number of individuals who were aware of them are described for 
the first time in the summary of facts 
the document names at least 40 us officials incluing 
president bush then reagans vice president who were aware of 
the clandestine efforts to get assistance for the contras 
including during the 198485 period when congress blocked direct 
and indirect us aid to the rebels and into 1986 when only 
nonlethal aid was allowed 
norths defense hinges on the argument he orchestrated the 
efforts at the orders of white house superiors that proposition is 
bolstered by the court document in which 107 points of fact are 
asserted 
those facts show the aid efforts took bizarre turns 
longtime enemies taiwan and the peoples republic of china were 
both approached to aid the contras apparently the meeting with the 
representative of the communist government was under fbi 
surveillance because the document says the fbi was asked to keep 
its report on the meeting secret 
in another apparent case of the government watching itself the 
document said the white house and the cia learned of reports of 
a meeting between an israeli government official and michael 
armacost then undersecretary of state for political affairs to 
discuss israeli help for the contras 
and north met with panamanian strongman manuel noriega who 
offered to kill sandinista leaders if the united states would help 
him clean up his image north rejected the assassination proposal 
but said noriega might help in sabotage in nicaragua the reagan 
administration later indicted noriega in connection with drug 
dealing 
the court documents 107 points center on reagan administration 
efforts to enlist other countries in the contra effort in 
particular major pressure was applied to get nicaraguas four 
closest neighbors el salvador honduras costa rica and 
guatemala to provide arms facilitate weapons deliveries and 
allow their territory to be used for support operations 
quid pro quo arrangements abounded 
reagan depicted as taking an active role in thirdcountry 
solicitation was told in february 1985 that honduras needed some 
enticementsso that it would maintain its aid to the 
resistance said a memo from thennational security adviser 
robert mcfarlane 
subsequently the president personally authorized the entire 
plan in which the hondurans were to receive expedited economic 
aid and military assistance in exchange for helping the contras 
the court summary says 
bush is cited as an emissary from the white house to honduras 
carrying word in march 1985 to thenpresident roberto suazo that 
reagan would speed us aid to his country 
while reagan was telephoning and sending messages to suazo 
urging that he do all in his power to support those who struggle 
for freedom and democracy state department officials publicly 
were sounding a different tone they assured congressional hearings 
that the government view was that solicitation of third countries 
was illegal under the ongoing aid ban 
later in 1985 the hondurans again were waffling annoyed that 
they were being put upon 
they were upset that promised us aid had not come through and 
were particularly angry that the us embassy there had recently 
denied any connection with the resistance referring inquiries to 
representatives of honduras the court summary said 
by early 1986 the importance of getting honduran cooperation 
for the secret contra air resupply network led to plans for bush to 
play a major role in pressuring the new president jose azcona 
the document does not say whether bush ultimately carried it 
out but cites a state department memo prepared for a bush meeting 
with azcona with the honduran expected to insist on getting 
clear economic and social benefits from its cooperation with the 
united states 
bush was to emphasize the importance of keeping the contras 
strong while national security adviser john poindexter would meet 
privately with azcona to seek a commitment for honduran support of 
the contras the document said 
the late cia director william casey also is depicted as playing 
a key role in bringing other countries into the contraaid business 
in mid july of 1984 he told his deputy john mcmahon and deputy 
secretary of state kenneth dam that those present ought to get 
moving on nonus funding for the rebels in light of attorney 
gen william french smiths ruling that such fundraising would not 
be an impeachable offense a fear that had been raised by then 
white house chief of staff james a baker iii baker is now bushs 
secretary of state 
smiths ruling stated that thirdcountry solicitation was 
acceptable only if there was no quid pro quo 
as early as august of 1984 shortly after congress cut off us 
aid to the rebels secretary shultz was proposing a plan to wink 
at lethal support for the resistance according to the document 
the idea was that the united states would give arms to el salvador 
which in turn would give arms to the contras 
in his testimony to the congressional irancontra investigating 
committees however shultz had said he opposed soliciting third 
countries that were major us aid recipients 
if contra supporters were rewarded then the reagan white house 
took the opposite view of those who didnt cooperate 
in the case of costa rica its new president oscar arias was a 
persona non grata in washington after his government revealed in 
september 1986 the existence of the santa elena airstrip which his 
predecessor had sanctioned for use by the contra supply operation 
north recommended cancellation of a planned arias visit to the 
white house because of the santa elena disclosure 
conversely north got reagan to agree in march 1986 to pose for 
a photo opportunity with costa rican official benjamin piza 
who had arranged for construction of the santa elena airstrip 
in 1986 the guatemalans were seeking new us recognition for 
their assistance to the contras 
after meeting with guatemalan president vinicio cerezo in 
september 1986 the court document says a us official informed 
reagan bush shultz secretary of defense caspar weinberger and 
poindexter that in return for guatemalan support for the 
resistance cerezo would ask secretary of state shultz to triple 
military assistance ot guatemala to double economic assistance to 
guatemala and to undertake other forms of support for guatemala 
north had recommended in march 1985 that additional military aid 
be sent to guatemala as a means of compensating guatemala for the 
assistance it was providing to the resistance the court document 
said 
guatemala had a valuable role as provider of phony end user 
certificates that certified it was the recipient of 8 million 
worth of weapons shipments that actually were going to the rebels

sales of challenger license plates 
have already paid for a memorial to the shuttles seven astronauts 
and are helping to fund future trips to mars state officials say 
the design on the license plate features the space shuttle 
rising on an orangeandwhite cloud into a blue sky it was 
conceived in the months following the 1986 shuttle explosion in 
which the seven lost their lives 
the plates costing an extra 15 went on sale in january 1987 
more than 500000 people have bought or renewed the plates 
bringing in 5 million in 1987 and about 45 million last year 
the state legislature designated a quarter of the money for 
scholarships and another quarter for the florida technical research 
and development authority to research manned missions to mars 
the rest is going to build and maintain the memorial at the 
kennedy space center 
to bring in 5 million in one year from these tags without 
any advertising or promotion boggles my mind says ben everidge 
head of the astronauts memorial foundation in titusville we had 
no idea the tags would take off like that 
the 5 million memorial to be inaugurated in october is 50 by 
40 feet and will rotate to follow the sun the names of the seven 
challenger astronauts along with the three killed in the apollo 
fire and four who died in training accidents were etched by laser

a survey to find out what the public 
considers obscene may be too obscene for city sponsorship some 
city council members say 
i read just the first two questions and realized that some of 
the very things we are trying to take off the shelves are now going 
out as part of our questions council member bob long said friday 
the draft version of a questionnaire reviewed by city officials 
thursday asks people their opinions of 15 sexual acts ranging from 
heterosexual intercourse to bestiality 
the purpose of the survey is to define contemporary community 
standards as an aid in prosecuting pornographers 
but council members are nervous 
this is not what i understood the intent to be said council 
member janice rettman when a woman from the polling firm stood 
up in committee some time ago and read off a bunch of questions 
they were pretty innocuous not about three people on a couch 
this sounds almost like were sending out pornography ourselves 
council president jim scheibel wants each council member to 
study the draft questionnaire prepared by minnesota opinion 
research inc of minneapolis he then wants the council to vote on 
it one more time probably next week before the poll goes to the 
public

authorities on saturday said at least 
three nurses killed dozens of patients with overdoses of insulin 
and other medication 
franz priessnitz a senior police official involved in the 
investigation told austrian television the nurses killed the 
patients for a kind of euthanasia he said among those killed 
were patients they considered disagreeable 
but the fact that they were most seriously ill always played a 
role the official said adding we have so far 30 to 32 cases 
of killing patients 
initial reports said the killings took place over the past year 
but police gave no specific time frame 
the three women were arrested for questioning friday and 
guenter boegl the vienna police chief said saturday that they had 
confessed boegl said more people could be apprehended 
no formal charges were filed by late saturday 
euthanasia a method of causing painless death is advocated by 
some as a way to deal with people suffering from incurable painful 
diseases 
josef siska head of the homicide squad told austrian radio 
earlier saturday the killing of the patients at viennas lainz 
hospital not only consisted of the administration of medication 
but did not elaborate 
priessnitz said a 30yearold nurse was suspected of killing up 
to 20 patients the other two nurses were 25 and 27 years old the 
austria press agency reported quoting unconfirmed reports 
priessnitz said the three nurses did not act jointly but 
separately although it was not clear what each knew of the others 
criminal acts 
boegl said all three nurses made confessions which differ 
essentially only as to the number of possible victims 
alois stacher viennas municipal health councilman notified 
police after doctors found that a patient had recently received an 
overdose of insulin that could have been mortal the patient 
survived stacher told austrian television friday

shifting wind set oil from the exxon 
valdez on a collision course for the nations no 1 fishing port 
while the pentagon on saturday sent a special team and equipment to 
help clean up the giant slick 
wind from the southeast and northeast pushed oil toward kodiak 
island 300 miles from the site of the nations worst oil spill two 
weeks ago the direction of the crude raised fears that the port 
town of kodiak which last year had 166 million worth of catches 
could be polluted within days officials said 
geographically kodiak is downwind of the oil area if there 
are east winds national weather service meteorologist dan keeton 
said 
the stricken tanker meanwhile was sitting dead calm in a flat 
sea saturday with a halfdozen smaller boats clustered around it 
steam drifting from its stack a radar arm rotating and a 
helicopter on its deck the exxon valdez is in a protected cove for 
emergency repairs 
an orange boom designed to contain any leaking oil encircled the 
987foot tanker in every direction beyond the boom however long 
streamers of congealed oil the color of chocolate milk drifted off 
for miles 
on friday president bush said he would send federal troops to 
help with the cleanup and put the federal government virtually in 
control of the effort bush insisted however that we are not 
federalizing this operation 
the new federal authority was apparent saturday as the coast 
guard began to move into a command center set up by exxon in a 
valdez office building 
i think we had a problem with organization thats what 
frustrated everybody said rear adm edward nelson jr the 
commander of the coast guards alaskan district we now see a 
clean line of whats going to go on 
some defense department equipment was already arriving 
including navy skimmers and oil containment booms 
a pentagon assessment team made up of engineering 
environmental medical and logistical personnel from bases in 
alaska hawaii and washington dc assembled at the alaskan air 
command it was scheduled to begin work sunday 
meanwhile however confusion complaints and equipment problems 
continued to characterize the cleanup 
at sawmill bay where workers have been struggling for a week to 
hold oil away from four salmon hatcheries a shipment of 
containment booms from the us navy turned out to be only half of 
the 16000 feet promised and only 24 inches deep instead of 41 
inches 
with favorable weather however 41inch booms wont be 
necessary prince william sound aquaculture corp spokesman bruce 
suzumoto said 
fishermen and merchants of the nearby fishing community of 
cordova said exxon has been slow to process claims including 
compensation for cleanup expenses and the loss of the 12 million 
herring season 
cordova remains a forgotten town said rs kopchek a local 
fisherman we are the people who are hurt the most 
the department of fish and game said oil has been spotted about 
five miles from esther bay site of worlds largest salmon 
hatchery esther bay is about 50 miles wst of valdez and north of 
sawmill bay 
fish and game officials also announced that autopsies on two 
deer originally said to have been killed by oil showed one death 
caused by old age and the other by stress 
in kodiak officials have begun daily meetings to make 
contingency plans and have expressed concern that there wont be 
enough oil containment supplies left for that part of alaska the 
state has transferred some managers of its cleanup at valdez to 
kodiak to begin making preparations for a cleanup there 
were going to try to get down there and break it up if 
possible nelson said 
nelson said authorities were sending herring boats with nets and 
coast guard cutters with water cannons to try to break up the 
winddriven oil before it reaches kodiak 
the weather was better around valdez high pressure that has 
brought a week of favorable weather to the prince william sound 
area appears to be holding off encroaching fronts that threatened 
to blow oil into untainted shorelines and hatcheries 
the wind pattern created by the highpressure ridge has pushed 
much of the oil away from land and into the gulf of alaska where 
it is more likely to break up 
this has been miracle weather said michelle hahn oleary a 
member of the cordova district fishermen united 
oil has already traveled over a 3000squaremile area so far 
only an estimated 16000 barrels about 7 percent of the 240000 
barrels spilled has been sopped and vacuumed up a barrel is 42 
gallons 
the disaster has killed thousands of birds and sea otters along 
the central alaskan coast cost fishermen millions of dollars in 
lost catch and continues to threaten valuable salmon fisheries 
as the defense department worked to set up its cleanup effort 
others continued theirs 
though alaska officials had complained exxons handling of the 
cleanup was too bureaucratic and too slow the oil company will 
continue to provide materials manpower and money 
fishermen in prince william sound who have spent the past two 
weeks defending four salmon fisheries hoped to use new skimmers 
and booms to attack oil trapped in dozens of bays and inlets in the 
sound 
the plan is to boom in the oil in places like snug harbor and 
herring bay and then bring in the skimmers to collect the oil 
said rick steiner a state adviser to the cordova fishermens union 
doug mertz an assistant state attorney general said a review 
of state and federal law indicates exxon and alyeska pipeline 
service co the operator of the transalaska oilpipeline 
terminal could face fines exceeding 700 million as a result of 
the accident in which the exxon valdez rammed a reef 
an environmental group in alaska said friday it had received the 
states blessing to establish a fund to assist in the volunteer 
wildlife effort and to monitor exxons cleanup progress 
state officials issued an emergency order friday to alyeska 
directing it to correct problems with its oilspill response 
program 
alaska wont tolerate any more excuses for not responding to 
an oil spill no matter what the size gov steve cowper said 
the order requires alyeska to replace a 12member spill response 
crew disbanded several years ago acquire by may 15 the best 
available equipment and prepare by june 1 a revised 
spillcontingency plan for state approval 
alyeska has seven days to respond the company on thursday 
announced its own new plans which include tug boat escorts and 
random drug and alcohol testing

that hazelwood constantly appeared to be intoxicated when 
he was in command of the vessel the boston globe reported saturday 
amero said hazelwood held regular drinking parties in his room 
on board ship and added that he once saw hazelwood throw four 
empty quart bottles of jack daniels whiskey overboard

and his chief mate jack daniels that run the ship he said in 
the deposition 
hazelwood was captain of the exxon valdez on march 24 when it 
crashed into a reef and spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil

operating a ship while intoxicated reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of oil he is free on 25000 bail after

hazelwood falsified the deck logbook about fire and boat drills 
aboard his ships the new york daily news reported saturday

i smelled liquor on him on a number of occasions 
the lawsuit which charges that amero was treated so badly that 
he needed psychiatric treatment is pending

superior officers and other supervisory employes and in particular 
capt joseph hazelwood 
there was no answer saturday at ameros home in new hampshire

lawsuit 
on march 24 hazelwood allegedly turned control of the valdez 
over to a third mate uncertified to pilot the vessel in the waters 
off alaska he was fired by exxon on march 30 after the national 
transportation safety board said tests taken about nine hours after 
the disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol 
amero said his problems with hazelwood began a week after he 
first began working under his command 
i was asleep and he was jumping up and down on his floor one 
evening screaming at me to come up and drink with him he said in 
the deposition quoted in the boston globe he said he refused and 
that hazelwood began harassing him and that a female seaman told 
him that she was sexually harassed by hazelwood

remedies had been taken including the promotion of the two women 
who had not been ranked as full professors 
an investigation found that the university sought more letters 
of recommendation when reviewing one woman associate professor for 
promotion than it does for similarly situated males it also 
determined the college did not develop an adequate maternity leave 
policy to ensure that women faculty would not be penalized for time 
away from work because of childbearing 
these are procedural errors which occured said eddy 
theres no clear and concise proof of any pattern of 
discrimination 
but william rosen faculty union president said the report 
shows uri officials havent unlearned their former practices 
referring to a sex discrimination lawsuit against uri that was 
settled for 13 million in 1985 
theyre jerking people around mainly women he said 
the 14page report was the cullmination of a routine 
investigation of uris affirmative action policies the labor 
departments office of federal contract compliance undertakes such 
reviews when agencies are slated to receive at least 1 million in 
federal grants 
if uri fails to comply with the report the labor department 
could take steps to cut federal funds to the 13000student school 
the grants total more than 30 million in research alone 
eddy said pay adjustments totaling 6365 have been awarded to 
five of the eight women involved and both associate professors 
cited in the report have been promoted eddy said

police in this small fishing town tried 
to determine saturday why a masked gunman entered a courthouse 
annex and opened fire killing a justice of the peace and wounding 
an assistant police chief 
were looking at three motives right now but we havent 
narrowed it down police chief don gullett said saturday he 
wouldnt elaborate 
justice of the peace tj jack dooley 79 was shot once in 
the heart in the attack at about 235 pm friday assistant police 
chief emmitt greene 43 was shot in the upper chest but managed to 
return fire and kill the gunman 
greene remained in serious condition in the intensive care unit 
of the matagorda general hospital in bay city with a bullet lodged 
near his spine gullett said 
the slain gunman was identified as duc nga nguyen 27 from 
garden city kan he had lived in palacios previously and was 
arrested in 1987 for carrying a pistol 
officials estimated nguyen and greene fired up to 20 shots 
during a gun battle that lasted only a few seconds 
residents of palacios 100 miles southwest of houston are 
puzzled over the shooting gullett said 
the city is in shock the vietnamese community is in shock 
he said my phone was ringing off the wall at home last night 
many vietnamese called my wife some called me they are 
apologizing that this took place the community as a whole is 
remorse 
authorities said nguyen had been at the courthouse annex earlier 
in the day to get a drivers license but left when he was told they 
were issued only on wednesdays 
when he returned his face was partly covered by a bandana and 
he held a mauser automatic which discharges bullets about the size 
of those from a 32caliber pistol 
nguyen also wore a backpack that police later learned 
contained adhesive tape string and a device that could be used as 
a bomb detonator the pack also contained three pairs of fake 
handcuffs but no bomb hurta said 
pam gullett the police chiefs wife who works for the county 
tax office and has a desk at the annex said she knew there was 
something wrong as soon as nguyen walked in 
he yelled at me to stand up i asked him what he said and 
then the shooting started she said i ducked into a corner 
hoping that the bullets wouldnt go through the wood 
dooley walked in as nguyen grabbed dwayne koenig 32 who was 
standing by the door authorities said nguyen was telling koenig 
and mrs gullett to lay on the floor when dooley approached them 
and was fatally shot mrs gullett and koenig were unhurt 
greene entered the tax office and ordered nguyen to drop the 
gun the gunman fired at the 13year police department veteran 
hitting him in the upper chest but greene managed to reload his 
45caliber revolver and fire several times striking the gunman in 
the head arm and leg 
dooley had been a justice of the peace for 12 years and was 
planning to travel to rome where he was to meet one of his two 
sons hurta said the two were supposed to have an audience with 
the pope

high pressure over california weakened 
saturday and let ocean air move onshore but temperatures still 
rose to record levels for early spring one person apparently died 
from the heat 
the beach is packed lifeguard randy degregori said as an 
estimated 100000 people stretched out on santa monica beach in 
soothing 77degree air temperatures or took a cold plunge into the 
64degree water 
the crowd is just unbelievable youd think it was the fourth 
of july said lifeguard lt tom hargett at hermosa beach 
watching over part of an estimated 300000 people lining the sands 
of the south santa monica bay 
i had to look at the calendar just to make sure it was 
april he said 
the los angeles civic center temperature hit 89 at noon tying 
the april 8 record high established in 1987 downtown had a 
recordtying 100 on tuesday and record highs of 105 wednesday 106 
thursday and 100 friday 
the heat contributed to the death of a los angeles woman who 
was taken to a hospital with heat exhaustion and later died of a 
heart attack police sgt robert normandy said 
barbara zavaleta 50 of boyle heights died friday evening at 
white memorial medical center he said 
in the desert palm springs baked in 106degree heat and the 
town of thermal fried at 105 by noon elsewhere central and 
southern areas of the state had noon readings in the high 80s and 
90s 
the highest temperatures moved into the inland valleys and to 
the desert as the normal cooling sea breezes reasserted themselves 
and kept most of the coastal highs in the 70s 80s and 90s rather 
than the tripledigit range 
throngs packed the beaches from los angeles to san diego 
throughout the week and lifeguard agencies have had to call in 
their troops to handle crowds rivaling those of summer 
this is an early start degregori said we do get some 
good spring weather but this is something that youd see in the 
first week of july and the end of june 
every day this week and today is no exception weve used 
every man available he said 
lifeguards made hundreds of rescues during the week hargett 
said 
southern california beaches are still uneven from the winter 
waves with deep holes lurking beneath the early spring surf and 
riptides 
weve had rips running 2 3 400 yards out like a freight 
train grabbing people and yanking em right out hargett said 
riptides run opposite to the ordinary flow and can pull people 
seaward 
downtown los angeles got the first indication of a return to 
normal when the overnight low fell to 67 by 5 am saturday the 
first time the temperature had dropped below 70 since tuesday

a soviet flag fluttering over a paper 
factory made some employees see red but organizers of a weekend 
visit to town by five soviet women said saturday the flag was a 
friendly greeting 
international paper co always runs up foreign flags for 
overseas visitors said spokesman gary orielly 
valentina matvienko vice mayor of leningrad and leader of the 
delegation said the women appreciated the gesture and were 
grateful to the citizens of pine bluff for their hospitality and 
friendliness toward our delegation 
employees circulated a petition friday questioning the flying of 
the flag but did not get a response from the plants management 
orielly said he never saw a petition 
paper worker albert bolls said it was upsetting to see the flag 
when he ended his shift friday night 
i dont think there ought to be a russian flag flying over an 
american plant im a veteran and i dont like it russia is a 
communist country and were not bolls said 
another employee cathy yiengst said she understood the gesture 
but didnt think it was necessary i dont think youd see an 
american flag flying in their country she said 
ms matvienko said that when americans visit the soviet union 
we also greet them by putting up their flags and regard it as a 
sign of friendship 
orielly said the firm had flown the flags of delegations from 
other countries including japan and finland when they toured the 
plant 
the women had considered touring the mill on saturday but opted 
instead for shopping at a local mall said marion kahn of the 
sovietamerican womens exchange organizers of the soviet womens 
11day tour of arkansas 
the decision had nothing to do with the workers grumbling about 
the flag ms kahn said 
ms kahn said she hoped the plant workers would look beyond 
differences between the two nations 
i can understand that some people might feel the way they do 
and thats the whole point of the trip for us to get to know each 
other on a persontoperson level ms kahn said 
the flying of the flag is certainly not a political statement 
we are trying to create friendships

local hospital and has received the last rites his doctor said 
saturday 
dr jaime gutierrez said the 83yearold expresident was 
admitted friday night to san juan de dios hospital after suffering 
severe chest pains 
he said figueres is in the coronary unit and we are afraid he 
might die 
another doctor who asked not to be identified by name said 
figueres condition was worsening 
his heart cannot take a pacemaker his situation is worsening 
because he has a pulmonary infection and also has an inflamation in 
a vein in one of his legs the doctor said 
alberto casals a roman catholic priest told reporters at the 
hospital that he had delivered last rites to the man considered by 
many to be the father of democracy in costa rica 
five of figueres six children and his two former wives were at 
the hospital along with some government officials hospital sources 
reported 
an adviser to president oscar arias said the president may cut 
short a trip to canada if figueres condition continues to worsen 
in 1948 after allegedly fraudulent elections figueres went 
into the hills with a band of rebels and led a brief but bloody 
revolution that overthrew president fernando calderon guardia who 
had allied himself with the communist party 
figueres took over as president of a provisional junta for a 
year banning the communists and overseeing the writing of a new 
constitution that provided increased social services 
he also abolished the armed forces making costa rica the only 
nation in latin america and one of the few in the world without 
a military since then costa rica has been central americas most 
enduring democracy

wouldbe scientists who took a wrong 
turn on the road to enlightenment wound up in their own little 
corner at the mecca of knowledge known as mit enshrined in the 
archives of useless research 
the archives a compendium of crackpot theories also known as 
the nut collection preserve 200 books drawings and pamphlets 
by brave laymen who sought to explain things like why life exists 
and allied subjects 
but archivist kathy marquis says the weird science doesnt 
entirely clash with the serious science at the massachusetts 
institute of technology since both stem from peoples desire to 
explain their existence 
we want to collect basically not only what worked but what 
didnt work she said 
at least two of the theorists from the 1920s 30s and 40s were 
borne out by later scientists warning that cigarette smoking could 
be linked to cancer but its the really useless that dominates 
not the musings of the aheadoftheirtime misunderstood geniuses 
there is cyrus teed who advanced the theory that people are 
living inside earth and there is seabury doane brewer who 
determined that the sun is actually 600 miles away from earth as 
opposed to the 93 million miles generally accepted by astronomers 
titles of the mainly selfpublished works are ambitious 
the fact of all life beyond einstein why life exists 
and allied subjects are among the sticky issues bravely tackled 
explaining the meaning of life is a key theme of the authors 
along with debunking scientific beliefs such as the existence of 
gravity and finding proof for religious beliefs 
my own theory is these are the same kind of people who in 
another circumstance might have found their one answer in 
religion marquis said i think thats a lot of what drives 
science anyway we want to know why 
the collection was donated to mit by an editor of scientific 
american it also includes crank mail sent to mit scientists over 
the years marquis said 
most of the authors take a bombastic approach but some are more 
modest such as ernest e sowell who titled his 1938 work a 
laymans guess or the universal electric life theory 
sowell noted he lacked scientific training and admits that some 
might think him presumptuous however there is an impelling 
desire on my part to do this he wrote 
the impelling desire to explain the unexplainable is an 
integral part of science marquis said 
the successful guys think about impossible things and try to 
explain them she said these guys just kept thinking about 
impossible things

a man received a new heart after living a record 
132 days with a device that helped his ailing heart pump blood 
louis wilson a 39yearold paper mill worker from winnfield 
la was feeling well enough to sit up in bed for an hour saturday 
two days after his transplant operation his wife carolyn said 
finding a proper heart donor for wilson was difficult because of 
his large size and type b blood doctors at texas heart institute 
said officials at st lukes episcopal hospital didnt identify 
the donor other than to say the person was from the houston area 
dr bud frazier director of the institutes cardiac transplant 
program said wilson who is 6 feet tall and weighed 210 pounds 
when he was outfitted with the heart pump was doing fine after 
thursdays transplant 
wilson is thought to have survived longer than any other patient 
who has used a stationary heart assist pump which serves much the 
same function as an artificial heart while the patient awaits a 
transplant the pump however assists rather than replaces the 
heart 
wilson was hospitalized nov 21 with ischemic cardimyopathy a 
degenerative condition that prevents his heart from pumping enough 
blood 
on nov 25 a team led by dr oh frazier implanted the 
airpowered heart assist pump into his abdomen

city officials asked a court to declare 
the mobil oil corp refinery here a public nuisance following a 
series of mishaps that have killed three people and injured dozens 
since 1987 
the lawsuit filed friday in los angeles superior court alleges 
the potential for massive disaster at the 750acre refinery 
with the city especially fearing the uncontrolled release of toxic 
hydrofluoric acid 
the complaint asks the court to bar mobil from polluting the air 
with the acid and other toxic chemicals and order the company to 
safely operate the refinery in southern los angeles county the 
facility produces about 12 percent of southern californias 
gasoline 
officials in this city of 140000 people did not say in detail 
what actions they might take if the court issued such an order 
mobil officials had not seen the lawsuit late friday and 
declined to comment on the specific allegations 
scientists say a 1000gallon hydrofluoric acid spill could 
produce a lethal toxic cloud capable of spreading over a fivemile 
range 
the lawsuit was the citys latest attempt to respond to a series 
of fires explosions and other problems that have claimed three 
lives at the refinery since 1987 
a consultants report in january blamed carelessness and lax 
management for what it called an unacceptable number of 
problems at the facility since 1987 
in november the federal government cited mobil and nine of its 
contractors for 100 safety violations and recommended fines 
totaling 30040 mobil officials are contesting the federal 
findings

portauprince haiti ap the military government of lt gen 
prosper avril said saturday that loyal troops crushed a mutiny 
after two days of fighting and that most of the rebel soldiers were 
captured 
the soldiers of the presidential guard presently occupy the 
dessalines barracks said a statement issued by the army 
adjutant gen andre jeanpierre and read on staterun radio 
it said most of the rebels in the barracks were captured but 
some fled and left behind their uniforms and weapons 
the communique did not say how many rebels were captured or had 
escaped the normal force of the dessalines barracks is 750 
soldiers 
loyal soldiers shelled the barracks friday night and resumed the 
artillery bombardment saturday morning there also were firefights 
in the area of the barracks which adjoin the national palace in 
the center of portauprince 
casualty figures for saturdays fighting were not available 
a source close to the government said 17 soldiers all thought 
to be rebels were killed in fridays fighting haitians monitoring 
military radio broadcasts said reports indicated the presidential 
guard suffered 15 casualties but there was no breakdown of dead and 
wounded 
the state hospital said at least one civilian was killed friday 
and unconfirmed reports put the civilian death toll at three 
us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde said it was believed two 
presidential guard soldiers were killed saturday 
the casualty figures apparently are going to be lower than the 
level of noise might have indicated she said 
portauprince remained calm after the government claimed 
victory 
its communique said the captured rebels implicated drug 
traffickers in efforts to overthrow avril that began april 2 with 
an attempted coup it said an antigovernment plot was organized by 
haitian exiles formerly associated with the ousted regime of 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier 
the statement also claimed the mastermind of the revolt was 
former interior minister roger lafontant who is now living in the 
dominican republic which shares the island of hispaniola with 
haiti 
the statement was issued at 515 pm edt after several hours of 
heavy shelling of the barracks shooting had tapered off shortly 
before the announcement 
us officials said earlier that a hole was blown in the roof of 
the gleaming white national palace which serves as the 
presidential residence 
it was believed the damage was caused by a mortar shell fired 
about a mile away by rebels who fled the barracks friday night and 
took over a roman catholic church compound 
diplomats had said friday night it appeared avrils troops had 
gained the upper hand and driven the rebels from the compound but 
fierce firefights broke out again saturday 
reports saturday morning said members of the leopards commando 
unit who had been involved in the mutiny were seen removing their 
uniforms witnesses said they abandoned their base in the capitals 
suburbs 
there were no reports of fighting elsewhere in haiti 
the rebels accuse avrils government which took power in a 
military coup six months ago of favoritism toward the presidential 
guard in pay and living conditions they also said the government 
was arbitrarily dismissing senior officers in a ussupported 
crackdown on drugs and corruption 
in the attempted coup on april 2 rebel soldiers seized avril 
and took him to the airport for deportation but he was rescued by 
loyalist soldiers 
avril went on television monday to claim the rebellion had been 
put down however rebel soldiers continued to roam the capital 
clashing with government forces 
avril 50 came to power in september 1988 in a coup by 
noncommissioned officers that ousted lt gen henri namphy the 
officers demanded democratic reform and an end to statesponsored 
violence 
namphy had deposed a shortlived civilian government he had 
earlier led a junta that took over after jeanclaude duvalier was 
swept from power in a popular uprising and fled to france in 
february 1986 
the government blamed the attempted coup earlier this month on 
people opposed to both democratic change and a campaign against 
drug trafficking contraband and corruption 
the united states has made the drug crackdown a condition for 
restoring 70 million in aid that it suspended after thugs 
massacred 34 voters in november 1987 thwarting haitis first free 
elections in more than 30 years

preliminary laboratory tests showed nothing 
to indicate that a nuclearpowered soviet submarine released 
radiation after it caught fire and sank norwegian scientists said 
sunday 
early results of tests for radioactive contamination in air and 
surface water samples from the accident area showed no radiation 
from the sub the governments institute for radiation protection 
said in a statement 
these tests checked to see if the soviet sub released 
radiation on or near the surface of the ocean but cannot exclude 
the possibility of such a leak deeper in the ocean said 
researcher per strand of the institute 
he said the tests will continue they involve examining 
scrapings from norwegian orion reconnaissance aircraft that flew in 
the region immediately after the accident friday and seawater 
collected near the site 
a norwegian research vessel on sunday will take new samples from 
deeper waters to assess the possibility of the sub having emitted 
radiation as it sank towards the seabed strand said 
norwegian military officers said the submarine caught fire and 
went down in international waters 120 miles southwest of norways 
bear island and about 310 miles west of tromsoe on norways 
northern coast as many as 50 crew members may have died officials 
said 
defense minister johan joergen holst said he believed the risk 
of radiation contamination was slight 
soviet officials said there was no danger of contamination they 
confirmed there were deaths but did not provide casualty figures or 
details about the explosion the third serious soviet sub accident 
in 2 years 
the vessel one of the soviets most advanced was capable of 
carrying more than a dozen longrange missiles according to us 
officials 
vadime rosanov soviet press attache in oslo told norwegian 
television the sub was carrying only torpedoes but he declined to 
say whether the vessel was equipped with any nuclear weapons 
the ship normally carries a crew of about 95 from observations 
by a norwegian reconnaissance air crew the norwegian defense 
ministry estimated 40 to 50 men were picked up by soviet vessels 
and it was unclear if all survived 
its a matter of mathematics said maj john berg a 
military spokesman you have a potential of 50 or more who died 
the submarine reportedly caught fire while submerged a 
norwegian defense ministry statement said that after the ship 
surfaced the fire spread from one section to several others and set 
off an explosion the ship then began to list and sink 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev assured norway the 
vessels reactor was shut down before it sank and that there was no 
risk of radiation 
according to the opinion of experts the possibility of a 
nuclear explosion and radioactive pollution of the environment is 
excluded gorbachev wrote in a message to prime minister gro 
harlem brundtland he sent similar messages to the united states 
and britain 
the soviet news agency tass said the sub sank in water more than 
4500 feet deep tass quoted defense minister dmitri t yazov as 
saying survivors were taken on board a soviet warship that was 
bound for the arctic port of murmansk 
norways foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg criticized the 
soviet failure to quickly inform norway of the accident 
its clear that the information came too late stoltenberg 
said in a radio interview 
tass said the fire broke out at 1141 am friday and the sub 
sank about 5 hours later 
a norwegian spokesman said oslo was officially told of the 
accident nearly nine hours after the sinking and only after the 
foreign ministry in oslo contacted the soviet embassy 
the viennabased international atomic energy agency said the 
soviets notified it of the sub accident early saturday and that the 
soviets said there was no danger of a nuclear explosion or

a major foreign policy report to president 
bush advises no major new initiatives toward the soviet union an 
administration official said saturday 
bush asked his advisers to take another look another time at 
the whole situation after receiving recommendations on relations 
with the soviet union eastern europe and eastwest relations 
said the official the trio of reports are part of a major foreign 
policy review bush initiated as he took office in january 
in relations with the soviet union i dont see anything 
new the official said adding that there apparently was not 
much to change right now the reports were given to bush during 
meetings of the national security council over the past 10 days 
the official said 
the reports recommended some changes including new measures 
involving an easing of pressure on poland the official said 
adding that regarding afghanistan the most likely option was to 
break off diplomatic relations with the government in kabul the 
official did not give further details 
meanwhile the new york times reported in sundays editions that 
the presidents advisers suggested that he maintain a middle course 
allowing him to view the policies of soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev skeptically while responding with some bold foreign 
policy initiative of his own 
the administration experts recommended a statusquo plus 
stance toward the many changes occurring under gorbachev in the 
soviet union the times said 
the washington post said in its sunday editions that the three 
reports determined that the administration should closely follow 
current policies toward europe and the soviet union set by former 
president reagan 
the post reported that some senior administration officials 
expressed frustration with what they considered a complacent view 
of world affairs reflected in the reports however it said other 
officials praised the process that produced the reports saying 
they were less rancorous than interagency meetings conducted during 
the reagan administration 
one official said the report on the soviet union urged that us 
policy should not be designed either to help or hurt gorbachev 
the post said 
the times said the classified analyses were prepared by the 
central intelligence agency the state department the pentagon and 
the staff of the national security council they concluded that 
changes in the soviet union would continue throughout the bush 
administration even if gorbachev were replaced with another soviet 
leader the times reported 
bush and some of his top assistants national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and deputy security adviser robert gates have been 
skeptical of some of the changes in the soviet union but that 
approach has been criticized by some experts as too cautious at a 
time when the soviet union is undergoing monumental change that 
could dramatically alter americansoviet relations the times 
reported 
the real debate in the administration will be between the two 
centrist positions the standpat school and the 
seizetheopportunity school rep les aspin dwis told the 
times 
the report to the white house suggested that the president could 
pursue dialogue for the two superpowers to combat terrorism jointly 
and slow the spread of chemical weapons the times said

an arkansas democrat circulated an ethics 
complaint among his democratic colleagues friday charging house 
minority whip newt gingrich with nine alleged violations of house 
rules 
the complaint drawn up by rep bill alexander will be filed 
formally with the house ethics committee early next week alexander 
spokesman lee powell said committee members were given advance 
copies of the complaint friday he said 
under house rules the formal filing of such a complaint by 
alexander will force the ethics committee to take a vote on whether 
to launch an investigation of gingrich a georgia republican 
alexanders action was seen as the beginning of a democratic 
counteroffensive against gingrich who last year filed the ethics 
complaint that resulted in a lengthy investigation of speaker jim 
wright dtexas 
the ethics committee known formally as the house committee on 
standards of official conduct is nearing the conclusion of its 
investigation of wright and is expected to decide as early as next 
week whether to charge him with violations of house rules 
the nine allegations in alexanders complaint center on an 
unusual promotional deal for gingrichs 1984 book window of 
opportunity details of the deal were disclosed last month just 
before house republicans elected gingrich to their number two 
leadership position 
on friday gingrich said the complaint was clearly another 
democratic smear and in this case a pathetically poorly done 
one he said alexanders complaint was poorly researched and 
riddled with factual errors 
it is certainly mr alexanders right to file with the ethics 
committee gingrich said in this case it so clearly is an 
unresearched and unprepared document and it so clearly demeans and 
distorts the ethics process that i hope that respectable and 
responsible democrats will intervene 
the deal involved 21 investors who put 5000 each into a 
partnership formed to promote the book in return for their 
investment the partners were promised half the publishers 
profits but the publisher ended up losing money on the book and 
the investors got a tax writeoff 
gingrichs wife marianne gingrich who coauthored the book 
has said she received less than 10000 of the 105000 raised by 
the partnership for arranging the deal and coordinating the 
promotional effort she also received a 26 tax benefit from her 
share of the partnership 
mrs gingrich said last month that the ethics committee had been 
consulted before the partnership contracts were signed to ensure 
that the arrangement did not violate any house rules 
alexander contends in the complaint that the promotional deal 
may have violated house rules limiting outside earned income and 
gifts that a member can receive he said the deal also may have 
violated house rules governing the use of campaign funds and 
government resources and requiring disclosure of travel 
reimbursements

three american soldiers found what 
was believed to be a communist rebel bomb trap on a road near clark 
air base a us air force spokeswoman said friday 
capt donna eggleston said the servicemen detected the suspected 
trap thursday in the village of sapang bato when they found a wire 
running across a road that leads to a firing range near the base 
the base run by the united states is about 50 miles north of 
manila 
in manila president corazon aquino met with a us delegation 
evaluating human rights in the philippines and said she regretted 
that her governments rights record was viewed as no better than 
that of ferdinand marcos 
in the southern philippines a roman catholic priest and a 
village official were shot to death by a soldier church officials 
said 
ms eggleston said the american soldiers were on their way to 
the firing range when they spotted the wires on the road and turned 
back to report their discovery to base authorities 
when american and filipino troops went to the area they found 
that the wires had been removed 
local police said the incident could have been a rebel plot 
since members of the communist new peoples army operate in the 
area 
in october 1987 communist rebels killed two american soldiers 
a retired us air force soldier and a filipino of us descent in 
almost simultaneous attacks near clark there had been no attacks 
on americans since then 
in manila presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said mrs 
aquino told a group of attorneys from minnesota that her 
governments human rights record has improved despite criticism 
that violations are similar to those under marcos 20year rule 
the lawyers were completing a 12day tour of the country 
the fact is we have restored democracy and that is the most 
important factor she said 
fraser in a telephone interview with the associated press 
agreed 
she reaffirmed her own commitmnet to human rights but i think 
the problem is how to translate this commitmnet to the lower levels 
of the government out in the field he said 
amnesty international and other human rights groups have accused 
the military of continued human rights violations during mrs 
aquinos administration 
on mindanao island the rev dionisio malalay and a village 
councilman were gunned down thursday in the town of tabina about 
520 miles southeast of manila a church official in manila said 
the rev dwight calaar said malalay was talking with councilman 
rufino rivera when a philippine constabulary soldier and a 
militiaman passed by and started an argument with rivera 
malalay tried to intervene and the soldier shot him calaar 
said the militiaman then shot rivera he said 
the constabulary regional headquarters reported the shooting as 
an ambush by communist new peoples army rebels

from the jeweled party dresses of peasants to peter 
the greats homemade boots historical fashions from imperial 
russia are being shown in an exhibition from leningrads hermitage 
museum put on by yves saint laurent 
until may 31 parisians will be able to view 200 costumes 46 
paintings and nine engravings covering russias prerevolutionary 
period from 1700 to 1914 the jacquemartandre museum formerly a 
dingy mansion has been refurbished to shine as splendidly as the 
czars winter palace 
saint laurent who was honored with his own fashion 
retrospective in the soviet union two years ago was also 
celebrating the 225th anniversary of the hermitage museum 
this is a great example of glasnost said stephen de pietri 
the american curator of the show referring to the openness 
policy of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
several years ago we wouldnt have been able to get seven 
court dresses as we did this time he said the russians are 
justifiably proud of these wellpreserved costumes they have done 
a fabulous job of preserving their heritage 
a small room devoted to peter i who made st petersburg now 
leningrad into an 18thcentury imperial city displays several 
outfits that clothed the 6foot9 czar a giant with sloped 
shoulders 
he might have worn the splendid red and blue cavalry dress 
outfit during the battle of poltava as he beat a path to water 
opening up landlocked st petersburg to the sea standing alone 
peters plain homemade boots bear witness to his doityourself 
creativity as a young man who built boats as well as boots to 
escape boredom before he came to power 
among the imperial costumes of catherine 1 who plotted and 
succeeded in marrying peter the great were two outfits for 
reviewing the troops one was green for the preobrajenski order 
named after a hero another red and blue equestrian outfit for 
passing the cavalry in review 
unlike her towering husband catherine who was empress only two 
years 172527 was short and fat wearing a big cloak to cover up 
most of her girth 
the russian love of oriental opulence is woven throughout the 
show with silver and gold threads amazing brocade embroidery 
iridescent taffetas jet beads sequins and pearls red velvet 
always a russian favorite is shown generously throughout but the 
enormous rubies emeralds and amethysts the russian royals lavished 
on themselves have now been replaced by glass stones 
only in the soviet union could one find the exquisite antique 
shawls on view woven so finely in stainedglass colors that the 
threads are barely perceptible the price was heavy for the young 
girls who wove the fabrics who often went blind 
yet the french fashion influence is obvious as well 
peter the great decreed that european styles would be worn at 
court said isabelle de courreges a spokeswoman for saint 
laurent everything about dressing was decreed even the length 
of the trains 
many of the 19thcentury outfits are nearly lineforline copies 
of what parisians were wearing from highwaisted french empire 
styles to crinoline skirts and bustles one tableau of the 
imperial white nights is a stunning succession of gossamerlight 
silvery embroidered dresses 
going along with the modern dawntodark philosophy are two 
convertible dresses with separate tops circa 1880 the daytime 
versions sport frothy jabots for modesty at the the neck while the 
evening tops have daring decolletages 
the shows mannequins are given an amazingly lifelike appearance 
with period curls and coifs fashioned out of stiffened silk 
paper the work of two parisian hair stylists 
while women might envy the extraordinary beauty of the elaborate 
dresses men could covet some of the marvelous silk dressing gowns 
worn in offhours 
outfits from the top russian couturiers lamanova brissac and 
boulbenkova are displayed alongside models by poiret and worth 
favorite paris designers at the turn of the century 
children are not forgotten in the show a lavish 
silverembroidered salmon pink velvet suit was a gift of catherine 
to her adored grandchild alexander i 
touching outfits for children that might have been worn by 
anastasia and alexis offspring of the last czar nicholas ii are 
just as elaborate as the grownups clothes a short silvery dress 
for the little girl an embroidered blue velvet suit for a boy 
a group of peasant fete dresses topped by cockscomb 
kokoschnik haloheaddresses is just as richlooking as the 
court styles though with informal touches such as gay sashes and 
suspenders with lacetrimmed sarafan or apron dresses 
the glittery folklore was reminiscent of the rich and happy 
peasant styles admired by saint laurent and the inspiration for 
his 1976 ballets russes collection

forecasters gazing into their crystal balls say 
the economic picture is still fuzzy but they have started to get an 
image of how people are reacting to rising interest rates a few 
businesses probably dont like what theyve seen so far 
car makers and big retail merchants furnished figures this past 
week that cast shadows of doubt about their situations 
sales of cars and trucks in the united states skidded an 
unexpectedly steep 183 percent in late march auto manufacturers 
reported and many retailers didnt ring up as much business last 
month as they had thought they would 
the news was unsurprising given the direction interest rates 
have taken lately 
expensive purchases normally financed with loans like cars 
were predicted to shrink as consumers became obliged to spend more 
on things such as mortgage payments so widely anticipated was the 
spending slowdown that the nations big three automakers cranked up 
their promotional vehicles before the latest results were even in 
they have been touting rebates and cutrate financing deals 
including chrysler corps zero percent financing to tempt 
customers back into the showrooms during the important spring 
carbuying season 
historically march and april are the months when shoppers gear 
up for extra summertime driving by paying a visit to dealerships 
many may have stopped by to browse in late march but fewer than 
usual bought 
conventional wisdom says the incentives will breathe some oomph 
into auto sales but after a short while theyll lose gusto again 
once bargainhunters have had their fill 
when many of nations major retailers toted up march sales they 
were disappointed some blamed bad weather or the fact that they 
had one less selling day in this years fiveweek period than they 
had last year which can make a big difference 
retail industry analysts agreed with those points but in 
sifting through the numbers they came up with evidence that 
consumers are losing enthusiasm to spend money on the types of 
things they bought in abundance during much of the sixyear 
economic expansion 
i think we have a fundamental switch in consumer spending 
says allen sinai chief economist at the boston co 
consumers are spending more on services such as travel 
recreational pastimes or personal health and fitness plans 
the kind of items bought at the chain stores are less 
prominent in the consumer basket these days according to sinai 
a calculation by the securities firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
indicated sales of specialty apparel hard goods such as home 
furnishings and other general merchandise rose just 46 percent 
in march down from februarys 76 percent growth in order words 
sales barely kept ahead of inflation 
retailers are justifiably reluctant to generalize based on only 
one months performance the transition from winter to summer can 
be an unsettled time for the weather so shoppers frequently dont 
buy clothes to freshen up their wardrobes or get new gardening 
gear for instance until theyre sure warm temperatures have come 
to stay 
april could be a cruel month for car makers and general 
merchandisers if customers dont act on the traditional weather cue 
and go out shopping 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the government reported what was desribed as an ambiguous set 
of statistics about the labor market the labor department said the 
unemployment rate fell to 5 percent in march a new 15year low 
from 51 percent the month before even though the number of new 
jobs added to the economy fell to the smallest amount since august 
eastern airlines agreed to be acquired by an investor group led 
by former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth for about 464 
million but the deal which would give easterns 30000 employees 
a 30 percent stake in the airline wont become final until after 
parent texas air corp brings eastern out of federal bankruptcy 
protection among other things 
as junk bond enthusiasts capped an annual gettogether in 
california and toasted michael milkens pioneering efforts in the 
highyield highrisk business the former head of drexel burnhams 
junk bond operation pleaded innocent at his arraignment in 
manhattan federal court on a raft of racketeering and securities 
fraud charges

in a stock market intensely focused on economic 
statistics producer prices are the magic words for the coming 
week on wall street 
the government is due to report wednesday on the march producer 
price index for finished goods 
stock and bond traders will be watching closely to see whether 
the index a measure of inflationary pressures at the nexttolast 
point in the distribution chain shows signs of letting up 
increases of 1 percent in the index for both january and 
february shook up the markets when they were reported and fanned 
fears of increasing inflation and higher interest rates 
the index is the most worrisome inflation indicator at this 
time the merrill lynch market letter observed another large 
increase could prompt further credittightening moves by the 
federal reserve 
if advance estimates by private economists are right a measure 
of relief is on the way 
the consensus view is that the increase for march will be down 
to about half a percentage point still a bit high perhaps but 
at least moving in the right direction 
peter greenbaum at smith barney harris upham amp co which is 
looking for a gain of either 04 percent or 05 percent says the 
expected improvement lies mainly in food and energy prices which 
were primary culprits in the increases of the two previous months 
the adverse price effects of the oil spill near valdez alaska 
wont show up in producer prices until the april figures are out 
he said 
of course there are no guarantees against an unpleasant 
surprise the february figure came in well above expectations 
but whatever the ups and downs of the figures over the next 
month or two many economists argue that inflation is likely to 
subside significantly as the year passes 
we think the stage is being set for a deceleration of 
inflation later in 1989 said jeffrey applegate at tucker 
anthony amp rl day inc 
the recent inflation figures while certainly worse than 
expectations are also history they lag not lead 
applegate points out that such traditional earlywarning 
indicators of inflation as the price of gold and the growth rate of 
the money supply are sounding no alarms at all 
he also observed that the stock market has risen on balance 
since the fed began to tighten credit a year ago suggesting at 
least a cautious belief that the central bank might succeed in 
restraining inflation without inflicting severe pain on the economy 
in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 
1118 points to 230480 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 140 to 
16693 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
added 398 to 41071 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 228 at 33059 
volume on the big board averaged 16693 million shares a day 
against 14691 million the week before 
edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities says 
he believes the rise of 3 percentage points in shortterm interest 
rates over the past year is starting to bite but we dont expect 
a recession 
rather we believe that the feds aggressive preemptive attack 
against inflation is working 
while consensus expectations are like to continue to bounce 
between the extremes of boom and bust we expect that the economy 
will continue to chug along somewhere down the middle

the vessel is anything but traditional but a 
ceremony saturday will employ the standard champagne bottle 
christening for the worlds first prefabricated hydroelectric 
plant 
were inflicting a little bit of shipyard tradition on it 
said bruce wismar the man who oversaw construction of the 12story 
structure at avondale industries after all it will be making a 
heck of a trip 
three tugs will push the 456foot long merrimac which resembles 
a 12story grey box 208 miles up the mississippi river in late 
april or early may depending on river conditions wismar said 
the structure actually a power plant enclosed in a dam is so 
massive it will have to be partially sunk near baton rouge to allow 
it to pass under a bridge but wisner said no trouble was expected 
during the four to fiveday journey 
we will ballast it down to get under the bridge probably by 
about 50feet or five stories we have installed a temporary 
ballast system and 24 pumps to pump the water back out when were 
past the bridge wismar said 
a 106foot deep hole has been prepared at the flooded site of 
the new plant between the mississippi and red rivers about 40 miles 
below vidalia once the plant is floated onto the site a levee 
will be rebuilt the water drained off and the plant permanently 
grounded 
the eightturbine power plant is expected to begin generating 
electricity by 1990 
the brainchild of former vidalia mayor sidney murray jr the 
plant is intended to produce cheap electricity for the 6800 
vidalia residents and help generate jobs and prosperity for the 
town which has been hit hard by depressed oil and farming 
industries 
when we started all of this we had 22 percent unemployment in 
our area murray said thursday 
what i really wanted to do back them was just try to stabilize 
energy prices he said i think we can do that when the 
plant gets going and i think it will attract some industry to our 
area 
skyrocketing oil prices in past years sent rates for electricity 
from local oilfired power plants soaring rates never receded when 
oil prices did and expectations were that if oil prices rose 
strongly again in coming years the electric rates again would 
follow suit 
the plant will produce enough electricity for over 200000 
homes vidalia is entitled to between 6 percent and 15 percent of 
the electricy enough to supply its residents 
when the debt for building the 500 million facility is paid off 
in 41 years through plant revenue vidalia will begin receiving a 
third of the money from the sale of power and can set local 
electric rates 
the other two partners are catalyst energy development 
corporation of new york and dominion capital inc of virginia 
catalyst is a wholly owned subsidiary of merrimac inc a 
privatelyheld corporation principally owned by tom b pickens iii 
son of the noted corporate raider t boone pickens merrimac and 
its related companies have 18 operating facilities in 13 states and 
10 more projects under construction 
local officials expect the population of vidalia to double in 
coming years as more businesses move to a 280acre industrial park 
aimed at capitalizing on the new source of power 
city officials and a lot of what murray called regular 
residents planned to journey to new orleans for saturdays 
ceremonies he said 
its been 13 years and i think they want to actually see it 
so theyll really believe its going to happen now murray said

peter v ueberroths 464 million deal to buy 
eastern airlines and share ownership with its unions is a major 
step toward untangling the strikebound carriers problems 
but can ueberroth and his team or another potential suitor who 
might emerge resurrect eastern as a competitive airline 
once any buyer gets the company back into operation easterns 
new managers will have to repair its battered service reputation 
regain customers who deserted the virtually grounded airline and 
compete headon with such aggressive rivals as delta air lines and 
american airlines that already have muscled further into eastern 
turf 
cheaper fares at least for the first few weeks eastern is back 
into the air are a strong possibility to lure back passengers 
observers believe 
eastern is moving off deadcenter said robert joedicke an 
airline analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc whether it will 
fly or not i dont think anybody can tell this early 
the arrival of the buyout group led by former baseball 
commissioner ueberroth has galvanized easterns embittered 
employees and lifted their rockbottom morale picketing pilots and 
flight attendants at airports up and down the east coast cheered 
news of the sale thursday while machinists sang take me out to 
the ballgame at a packed union hall in miami easterns home base 
but beyond the euphoria ueberroth admitted there are two major 
hurdles his group must vault before eastern can again fly a full 
schedule approval of new work agreements with easterns unions and 
approval of the buyout by eastern creditors and the us bankruptcy 
court 
eastern filed for bankruptcy protection and reorganization on 
march 9 five days after the start of a machinists union strike 
that won the support of pilots and flight attendants virtually 
grounded the carrier and drained its cash reserves 
there are no miracle workers standing in front of you 
ueberroth said in announcing the deal with texas air corp 
under the proposed buyout eastern employees would get a 30 
percent stake in the carrier in exchange for some 210 million in 
pay cuts and workrule concessions the ueberroth group almost 
immediately began talks with the unions to beat a midnight tuesday 
deadline set in the deal for reaching agreements 
the airlines attempt to wring 125 million in concessions from 
its machinists who in turn demanded a pay raise had 
precipitated the strike if ueberroth succeeds in wresting 
concessions from the unions that texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
was unable to get and if the court and creditors approve his real 
challenge will still lie ahead 
american airlines for example has been quick to capitalize on 
easterns troubles the dallasbased carrier announced thursday 
that it plans to add 11 flights in miami and 13 in the caribbean 
traditionally a stronghold of eastern 
the new schedule gives american nine new flights a day out of 
miami and seven new flights daily out of san juan puerto rico 
officials of american said the machinists strike against eastern 
accelerated their expansion plans 
competitors have been moving in on eastern long before the 
strike began in the past five years its leading rivals delta 
american pan am trans world airlines and usair group together 
have added some 1600 new flights in eastern markets east of the 
mississippi 
some rivals have raised fares on competitive routes since the 
eastern walkout began archrival delta based in atlanta says it 
hasnt raised fares but has tightened fare restrictions as a result 
of easterns paralysis 
a lot of things have to be changed at eastern said julius 
maldutis who follows the industry for salomon brothers inc 
maldutis is one of a number of experts who expect the airline to 
offer special discount fares to attract customers once it gets off 
the ground other carriers such as united airlines braniff inc 
and easterns sister continental airlines have sharply cut fares 
following strikes 
the fare cuts are bound to be temporary and unlikely to be 
matched by easterns competitors analysts believe 
initially there will be some incentive of that type cheap 
fares put in just to get people back to eastern said louis 
marckesano an analyst with janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia 
after that he warns its going to be a slow steady process 
of winning their customers back and keeping costs down theyre 
still going to be losing money hand over fist at the beginning 
with improved marketing strategy and service a revived eastern 
might start to break even by years end marckesano suggested 
the airline has lost 15 billion over the past decade and has 
piled up debts totaling 32 billion 
standard amp poors corp said friday that the sale to ueberroth 
if approved would have a positive effect on the credit 
positions of texas air and eastern 
however the creditrating agency cautioned eastern has lost 
market share to competitors and will be even more dependent on 
pricesensitive leisure traffic without its shuttle which it has 
agreed to sell to developer donald trump for 365 million 
eastern has a relatively old fleet and high nonlabor fixed 
costs the airline will be vulnerable to competition and would be 
hurt badly by a recession sampp stated

a us software consortium has accused 
three italian firms of pirating american programs in an 
unprecedented copyright infringement suit company officials said 
friday 
the suit filed thursday in milan by the business software 
association accuses the european companies of copying without 
authorization software produced by lotus development corp of 
cambridge and ashtontate corp of torrance calif 
the elettrocarbonium spa montedison spa and its affiliate 
monefibre spa were named as codefendants in bsas suit but 
exactly what if any compensation the group was seeking was not 
specified 
bsa president douglas e phillips said the group would likely 
file additional lawsuits against several other companies in the 
months to come 
the level of unauthorized copying of software in italy not 
only by dealers but by organizational users is one of the most 
egregious in europe phillips said in a prepared statement 
the breach had cost companies trying to develop and market 
legitimate software hundreds of millions of dollars phillips said 
technical experts found evidence of widespread software 
duplication during inspections ordered by the italian courts and 
conducted last week at two of the accused firms phillips said 
he said more than 90 percent of the software inspected at 
montedison was reproduced without authorization and 80 percent of 
the software inspected at elettrocarbonium consisted of 
unauthorized copies 
officials at the milanbased montedison and its affiliate have 
denied the charges bsa officials did not know whether 
elettrocarbonium had also denied the allegations 
bsa spokeswoman pilar cloud said the accused companies pirate 
the software by buying a single copy of a program and then 
duplicating it internally and reselling it 
its a fairly common practice internationally but its very 
illegal cloud said bsa hopes to put a stop to it 
washingtonbased bsa was founded in 1988 to promote free and 
open trade in legitimate business software while protecting 
intellectual property 
the consortiums membership also includes aldus corp of 
seattle autodesk inc of sausalito calif microsoft corp of 
redmond wash and wordperfect corp of orem utah

former drexel burnham lambert inc junk bond 
chief michael milken and his brother have pleaded innocent to a 
massive racketeering and securities fraud indictment but their 
lawyers will be back in court next week to settle on bail 
looking tan and smiling milken 42 dressed in a navy blue 
pinstriped suit entered his plea friday before a standingroomonly 
crowd at federal court in manhattan 
outside the courthouse later dozens of applauding supporters 
some wearing hats that read mike milken we believe in you 
cheered him and shook his hand as he left without comment 
mr milken looks forward to the opportunity to have his story 
come out in court where you have due process and the truth will 
emerge said one of michael milkens lawyers arthur l liman 
drexel spokesman steven anreder denied reports that prosecutors 
asked it to bar employees from holding a courthouse rally for 
milken but the firm issued a statement sympathetic to milken 
supporters 
some individuals have chosen to express their support for mike 
at this very difficult and emotional time for him drexel said 
we understand their desire to express their feelings 
supporters also rallied for milken at drexels annual highyield 
bond conference being held this week in beverly hills calif where 
the drexel high yield bond department is headquartered 
also pleading innocent before us district judge kimba wood at 
federal court in manhattan was milkens brother lowell 40 a 
third defendant former drexel trader bruce l newberg was absent 
due to a skiing accident and will be arraigned april 25 
all three were named in a 98count federal securities fraud and 
racketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury march 29 
both milkens were released without bail after assistant us 
attorney john carroll said prosecutors and defense lawyers made 
substantial progress during talks to reach an acceptable bond for 
the defendants and their assets 
the racketeering charges seek 185 billion in forfeitures from 
each of the three defendants which amounts to their total combined 
earnings at drexel from 1984 to 1987 the government reportedly had 
asked the three defendants to post a 1 billion bond to avoid 
pretrial restraints on their assets 
under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
assets found by the jury to be the result of racketeering 
activities are subject to forfeiture proceedings and prosecutors 
could ask the judge to freeze the milkens assets to guarantee 
their availability in the event of a conviction 
ms wood scheduled another court session for tuesday morning at 
carrolls request to finalize bond arrangements 
lowell milken dressed in a gray suit said i plead not 
guilty in a loud firm voice when asked by the judge 
in addition to the potential 185 billion in forfeiture all 
three defendants face possible maximum fines of 37 billion each 
if convicted on either of two racketeering charges 
prosecutors however concede that upon conviction a judge is 
unlikely to impose maximum fines or maximum prison sentences which 
would be 520 years in michael milkens case 
milken took a leave of absence from his job as head of the junk 
bond division where he reportedly made more than 1 billion over 
four years including 550 million in 1987 
the racketeering indictment followed a more than twoyear 
investigation of wall streets fifthlargest investment firm that 
was triggered by information supplied by convicted stock speculator 
ivan boesky 
drexel in december agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and 
pay a record 650 million to settle securities fraud charges with 
the us attorneys office 
the plea deal is conditional on settlement of separate civil 
insider trading charges filed by the securities and exchange 
commission against drexel sources familiar with the negotiations 
said the agreement could be completed next week 
milken though is challenging the criminal deal on the grounds 
that is violates his rights by forcing drexel to fire him and 
withhold his 1988 pay of more than 100 million
