britain invented racism and was forced 
to accept blacks in politics only because they demanded their 
rights the first black woman member of parliament said friday 
in a speech to the 12th annual conference of the national 
council for black studies diane abbott said she was told blacks 
were distinctly unelectable and received little support from 
whites during her campaign 
before her election to the house of commons in 1987 the 
cambridgeeducated politician was accused of antisemitism and of 
supporting only the interests of blacks and women she said 
even colleagues in her own party the socialist labor party 
were not willing to support her against a white incumbent she said 
it is a common fallacy among americans to believe europeans 
are nicer than americans and more liberal than americans she 
said 
far from britain being a nicer and more liberal society the 
british invented racism miss abbott said they built an empire 
on which racism was the organizing principle i believe britain is 
one of the most fundamentally racist nations on earth 
miss abbott was smeared as an antisemite she said after 
refusing requests by britains jewish community to denounce louis 
farrakhan the controversial leader of the nation of islam who has 
called judaism a gutter religion 
i said i wouldnt denounce him because once you as a black 
politician start jumping through hoops for people it never 
stops she said to an applauding crowd of about 150 
a child of working class immigrants from jamaica she has 
prevailed because of her belief in her roots she said 
i believe in black people i believe in our beauty i believe 
in our strength i believe in our potential my career has been 
about that 
she has also prevailed she said because the labor party has 
needed the black vote 
nobody could have guessed that this black girl would 
have gone on to take her seat in the mother of parliament in the 
heart of empire in the heart of darkness in the belly of the 
beast she said 
the conference sponsored by three pennsylvania universities 
aims to develop ways to allow others to see the world from an 
african perspective according to kariamu welsh assistant 
professor of african studies at temple university

when others had given up hope that unsponsored 
talks would produce a peace settlement for afghanistan diego 
cordovez wouldnt call it quits 
it has happened that everybody has given up except myself 
said cordovez an undersecretarygeneral of the united nations who 
mediated the indirect peace talks between afghanistan and pakistan 
not to give up is my duty said the 52yearold ecuadoran 
lawyer 
cordovez said in an interview that the task of mediating the 
talks requires tremendous physical and mental strength you 
cannot do it unless youre convinced you will succeed 
success seems within reach with all main elements complete in a 
package of agreements designed to end the war the accord is to be 
signed next week 
cordovez the son of ecuadorean politician luis cordovez has 
had a string of other troubleshooting assignments since he joined 
the un system as a 27yearold law graduate of the university of 
chile 
in 1965 he was in the dominican republic then in the throes of 
a civil war and he went to bangladesh shortly after it gained 
independence after the 1971 indopakistan war 
he was the highestranking un official to accompany a special 
independent mission to tehran that failed to resolve the us 
hostage crisis in february 1980 and he helped settle a dispute 
between malta and libya over offshore prospecting rights 
while the afghanistan talks were under way he also was involved 
in un efforts to end the iraniraq war and was sent to grenada 
after the 1983 us invasion 
but none of his assignments has posed more of a challenge than 
the geneva talks 
cordovez is credited with avoiding an early collapse of the 
afghan negotiations over the issue of facetoface talks pakistan 
which considers kabul a soviet puppet refused direct talks 
although it still has a diplomatic mission in the afghan capital 
pakistan represents the moslem guerrillas fighting the communist 
government in kabul which has been backed by an estimated 115000 
soviet troops the afghan and pakistani negotiators have not spoken 
to each other since the talks were launched six years ago 
initially the delegations took turns meeting with cordovez 
when the afghans threatened to leave unless they got more 
recognition from the pakistanis the un diplomat devised the 
proximity formula under which both delegations sit in separate 
rooms in the geneva un office with cordovez shuttling between 
them 
the satisfaction of getting the adversaries to compromise is 
fantastic he said the more difficult the problem the more i 
enjoy it 
although known for taking a tough stance cordovez also has a 
sense of humor he says he has been cracking jokes all the time 
during his meetings with the two sides 
a sense of humor is absolutely essential in these 
negotiations he said a joke can immediately defuse a 
situation 
recently he was seen limping down a corridor there was no 
accident a bystander was assured cordovez was just illustrating 
that the talks were limping on 
journalists grabbed their pens when he opened a rare news 
conference by saying he had an important announcement 
my name is not spelled with an accent over the o and if a 
newspaper keeps misspelling it i will cease buying it 
much of his negotiating strength derives from his ability to 
leave his work behind on weekends 
people are forbidden to call me at home and i never call my 
assistants said cordovez who is married with one son 
he enjoys an occasional cuban cigar sometimes from fidel 
castro good wine and a good meal 
cordovez has termed his assignment the most exacting and 
rewarding in my life but he adds you cannot do such a thing 
twice

embarrassed managers at a company building a 
nuclearpowered hunter submarine for the british navy have ordered 
an inquiry into how a large section of the vessel was welded into 
position upside down 
i dont think anyone can remember quite such a blunder an 
unidentified employee of the vickers shipbuilding and engineering 
ltd in the northwestern town of barrow told the daily telegraph 
correcting the mistake to the 446 million trafalgarclass 
submarine named the triumph will cost up to 186 million 
according to a trade union leader quoted by the british domestic 
news agency press association 
mike smith a spokesman for vickers said a section of the 
ssn19 the triumph has been welded into an incorrect position an 
investigation is currently under way into how this occurred 
we dont envisage there being any impact on the building 
program or the quality standards which apply to this submarine 
he said 
smith refused to say how the mistake occurred the unidentified 
trade union leader told the news agency it was a mistake by 
senior management 
smith said he did not think the welding error would jeopardize 
vickers bid to win an order to build submarines for the canadian 
navy vickers is pursuing the order in the face of competition from 
the french company societe navigation atomique 
this is a very isolated incident and we will be pressing ahead 
with our bid how much it will cost to put right i dont know but 
the figure of one million pounds 186 million is ridiculous 
smith said 
jeanpierre lucas naval attache at the french embassy told the 
times of london i have always told the canadians that the french 
submarines are cheaper and will be easier to maintain but now i 
will have to remind them that if they want it the right way up they 
had better not look to the british submarine 
press association said the welding mistake is believed to have 
resulted from a change in shipbuilding methods at the barrow 
shipyard 
the daily telegraph quoted workers at barrow as saying a 
cylindrical hull section measuring 20 feet by 30 feet had been 
welded in the wrong position the paper said it would now have to 
be ripped out and rewelded which will take several weeks 
the defense ministry said the problem was vickers contractual 
responsibility a ministry statement said the company has 
quality control and inspection arrangements to ensure that problems 
are identified and rectified at the earliest possible time 
the hull of the triumph is due to be launched in a year and the 
vessel is to be completed in 1991 it is the last of six of the 
original design of trafalgarclass submarines being built by 
vickers 
nuclearpowered submarines are built in a series of massive 
rings designed to withstand the huge pressures on the vessel when 
submerged each of the rings is slightly thicker at one side which 
means their positioning is crucial 
the times reported that signs saying which end is up are glued 
to the sections and either the notice fell off or someone didnt 
read it properly which led to last weeks erroneous welding a 
quality control inspector noticed the mistake 
the daily telegraph printed a cartoon showing the triumph with 
its conning tower and periscope on the bottom of the hull instead 
of the top the cartoon had vickers staff saying yes they will 
notice 
the tabloid newspaper the sun reported the story under the 
headline substandard

debt problems and an oil glut have shrunk the 
amount some countries can spend on arms causing the annual value 
of worldwide arms imports to drop 16 billion from earlier this 
decade a report says 
from a plateau of about 50 billion a year from 1981 to 1984 
global arms imports declined to 42 billion in 1985 and 34 billion 
in 1986 according to a report issued friday by the us arms 
control and disarmament agency 
as late as 1984 the trend in arms imports by developing 
nations was sharply up in almost all years fueled by ambitious 
force improvement programs financed in most cases by rising oil 
prices and easy credit the agency said 
since then an oil glut has driven down mideast income and the 
third worlds debt problems have made funds for weapons scarce 
besides many of the countries that bought all those weapons in the 
early 1980s have all the guns tanks planes and ammunition they 
want the report said 
a sharp decline in middle east arms imports in 1985 and 1986 
was the main contributor to the decline in the world and 
developingcountry totals the agency said from their peak in 
1984 middle east imports dropped an average of 24 percent in 1985 
and 1986 
despite the drop in arms imports global military spending rose 
in 1986 to 921 billion from 800 billion the previous year 
during 1985 the last year covered by the countrybycountry 
arms transfer figures iraq topped the list of weapons importers 
buying 4 billion worth of equipment for the war against iran that 
began in 1980 
iraq was followed in order by saudi arabia india cuba west 
germany iran libya syria egypt and the soviet union which 
purchases large amounts of weaponry from its allies in eastern 
europe 
the united states which is being urged by its nato partners to 
buy more weapons from western europe ranked 23rd on the list of 
importing nations with 600 million worth of purchases 
as it has for many years the soviet union led the list of 
international arms sellers its transfers totalled 153 billion 
the united states was second with 123 billion followed by 
france czechoslovakia poland italy britain west germany china 
and east germany 
the variety and quality of soviet and us weapons and the 
superpowers willingness to employ weapons sales as a political 
instrument suggest that the two will remain the third worlds 
largest suppliers by significant margins for many years to come

a federal judge heard arguments for more than an 
hour friday in a suit by the state of massachusetts challenging the 
authority of federal officials to direct the training of the 
national guard in peacetime 
us district court judge robert keeton took the case under 
advisement but indicated that he expected to rule promptly 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis a democratic presidential 
candidate who opposes the reagan administrations policies in 
central america is resisting washingtons orders sending 13 
guardsmen to panama and honduras late next month 
douglas wilkins an assistant state attorney general argued 
that the framers of the us constitution envisioned the 
militia as a citizens army allowing the genius of the 
people to exert a democratic influence over the perils posed by a 
large standing army 
he said that in spite of the national guards dual federalstate 
status congress did not have the power to set aside the states 
traditional role in training the militia 
the original militia at least in these parts was the 
minutemen of lexington and concord wilkins said 
massachusetts is asking the federal court to overturn a 1986 act 
of congress known as the montgomery amendment that says governors 
may not withhold their consent for training assignments outside the 
united states because of objections to the location purpose or 
schedule of the training 
justice department lawyer vincent garvey argued that congress 
acting in 1933 under the army clause of the constitution 
created the national guard of the united states when members of 
the militia are serving in their federal status they are part of 
that federal entity and answerable to congress and the 
president 
from the bench keeton asked several questions about the 
militia clause which clause gives congress power over 
organizing arming and disciplining the militia reserving to the 
states respectively the authority of training the militia 
according to the discipline prescribed by congress 
if the states are to retain their authority over training he 
asked how can federal officers order a training mission over a 
governors objection 
last year a federal court in minnesota rejected a suit brought 
by gov rudy perpich seeking to block his states national guard 
troops from a similar assignment that case which massachusetts 
joined as a friend of the court is on appeal 
in late january after receiving direct orders from washington 
dukakis filed a fresh suit in boston dukakis has said that if he 
is faced with a lawful order he will comply when the 13 members of 
the 65th public affairs detachment are scheduled to leave for two 
weeks in panama and honduras on may 28

a rebel member of panamas defense forces has 
smuggled out a memo detailing the efforts of military strongman 
manuel antonio noriega to buy thousands of pistols from an american 
arms dealer 
the memo marked urgent and confidential was sent to 
noriega on april 1 by leo wanta president of americhina global 
management group inc an arms exporting firm based in appleton 
wis 
the document offered fresh evidence of noriegas intention to 
ride out panamas prolonged political crisis partly with help of a 
large infusion of foreign weapons a defense forces defector said 
last month he had helped fly to panama 94000 pounds of weapons 
from cuba 
in what appeared to be a major security breach aimed at blocking 
the purchase by his boss the unidentified officer leaked the memo 
to a panamanian opposition leader the memo was turned over to the 
associated press on condition the leader be identified neither by 
name nor location 
wanta told noriega in the memo that the supplier of the weapons 
had advised that they are ready to finalize the delivery of the 
browning 9mm semiautomatic pistols made in belgium 
the schedule called for the delivery of 5000 pistols 
immediately and 2000 per month thereafter until all units are 
delivered 
the memo did not specify how many weapons were to be sent all 
told but a previous memo by wanta obtained last month by the ap 
said the purchase involved 30000 pistols including the 5000 to 
be sent immediately the list price is 398 each 
the earlier memo was given to the ap by panamanian ambassador 
juan b sosa wanta had sent a telecopy of the memo to sosa 
unaware that the envoy had broken with noriega and continues to 
regard ousted president eric arturo delvalle as the countrys 
constitutional leader sosa has refused to relinquish the embassy 
to a replacement envoy named by the new government in panama 
wanta sent the april 1 memo directly to noriega bypassing the 
embassy here a stamp in the upper left hand corner of the 
communication said it was received by the panamanian defense forces 
on april 5 
the pistols are manufactured by fabrique nationale sa of 
belgium and are to be delivered from that country to panama 
according to the memo the state department raised the issue late 
last month with the belgian firm which said that it had not had 
contact with anyone from americhina a us official said 
the government cannot legally block the sale because the weapons 
are not of american origin the us official insisting on 
anonymity said americhina has not registered with the us 
government a requirement he said applies to all american arms 
dealers 
wanta could not be reached for comment the company phone number 
that appeared on the first memo was deleted from the second memo 
the phone has been temporarily disconnected according to a 
recorded announcement the only address listed is a post office box

much attention as what theyre winning at the annual oscar 
ceremony and this years fashion forecast promises heavy glamour 
and romance with only moderate glitz 
gone are the pounds of weighty sequins and beads the 60th 
annual academy awards will be the year of showing off legs and the 
body in formfitting silhouettes 
were pushing glamour like crazy this year designer bob

definitely reflect that said mackie who with ray aghayan is the 
official designer of the show to be televised live from the shrine 
auditorium on monday 
mackie and other local fashion notables say films in 1987 were 
loaded with more solid serious female roles than ever before and 
that will be reflected in how nominees and presenters outfit 
themselves 
those nominated for best actress are cher for moonstruck 
glenn close for fatal attraction holly hunter for broadcast 
news sally kirkland for anna and meryl streep for 
ironweed 
cher who was overlooked in the 1986 nominating process for her 
role as a biker mom in mask stunned the oscar audience that 
year in a revealing black sequined spiderweb dress that once again 
made her belly button famous 
i think the navel is definitely out this year said designer 
mr blackwell who puts out an annual list of the worstdressed 
women 
cher wants to give credibility to her acting blackwell 
said i think shell wear something long and boring though 
shell probably wear her hair like medusa

but dull since she was passed over for a nomination for 
mask she purposely made a statement to be noticed at the 
awards he said she wont be conservative this year i can 
assure you of that 
torie steele a beverly hills bastion of haute couture has 
increased its stock of designer entrance and exit gowns for

barbara boettigheimer president of the rodeo drive boutique 
all over glitz is out and real bodyhugging dresses are in 
she said adding that generally only one of each item is ordered at 
the exclusive store to prevent duplication 
sometimes customers get upset because they fall in love with a 
particular dress but we didnt get it in their size said 
bottigheimer whose outfits run between 3000 and 7000 
avoiding duplication is one thing we can offer our clients 
when theyre paying that much for a gown they want to be sure its 
theirs and theirs alone 
dressy pants are on the hit list this season as well and may be 
something to watch for at the awards said los angeles designer 
holly harp whose flowing romantic dresses have graced past oscar 
winners sally field and goldie hawn 
the people who look best are the ones who dress simple but 
still look special harp said its sometimes hard to balance 
beverly hills designer susanna chung who has outfitted julie 
andrews liza minnelli and faye dunaway says long is defintely 
passe 
women want to show off their legs and their bodies and the 
formfitting fabrics this season do so very nicely she said 
mackie who has also been commissioned to design outfits for 
actresses sean young and joan chen and independent producer sherry 
lansing said some ball gowns may even be in evidence at the 
ceremonies 
sherry told me to make her look like a princess mackie said 
of the former 20th century fox productions president she just

former white house political director lyn 
nofziger expects his conviction and 90day prison sentence for 
illegal lobbying to be reversed saying the prosecutor made 
mountains out of molehills and lied 
i am an honorable man nofziger told us district judge 
thomas a flannery who also fined him 30000 on friday like 
other honorable people i have gone through life making mistakes 
doing stupid things but i am not a criminal 
he said independent counsel james c mckay was not an 
honorable man 
nofziger a longtime associate of president reagan shook hands 
with friends and kissed his wife and other family members after the 
sentence was pronounced 
but he reacted angrily when a reporter asked how he felt about 
the sentence calling the question stupid how do you think i 
feel what do you want me to do say i feel great he asked 
reagan and his wife nancy issued a statement from their 
vacation home in california lyn nofziger is a dear friend of 
many years and our prayers are with him 
nofziger 63 said he would not ask reagan for a pardon because 
he was confident the conviction would be overturned on appeal 
flannery delayed imposition of the prison term and fine until the 
appeal is completed 
i thought things were going to go better than they went 
said nofziger expressing surprise at the sentence his lawyers had 
asked that he only be put on probation 
in my heart of hearts i dont believe im going to serve time 
because i dont believe a prison sentence is justified even if i 
were guilty and i repeat that i am not guilty he said 
still nofziger said i do have remorse i am distressed 
beyond measure i trusted in others rather than relying on myself 
i am distressed if i have embarrassed my family and my friends and 
my president 
nofziger charged that prosecutor mckay set out to get me 
because i would not knuckle under because i would not cop a plea 
and because i would not say i was remorseful and i think he 
succeeded 
he makes mountains out of molehills he has exaggerated he 
has misstated and i think he has lied i dont think he is an 
honorable man 
mckay made no statement during the 25minute sentencing hearing 
but in a court filing last week he recommended imprisonment 
contending that nofziger deliberately flouted the ethics law and 
showed no remorse 
there will be some bitterness but were very satisfied with 
what judge flannery has done today mckay said after the 
sentencing 
nofziger was convicted feb 11 of three counts of illegally 
lobbying thenpresidential counselor edwin meese iii and other 
white house aides on behalf of the scandalridden wedtech corp a 
marine engineers union and the manufacturer of the air force a10 
antitank plane 
the contacts were deemed illegal because they occurred within a 
year of nofzigers departure from the white house staff in early 
1982 
flannery imposed the maximum fine but the prison term was far 
lighter than the maximum of two years on each conviction he 
sentenced nofziger to terms of two to eight months for each of the 
three counts but suspended all but 30 days of each to be served 
consecutively he also ordered that nofziger be placed on two years 
probation 
e lawrence barcella one of nofzigers lawyers disputed the 
prosecutions contention that the former white house aide exploited 
his government connections to enrich himself 
mckay in calling for the maximum sentence and fine argued that 
nofziger unjustly enriched himself quoting a presentence report 
as saying nofziger is currently worth 28 million 
nofziger said the figure was inaccurate and told reporters his 
net worth was none of your business

president reagan is turning up the 
heat against panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega by moving 
to halt the flow of american dollars to the central american 
country 
citing the unusual and extraordinary threat of noriegas 
continued rule to the united states and the panamanian people 
reagan invoked the seldomused international emergency economic 
powers act 
invocation of the 1977 law puts teeth in the us government 
quest to freeze panamanian assets and withhold tax payments by 
american businesses and their subsidiaries operating there 
these further steps reaffirm our commitment to democratic 
government in panama and our belief that noriega would best serve 
his country by complying with the instruction of president eric 
arturo delvalle to relinquish his post the president said in a 
letter to house speaker jim wright dtexas 
before reagans move white house chief of staff howard baker 
denied that economic sanctions applied earlier had proved 
unsuccessful 
after all general noriega is a much beleaguered de facto 
leader of the panamanian government he said he is certainly 
not in a comfortable position nor are the people of panama which 
is unfortunate 
presidential aides tried to surgically design imposition of 
the statute in a way to avoid causing longterm damage and the 
collapse of the panamanian economy said a senior administration 
official 
it does have a major impact on trade by strangling the 
financial situation there said the official speaking on grounds 
of anonymity our purpose here is to impact on noriega and not on 
the panamanian economy and the strangulation of the financial 
system seems to be the best way to do this 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that among the steps 
the president ordered under provisions of the law are 
blocking assets of the government of panama in the united 
states 
prohibiting payments by all people and organizations in the 
united states to the noriega regime 
prohibiting payments to the noriega regime by all us citizens 
and organizations in panama including us branches and 
subsidiaries 
it was the first time the law has been invoked since the 
administration used it in the mid1980s to squeeze libyan strongman 
moammar gadhafi thenpresident carter invoked the act against iran 
in the late 1970s 
panamanian assets essentially have been frozen in us 
commercial banks since late march when delvalle obtained an 
injunction from a federal court in miami and the administration 
followed up that by asking the federal reserve board to freeze the 
monies 
the act that reagan resorted to friday merely broadens the 
authority behind the freezing of these assets 
i assume this ensures that the injunctions that were ordered 
at that time remain in effect the administration official said 
under the law that reagan invoked in an executive order 
violators can be prosecuted the criminal penalty is a 10year 
prison sentence and up to 50000 in fines and the civil penalty 
is a 10000 fine 
the latest move stops short of an allout trade embargo and the 
official said it would take another executive order to exercise 
that option 
asked what national security emergency justified reagans 
invoking the seldomused law the official said the presence of 
general noriega who denies the legitimate authority of panama 
the united states interests are very heavily intertwined with 
panamas he said his presence increases the threat to the 
canal the people of panama and our citizens there

president reagan has turned out a 
winner in the taxreform law he championed making more money and 
paying less tax last year than he did in 1986 
the white house on friday released copies of federal tax return 
filed by reagan and his wife nancy it showed their tax liability 
for 1987 was 86638 or 251 percent of their 345359 gross 
income 
in 1986 their tax bill had been 92460 on a total income of 
336640 or 275 percent 
in other words they made 8719 more in 1987 than in 1986 but 
paid 5822 less in federal taxes 
basically i would conclude that tax reform didnt have too 
much of an impact on the reagans said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
it had some effect but not very much fitzwater added 
he said he was not aware of any factors other than tax reform 
that would have allowed reagan to pay less tax on more income 
the sweeping tax reform law applied for the first time to 1987 
returns eliminated many deductions and lowered tax rates for the 
richest americans such as the reagans the maximum rate dropped to 
385 percent last year down from 50 percent in 1986 
reagan had waged an intensive campaign for tax reform making 
speech after speech around the country to prod congress into 
enacting the changes 
the reagans returns provided a glimpse into their private life 
for example mrs reagan sold three drawings by japanese artist 
fojita that she inherited from her mother the late edith luckett 
davis they sold for 33000 and were reported as a 31350 
capital gain after deduction of a sales charge 
the reagans reduced their reportable charitable contributions 
from 30487 in 1986 to 25407 in 1987 the tax return showed 
14095 were given in cash contributions that were not identified 
fitzwater said 214 of that amount were donated by mrs reagan to 
the community foundation of greater washington from residuals for 
appearing on the television shows different strokes and one 
to grow on 
besides the unidentified cash contributions reagan also gave 
11312 to his alma mater eureka college in illinois of that 
amount 1312 was a fee for appearing on the 25th anniversary of 
johnny carsons tonight show 
fitzwater said the contribution total did not include 
nondeductible outlays reagan had made for organ transplant cases 
brought to his attention 
reagan is still drawing royalties from the autobiography he 
wrote years ago earning 281 last year on wheres the rest of 
me 
the reagans signed their tax returns last wednesday well ahead 
of the april 15 filing deadline while vacationing at their 
mountaintop ranch their returns will be audited by the internal 
revenue service as they are every year fitzwater said 
indeed among the 77792 in deductions claimed by the reagans 
are 32200 in legal fees including 7600 for handling a tax 
audit in 1986 
the reagans actually are owed a refund for last year since they 
prepaid 97392 in estimated tax payments and withholding however 
they asked that the 10754 they are owed be applied to their 1988 
tax bill 
in wages the reagans earned 201526 most of it from his 
200000 salary other major sources of income included 54178 in 
interest and 46208 in capital gains 
the blind trust reagan established when he became president to 
keep an arms length from his investments yielded 44766 of the 
interest income he reported it also provided 319 in dividends

back home after logging 16000 miles in a 
failed effort to get arabs and israelis to agree to negotiations 
secretary of state george p shultz says he wont be deterred from 
trying again 
their reluctance to sign on to a twostage us proposal for 
negotiations means one deadline has passed and another almost 
certainly will go by the boards 
the first was shultzs call for a reply by midmarch israel and 
jordan the two key parties did not turn him down but they also 
did not agree to the talks 
the second deadline was midapril the target date for an 
international peace conference that obviously will not happen 
shultz said friday at his last stop in amman jordan 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir simply rejected a 
conference in which he feared the soviet union might try to impose 
terms on israel 
jordans king hussein on the other hand refuses to sit down 
and deal directly with israel unless the united states the soviets 
and the three other permanent members of the united nations 
security council china britain and france play an active role 
china like the soviets has no formal relations with israel and 
invariably backs arab positions 
but despite the deadlines passing shultz is sticking to his 
time line for the negotiations his plan calls for an 
international conference to please hussein but one without much 
power to satisfy shamir 
it would be followed in about two weeks by the opening of 
negotiations to provide selfrule but not statehood to the 15 
million palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
then seven months later fullscale negotiations would begin on 
an overall settlement to attend israel must agree to trade 
territory for peace jordan on the other hand would not be 
guaranteed israel will relinquish all the territories captured in 
the sixday war of 1967 
shultz told the arabs a total withdrawal was just not in the 
cards 
he also opposed creation of a palestinian state and stood firm 
against participation by the plo in the talks 
shultz has all but acknowledged that even if he can get 
negotiations going he cannot expect an agreement in the little 
more than nine months he has left as secretary of state 
but he refuses to give up despite the long odds against success 
whos afraid to struggle against odds he said friday in 
amman you have to be willing to do it what am i saving myself 
for anyway 
ive got a few more months to go here and i want to try to 
leave something constructive for the region and for my successors 
so i am going to put my back into it why not 
shultz has made three trips to the region in six months 
measuring the progress in inches 
in 10 days he is due to go to moscow to plan the next 
superpower summit meeting he will have another session with 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in midmay and then attend 
the summit itself with president reagan at the end of the month 
the new nuclear weapons reduction treaty reagan and general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev plan to sign is far from ready 
however 
and there are lots of problems on shultzs desk including the 
turmoil in panama and completing an agreement with the soviet union 
to withdraw the red army from afghanistan 
but he plans to go back to the middle east 
i will find the time shultz said

a judge ruled friday that real 
estate tycoon donald trump was entitled to an 86000 tax break on 
maralago after he challenged the countys assessment on the 
118room mansion 
circuit judge richard burk ruled friday that trump was 
responsible for taxes on the 17acre estates 7 million purchase 
price rather than an 115 million assessment made by the palm 
beach county property appraisers office 
maralago was built in 1926 by cereal heiress marjorie 
merriweather post trumps purchase in 1985 was the first time the 
estate had been sold 
robb maass trumps attorney said burks decision was a very 
proper way of looking at the market value 
gaylord wood a fort lauderdale attorney who represented palm 
beach county property appraiser rebecca walker said the decision 
would be appealed 
donald trump has demonstrated once again that there is no one 
better in this country at buying things for less than what they are 
worth ms wood said 
trump challenged the assessment in a 1987 lawsuit after the 
county said he owed 208000 in taxes trump contended that the 
bill should only be 122000 including a 4 percent discount for 
early payment 
in a prepared statement trump said historic properties such as 
maralago are often overassessed so the ruling constituted a 
victory for property owners who have preserved rather than razed 
buildings 
in his ruling burk wrote that trumps 7 million purchase price 
established maralagos market value because the estate has no 
equal 
surely in this case one sale does in fact make a market

the democratic candidate for a north 
louisiana congressional seat has returned to the campaign trail 
after losing an eye in a car accident and his republican opponent 
may be as happy as anyone to see him back 
foster campbell a state senator who suffered other severe 
injuries in the accident faces former congressional aide jim 
mccrery in the april 16 election to fill the seat left vacant when 
buddy roemer became governor on march 14 
the winner in the 4th district race will serve only the 
remainder of the unexpired term in congress and must run for 
reelection in the fall when all louisiana congressional seats are 
on the ballot 
each candidate claims to be the ideological heir of roemer a 
conservative democrat who often sided with the republican 
president they were locked in a close battle before campbells 
march 13 accident en route to baton rouge 
campbells car plunged into a 13inchdeep hole where workers 
had been replacing a section of concrete on interstate 49 his 
right eye was ruptured his nose left cheekbone and upper jaw were 
broken 
mccrery scaled back his campaign while campbell was 
recuperating and campbells wife appeared in his place she proved 
to be a personable standin for her husband and mccrery found it 
difficult to campaign against her facetoface 
she doesnt address any issues mccrery complained in an 
interview im the only one at risk in those situations 
campbell resumed campaigning thursday night at a fundraiser in 
shreveport and he said the painful accident had helped his 
campaign citing polls indicating he held a slight advantage over 
mccrery 
i think a lot of people view me now as a person who wont 
quit he said with campbell back in the race both candidates 
resumed the tough campaign tactics they had used before the 
accident 
campbell immediately accused his opponent of representing the 
lobbyists and special interests 
ive been lobbying for good things not voting for bad 
things said mccrery the former regional manager for government 
affairs with georgia pacific corp 
then he called campbell a crony of former gov edwin edwards 
the oncepopular governor who lost a reelection bid to roemer as 
the states economy declined and rumors of corruption circulated 
about the state capital 
responded campbell i voted with edwin edwards when he was 
right and when he was wrong i voted against him 
campbell noted that mccrery only recently switched from the 
democratic party to the gop and has never held elective office 
i think mr mccrery is a strict opportunist campbell said 
well see what the voters think about that

a hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in 
the atlantic ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas 
but says its impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten 
populated areas 
william gray a professor of atmospheric science at colorado 
state university said friday he expects about six atlantic 
hurricanes this year the average for the last 40 years but above 
average for the decade 
the atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the 
last six hurricane seasons those years brought just two to five 
hurricanes each except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985 
the hurricane season officially begins june 1 and its most 
active period usually begins aug 1 
gray who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual 
hurricane forecasts each year since 1984 will issue his first 
formal 1988 forecast in late may he issued an early outlook 
friday for the 10th annual national hurricane conference 
it is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does 
form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average 
hurricanes of the last six years except for the 1985 season 
gray said in a paper presented to the conference 
but gray said his models of air pressure winds around the 
equator and winds for el nino periods when eastern pacific 
waters are warmer than usual do not allow for predictions of when 
or where a hurricane might form 
gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterly 
winds at the equator and the approaching end of el nino period 
gray predicted four hurricanes last season and three actually 
occurred his prediction of four in 1986 was on the money and he 
originally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figure 
to seven the eventual correct number in 1985 in 1984 when there 
were five hurricanes gray had predicted seven 
drought in west africa is responsible for a drop in atlantic 
hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s gray said he said the drought 
has robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start their 
escalation into hurricanes 
that pattern eventually will change he said but it is 
impossible to say when this shift will occur 
forecasters and emergency management officials at the conference 
stressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during the 
lull in hurricanes a surge in storms up to the levels of the 
1950s and 1960s could bring unprecedented damage they said

a decision last year by saudi arabia to reduce 
import subsidies has made a big impact on world barley trade 
including us shipments says the agriculture department 
barley is not a huge crop nationally but it is important to 
many farmers and is an essential part of the us food machine 
last year by comparison barley output was 527 million bushels 
and corn 706 billion bushels 
world barley trade grew explosively over the last two decades 
and has shown signs of leveling off only in the last year says 
pete riley of the departments economic research service 
barley trade accelerated during the 1980s when world traffic in 
other grains experienced severe contractions riley said the gains 
were supported by increases in exportable barley supplies and by 
export subsidies notably by the european economic community the 
largest exporter 
one of the key factors in demand has been the dramatic rise in 
imports by saudi arabia now the worlds largest barley importer 
sparked by import subsidies he said 
besides the eec the main barley exporters are canada the 
united states and australia others which are comparatively small 
include austria finland new zealand and sweden and finland and 
sweden are expected to become net importers riley said 
the most remarkable barley development has been the increase in 
saudi arabias imports from less than 100000 metric tons in the 
mid1970s to 85 million tons in 198687 import subsidies 
equivalent to 81 per ton 176 per bushel were the key factor 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 459 bushels 
of barley 
riley said the saudi import subsidies sometimes exceeded the 
price of the grain itself 
the reason for such large subsidies was saudi arabias 
commitment to improve consumer diets and to support a large number 
of sheep imported live every year for moslem pilgrims he said as 
imports increased so did saudi reserve stockpiles of barley 
but the import subsidies were reduced 67 percent last september 
and saudi imports are expected to decline in 198788 to 55 million 
tons even so saudi arabia will still be the leading barley 
importer well above the next largest the soviet union which is 
expected to import 3 million tons 
in addition to budget considerations one motivation for the 
saudi cut in subsidies was an attempt to increase domestic 
production riley said in the april issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine recent increases in the producer price have failed to 
bring a big response and 198788 output is forecast at less than 
150000 tons 
meanwhile us barley production could decline this year from 
the 1987 harvest of 527 million bushels which was down from the 
record of 6105 million bushels in 1986 north dakota is the 
leading barley producer with 1392 million bushels last year 
according to a recent usda report farmers may plant 103 
million acres for harvest in 1988 down 7 percent from last year 
barley exports in the 198788 marketing year which runs through 
may 31 are forecast at 115 million bushels down from 137 million 
last season in 198586 us barley exports were reported at 22 
million bushels

the soviet union has bought an additional 
500000 metric tons of us wheat subsidized prices the 
agriculture department reports 
the sale equal to about 184 million bushels was handled by 
the peavey co 300000 tons cargill inc 50000 artfer inc 
50000 garnac grain co inc 50000 and louis dreyfus corp 
50000 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said friday the grain was sold under 
terms of the longterm grain agreement between the united states 
and the soviet union 
sims said the subsidies averaged 2161 per ton or about 59 
cents per bushel of wheat 
no selling prices were announced but wheat has been averaging 
about 272 per bushel recently according to the usda that could 
mean a farm value of about 50 million 
the pact which expires sept 30 calls on moscow to buy at 
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the 
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
if more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year the soviets 
are required to seek us approval the soviets were given approval 
to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans 
so far the soviets have bought more than 85 million tons of 
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year as well as 41 
million tons of nonsubsidized corn 818400 tons of us soybeans 
and 13 million tons of soybean meal 
subsidies are provided under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep private exporters are given surplus commodities 
owned by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
the subsidies or bonuses have run between less than 20 to 
more than 40 per ton roughly 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
sims said the soviets have more than 510000 tons remaining in 
their current eep authorization an additional 1 million tons were 
announced on april 4 plus some left over from earlier 
authorizations

a judge refused friday to place mario 
cuomos name on californias june 7 presidential primary ballot 
but cuomo backers said they would appeal the ruling next week 
the draft cuomo for president committee filed suit monday 
against secretary of state march fong eu after she ruled that the 
new york governor had to be actively seeking the democratic 
nomination to qualify under california law for a place on the 
ballot 
eu also rejected the estimated 17000 signatures the committee 
had submitted on cuomos behalf because they did not meet the 
minimum of 500 signatures required from each of californias 45 
congressional districts for a candidate to get on the presidential 
ballot by petition 
paul demarco attorney for the cuomo committee argued in 
superior court friday that cuomos active support of the effort was 
not required under a portion of state law that directs eu to place 
on the ballot the names of persons generally advocated for the 
nomination 
but superior court judge cecily bond ruled that the section 
applied only to people actively seeking the presidential nomination 
she also rejected demarcos argument that the requirement of 500 
signatures per congressional district was burdensome noting that 
statewide initiatives routinely qualify for the ballot by petitions 
of up to 1 million signatures 
eus attorney richard nishite said saturday was the final day 
to add or delete anything from the june 7 ballot 
as certified by eu californias democratic ballot includes the 
names of massachusetts gov michael dukakis sen albert gore the 
rev jesse jackson lyndon larouche and sen paul simon the names 
of vice president george bush sen bob dole and pat robertson will 
appear on the republican ballot

jimmy swaggart and the nations largest 
pentecostal denomination walked away from each other after the 
church said it was defrocking him for rejecting its punishment for 
moral failure 
swaggart on friday announced his resignation from the assemblies 
of god shortly after the church said it was ousting him for 
refusing to undergo a years suspension from the pulpit and at 
least two years of rehabilitation 
the punishment was ordered after swaggart confessed publicly to 
unspecified sins though never proven but also never disputed it 
was widely reported that swaggart had committed lewd acts with a 
new orleans prostitute 
a woman who said she was that prostitute said swaggart paid her 
50 a visit to pose nude for him another defrocked assemblies of 
god minister rev marvin gorman of suburban new orleans 
reportedly hired men who photographed swaggart with the woman 
outside a motel 
swaggart at a friday news conference at which he refused to 
answer questions said his dismissal was inevitable but that 
leaving the church was vital to save his bible college and 140 
millionayear world ministry 
because of the nature of this situation we are forced to take 
a position that does not answer all of the questions nor solve all 
of the problems but we feel we have no alternative or choice 
swaggart said 
asked if that meant swaggart would form his own church his 
lawyer william treeby replied this ministry is an independent 
church and always has been 
shortly before swaggart made his announcement the executive 
presbytery of the assemblies of god headquartered in springfield 
mo said it had dismissed him as a minister for refusing to accept 
the churchs recommended punishment 
the churchs decision was announced in springfield by the rev 
g raymond carlson general superintendent of the church after he 
and other members of the executive presbytery met by telephone 
conference call 
earlier friday the church had received what carlson described 
as a gracious letter from swaggart in which the evangelist 
refused to accept the churchs terms carlson declined to release 
details of swaggarts letter 
the rev everett stenhouse assistant superintendent of the 
assemblies said swaggarts chances of returning to the church are 
slim it would be a long trail back if at all he said 
swaggart voluntarily stepped down from his pulpit feb 21 after 
a tearful public confession of moral failure before his wife 
son and congregation gathered in his family worship center 
he later agreed to accept a punishment originally recommended by 
louisiana church officials a threemonth suspension and two years 
of counseling but the national church insisted on the more 
stringent discipline 
swaggart said friday he would stick to the punishment initially 
decided by the louisiana church officials under that punishment he 
would not preach sermons until may 22 although he has been 
witnessing at church services 
the scandal rocked swaggarts baton rouge church tv and school 
complex about 100 workers were fired and jimmy swaggart bible 
college students and faculty are said to be clamoring to transfer 
to other religious institutions 
swaggarts ministry brought in an estimated 142 million last 
year and his sermons are broadcast in more than 100 countries he 
has been known for his harsh denunciations of the sins of others 
including two other prominent assemblies ministers brought down by 
scandal 
ptl founder jim bakker lost his assemblies credentials after a 
sexandmoney scandal last year bakker did not opt for 
rehabilitation 
swaggart also was said to have been instrumental in the downfall 
of gorman who said the action friday involving swaggart further 
proves the truth of the allegations i made in a 17 million 
lawsuit he filed against swaggart in march 1987 in it gorman 
blamed swaggart for destroying his ministry

john zaccaro jr was a wellorganized drug 
dealer who was known as the pharmacist a prosecutor said in 
the cocaine trial of the son of former vice presidential candidate 
geraldine ferraro 
in opening arguments friday a defense lawyer for zaccaro now 
24 conceded that his client had sold cocaine but said he was 
tricked into making the sale by an attractive female agent the 
trial was to continue today 
undercover agent laura manning a state police officer 
testified that she went to zaccaros apartment during the 
middlebury college winter carnival with instructions to buy a 
quarter gram of cocaine 
manning testified that zaccaro was not home when she first went 
to his offcampus apartment on feb 20 1986 but he answered the 
door when she returned an hour later and said she was looking for 
john 
when asked what she said to zaccaro manning responded i 
said a couple of people told me that you could sell me some 
coke 
and what did he say asked addison county states attorney 
john quinn 
sure manning quoted zaccaro as responding she added he 
pulled a tray from under the couch 
the tray manning said contained about 15 packets of cocaine in 
a plastic bag with the packets marked by weight 
charles tetzlaff zaccaros lawyer accused police of entrapment 
the defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a 
regulated drug tetzlaff said this is a case of improper and 
overzealous police conduct 
tetzlaff said an attractive female police officer who had 
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped zaccaro 
into making the sale he said it was manning not zaccaro who 
brought up the subject of drugs and a purchase 
tetzlaff questioned manning in detail about what she wore to 
zaccaros apartment and whether her jeans were tight and her 
jacket open 
manning said she was told to dress like a college student she 
said she wore an open jean jacket a yellow vneck sweater and 
jeans which were not tight 
quinn the prosecutor conceded in his opening arguments that 
manning was inexperienced but he asked jurors to remember the 
middlebury police department is a lowbudget smalltown operation 
it was difficult even for police to to scrap together 30 for 
the drug purchase he said 
the prosecutor painted a picture of zaccaro as a wellorganized 
drug dealer 
when he takes a packet off the tray he opens it up being the 
good merchant that he is looks at it wraps it up and gives 
it to manning quinn said 
police began investigating zaccaro after receiving a note 
containing zaccaros name address car registration and the words 
the pharmacist quinn said zaccaro earned the nickname on 
campus because of his reputation as a drug dealer authorities say

sick and the refusal to refuel the jetliner is causing the 
sickness said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity

pilot at one point do whatever you want crash on the tarmac or 
in the sea we shall not let you land here

declared at the airport 
foreign minister george iacovou went there to try to establish

terrorists jailed in kuwait for bombing the us and french 
embassies there in 1983 the demand echoed that of proiranian 
extremists holding us hostages in lebanon 
the captain in a calm voice called the larnaca airports tower 
and requested fuel but did not say if the hijackers wanted to take 
off again 
the tower said that since it was a holiday in cyprus the 
airport could only provide him with about 8000 gallons less than 
a quarter of what a jumbo jet can hold 
please give us all you can the pilot responded 
a hijacker then told the tower that if the 17 prisoners in 
kuwait were not freed the passengers and the plane are in 
extreme danger 
he said his groups struggle is against imperialism and 
zionism and continuing until martyrdom or victory

for landing permission saying he was out of fuel this is a real 
emergency he kept repeating

on a bangkokkuwait flight nd diverted to mashhad airport the 
hijackers freed 57 people there on tuesday and wednesday 
those released initially put the number of hijackers at five or 
six but diplomats who debriefed the freed passengers in kuwait 
said some mentioned as many as 10 hijackers 
iran originally refused to allow the plane to take off blocking 
runways at mashhad but the hijackers brought a man to the top of 
the stairway and fired three warning shots then tossed a grenade 
out the door the islamic republic news agency reported it did not 
say if it exploded 
a passenger was forced into the cockpit and beaten said the 
news agency monitored in nicosia the hijackers first threatened 
to kill a passenger then said they would blow the plane up if they 
werent allowed to take off 
as the plane left mashhad the hijackers radioed a message to 
the emir of kuwait saying he must comply with their demands or they 
will blow up the plane irna said

runways of beirut airport which is run by syrian troops the 
beirut control tower told the captain if you try to land by 
force the plane will be fired on

an 11yearold boy said hes learned 
it pays to fight for what he believes in after school officials 
rescinded his suspension and allowed him to return to class without 
cutting off his mohawk haircut 
matt youngs who was suspended for refusing to cut a haircut 
authorities deemed disruptive will be allowed back in school 
monday officials said friday 
superintendent alson dougherty said a potential court battle 
over youngs hair wasnt worth the trouble the boy can wear his 
hair as he pleases the superintendent said 
i want it back to normal the boy said of his hectic week 
i want to wear my hair the way it is and not be hassled 
youngs was suspended for five days because school officials said 
his haircut was an embarrassment to the school dougherty said 
matts hair was long in the back shaved on the sides and given a 
brush cut on top 
never has so little hair caused so much consternation among so 
many folks dougherty said 
the boys parents william and clifta youngs said they didnt 
necessarily like their sons haircut but they liked even less the 
school system telling matt he had to change it 
the youngs said they were willing to go to court to defend 
matts right to wear his hair the way he liked 
its grown all out of proportion to the reality of the 
situation dougherty said after announcing that matt would be 
welcomed back at sackets harbor central school 
a court fight could drag on for years building up enormous 
lawyers fees he said adding that he couldnt justify making 
taxpayers foot the bill 
he may be a graduate by the time a court fight is resolved 
dougherty said 
matt and three of his friends first cut their hair in the mohawk 
fashion about three months ago on march 16 principal robert 
wagoner jr wrote to the boys parents saying the boys would be 
suspended if they did not change their hair all but matts parents 
complied 
since his suspension matt said he has received a couple of 
dozen letters mostly from people urging him not to give in he 
also received several calls from radio stations wanting to 
interview him 
its hard waking up at 8 in the morning to talk to djs he 
said

the independent counsel in the irancontra 
criminal case is fighting claims that congressional testimony by 
three of the defendants is being improperly used against them 
a court filing made friday by lawrence e walshs office denies 
a defense charge prosecutors illegally relied on the congressional 
testimony given by former national security adviser john m 
poindexter lt col oliver l north and arms dealer albert hakim 
defendants involvement in the activities underlying the 
indictment had been fully identified prior to any of their 
immunized testimony walshs office said in a brief filed by 
herbert j stern a former federal judge hired to handle the 
congressional immunity issue 
the government represents that the overwhelming majority of 
its caseinchief will consist of witnesses known to it and 
documents obtained or requested by it before any of the defendants 
gave immunized testimony the prosecution brief said 
walshs office opposed a defense motion to dismiss the 23count 
indictment on the grounds that prosecutors impermissibly based 
their case on the three defendants congressional testimony which 
was given under grants of limited immunity from prosecution 
it also urged us district judge gerhard a gesell to deny the 
defense request for a hearing on the congressional immunity issue 
the defense claims that forcing poindexter north and hakim to 
stand trial on charges of conspiring to illegally divert proceeds 
of the usiran arms sales to the nicaraguan rebels would violate 
their fifth amendment protection against selfincrimination because 
they were compelled to testify before congress 
a fourth defendant retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord testified at last years congressional hearings without 
such an immunity grant 
under the law walsh is prohibited from using the congressional 
testimony of north poindexter and hakim as evidence against him 
he must also prove that he built his case independently of that 
immunized testimony 
but the prosecution brief argued that any statements north 
poindexter or hakim made voluntarily before congress could be used 
as evidence against them in the criminal proceeding 
the immunity statute like the fifth amendment protects only 
compelled disclosures the prosecutors brief said in 
contrast the privilege does not protect voluntary answers or the 
spontaneous outpouring of testimony 
without identifying any voluntary statements the prosecution 
offered to forgo introducing such testimony as evidence if gesell 
denies the defense request for what stern called a massive 
multimonth hearing 
the defendants request for discovery is testimony to their 
intent to use pretrial proceedings to delay their trial by jury 
and obtain unparalleled discovery in a criminal case stern said 
defense lawyers asked to question prosecutors and grand jurors 
about whether they learned of the congressional testimony of north 
poindexter and hakim they also want to examine documents to 
determine if walsh relied on the congressional testimony for leads 
stern said the prosecution should be allowed to submit for 
gesells review sufficient evidence documents and witness 
interviews all collected or requested before the immunized 
testimony to demonstate that it is not unfair to place the 
defendants on trial

the government is preparing to publish rules 
to guard against employee cheating during random drug testing of 
federal workers in sensitive assignments according to a published 
report 
the guidelines to appear monday in the federal register will 
require that toilet water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of 
samples and that temperature readings be taken from the samples to 
detect substitution the washington post said in todays editions 
according to an agreement with congress the printing of the 
guidelines must be followed with a certification by the health and 
human services department that all federal agencies have a 
drugtesting program that meets the regulations 
although all agencies have submitted plans outlining who will be 
tested and for what drugs the final certification date was 
unclear agencies will be required to test for cocaine and 
marijuana but may test for pcp opiates and amphetamines 
finally the office of management and budget must provide 
congress with an estimate of implementation costs before the 
regulations become effective the working estimate is thought to be 
about 7 million the paper said 
the new guidelines draw heavily on the experience of the testing 
which has been conducted in the military for the last seven years 
currently the department of transportation which began a program 
last year is the only nonmilitary agency testing employees in 
sensitive jobs 
the american federation of government employees which has filed 
suit in federal district court in new orleans against earlier 
informal standards contends the random drug testing violates 
workers constitutional rights

in jail on each of the three counts of violating florida wildlife 
laws a spokesman for the game and fresh water fish commission said 
friday 
one of the western cougars was killed march 9 after being struck 
by a car near capps about 15 miles east of tallahassee said henry 
cabbage public information supervisor for the commission 
an investigation led two game officers to turners avalon 
plantation near capps the commission said turner staffers told 
the officers that he had ordered the animals brought from his 
plantation in south carolina and released into the wild at avalon 
cabbage said 
assistant state attorney jim hintz said he filed two counts of 
importing nonnative wild animals one each for the bears and 
cougars and one count of possessing such animals the charges were 
filed march 30 in monticello 
a secretary at turner broadcasting system headquarters in 
atlanta said he was traveling and unavailable for comment friday

come to florida but said it didnt state why 
hintz said turner wouldnt be arrested but would be served with 
a summons asking him to appear or be represented by counsel at a

south carolina and release them on his florida property but it was 
denied cabbage said no permit had been sought for the cougars 
game officials will try to capture the other cougar but the 
bears will be allowed to roam free because it would be impossible

presidential contenders michael dukakis and albert gore jr both 
are sounding antidrug themes as they battle for democratic support 
in new york while jesse jackson tries to make peace with the 
states jewish voters 
but while jackson said friday his campaign would continue to 
heal relationships with the jewish community aides said he wont 
have time to meet with jewish leaders concerned that he is 
antiisrael 
in the republican race meanwhile vice president george bush 
hit the campaign trail friday for the first time since bob dole 
quit the race and pat robertson switched his campaign into low gear 
on a visit to fort worth texas bush said he was delighted with 
the slim competition he faces for republican delegates and 
wouldnt trade places with the three democrats scrambling for 
their partys nomination 
nevertheless he said he wasnt banking on democratic infighting 
to pave his way to the oval office 
i wish i thought the democrats would have a unity problem but 
i dont think they will bush said im not counting on the 
blood on the floor that exists at this moment to carry over and 
cause the democrats to hemorrhage to death 
back in new york jackson campaign aide gerald austin said his 
boss would not accept a request to meet with the jewish community 
relations council because weve already answered all these 
questions i dont see why we have to go to a meeting to answer all 
the questions again 
the questions revolve around jacksons use of the phrase 
hymietown during his 1984 campaign his past association with 
nation of islam leader louis farrakhan who has called judaism a 
gutter religion and his closeness to the palestinian cause 
jackson himself had plenty of conciliatory words for jewish 
voters as he campaigned across new york and long island in advance 
of the states april 19 primary 
visiting the posh sardis restaurant in manhattan jackson 
recalled the days when it was commonplace to see signs that said 
blacks and jews and dogs are not welcome 
our commitment is to end any vestiges of racism of 
antisemitism or sexism he said weve sent a message no one 
can miss 
dukakis and gore meanwhile both had harsh words for the 
effectiveness of the reagan administrations antidrug efforts and 
pledged to do better if elected 
speaking at a senior citizens center on long island dukakis 
promised hed wage a real war not a phony war on drugs 
in latin america the gravest threat to our security comes not 
from the sandinistas but from drugs the massachusetts governor 
said earlier in a speech at st johns university 
gore was advancing a similar theme 
the administration declared a war against drugs and drugs 
won the tennessee senator told an audience on long island 
theyve got to say yes to funding for drug programs 
the 255 democratic delegates at stake in new yorks primary make 
the state a crucial battleground for dukakis jackson and gore 
none thus far are close to the 2082 delegates needed to gain the 
democratic nomination 
dukakis holds a slight lead with 74505 delegates compared 
with jacksons 70855 and gores 3958 illinois sen paul simon 
with 1715 delegates remains on the candidates roster but has 
suspended all campaign activities 
new york gov mario cuomo whose endorsement has been courted 
unsuccessfully by the democratic candidates revealed hed already 
voted by absentee ballot for one of the contenders but refused to 
say which one 
cuomo said he was discussing making campaign appearances for all 
three active democratic candidates as time permits 
ill go anywhere with them he said

campaign he ran from his cell he was indicted in december 1986 on

friday that bottles soon will carry a singledigit number inside a 
triangle to help guide recyclers

trash disposal should make room for recycling incineration

almost all recycling markets are designed to handle one kind of 
plastic at a time though various efforts are under way to develop 
techniques to separate mixed plastics

windhoek southwest africa ap president pw botha decreed 
broadened powers for his chief representative in this 
pretoriaruled territory insisting the rights of whites and other 
minorities must be protected 
the official administratorgeneral louis pienaar will be 
empowered to take action against subversive media arrange for 
regional or racially based elections and refer certain major court 
rulings to south africas appellate court 
cabinet ministers complained that the new powers announced by 
botha friday during a visit to windhoek amounted to greater south 
african intervention in the affairs of this territory alsk known as 
namibia 
botha after a threehour meeting with the territorys 
multiracial cabinet also indicated he might accept proposals to 
eliminate most racially segregated political structures 
finance minister dirk mudge a white moderate said he hoped 
pienaar would consult with the cabinet rather than acting 
singlehandedly to perpetuate a whitesonly political structure 
also friday archbishop desmond tutu flew with other anglican 
bishops to the territorys northern region of ovambo 
tutu an outspoken critic of botha and south africas system of 
apartheid spoke to 1500 exuberent worshippers at a wardamaged 
mission center near the angolan border 
in windhoek more than 100 supporters of the southwest african 
peoples organization staged an antibotha demonstration outside a 
downtown hotel holding up placards with slogans such as stop 
sucking our blood and take your puppet government to pretoria 
swapo which has been waging a guerrilla war against south 
african rule for 22 years claims overwhelming support in ovambo 
home of 55 percent of namibias people 
niko bessinger an official of swapos legal political wing 
said botha was manipulating the territorial cabinet as part of a 
divide and rule strategy aimed at avoiding oneman onevote 
national elections 
pienaar said it was virtually certain the interim government 
botha installed in 1985 would be allowed to repeal a controversial 
1980 proclamation that establishes 11 ethnically based secondtier 
governments in namibia 
blacks who make up 88 percent of namibias 13 million people 
complain the system provides disproportionate benefits for the 
white and mixedrace communities each of which makes up 6 percent 
of the population 
pienaar said the 1980 proclamation would be repealed only when 
provisions were adopted to ensure that the cultural and linguistic 
rights of minorities were protected 
the interim government favors total repeal of apartheidstyle 
laws but a white and mixedrace party supports retention of 
racially segregated structures 
botha reiterated that south africa will not agree to the un 
call for namibian independence until all cuban troops withdraw from 
neighboring marxistruled angola 
namibia is the main staging point for south african troops who 
are fighting in angola in support of rebels 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services

negotiators suspended talks on setting 
up contra rebel ceasefire zones with the sandinistas calling the 
rebels intransigent for demanding they be allowed to receive 
military supplies inside the zones 
military leaders of the two sides met six times in the southern 
border town of sapoa to negotiate precise locations sizes and 
rules governing conduct inside the zones 
a preliminary peace agreement signed march 23 by sandinista and 
contra leaders calls for the ussupported rebel fighters to 
gather inside the zones by april 15 
but the contra military delegation abruptly abandoned fridays 
meeting and immediately left in vehicles for the costa rican border 
without comment 
maj gen joaquin cuadra head of the sandinista delegation 
termed fridays talks very serious and said rebel negotiators 
had been intransigent in demanding they be allowed to maintain 
military supplies inside their zones 
the sapoa peace accord permits humanitarian assistance to the 
rebels to be administered by a neutral international organization 
cuadra said the technical talks would be resumed alongside 
highlevel negotiations between the sandinistas and the nicaraguan 
resistance the contra umbrella group next friday in managua 
they will try to negotiate a permanent end to the war which has 
killed more than 40000 a 60day ceasefire went into effect april 
1 
cuadra said the rebel technical delegation didnt have 
sufficient authority to respond to a 25point government proposal 
outlining contra activity inside the zones the proposal addressed 
food assistance to the rebels and verification procedures 
cuadra said the government proposal was based on the sapoa 
accords and the central american peace plan signed by the regions 
five presidents aug 7 
the contra team had proposed its own 34point plan on thursday 
among other conditions it demanded the rebels be allowed to 
receive military assistance recover military supplies and maintain 
a munitions stock and have access to air delivery of necessary 
supplies 
cuadra dismissed the rebel proposal as seeking to violate the 
sovereign rights of the nicaraguan republic 
on thursday the two sides had agreed on defining the location 
of seven contra zones 
cuadra said he hoped negotiators could resolve outstanding 
differences at the april 15 meeting 
president daniel ortega was quoted in newspapers friday as 
saying the contras signed the preliminary accord because they had 
been defeated militarily after nearly seven years of war and 
never held an inch of territory 
the sandinista newspaper barricada said the president explained 
that the contras would move into the zones lay down their weapons 
and return to civilian life 
but the contras say they will never put down their weapons until 
nicaragua is on an irreversible road to democracy 
in copenhagen denmark on friday a sandinista official 
commandant victor tirado told a news conference that the 
sandinista government is dissatisfied with the way the truce is 
taking shape 
we cannot be satisfied with developments the past few days 
he said the contras took part in setting the dates for the 
ceasefire and then they start breaking the accord themselves 
tirado is one of the nine commanders of the ruling sandinista 
national liberation front 
tirado was in denmark for a conference on central america 
organized by the danish social democratic party and the trade union 
congress

john demjanjuk a retired auto worker awaiting 
a verdict in israel on charges that he committed war crimes as a 
nazi death camp guard during world war ii has filed a lawsuit to 
regain his us citizenship 
demjanjuk who lost his citizenship in 1981 alleges in the suit 
filed friday in us district court that the justice departments 
office of special investigations withheld evidence that would have 
helped prove his innocence 
a federal judge ruled that demjanjuk lied to conceal from us 
authorities his alleged past as the brutal guard ivan the terrible 
at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland 
demjanjuk 68 was extradited in 1986 to israel he had lived in 
the cleveland suburb of seven hills 
weve acquired documents through unknown sources that really 
lay out plain and clear what osis intentions were from the 
beginning that they did not believe mr demjanjuk was in fact 
ivan the terrible and they went ahead and prosecuted him and 
suppressed the evidence that would help him prove his case said 
ed nishnic demjanjuks soninlaw 
justice department spokesman john russell said demjanjuk has 
been unsuccessful in a number of appeals in the case and we will 
respond in court to the present suit 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk says hes a victim of mistaken 
identity and was never at the treblinka camp demjanjuk has 
admitted lying on his immigration papers but says he did so 
because he feared execution if he returned to the soviet union 
after the war 
demjanjuk says he served in the soviet army was captured by the 
germans in 1941 and remained in prisonerofwar camps until 1943 
he claims he was not at treblinka as alleged in 1942 and 1943 
the israeli judges are expected to render a verdict april 18 
the case to recover his citizenship is based on material 
obtained through the freedom of information act and justice 
department documents sent anonymously to the family 
according to demjanjuks suit government investigators 
interviewed 71 people but only disclosed the existence of 31 
interviews to defense attorneys and released only 11 statements 
the suit also alleges that the government failed to reveal that 
most of the people interviewed failed to identify demjanjuk or 
their identification was flawed

four americans including two us 
congressmen accepted an offer today to join vietnams foreign 
minister on a helicopter search for americans possibly still alive 
in the nation one of the group said 
bill hendon a former us congressman from north carolina said 
he and three others already had applied for visas to vietnam at 
hanois office at the united nations in new york 
we accept without reservation foreign minister nguyen co 
thachs invitation for onsite inspection of vietnamese prisons we 
say hold us prisoners of war hendon quoted a telegram the 
group sent today to the countrys un office 
there was no immediate comment from vietnamese officials 
thach told visiting us sen larry pressler rsd in hanoi 
earlier this week that if any congressmen presented evidence of 
american pows in vietnam he would personally accompany them by 
helicopter to investigate 
if pows were found vietnam would cover expenses of the 
investigation while the americans would pay if none were found 
thach reportedly told pressler 
the vietnamese official apparently did not spell out what 
evidence congressmen had to present before an investigation trip 
was launched 
thach had made the offer previously but nobody had taken him up 
on it he and other vietnamese officials often react angrily to 
american charges that hanoi still holds pows from the vietnam war 
which ended in 1975 when communist north vietnam defeated 
ussupported south vietnam 
in a telephone interview from washington hendon said his group 
was certain there were americans still in captivity and that they 
would guide thach to prisons where they are being held 
hendon gave no other details about the locations of the prisons 
or the numbers allegedly being held 
hendon said others in the group were rep john rowland rconn 
rep robert smith rnh and eugene mcdaniel a retired us navy 
pilot and a pow in vietnam for six years 
mcdaniel and hendon are members of the american defense 
institute a conservative study group which focuses on the issue of 
amerian mias and pows in vietnam cambodia and laos 
last september hendon led a group of americans to thailands 
mekong river boundary with laos where they floated plastic bags 
containing offers of a 24 million reward for the rescue of us 
pows in indochina 
the reward money had been pledged in part by 21 us congressmen

an israeli girls death in 
a clash with arabs was a watershed in four months of violence 
radicalizing jewish settlers many fear it presages a more savage 
conflict in the occupied lands 
the killing of tirza porat on wednesday shocked the nation but 
the general feeling had been that it was only a matter of time 
before a jew living in these disputed hills would die because of 
the arab rebellion 
ironically israeli media reported friday that it was likely the 
girl was slain by a bullet fired from the rifle of a jewish settler 
guarding her and not by a rock flung by an arab as the army 
previously reported 
the reports said the guard may have inadvertantly fired on tirza 
still many settlers blamed their government accusing it of 
creating an atmosphere of leniency toward arabs that made the 
confrontation possible 
one of the sorest points to the 850000 arabs in the west bank 
which they call occupied palestine is the presence of 65000 
jewish settlers in the land israel calls by the biblical names 
judea and samaria 
the israelis have ruled the west bank and gaza strip since 
capturing them from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
israel is a castrated giant afraid to deport arabs afraid to 
really punish rioters said eliakim haetzni a lawyer and leader 
in the kiryat arba settlement 
weve reached the point where the last arab urchin in the last 
alley in the last refugee camp is no longer afraid of our 
government or our army so of course they attack jewish children 
he told the associated press 
benny katzover head of the settlement council said if our 
leaders dont take steps to stop the arabs now they will not be 
able to stop jews from taking things in their own hands 
palestinians fear that now settlers will retaliate against 
palestinians everywhere said mubarak awad an arabamerican who 
advocates nonviolent resistance 
soon the army will have to make a decision about who is 
running the show if it is the settlers that means there will be 
more killings on both sides 
jewish settlers enraged by tirzas death raided arab villages 
under cover of night beating palestinians and smashing windows of 
arabowned homes and cars near the settlements of kiryat arba and 
elon moreh where the girl lived 
tirza 15 and other teenagers from elon moreh were on a 
passover holiday hike accompanied by two adult guards they 
encountered stonethrowing palestinians and were led to beita 
where the fatal clash occurred 
two arabs also were killed and 141 have died since violence 
began in the occupied territories dec 8 according to un 
figures one israeli soldier was stabbed to death but tirza is the 
first israeli citizen killed 
settlers carried guns at her funeral on a west bank hillside at 
midday thursday some shouted revenge revenge despite 
admonitions from a rabbi who said over a loudspeaker that such 
disruptions were out of place 
the death of the teenager appalled israelis many demanded that 
the arabs of beita be punished but others said the were dragging 
the country deeper into its war with the palestinians 
this will mean the start of a cycle of bloodshed that will be 
difficult to end the leftwing daily hadashot declared 
if you cannot enforce a stronger policy mr prime minister 
our next meeting will again be in a cemetery hanan porat a 
settler leader who is not related to tirza told yitzhak shamir at 
the girls funeral 
some israelis asked why jewish children were hiking in the west 
bank hills at a time of such trouble 
one hiker her head bandaged explained from her hospital bed 
we have to show them that we are the owners of the country 
her party made one mistake she said it wasnt good that we 
had only two guns she spoke on television and was not identified 
by name 
requests for gun permits have increased by 50 percent since 
december mostly from israelis in the occupied territories and 
jerusalem the daily al hamishmar reported 
according to moshe weiss of the interior ministry about 200000 
israelis own private weapons both parents and the older children 
in many west bank homes are getting permits

jesse jackson wont be taking time 
from his busy campaign schedule to meet jewish leaders because he 
has already explained his controversial statements on jews and 
israel his campaign manager says 
he has answered the same questions over and over again said 
gerald austin explaining friday why the campaign had decided not 
to meet with the jewish community relations council an umbrella 
group of jewish organizations 
austin spoke to reporters outside a long island fundraiser at 
the wading river home of marty bergman a cbs television producer 
austin said he had counted 48 communities in and around new york 
city that are bigger than des moines iowa where the presidential 
candidates spent weeks campaigning you need to spend time in 
these places he said 
that kind of campaigning doesnt leave time for what austin 
considers the unproductive meeting to again answer qustions about 
jacksons use of the offensive term hymietown to describe new 
york in his 1984 campaign and his past association with nation of 
islam leader louis farrakhan 
the incidents left many jewish voters with the feeling that 
jackson might be antisemitic and they also do not like his views 
on the issue of a palestinian homeland 
austin made the comments even as jackson appeared to be subtly 
reaching out to the large numbers of jewish voters as he campaigned 
vigorously across new york and long island seeking votes for the 
states april 19 primary 
on different occasions he mentioned antisemitism along with 
racism as reprehensible attitudes 
at the landmark sardis restaurant in manhattans theater 
district jackson told a labor leaders breakfast that in the 
precivil rights south it was commonplace to see signs that said 
blacks and jews and dogs are not welcome 
he mentioned three white civil rights workers who were shot in 
the early 1960s in mississippi and noted two of them were jewish 
asked by reporters about jewish resistance to him jackson said 
we continue to build relationships we continue to heal 
relationships ours is an inclusive outreach campaign 
additionally he said jews are among many minority and ethnic 
groups he has involved in his campaign and added our commitment 
is to end any vestiges of racism of antisemitism or sexism 
weve sent a message no one can miss 
at a senior citizens forum at adelphi university in garden city 
an audience member asked him to comment on us apathy in early 
world war ii while hitler was beginning his jewish extermination 
campaign 
we did abandon many jewish people to hitlers hell it was a 
tragic mistake jackson said 
we should forever accept a shared responsibility we must 
assure it will never be allowed to happen again 
jackson then said the united states must fight for the right of 
soviet jews to emigrate and for the right of israel to exist as a 
secure state 
at the wading river fundraiser jackson spoke in opposition to 
the nearby shoreham nuclear plant which is awaiting a fullpower 
operating license he said nuclear power is too expensive and 
unsafe and he endorsed alternative forms of energy

a tribal militiaman gunned down a 
70yearold roman catholic priest from chicago in the southern 
philippines after accusing the clergyman of harboring criminals 
the military reported today 
defense secretary fidel ramos today ordered an investigation in 
the killing of the rev carl schmitz including the possibility 
that religious differences may have played a role he did not 
elaborate 
in chicago a church official said he was told the priest was 
slain because he had refused to employ the killers wife 
a military report said the schmitz died thursday from multiple 
gunshot wounds from a 30caliber garand rifle during the attack 
inside his convent in koronadal a provincial capital 620 miles 
south of manila 
it said schmitz was slain by saguin munday 29 a teacher and 
head of the local government militia after a heated argument over 
the priests willingness to give sanctuary to wanted tribal 
criminals 
munday a blaan tribesman surrendered to police authorities 
after the slaying 
schmitz did missonary work in japan before being assigned to the 
philippines in 1974 he was the head of the notre dame of marbel 
colleges a missionary school for the minority blaan tribe 
manila newspapers gave differing accounts on schmitzs killing 
the philippine inquirer said schmitz had punched munday during 
the confrontation prompting the militiaman to shoot the priest 
the manila bulletin quoting a military report said the priest 
allegedly turned down the wife of munday who was applying for a 
teaching job in the school 
in another account the daily globe said munday barged into the 
convent of the passion and without saying a word gunned down the 
priest 
todays edition of the chicago tribune quoted rev sebastian 
macdonald provincial superior of the passionist community as 
saying priests in manila told him schmitz was killed by the husband 
of a woman who had been refused a teaching job at the missionary 
school 
we are going to petition the filipino government to set up an 
investigative committee to explore the facts and clear his name of 
any smear macdonald was quoted as saying 
schmitz also served a missionary in china in the late 1940s but 
was expelled during the communist takeover

separatist tamil rebels stopped 14 
sinhalese villagers on a road in northern sri lanka and massacred 
them military officials said today 
also a senior police official said detectives had arrested a 
sinhalese man believed responsible for an attempt to assassinate 
president junius r jayewardene in parliament last august 
the rebel slayings took place friday evening when villagers on 
bicycles and in a truck were stopped near the town of anuradhapura 
about 100 miles northeast of colombo said the officials who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
they did not elaborate on the slayings 
the latest killings raised to at least 147 the number of 
villagers slain in northern sri lanka since march 2 most of the 
victims have been members of the islands majority sinhalese 
community 
but at least 22 members of the minority tamil community were 
killed in a revenge attack blamed on sinhalese march 11 and 17 
moslems died in a raid blamed on tamil separatists march 31 
frank silva director of the national criminal investigation 
department said the the main suspect in the parliament grenade 
attack was arrested friday at the village of naula 68 miles 
northeast of colombo 
he was identified as ajith kumara 28 
one lawmaker and a clerk were killed and several people were 
injured aug 18 when two hand grenades were thrown into a 
conference room where jayewardene was presiding over a meeting of 
cabinet ministers and parliament members 
the attack occurred shortly after india and sri lanka signed a 
peace accord july 29 aimed at ending the tamil minoritys 
4yearold guerrilla war for an independent homeland in the north 
and east of the island 
the accord was opposed by many in the majority sinhalese 
community who felt it made too many concessions to the tamils the 
largest of the tamil rebel groups the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam also has rejected the pact 
india now has more than 50000 troops on the island to try to 
contain the tigers rebellion 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up about 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million population they claim they are discriminated 
against by the sinhalese who control the government and military 
india has become involved because it has an estimated 60 million 
ethnic tamils in its southern states who are sympathetic to the sri 
lankan tamils

police this morning arrested 91 
protesters staging a sitin at a penn state building ending a 
15hour impasse over a canceled meeting with university officials 
on minority issues 
i think its a terrible message to send to the students when 
the president of this university would rather send state troopers 
to meet with them than come himself said seth williams who is 
president of the student government 
williams one of more than 150 students who occupied the 
universitys telecommunications building overnight said he was 
cited for defiant trespass 
david stormer director of university safety said most students 
were charged with summary trespass while some faced disorderly 
conduct charges 
it was a very peaceful demonstration he said 
more than 75 police officers from university state college and 
state police took part in the arrests 
the university had obtained an injunction friday in centre 
county court ordering the students to leave the building 
students were arrested individually issued yellow citation 
slips and released receiving cheers and hugs from their friends 
outside a police cordon around the building 
stormer said about 130 people were in the building just before 
the arrests but many left rather than face criminal charges 
the students most of them black began the protest friday after 
a meeting between student leaders and school administrators failed 
to agree on ground rules for another session to discuss minority 
issues 
the university canceled a similar meeting friday after officials 
said they couldnt reach student leaders who had demanded the 
meeting to end an earlier sitin outside the office of penn state 
president bryce jordan 
were going to do it folks aint no stopping us now said 
darryl king a senior from philadelphia and past president of the 
black caucus a student organization 
robert blair a spokesman for the black caucus said minority 
students should have a voice in programs at the university that 
affect them and criticized penn state for failing to meet a 
courtmandated goal for black enrollment 
this fall penn state failed to reach a 5 percent black 
enrollment which the university agreed to under court order penn 
state has a 36 percent black enrollment which equals 2424 black 
students 
late friday night craig millar assistant vice president for 
student services told the protesters that they would be violating 
penn states code of conduct if they remained and could be subject 
to dismissal from the university 
he also said they could face criminal charges of disorderly 
conduct harassment and trespassing your point has been made and 
we are please asking you to leave millar said 
outside the building half a dozen students slept in sleeping 
bags while others huddled under blankets in the 37degree chill 
king said they would occupy the building until theyre arrested 
or their demand is met for a meeting with jordan and other 
university officials right now we will be in this place until 
whatever happens he said 
jordan had agreed tuesday to convene the canceled meeting to end 
an earlier sitin outside his office by nine black students and a 
local pastor 
carol a cartwright chairman of the equal opportunity planning 
committee said the university had offered to set up a meeting 
friday night outside the building to plan a forum next week on 
minority issues the offer was rejected 
we need to make it clear we have made very serious offers 
cartwright said we are willing to have a dialogue but were not 
willing to let students occupy buildings and get this accomplished 
this way 
student leaders said they didnt trust the university to keep 
its word once they left the building

an american businessman described new 
us sanctions against panama as futile and said they gave gen 
manuel antonio noriega the opportunity to shut down american firms 
there 
the us has very little to say in this situation as far as 
preventing us companies from deciding whether or not to pay taxes 
in panama if you dont pay your right to operate here can be 
taken away said the manager of a us franchise in panama 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
president reagan ordered the new sanctions which prohibit all 
payments by american citizens and organizations in the united 
states and panama to the noriega government the ban specifically 
includes branches and subsidiaries of american companies 
the sanctions come after texaco eastern airlines and other us 
firms paid more than 5 million in taxes and fees to the noriega 
government for doing business in panama 
the united states previously had stopped paying monthly toll 
fees to the panama canal commission and had frozen government 
deposits in american banks 
noriega head of panamas 15000member defense forces and the 
power behind the civilian government is under indictment in the 
united states on drug trafficking charges the united states has 
called upon the general to step down 
don halman manager of the general mills operation in panama 
said he believed the sanctions would not apply to his company 
while the local general mills operation is partly 
americanowned he said it is a panamanian corporation with 
panamanian shareholders i would not think that it could apply to 
us 
the us embassy said tax payments by us firms should be 
directed to an escrow account set up by the federal reserve bank in 
new york for deposed president eric arturo delvalle noriega forced 
delvalle from office after delvalle tried to fire the general on 
feb 25 
the united states recognizes delvalle as panamas legitimate 
president 
there are 190 members of the us chamber of commerce in panama 
but many are franchises of american firms and operate as panamanian 
corporations 
all businesses in panama including us firms must pay social 
security taxes workers compensation valueadded and other taxes 
according to a us businessman who has been in the country more 
than 15 years 
if you do business in a country you have to obey the laws of 
that country said the businessman who added that the sanctions 
gave noriega an excuse to seize us businesses 
the shortage of dollars panamas official currency has kept 
banks closed since march 3 and prevented the government from paying 
130000 public employees and 15000 troops for more than a month

chinas legislature today approved li peng as 
premier and endorsed a reorganization plan that intends to make the 
government a leaner more efficient instrument for promoting 
economic development 
li a moscoweducated technocrat has been acting premier for 
five months 
one national peoples congress delegate voted against the 
reorganization of state ministries and toplevel commissions which 
was approved by a show of hands of the 2877 delegates attending in 
the great hall of the people one delegate abstained 
a key component of the reorganization the merger of chinas 
railway and communications ministries and national airline was 
abruptly dropped officials said only that delegates had objected 
to it 
the delegates then voted by ballot for premier vice chairmen of 
the state central military commission and top judicial posts 
in announcing the results the staterun xinhua news agency did 
not say if any delegates voted against li 
senior leader deng xiaoping who is a delegate did not attend 
and there was no official explanation for his absence deng 84 
had appeared in good health at fridays congress session 
ninetytwo ordinary delegates said to have other business were 
also absent 
foreign reporters were allowed to watch from a balcony as they 
were for the first time friday when the congress elected gen yang 
shangkun president and former vice premier wan li to head the 
congress standing committee 
li 59 was appointed acting premier by the previous congress 
standing committee in november when zhao ziyang gave up the post 
to become communist party chief 
since then the former vice premier and minister of education 
and power industry has felt his way slowly in his new job although 
he supports chinas program of modernization lis public 
statements indicate he favors moving cautiously in introducing 
marketstyle economic reforms in contrast to zhaos emphasis on 
the need for speedy action 
in his speech to the congress when its session opened march 25 
li strongly endorsed the reform goals of deng and zhao but warned 
against rushing headlong into mass action or being too 
impatient for quick results 
in other voting zhao was elected vice chairman of the state 
central military commission under deng as chairman yang shangkun 
stayed on as permanent vice chairman 
zhao has no military experience and the post is seen as an 
opportunity for him to gain the connections and support in the 
military he will need if he is to succeed deng as chinas top 
leader 
six members of the military commission also were elected 
including qin jiwei head of the beijing military command who is 
expected to be named defense minister 
ren jianxin vice president of the supreme peoples court was 
promoted to president replacing zheng tianxiang 
liu fuzhi 71 a former minister of justice and minister of 
public security was elected the nations top prosecutor 
the government reorganization approved saturday calls for 
splitting several existing ministries and combining others 
reducing the total number from 45 to 41 among the major changes 
the current planning and economic commissions will be merged into a 
powerful body directing chinas economic and social development 
strategies 
the ministries of coal petroleum and nuclear industry will be 
merged into a single energy ministry while the ministry of labor 
and personnel will be split in half 
the cancellation of plans to merge the railways and civil 
aviation administration of china the national flag carrier came 
as a suprise not only because of its abruptness but because the 
railways ministry was regarded as a prime target of reform 
the train system chinas main means of longdistance travel 
has failed to expand as quickly as demand and has been criticized 
for chronic mismanagement and sloppy operating procedures four 
fatal train accidents this year claiming a total of 168 lives 
created a clamor for improved safety measures 
the congress is expected next week to approve ministerial 
appointments and vote on several key laws including one that would 
guarantee business people more freedom from government interference 
it also is expected to approve a constitutional amendment 
legitimizing chinas small but growing private sector

police have found further traces of two missing 
wheaton college newlyweds but still are unable to determine if 
their weeklong absence has been the result of foul play 
scott swanson 23 and carolyn maclean 22 have not been seen 
since the couple left the flint mich home of ms macleans 
grandmother april 2 on their way to the swanson family home in the 
west chicago suburb of elgin 
sgt raymond caplis of the chicago police youth headquarters 
confirmed late friday that identification belonging to one of the 
missing students had been found in a downtown alley near the spot 
where ms macleans car was found 
the cards were found in the alley behind orchestra hall 
apparently beneath a dumpster caplis said 
caplis declined to describe the identification but wbbmtv 
reported that it included several credit cards and a student 
identification card 
another youth headquarters officer detective paul stubblefield 
said earlier friday that neither of the two missing students had 
withdrawn any money from their bank accounts since leaving flint 
there was speculation initially that the couple who married 
secretly march 26 might have taken off on a delayed honeymoon but 
that speculation was tempered by fear because ms macleans red bmw 
was found last saturday with its engine running and police said 
there was evidence its glove compartment had been tampered with 
a pack of cigarettes and a lighter found in the car indicated 
the car may have been stolen because friends said neither swanson 
nor ms maclean smoked 
while police in illinois michigan and indiana searched for 
possible clues friends family members and fellow students spread 
fliers with the missing couples pictures to restaurants and gas 
stations along interstate 94 between flint and chicago 
police have been investigating a report that the two were seen 
at a stevensville mich restaurant off interstate 94 last 
saturday shortly after leaving flint 
john bradburn of elgin a friend of the swanson family who 
helped coordinate the volunteer effort described the couple as 
good students and good christians 
its been real hard for everyone especially the families 
bradburn said youre up youre down you get encouraged with 
one report and then that doesnt work out 
bradburn said swanson was a senior majoring in psychology 
school officials said swanson was active as an rotc cadet and 
ms maclean a new jersey native worked part time as a model 
fellow students at wheaton college a religious school west of 
chicago held roundtheclock prayer services for their missing

twentythree cars of a 135car freight train 
derailed along the columbia river and two of the cars leaked 
hazardous chemicals authorities said 
no one was hurt in fridays derailment but the singletrack 
line was blocked and was not expected to be reopened until sunday 
the burlington northern train was carrying primarily lumber and 
other forest products along with some chemicals ore pumice 
aluminum bars and other industrial goods 
one tank car landed on its side on the river bank and leaked 
sodium borohydride a chemical used in bleaching wood pulp and 
manufacturing plastic foam the other leaking car tumbled partly 
into the river spilling sodium borohydroxide a closely related 
chemical used in chemical manufacturing petroleum products and 
papermaking said howard kallio a spokesman for burlington 
northern 
both chemicals produce heat as they dissolve in water but are 
not explosive kallio said they can be harmful if people breathe 
the vapor or dust or come in contact with the substances he added 
dave hare chief of the benton county hazardous materials team 
said more than half the sodium borohydroxide in the partially 
submerged tanker spilled into the river before the leak was stopped 
mcnary dam about 23 miles downstream was closed for nearly 2 
hours to increase the dilution of the chemical before it passed 
farther west eliminating any possibility of danger from the spill 
he said 
the leaking car on the riverbank also contained sodium chloride 
hare said hazardous materials team members tightened bolts on the 
dome of that car to stop the leak 
cleanup of the derailed cars will take three or four days 
kallio said 
the cause of the accident which took place about eight miles 
east of plymouth was undetermined the allowable track speed was 
60 mph but kallio said he did not know the actual speed of the 
train 
amtrak passenger trains were being rerouted to union pacific 
tracks on the oregon side of the river he said

british airways has criticized boeing co for 
faulty workmanship and poor quality control in the construction of 
commercial aircraft the second complaint revealed this week by an 
international boeing customer 
the seattle times today reported that british airways in a 
letter written in february complained in particular about boeings 
plant in everett 30 miles north of seattle where the company 
makes 747 jumbo jets and twinengine 767 widebodies 
the newspaper quoted the letter as saying at least one mistake 
compromised the integrity of a 747 and that boeing workers seem 
oblivious that they are building aircraft where any mistake not 
properly corrected or hidden represents a direct compromise with 
safety 
the times obtained a copy of the letter friday it was written 
by dk craig british airways chief engineer for technical and 
quality services to phil condit executive vice president of 
boeing commercial airplanes 
boeing officials friday said they were aware of the situation 
however company spokesman david jimenez said they declined to 
discuss it until later 
japan air lines complained to boeing chairman frank shrontz in a 
letter leaked tuesday to the japanese press jals complaints 
ranged from incorrect assembly of fireextinguisher piping in 767s 
to enginetemperature sensors being installed in reverse order in a 
747 the letter demanded that boeing make greater efforts to 
achieve better quality control 
a japan air lines spokesman was quoted in a wall street journal 
story this week as saying the defects were not critical problems 
for safety 
craigs letter cites problems spotted by airline inspectors at 
the boeing plant ranging from missing fasteners to wrong or missing 
parts the newspaper reported 
one missing part caused the floor of a jet to bow so much that a 
main deck cargo power drive unit wouldnt work the newspaper said 
my quality inspectors can only properly inspect a very small 
proportion of each aircraft craig wrote they should never 
ever come across missing fasteners missing parts cracks 
fasteners fitted the wrong way round yet we find instances of some 
of these on every aircraft 
british airways placed boeings largestever order potentially 
worth 41 billion in august 1986 when it ordered 16 747400s and 
placed options for 12 more it also has 11 767s on order and flies 
boeing 737s and 757s 
like other customers british airways maintains a staff of 
inspectors at boeing factories 
craig martin boeing commercial airplanes spokesman said after 
the jal letter was made public that an investigation was under way 
to determine how the mistakes occurred and said he believed they 
were onetime occurrences 
but the british airways official wrote the situation 
underscores our fears that the underlying reason for the boeing 
cos poor quality record is that the production work force are in 
general inadequately trained possess a low level of basic working 
skills and of paramount concern seem oblivious that they are 
building aircraft where any mistake not properly corrected or 
hidden represents a direct compromise with safety 
boeing the worlds biggest maker of commercial aircraft and one 
of the united states biggest exporters is in the third year of a 
major effort to improve products increase productivity and cut 
costs

sikh extremists have acquired one or two usmade stinger missiles 
and have hidden them inside the golden temple sikhisms holiest 
shrine 
police halted trucks carrying rice milk and other basic 
supplies to the temple to search for the missiles 
the missiles would represent a major upgrading in the arsenal of 
sikh extremists who have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 
for an independent homeland in punjab state in the past the sikhs 
have largely relied on knives swords pistols and automatic rifles 
a senior police official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said today that initial intelligence reports suggest the 
militants inside the temple may have stinger missiles with them 
authorities were unsure where the weapons would have come from 
but one police official said they were obviously from pakistan 
the united states has supplied the shoulderlaunched stinger 
missiles via pakistan to afghan guerrillas fighting the 
sovietbacked afghanistan government 
india has accused neighboring pakistan of allowing sikh 
militants to train and arm on its territory 
the militants are also believed to use the temple for military 
purposes police say about 400 people are in the temple complex 
some pilgrims and some militants 
a june 1984 government raid to drive radicals from the shrine 
left more than 1200 people dead mostly sikhs soon afterward 
sikh bodyguards killed prime minister indira gandhi militants are 
believed to have rearmed the temple since then

opec oil ministers opened talks here 
today on possible ways to reverse a worldwide slump in oil prices 
sources said a consensus was emerging that the cartel should not 
respond by cutting production 
although the price depression is costing opec at least 35 
million a day most of the ministers feel that further cuts in opec 
production will not help said cartel sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
they said the ministers instead would likely renew a call for 
production restraint by independent oil producing nations such 
mexico and china 
the ministers were not empowered to make opec policy decisions 
but they hoped to recommend to their cartel partners on what if 
any action should be taken at the next full opec conference set 
for june 
those attending the closeddoor meeting represented saudi 
arabia venezuela nigeria indonesia and algeria and reflected a 
crosssection of views within the organization 
arturo hernandez grisanti the oil minister of venezuela told 
reporters no decisions had been made 
some analysts believe that if opec decides not to reduce its 
production further oil prices will fall in coming weeks because of 
a global glut 
pierre terzian editor of petrostrategies an oil trade 
publication said today in vienna that he thought opec inaction 
would drive the price down by as much as 150 a barrel to about 
14 a barrel for topgrade crudes 
on friday world oil markets were calm the price of brent crude 
from the north sea traded in london for may delivery at 1560 a 
barrel down 10 cents from thursday 
theres a high degree of skepticism among traders regarding 
the outcome of this meeting said peter gignoux an analyst in 
london for the investment firm of shearson lehman brothers 
the talks by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
opened amid renewed signs that saudi arabia opecs most 
influential member was growing impatient with the failure of some 
members to strictly abide by the cartels rules 
king fahd was quoted friday by the official saudi press agency 
as saying he regretted that some opec members whom he did not 
identify were unsettling the oil market by offering price 
discounts in violation of opec statutes 
fahd was said to have denied recent reports that his kingdom was 
offering price discounts to some customers 
the venezuelan oil minister arturo hernandez grisanti said it 
should be viewed as a routine session of the cartels 
pricemonitoring committee which is authorized to meet whenever 
oil prices fall substantially below opecs target of 18 
it was the first meeting of the committee since last decembers 
full opec conference in which the cartel decided to maintain at 
least through june its existing oil production quotas for all 
members except iraq 
the iraqis have refused to cooperate in limiting output 
analysts say opec has been producing near its 12nation 
production ceiling of 1506 million barrels a day prices 
nonetheless have dropped to between 15 and 16 a barrel 
with opecs production including that of iraq apparently 
running at between 175 million and 18 million barrels daily the 
price decline is costing opec as a group at least 35 million a day

an american senator returning from 
vietnam predicted today that the united states and vietnam would 
establish special offices in each others capitals as early as this 
year 
sen larry pressler rsd a vietnam war veteran said such 
special interest sections would help expedite the accounting for 
americans missing in action during the war the plight of 
amerasians and other problems between the former enemies 
pressler told a news conference that despite opposition to such 
sections from the us state department there would be 
overwhelming support in the us congress and implementation 
within the next two years 
last month sen john mccain rariz a former prisoner of war 
in vietnam introduced legislation to set up the special interest 
sections which are usually housed in a third countrys consular 
offices 
pressler said he would seek an amendment to include a us 
special technical office in ho chi minh city 
ho chi minh city formerly called saigon is the major exit 
point for thousands of vietnamese departing for the united states 
and other countries under the unsponsored orderly departure 
program 
these include the children of vietnamese and american couples 
or amerasians during the war 
pressler also predicted full diplomatic relations would be 
established within five to 10 years 
i think we are on the verge of some substantial changes in our 
relations with vietnam our policy on vietnam will change he 
said we have so many common bonds 
pressler who served as an army second lieutenant in vietnam 21 
years ago met with foreign minister nguyen co thach and other 
vietnamese officials this week on wednesday he took part in a 
ceremony at hanoi in which the remains of 27 people believed to be 
missing americans were repatriated 
it was the largest such transfer of remains since the last 
american forces withdrew from south vietnam on march 29 1973 
 
pressler said that given severe food shortages in vietnam he 
explored the idea of sending some food aid to that country by 
private american organizations but he said such aid should not be 
tied to the accounting for 1767 americans mias in vietnam 
pressler said he agreed with the state departments policy on 
tying the us trade embargo with vietnams accounting for the mias 
and the withdrwal of its troops from cambodia which hanoi invaded 
in late 1978 
but he said he could not understand the departments opposition 
to the interest section offices 
whether we like it or not our country is going to have a 
great interest in vietnam pressler said citing the large 
numbers of us war veterans vietnamese who have settled in the 
united states and other factors that bind the two countries 
us troops supported south vietnam which was defeated by 
communist north vietnam in 1975

secretary of state george p shultz may go to 
geneva on thursday to attend the signing of accords calling for the 
withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan after an occupation of 
more than eight years an administration official said today 
but the signing expected thursday depends on a formal response 
by moscow to a us proposal for a symetrical continuation of us 
and soviet aid to warring factions the offical who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the soviets have not yet affirmed the 
compromise and a decision on shultz attending the signing depended 
on that affirmation 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze would sign the accords for 
the soviet union which would withdraw its troops by the end of the 
year the united states has provided shoulderfired stinger 
missiles and other arms to guerrillas at war with the marxist 
government in kabul which is backed by the soviet army 
shultz proposed ending all us and soviet aid to the two sides 
but was turned down by the soviets and offered the compromise 
calling for symetrical levels of aid in its place

half the states with income taxes have made 
them less fair for many low and middleincome residents since the 
federal tax to which they are geared was thoroughly revised in 
1986 a unionfinanced study reported saturday 
in 20 states and the district of columbia taxes were raised 
more in percentage terms for some low and middleincome taxpayers 
cut more for the wealthy or increased outright on the poor and 
middle class and reduced for the rich according to the study by 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees 
the union said the study provides the first solid evidence of 
how state tax burdens have been shifted in the wake of federal tax 
overhaul 
while many states made great strides in improving the fairness 
of their income taxes last year too many continued to buy into the 
old failed program of cutting taxes for the wealthy said 
gerald mcentee union president making a working couple with two 
kids and an income of 24000 pay more taxes while giving a tax 
cut to the town banker who makes five times as much makes no 
sense 
the 11millionmember union is a consisent backer of liberal 
tax spending and social policies it favors progressive taxes 
those in which ability to pay is a major factor 
the study considered effects of the tax changes on four types of 
households a oneearner couple with two children twoearner 
couple with two children single parent with two children and a 
single person at various income levels ranging from 9000 to 
125000 
steve gold of denver a spokesman for the national conference of 
state legislatures praised the thoroughness of the study but 
issued one caution 
if in any one of the 12 scenarios the tax system became less 
progressive the study counted the system less progressive even 
if in 11 of the 12 cases it was more progressive gold said on 
balance the system was made more progressive in every state 
the report does not compare actual dollars of taxes paid in the 
states but deals only with distribution of the burden among 
taxpayers with low middele and upper incomes 
most states adopt the federal definition of taxable income the 
1986 broadening of the federal tax base by elimination or reduction 
of several deductions thus gave the states more income to tax the 
increase in taxable income was accompanied by federal rate 
reductions producing a tax cut for most people but that formula 
was not followed by all the states 
the study found that states were much more successful in 
shifting the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy than from the 
middle class to the wealthy ten states worsened the relative 
burden on some poor families compared with wealthy families of the 
same size while 19 shifted a part of the burden from the upper 
levels to middleincome taxpayers 
the study found that

of the 41 states including the district of columbia with 
broad income taxes all but new jersey north carolina and 
pennsylvania significantly changed their systems last year 
in 17 states the changes resulted in a more progressive 
system meaning more relief in percentage terms at lower incomes 
these states arizona california hawaii idaho illinois 
indiana maine maryland massachusetts michigan missouri 
montana ohio oregon south carolina utah and virginia 
progressivity declined for many low and middleincome 
households in 21 states alabama arkansas colorado delaware 
district of columbia georgia iowa kansas kentucky louisiana 
minnesota mississippi nebraska new mexico new york north 
dakota oklahoma rhode island vermont west virginia and 
wisconsin 
the significance of the changes in distribution varies widely 
from state to state because state tax laws are so different for 
example progressivity was barely improved in illinois because 
capital gains a form of income held mostly by the welltodo 
already were fully taxable utah improved progressivity 
considerably by eliminating the state tax deduction for federal 
taxes paid 
only mississippi imposed no income tax on any of the four 
lowincome groups studied 9000 single parent 9000 single 
person 12000 oneearner couple with children and 12000 
twoearner couple with children 
almost all states could dramatically improve the fairness of 
their systems by simply making the state tax a percentage of 
federal tax as rhode island vermont and north dakota do 
after last years changes california mississippi new mexico 
maine and rhode island have the most progressive income taxes the 
least progressive are in indiana kentucky illinois alabama and 
pennsylvania

news leaks protests and philippine 
press commentaries have clouded the atmosphere in talks between 
american and filipino officials on the status of us military 
bases here 
last tuesday the two sides began a threemonth review of the 
1947 military bases agreement which allows the united states to 
use six military installations in the philippines 
us and filipino officials say the outcome is expected to 
influence manilas decision on whether to allow the bases to remain 
after the agreement expires in 1991 
both sides have called for a cordial review but there are 
increasing calls in the philippines for closing the bases and for 
asserting nationalism in dealings with the former colonial power 
on saturday foreign secretary raul manglapus chief philippine 
negotiator reiterated his claim that the bases serve us and not 
filipino interests 
he also challenged claims by ambassador nicholas platt chairman 
of the us panel that the installations are vital to counteract 
soviet expansionism 
we are under attack from within not from without manglapus 
said referring to communist rebels and rightwing extremists 
missiles aimed at some external target do not help us in this 
internal struggle we recognize no enemies but those within our 
borders 
the atmosphere between the two panels soured early when filipino 
officials leaked details of a dispute over manilas demand that the 
americans obtain prior consent before launching combat operations 
from the bases 
the us panel boycotted a scheduled session thursday morning 
and american sources said platt was furious over the leak 
but predictably most manila newspapers viewed american anger as 
an example of washington pressuring the filipino panel in the 
talks commentators urged the philippine government to stand its 
ground 
our panel should send back a clear message of standing pat on 
its commitment to making a more equitable arrangement through 
primarily gaining a bigger compensation package for the bases stay 
in the philippines for the duration of the agreement wrote the 
manila journal 
prominent columnist art borjal wrote in the philippine daily 
star that the filipino panel has an obligation to bargain for more 
philippine control of the bases the installations are nominally 
under philippine command although effectively under us control 
just about everybody is supporting the view that the 
philippines should protect its sovereignty stand its ground and 
bargain with the americans as a coequal nation borjal wrote 
groups opposed to the us bases are planning to take advantage 
of the antiamerican sentiment to stage more protests 
on friday riot police used clubs and jets of water to stop a 
protest outside the us embassy by about 3000 people demanding an 
end to the american bases 
officers attacked when some demonstrators broke away from the 
main group and dashed for the embassy some people in the crowd 
threw stones at police 
nationalist sentiment is expected to sharpen when the two panels 
take up the sensitive issues of compensation and nuclear weapons 
the filipinos are expected to demand substantial increases in the 
180 million they receive annually from washington for use of the 
bases 
a clause in the new filipino constitution also states the 
philippines opposes nuclear weapons consistent with the national 
interest 
legislation has been filed in the senate to ban nuclear weapons 
from the philippines and bar nuclearpowered ships from ports 
because of nationalistic fervor drummed up by the bases talks 
an accidental overflight of the presidential palace by a us navy 
helicopter emerged as a major topic in the local press 
a spokesman for the us navy at subic bay said the helicopter 
inadvertently flew over the prohibited air space last tuesday 
during a delivery flight to the us embassy the aircraft flew 
across the restricted area a mile north of the palace 
the manila bulletin wrote the unlawful buzzing by a us navy 
helicopter made us think of the human cost exacted even in 
peacetime by the warmaking machine at clark and subic the 
principle involved being that a war machine claims human lives even 
when it is idle 
on saturday kenneth quinn deputy chief of mission at the us 
embassy apologized for the incident and promised it would not 
happen again

a military source said today that an israeli 
girl killed in a clash with arab villagers might have been shot by 
a jewish settler but said the army is not ruling out the 
possibility she was killed by an arab 
israeli media citing an army probe said friday that 
15yearold tirza porat was likely killed by a bullet fired from 
the rifle of another jewish settler 
the military source said the cause of tirzas death had not been 
determined but added that there is a possibility she died from a 
bullet 
if so there are two possibilities either al dubi pulled the 
trigger after he was stoned by villagers or the shot was fired by 
an arab after he took away al dubis m16 the source said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
romam al dubi was one of two jewish guards accompanying israeli 
teenagers on a hike wednesday near the west bank village of beita 
tirza was struck in the head by a bullet and a large object 
during a clash that broke out between villagers and the hiking 
group the army has previously maintained that she was stoned to 
death by arabs 
more violence was reported today in the occupied territories 
hospital officials said an 18yearold arab was wounded in the 
chest during clashes with israeli soldiers in the jabaliya refugee 
camp in the gaza strip 
the hospital officials said soldiers firing rubber bullets in 
the refugee camp also hit a 60yearold arab man below the left eye 
and a 50yearold woman in the stomach 
the army said it could not confirm the reports 
in gaza city arabs staged a general strike and hoisted a 
palestinian flag outlawed by israel on the citys main mosque 
soldiers fired tear gas and live ammunition at youths who threw 
stones and burned tires in the citys main thoroughfares 
on friday a firebomb damaged the front porch of the home of 
us consulate spokesman david good who said his 5yearold 
daughter and two maids were in the house but that no one was 
injured he said a guard assigned to him by the consulate had been 
in the back of the building 
since december the us consulate building in east jerusalem 
has been firebombed twice but no one was injured 
throughout the occupied west bank and gaza strip arab youths 
chanted antiisraeli slogans and threw rocks at troops after noon 
moslem prayers friday protesters hoisted black flags to 
commemorate 141 arabs killed in the fourmonth uprising one 
israeli soldier also has died 
in jabaliya soldiers wounded five arabs after being stoned by 
angry worshipers four arabs were wounded by army gunfire in three 
other clashes hospital officials said 
the army only would confirm four wounded 
on jerusalems temple mount dozens of palestinians chanted 
nationalist slogans after prayers at the al aqsa mosque several 
boys tossed rocks at border police who dispersed them without 
incident 
an army official meanwhile said the investigation of miss 
porats death had not been completed partly because witnesses 
provided conflicting accounts there are 10 different people who 
give you 10 different versions he said 
the army says arab youths from beita threw stones at the hikers 
and attacked them 
in the fighting two arabs were killed in addition to miss 
porat two arabs were wounded and 13 israeli injured 
israel radio citing the army probe has said al dubi opened 
fire when the group was first stoned 
the radio quoted the army report as saying the other guard had 
asked al dubi not to shoot but that al dubi told the children to 
gather around him and started shooting then was disarmed by arabs 
who took the israelis to beita 
army officials said a villager handed al dubis weapon an m16 
rifle to a soldier on friday and israel tv said eight bullets 
were left in the magazine 
the second weapon an uzi submachine gun was found in the 
village wednesday and the army said villagers had dismantled it 
israeli media citing the army report have said the only shots 
fired in the clash came from these two weapons but that 
investigators didnt know who pulled the trigger 
lt gen dan shomron the army chief of staff indicated the 
struggle centered around the two israeli guards he told israel 
radio the investigation showed the villagers did not intend to harm 
the israeli teenagers

after focusing for nearly a decade on the 
deregulation of their own industry radio and television station 
owners are turning their attention to competitive challenges from 
cable tv satellite programming and foreign technology 
members of the industry will wrestle with issues like 
highdefinition tv and carriage of local tv signals by cable 
operators at the national association of broadcasters convention 
this week 
more than 40000 broadcasters are expected to attend the 
convention which will include a visit from president reagan a 
former radio broadcaster and friend of the industry 
since reagan took office in 1981 the federal communications 
commission has eased restrictions on buying and selling radio and 
tv stations taken a relaxed view of mergers and acquisitions 
reduced paperwork requirements and made license renewals easier 
broadcasters feel hes one of us he understands our 
business said wallace jorgenson president of jeffersonpilot 
communications co charlotte nc and chairman of nabs joint 
board 
reagan scheduled to speak at the convention sunday is to 
receive an award from nab for his leadership in broadcast 
communications 
the nab also will present its distinguished service award the 
industrys highest honor to former fcc chairman mark s fowler 
who carried out the administrations deregulatory agenda 
though broadcasters have been pleased with deregulation some in 
congress feel it has gone too far particularly with elimination of 
the fairness doctrine that required broadcasters to air conflicting 
sides of important issues 
the fccs decision to scrap the policy angered democrats in 
congress and they have promised to try to revive it this year they 
have made it a top priority and have told broadcasters they will 
get no legislation they want until the doctrine is made law 
one of the things broadcasters want most is a requirement that 
cable operators carry local tv signals the courts struck down 
previous mustcarry rules 
broadcasters are asking congress for renewed protection of their 
signals and some are willing to live with a fairness doctrine in 
exchange 
we broadcasters are sitting in the middle of a fight between 
the fcc and congress jorgenson said broadcasters have to 
learn they are shooting real bullets at each other and wed better 
keep our heads down right now 
another hot topic at this years convention is highdefinition 
tv called hdtv the japanese have a clear lead in developing the 
superpicture technology but the system they plan to introduce in 
their own country in 1990 relies upon direct satellite 
transmissions to specially designed tv sets europeans also have 
chosen an hdtv system but it is not compatible with the japanese 
system 
the united states is much further behind and the systems being 
developed are still in the computersimulation stage one 
complication is the number of competing interests who have a stake 
in whichever system is ultimately chosen 
broadcasters want to make sure that any us industry standard 
for hdtv is compatible with existing tv sets so signals from local 
broadcasters can still be received by the 140 million sets that are 
now in american households 
they also see the possibility the japanese could start selling 
hdtv satellite receivers and videocassette recorders in the united 
states a prospect broadcasters fear could cut deeply into their 
audience

oshakati southwest africa ap anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu and eight fellow bishops led a defiant church service saturday 
and called for namibian independence from south africa 
the main preacher bishop bruce evans described south africas 
occupation of the territory as evil urged christians to oppose it 
and called for the troops immediate withdrawal from southwest 
africa commonly known as namibia 
we say to the south african government get out evans a 
white from south africa told about 500 black worshippers we 
pray for independence 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize and the first black 
to lead the anglican church in southern africa told the 
congregation that two of evans sons have been detained in south 
africa for political activity 
oshakati is the administrative center of the northern region of 
ovambo the most populous area of namibia and the main operational 
zone of the southwest african peoples organization guerrilla 
movement during its sporadic 22yearold bush war against south 
african rule 
during their twoday trip to ovambo tutu and his colleagues 
have urged the immediate implementation of a 1978 united nations 
resolution calling for unsupervised independence elections 
most observers believe such elections would be won by swapo 
which is recognized by the un but condemned by south africa as a 
marxistoriented terrorist group 
south africa says it will not implement the un resolution 
until cuban troops withdraw from neighboring angola where they 
support the marxist government in a war against the south 
africanbacked unita rebel movement oshakati is a main staging 
point for south african forces fighting alongside unita the 
national union for the total independence of angola 
south africa has taken the military option tutu said after 
the church service it is not interested in negotiations 
tutu condemned the announcement by president pw boha on friday 
that he was broadening the powers of south africss chief 
representative in namibia 
you turn the screw tighter and tighter he said of south 
africa and you get less and less control 
among those attending the church service was peter kalangula 
leader of the ovambo regional administration he has refused to 
participate in the south africaninstalled territorial government 
and seeks to maintain good ties with swapo supporters 
kalangula who spoke with botha on friday in windhoek namibias 
capital said botha promised that defense minister magnus malan and 
army commander jannie geldenhuys would look into allegations of 
army atrocities when they visit oshakati soon

white soldiers had died friday from wounds they received in a 
bombardment thursday in the far northern part of the territory a

more than 1000 police officers ordered by 
the mayor to take back the streets raided gang strongholds 
today in their biggest attack on drug dealing and street violence 
in the nations secondlargest city 
the task force the largest to take to the streets of los 
angeles since the 1984 olympics arrested 634 people for 
investigation of a variety of offenses with 334 suspected of being 
gang members said police spokesman bill frio the other 300 were 
arrested for a variety of felony and misdemeanor offenses 
we are going to take these terrorists off the streets of los 
angeles mayor tom bradley a former police lieutenant said as 
the deployment began we are determined to take back the streets 
from these hoodlums 
blackandwhite police cruisers raced through southcentral los 
angeles where gangs hold sway most nights every few blocks a bust 
was taking place with officers swarming around handcuffed youths 
as patrol cars blocked the streets 
in addition to arrests police early today impounded 96 vehicles 
and 10 guns frio said 
prisoners sat in long lines on benches outside a temporary 
booking center at the los angeles memorial coliseum manacled and 
chained together waiting their turn for booking at folding tables 
some were released and others went to jail 
police chief daryl gates made a collar of his own stopping a 
man in gang dress frisking him and discovering a bottle of 
prescription drugs in somebody elses name 
the man whose name wasnt immediately released was held for 
investigation of possessing a controlled substance said lt mark 
leap noting wryly that the troops responded quite favorably 
assistant police chief robert vernon also made an arrest his 
collar was wanted for a parole violation frio said 
the mayor joined gates in addressing hundreds of shotguntoting 
officers at a roll call at the coliseum their comments apparently 
addressed to violenceweary citizens as well as the officers 
be gentle with the citizens so they dont feel their 
neighborhood is under siege gates said promising sterner 
measures for lawbreakers were going to wage a war and it will 
be over when the violence is over 
about half the special force augmented regular patrols in the 
gangplagued southcentral los angeles neighborhoods while the rest 
of the officers spread out across the citys four other police 
divisions 
the task force was assembled by putting officers on overtime at 
a cost of 150000 a day and bradley vowed to keep spending what 
it takes to intimidate the gangs blamed for 205 killings in the 
city of los angeles in 1987 
countywide the death toll from gang violence in 1987 was 387 
many of them innocent bystanders caught up in the gangs trademark 
driveby shootings 
officials estimate that there are about 70000 gang members in 
the city and drug dealing and gang violence have been a fact of 
life in the poor minority neighborhoods of southcentral los 
angeles 
but wider attention focused on the problem in february when a 
woman was killed by a stray bullet during a gang showdown in the 
affluent largely white westwood entertainment district near the 
university of california los angeles 
after a good friday attack killed one nongang member and 
injured 12 others on a southcentral los angeles sidewalk gates 
announced plans for the new task force 
bradley has budgeted to add 400 new police officers to the 
7000member force next year and political opposition to 
lawandorder measures aimed at gangs is virtually nonexistent 
county supervisor kenneth hahn has called for military police 
units from the national guard to patrol the worst neighborhoods 
but gov george deukmejian is cool toward the proposal

sikh militants may have acquired one or 
two usmade stinger antiaircraft missiles and hidden them inside 
the golden temple the sikh faiths holiest shrine punjab police 
officials said saturday 
possession of the shoulderfired heatseeking missiles would 
raise the militants arsenal to a new level 
sikh extremists who have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 
for greater autonomy or an independent homeland in punjab state 
generally have relied on knives swords pistols and automatic 
rifles 
their attacks so far this year in punjab have claimed at least 
676 lives including eight friday night and saturday in a 
halfdozen attacks across the northern state 
last month the extremists used rocketpropelled grenades for the 
first time in three attacks on police and paramilitary units 
stinger missiles may have been smuggled into the golden temple 
in trucks carrying rice milk and other supplies into the complex 
according to police who spoke on condition of anonymity 
about 10 sikh militant groups operate out of the temple complex 
indian paramilitary units have 17 checkpoints around the golden 
temple but no troops inside the complex 
initial intelligence reports suggest the militants inside the 
temple may have stinger missiles with them one senior police 
official said 
another police official said sikh separatists inside the temple 
were thought to have one or two stingers 
one official said the missiles were obviously from pakistan 
which borders punjab state 
india repeatedly has accused pakistan of allowing sikhs to train 
and arm on its territory pakistan has denied the accusation 
the united states supplies stingers through pakistan to afghan 
guerrillas who have been fighting soviet troops and the 
sovietbacked government in afghanistan since 1979 afghan 
guerrilla groups have bases in pakistan and huge arm bazaars have 
sprung up there 
amritsar is about 15 miles east of the pakistani border 
indian police have raided the golden temple a dozen times in the 
last two years but such raids are a political as well as a 
military risk because sikhs consider them a desecration of their 
holy shrine 
the late prime minister indira gandhi launched a major assault 
on the temple in 1984 in an effort to dislodge the militants about 
1200 people died in the raid prompting mrs gandhis 
assassination by her sikh bodyguards six months later 
since then the golden temple has been a hotbed of the sikh 
separatist movement and a haven for various militant factions 
sikhs whose faith has roots in hinduism and islam are a 
majority in punjab but make up only 2 percent of indias 800 
million people they claim they are discriminated against by 
hindus who form more than 80 percent of the nationwide population

nearly a year after leaving the top job at the 
national hurricane center to become a television weatherman neil 
frank still has a lot to say about hurricanes 
speaking at last weeks 10th annual national hurricane 
conference frank and his colleagues lamented the public tendency 
to think a hurricane will go exactly where the experts predict

senate investigators have stressed anew that 
the battle against illicit drugs shipped from latin america will be 
an uphill fight for a long long time if the government 
continues to tolerate foreign leaders who merely wink at the 
problem 
this is an enormously profitable business and it has been 
aided by several nations who claim to be our friends said sen 
john f kerry dmass whose foreign relations subcommittee on 
drugs and terrorism just concluded a second round of hearings on 
the issue 
were going to be fighting an uphill fight for a long long 
time as long as leaders of these countries are allowed to get away 
with this said kerry sen alfonse damato rny agreed 
saying drugs are winked at by many governments throughout latin 
america by highranking officials of those countries 
the two senators also faulted a lack of coordination in the us 
effort citing testimony which outlined disputes among various 
government agencies including the customs service the fbi the 
drug enforcement administration and the state department 
what we have to do is put drugs on the front burner establish 
that it is a priority issue for us in our dealings with these 
countries make those countries know that we will act and act 
toughly said damato 
the most recent testimony focused on the flow of drugs 
particularly cocaine and marijuana from colombia and implicated 
officials from honduras haiti and jamaica in addition to panama 
the first set of hearings last month focused on panamanian 
strongman manuel noriega and his ties to illegal drugs 
the witnesses most of them convicted drug dealers told 
detailed stories about nighttime flights at treetop level 
backroom cash deals in which few questions were asked and no names 
were offered payoffs were made to officials ranging from county 
sheriffs in the united states to toplevel officials in latin 
america and huge profits 
in my line of work it doesnt pay to ask too many questions 
or know too much i did not ask said george morales a convicted 
cocaine trafficker 
morales was explaining to reporters why he didnt know who owned 
the several hundred pounds of cocaine he claimed to have 
transported from costa rica to florida two years ago the drugs 
were brought back on a flight in which guns were flown to the 
contra guerrillas morales said 
kerry said he believes the witnesses despite their status as 
criminals and even though some of them claim the others are lying 
for example michael p vogel made up so many stories he was known 
as the liar by other members of a smuggling ring according to 
michael palmer a member of the same group 
theres an impressive amount of corroboration in their 
stories yes not every single detail matches up but they are 
telling the same stories and those stories are substantiated by the 
overwhelming amount of information said kerry 
damato also believed the stories i think the detail and the 
corroboration in the stories we heard are impressive he said 
the story told by gary betzner was typical of the drug 
smugglers the 47yearold father of five children testified that 
in his home state of arkansas he was a civic activist who was 
involved in local politics in addition to working as a crop duster 
betzner said he became a smuggler for a simple reason money 
in an 18month period he said he flew 50 drug flights and was 
paid at least 40000 each two other flights in which he ferried 
weapons to costa rica for the contras and returned with a planeload 
of drugs paid him 360000 each he said

li peng named to chinas top government post on 
saturday has tried to shake the label of conservative during five 
months as acting premier 
now that the national peoples congress has confirmed him as 
premier he is expected to press for reforms but at a slower pace 
than his predecessor zhao ziyang 
li 59 an electrical engineer by training lacks zhaos 
personal charisma and tends to be stiff in public appearances 
his only previous administrative experience came as head of the 
power and education ministries unlike zhao who was governor of 
sichuan chinas most populous province li never was responsible 
for administration of a region 
although he is wellconnected li is the adopted son of one of 
chinas most beloved communist officials the late premier chou 
enlai he is not believed to have a personal power base in the 
central government 
li has moved slowly in his new job the reorganization of 
government ministries approved by the congress was suggested before 
he became acting premier but he undoubtedly played a large role in 
working out details of the shakeup 
he has tried without success to change his conservative image 
an idea based in part on his years of study in the soviet union he 
is believed to favor a slower pace of change than zhao in chinas 
campaign to introduce market mechanisms into the economy and 
streamline the stagnant bureaucracy 
although he has referred to the conservative label as a 
misunderstanding his few statements on policy have reinforced 
it li has stressed the need for stability in the economy and for 
controlling inflation which reached 73 percent last year even if 
the measures slow reform of chinas pricing system 
in a work report to the congress delivered when it opened its 
annual session march 25 li endorsed the reform program but 
repeatedly cautioned against overexpectations and rushing 
headlong into change 
as premier li is responsible for the daytoday operations of 
the government zhao who gave up the premiership to become 
communist party chief controls the direction of government 
policies 
li was born in chengdu in southwest chinas sichuan province 
in 1928 his father was killed by nationalist soldiers during 
chinas civil war when li was 3 and he was adopted by chou enlai 
he spent his teen years at communist party headquarters in 
yenan where mao tsetung and chou directed the communists 
successful fight against the nationalists he joined the party at 
age 17 
from 1948 to 1954 he studied at the hydropower department of the 
moscow electrodynamics academy where he became fluent in russian 
after returning home he held a series of important engineering 
posts including chief engineer of chinas largest hydroelectric 
complex in jilin province in the northwest 
in 1978 li was promoted to full membership in the party central 
committee and in the next year became minister of power industry 
he became vice premier in 1983 and education minister in 1985 the 
same year continuing his climb up the party hierarchy he became a 
member of the politburo and secretariat 
he was made a member of the highest decisionmaking body the 
fivemember politburo standing committee at a party congress last 
fall 
weeks later he was appointed acting premier to replace zhao 
who resigned to take up the leadership of the communist party 
li has taught himself english his wife zhu lin formerly 
worked in the ministry of water resources and electrical power and 
their two sons and daughter are said to work in the same ministry

the selection of john c shepherd to become 
deputy attorney general of the united states has focused attention 
not so much on his legal credentials as on whether he has a mole on 
his upper thigh 
the question has come up before during and after a trial in 
which denise sinner who used to be the bookkeeper for shepherds 
law firm was convicted of stealing nearly 150000 from the office 
shepherd says he doesnt have a mole on his thigh 
sinner says she knows he does because they had an affair and 
that during the affair he authorized her to write checks to herself 
for the money that was taken 
now the fbi is looking into the case because shepherd 62 was 
picked by attorney general edwin meese to be the no 2 man in the 
justice department 
also to be checked out are shepherds memberships in the 
missouri athletic club which does not accept women and the 
bellerive country club which has no black members although the 
clubs bylaws say it is open shepherd said last week that he has 
not decided whether to resign from the clubs 
shepherd a prominent st louis attorney and former president of 
the american bar association has insisted that sinner is lying 
about the mole the affair and authorization to write checks 
her allegations are absolutely untrue and unfounded he said 
last week i am very confident that the fbis report will bring 
this matter to an end 
so is the justice department 
we were aware of the accusation before the selection was 
made said justice department spokesman terry eastland we 
understood that it was discredited at the time of the trial and 
believe that another investigation of this will show theres 
nothing there 
sinner 29 convicted of stealing 147000 from the law firm 
shepherd sandberg amp phoenix between july 1986 and february 1987 
claimed she and shepherd met at motels in st louis and chicago 
this woman had no corroboration for any of her testimony 
said michael g ravetta the assistant st louis circuit attorney 
who prosecuted her there wasnt a plane ticket there werent 
any receipts no bellhops came forward there was nothing not even 
a matchbook from a cheap motel 
when sinner was indicted she first told investigators she had a 
rich boyfriend who had been sending her checks that shed deposit 
into the firms account then she would write checks to herself off 
the account thus avoiding a wait for the boyfriends checks to be 
cleared 
obviously the auditors didnt find that to be true ravetta 
said thats when her story changed to the affair with shepherd 
sinner said friday that she lied initially to buy some time 
i thought he shepherd would be willing to work something 
out she said but that didnt happen so i decided to tell the 
truth 
sinner was hired by shepherds law firm through an employment 
agency ravetta said and appeared from her resume to be solid for 
the job 
but sinners attorney darrill s beebe said sinner whose 
college major was music was hired because of shepherd 
a 6 million law firm hires her to take care of the money 
beebe asked rhetorically at trial they didnt have a bookkeeper 
they had a twinkie 
ravetta said shepherd had nothing to do with the hiring 
sinner wrote more than 50 checks to herself before she was 
fired she contended that in the midst of the affair shepherd 
authorized her to write the checks to pay bills and buy luxury 
items such as a bmw car and a fur coat 
the jury agreed that it was just way too farfetched to 
think shepherd would have authorized sinner to write the checks 
said juror jo anne candela 
even so candela said most of the jurors believed that there 
was something fishy about the way sinner got the job 
a lot of us thought that maybe she was a con artist candela 
said but we also felt that there had been something there 
between her and shepherd 
sinner is scheduled to be sentenced later this month after 
that beebe said hell file an appeal that claims among other 
things that a pretrial motion to have shepherds right leg 
examined should not have been turned down 
ravetta said shepherd was willing to undergo the exam but 
ravetta himself decided to fight the motion because it was too 
general 
the motion said he had a mole birthmark or other skin 
imperfection above his right knee he said we just felt that 
we could have drawn a star on his leg with a ballpoint pen and she 
would have said thats what she saw

a luxury highrise some have called the devils 
building because of its 666 address will become the new home of 
playboy enterprises inc but the street number will read 680 by 
then 
playboy president christie hefner said friday her publishing 
video and licensing company has signed a 15year lease for 100000 
square feet on the 15th and 16th floors of the building which is 
to be called lake shore place as of may 1 
the new building which playboy will enter by the fall of 1989 
will provide the company with more efficient office space ms 
hefner said 
six hundred sixtysix north lake shore drive has been called the 
devils building or the markofthebeast building in reference to 
passages from the new testament book of revelation which refer to 
a beast with a mark of three sixes 
but people who live in the buildings 400 residential units were 
told in a march 1 letter the buildings address would change to 680 
north lake shore drive as of may 1 
spokesmen for the luxury buildings owner a chemical bank of 
new york subsidiary and the local management company golub amp co 
said the change was intended to dissassociate the building from the 
financial problems of its previous owner who lost a mortgage 
foreclosure battle with the bank last year 
it certainly wasnt us who raised the devil thing said 
michael schramm executive vice president of golub amp co 
playboy holds a 10year lease expiring in 1990 on 10 floors of 
the playboy building but the company does not need that space 
following the disposal of some businesses in recent years because 
of financial problems 
playboys current home was known as the palmolive building 
before hugh hefner playboys founder and ms hefners father 
bought the leasehold on the structure in 1965 playboy moved into 
the building in 1967 but sold the leasehold in 1980 
the company rejected moving to los angeles where hefner now 
lives or to new york where some playboy publishing and 
advertising executives are based in favor of staying in chicago 
ms hefner said

president reagan on saturday 
underscored his threat to veto a sweeping trade bill moving through 
congress saying the legislation could go a long way toward 
making america a bad investment 
reagan in his weekly radio address said we still have very 
underline very serious reservations about the bill 
he delivered the remarks from his mountaintop ranch where he has 
been spending a 10day vacation reagan will return to washington 
on sunday stopping briefly in las vegas to address the national 
association of broadcasters convention 
sen lloyd bentsen giving the democratic party response to the 
presidents address urged reagan to sign the trade measure 
no one suggests that the bipartisan trade bill congress will 
send to the president will solve all of americas problems with 
trade and restore our competitiveness said bentsen dtexas 
but we cant do the job without a consistent trade policy to 
shield us from protectionist pressures by opening world markets to 
american manufactured and agricultural products to create new 
opportunities for our service industry to accord trade policy the 
importance it so clearly deserves and to demonstrate that america 
is serious about insisting on equal access to world markets 
bentsen said 
the trade bill has been rewritten to delete a key provision that 
had drawn administration criticism the socalled gephardt 
amendment named for rep richard gephardt dmo that amendment 
would have forced a president under certain circumstances to 
retaliate against a country using unfair trade practices 
but the administration still objects to surviving provisions 
including one that would require businesses to give employees 60 
days advance notice of plans to close a plant or work place 
the administration also opposes a provision that would limit 
us sales by japans toshiba corp and a subsidiary as punishment 
for illegal sales to the soviet union of sensitive military 
technology 
without citing the provisions he dislikes reagan said the 
bottom line is this i will veto a bad trade bill before i let a 
bad trade bill veto our economy 
he said foreign investment in the united states isnt 
something to be scared of it brings us a host of benefits 
including jobs and lower interest rates for all americans 
we can be glad people in other countries choose to invest in 
the vibrant and growing us economy rather than their own 
nations reagan said 
however he said the trade bill could go a long way toward 
making america a bad investment for americans and foreigners 
alike 
reagan said the economy is strong and that the trade bill would 
adversely affect us business growth 
saying a higher percentage of the labor force is at work than 
ever before reagan told his listeners id love to take the 
blame or the credit as the case may be but that just wouldnt be 
fair 
reagan said he merely has presided over an administration that 
has reduced the governments regulation of business and has brought 
about tax cuts and that the us private sector has taken the 
economy and run with it 
after the radio address reagan was presented with a tribute 
the badge of the american spirit medal from the california 
association of highway patrolmen

here is a transcript of president 
reagans weekly radio address delivered saturday 
my fellow americans you probably heard that some of our 
political opponents are very concerned about the state of our 
economy and i have to tell you i dont blame them if i were in 
their shoes id be worried too 
you see april marks the 65th straight month of the longest 
peacetime expansion in us history 
in that time weve created nearly 16 million jobs they are 
better and higher paying too which is one reason why the real 
income of the average american has been rising steadily for the 
last five years 
the percentage of americans employed is the highest in history 
and the unemployment rate continues to drop down to its lowest 
level since 1974 since 1980 us manufacturing has increased its 
productivity almost three times as fast as in the seven previous 
years 
inflation remains low while the gross national product growth 
this year and last has exceeded even our own optimistic 
expectations 
somehow our opponents have convinced themselves that this record 
growth vibrant job creation and more productive economy is bad 
news and they say its all the fault of reaganomics well id love 
to take the blame or credit as the case may be but that just 
wouldnt be fair 
all we did was get government out of your way we cut taxes 
inflation and regulations and we let the american people take back 
their own economy and run with it 
in their effort to prove that this economic boom were in is 
really a bust our opponents have had to weave some pretty tall 
tales 
one of those they tell about america is that were threatened by 
foreign investment 
well to paraphrase what joe friday used to say in dragnet 
lets just look at the facts maam yes foreigners now hold 
about 12 percent of us public debt but thats down from 16 
percent in 1978 foreign resources also accounted for 10 percent of 
total credit market funds last year exactly the same as in the mid 
1970s 
but even so foreign investment isnt something to be scared of 
it brings us a host of benefits including jobs and lower interest 
rates for all americans whether they be home buyers small 
businessmen consumers or farmers 
writereconomist warren brooks makes a very good point what 
difference does it make he asks whether a japanese company 
owns a factory in detroit or in marysville ohio does someone 
seriously think they might dismantle it brick by brick and ship it 
back to japan in the middle of the night 
i wonder if the workers in those plants think foreign investment 
is such a bad thing or the nearly three million other americans 
employed by foreign firms in the united states whose payrolls add 
up to more than 70 billion and they pay about 8 billion in income 
taxes to the united states treasury the fact is we live in a 
global economy 
we can be glad people in other countries choose to invest in the 
vibrant and growing us economy rather than their own nations 
i dont blame them i think americas a pretty good investment 
too 
right now however theres a trade bill working its way through 
congress that could go a long way toward making americas bad 
investment for americans and foreigners alike at this moment 
weve not seen the final bill but from what we already know we 
still have very underline very serious reservations 
well continue to work with the full congress and the 
congressional leadership to clear up these problems 
but the bottom line is this i will veto a bad trade bill 
before i will let a bad trade bill veto out economic expansion 
another important matter facing the nation today is the inf 
treaty which i signed with general secretary gorbachev at our 
washington summit meeting last december 
this treaty will for the first time eliminate an entire class 
of us and soviet missiles we called this the zero option when 
i first proposed it in 1981 
the treaty also requires the soviet union to make far greater 
reductions now in its missile systems to reach equality with 
usthis is an historic precedent and we will apply it to other 
arms negotiations as well 
finally the treaty has the most comprehensive verification 
regime in arms control history this too is an important 
precedent for other negotiations particularly those on strategic 
arms where an even more elaborate verification regime will be 
required 
in sum this treaty represents what can be accomplished when we 
negotiate from a position of strength 
action on it is now up to the united states senate which must 
give its advice and consent to ratification i hope it will be 
given expeditious consideration by the full senate and i urge all 
senators to provide their advice and consent without reservation 
it is a solid treaty that it enhances the security of our 
country and our allies 
until next week then thank you for listening and god bless you

the arab hijackers of a kuwaiti jetliner 
today shot and killed a kuwaiti security guard on the plane and 
then freed another captive after officials refused to refuel the 
jet authorities said 
the identity of the man released was not immediately known but 
government spokesman akis fantis said he was about 25 years old and 
unwell fantis said he was taken by ambulance to a hospital in 
larnaca 
he gave no other details 
photographers at larnaca airport said the man was seen leaving 
the plane with a senior palestine liberation organization 
negotiator and two cypriot officials after their fourth meeting 
with the hijackers 
earlier the body of a man who had been killed his hands tied 
behind his back was tossed onto the tarmac an ambulance took the 
body away 
a stairway was then rolled out to the plane the plos deputy 
director in cyprus malaz abdo and the cypriot officials stood on 
the top step talking to a hijacker standing in the doorway of the 
jet just behind the cockpit 
the hijackers and negotiators held four separate meetings 
lasting a total of more than 1 hours before the captive was freed 
there was no immediate word on what was said at the plane 
fantis said the man was freed as a sign of good will by the 
hijackers 
fantis identified the dead man apparently the hijackers first 
victim as a young kuwaiti security guard he said an xray and 
pathologists examination showed the man was shot three times in 
the head and had a broken neck 
earlier the pilot said the gunmen were beating passengers 
about 55 people including at least half a dozen hijackers were 
aboard the kuwait airways boeing 747 on the fifth day of the ordeal 
the radioed message that the guard had been killed came at 1132 
am 432 am edt two minutes after a deadline set by the 
gunmen for refueling 
the tower had previously radioed that airport workers were 
afraid to approach the plane which the hijackers had warned they 
would blow up if security men tried to move in 
at 11 am director of civil aviation michael herodotou told 
the hijackers by radio that he needed more time to negotiate with 
the fuel workers who are afraid to approach you 
a hijacker accused the tower of misleading him throughout 
the night with bogus excuses for refusing to provide fuel he also 
said kuwait would be responsible for the consequences 
the hijackers main demand is the release of 17 proiranian 
terrorists convicted in kuwait of bombing the us and french 
embassies there in 1983 kuwait refuses 
the threat to kill a passenger followed a message from the tower 
appealing to the hijackers for the release of passengers so the 
refueling people can come to refuel your aircraft 
the hijackers started beating some of their captives early today 
after authorities failed to meet an earlier deadline to refuel the 
plane the pilot told the tower 
asked if he could see the beatings the pilot replied 
affirmative 
the hijackers earlier said six of the passengers were sick 
and that the cypriots refusal to refuel the jetliner is causing 
the sickness airport officials said 
tower officials had told the hijackers by radio that ground

here is a transcript of the response saturday 
by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas to president reagans weekly radio 
address 
on behalf of hundreds of democrats and republicans in congress 
i want to invite president reagan to stop brandishing his veto pen 
and accept the hand of friendship and work with us to fashion 
fair effective trade policies that will help america prosper in 
the 21st century 
late last week house and senate negotiators agreed on the 
outlines of comprehensive legislation that would finally establish 
trade policy as an urgent national priority it would put the world 
and our own government on notice that trade will no longer be 
the neglected stepchild of american policy 
its objective would be that countries which have full access to 
our market should grant us full access to their markets this 
legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support 
there are those who believe this bill doesnt do enough and 
there are those who prefer that we do nothing who like to conjure 
up images of the discredited smoothawley tariff thats unfair 
its like saying that anyone who supports a strong national defense 
is a warmonger 
and in this instance its especially unfair because the 
compromise trade bill is designed to resist protectionism by 
opening world markets and enforcing trade laws 
later this month well tie up the loose ends of the 
legislation bring it to a vote in congress and send it to the 
white house 
i would hope the president will sign it in the same spirit of 
bipartisanship which prevailed after the october 19 stock market 
crash six months ago at that time we all sat down together 
republicans and democrats white house and congress we set aside 
narrow partisan political differences and we hammered out some 
honest answers to the difficult problem of deficit reduction 
today we have an opportunity to take the same approach to the 
equally important problem of the trade deficit we just cant 
afford to be lulled into a false sense of security by the recent 
welcome surge in american exports monthly or quarterly economic 
snapshots dont accurately describe how trade has been a tragedy 
for the american worker during this decade 
let me give you an example of what i mean since 1981 our 
exports have stagnated while our imports have increased by 60 
percent thats why we had a 171 billion trade deficit last year 
this failure of exports to keep pace with imports has cost 
american dearly if exports had grown only onethird as rapidly as 
imports we would have created a million and a half jobs for 
american workers 
but jobs are only part of the story our soaring trade deficits 
have been matched by soaring international debt four years ago 
america was the worlds largest creditor nation today we are the 
largest debtor nation with international obligations of over 400 
billion we owe more money than mexico brazil argentina and 
venezuala combined 
for many years trade has sat below the salt when it comes to 
american policy and during the past seven years of growing trade 
deficits it hs remained there foreign policy monetary policy 
strategic policy have all taken precedence over trade random 
ineffective protectionist actions have served as a surrogate for 
trade policy 
no one suggests that the bipartisan trade bill congress will 
soon send to the president will solve all of americas problems 
with trade and restore our competitiveness 
but we cant do the job without a consistent trade policy to 
point us in the right direction to shield us from protectionist 
pressures by opening world markets to american manufactured and 
agricultural products to create new opportunities for our service 
industries to accord trade policy the importance it so clearly 
deserves and to demonstrate that america is serious about insisting 
on equal access to world markets 
the trade bill well send to the president gives america the 
tools we need to do a very difficult important job it is the 
bipartisan product of consultation and compromise it will help 
produce a stronger more competitive american presence in the world 
markets 
so with colleagues on both sides of the aisle i urge the 
president to sign the trade bill and join congress in creating an 
effective bipartisan american response to the challenge of trade

private pleas from arabs and israelis and his 
own instincts keep secretary of state george p shultz engaged in a 
middle east peace effort that has produced little progress so far 
shultz left the troubled region friday vowing to return 
convinced that all the key parties israel jordan and palestinian 
arabs want to work out a settlement 
he refused to be sidetracked by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs resistance to a symbolic peace conference that would 
launch the negotiations nor was he unnerved by a government 
statement in amman only hours after he left that jordan would not 
stand in for the palestinians 
shultz said israelis are as interested in peace and stability 
as jordan and the palestinians perhaps even more so he 
suggested the jordanian statement was designed for public 
consumption and did not reflect a more amenable stand taken 
privately by king hussein 
two of the basic elements in shultzs plan are a peace 
conference and exclusion of the palestine liberation organization 
he said in an interview in amman that the plo sought to exterminate 
israel officials kept it off the air 
shultz would have palestinians at the table but as part of a 
delegation with jordan he publicly opposed establishment of a 
palestinian state in the blackedout interview 
in jerusalem shultz tried to convince shamir that the peace 
conference he opposed was not the one shultz had in mind the 
israeli leader does not want to give the soviet union an 
opportunity to tilt a settlement in the arabs favor shultz told 
him the united states would not let that happen 
but shamir held fast to his position even though shimon peres 
the israeli foreign minister called negotiations within the 
framework of a peace conference the only hope in town 
otherwise peres warned the outlook in the region was bleak 
shamirs apprehension and husseins approval of a public policy 
statement that implied criticism of shultzs position reflect the 
mistrust that hung over the fiveday mission like a dark cloud 
shamir and other skeptical israelis doubt there is an arab 
partner ready to follow the course taken a decade ago by the late 
egyptian president anwar sadat and make peace with the jewish state 
these israelis are convinced sadat and the late lebanese 
president bashir gemayal who also sought peace with his neighbor 
were assassinated for extending an olive branch to israel 
many times in the past hussein has stepped to the brink of 
negotiations and then faltered peres and israelis who share his 
trust in the king are convinced this time the king means it 
shultz urged the israelis to consider hussein their possible 
partner in peace 
on the arab side meanwhile there are many obstacles in 
shultzs way 
after the 1967 sixday war in which the arabs took an 
embarrassing drubbing from the vastly outnumbered israelis and lost 
the west bank gaza the golan heights and east jerusalem the 
arabs vowed not to negotiate or recognize israel 
in 1974 they declared the plo to be the palestinians sole 
legitimate representative the plo undertook a terrorism campaign 
against israel the united states and moderate palestinians 
the arab positions and a basic resistance to a jewish state in 
the middle east are formidable roadblocks to shultz 
moreover shamir and peres would retain at least part of the 
west bank shultz told the arabs candidly that recovering all of 
the lost territory simply was not in the cards 
and yet shultz said he would not give up 
frequently describing himself as stubborn shultz said he could 
feel it in his bones that the arabs and israelis eventually will 
come around 
whos afraid to struggle against odds he said friday in 
amman you have to be willing to do it what am i saving myself 
for anyway 
ive got a few more months to go here and i want to try to 
leave something constructive for the region and for my successors 
so i am going to put my back into it why not

a court ruled saturday that the government 
may confiscate several million dollars in assets that anwar sadats 
brother and 10 family members were convicted of acquiring through 
corruption 
the court exempted from the takeover several cars and some 
jewelry and real estate but allowed the seizure of bank accounts 
and some property 
esmat sadat brother of the slain egyptian president said he 
would appeal on behalf of himself three of his sons and seven 
other relatives involved in the case 
he said the case was politically motivated and aimed at smearing 
his brothers name and presidential tenure 
the 11 were charged in 1982 a year after anwar sadats 
assassination with amassing millions of dollars through influence 
peddling bribery and other corruption at that time their 
property was sequestered for five years 
they were convicted on 24 counts of influence peddling black 
marketeering and bribery 
the court said that there was no evidence the president was tied 
in any way to illicit activities 
early this month the nations prosecutor general demanded 
confiscation of 82 million worth of property exempting from the 
request a car and an apartment for each defendant 
saturdays court session was for the reading of the verdict 
flanked by two of his sons esmat sadat sat quietly fingering worry 
beads and waited for sayed abdelbaky president of the sevenman 
tribunal to read it 
this is politics this is a public opinion case and i 
expected no less sadat told reporters afterward many others 
were let off without confiscation why us 
esmat sadat went into private business in 1973 during his 
brothers third year as president after 30 years as a bus company 
employee his salary when he left the company was about 100 a 
month

after a week of waiting the united states on 
saturday received a written soviet response to a reagan 
administration proposal for continued superpower military support 
for the factions in afghanistan us officials said 
and secretary of state george p shultz as he studied the 
response considered a trip to geneva this week to attend the 
signing of a longawaited accord ending soviet troop presence in 
afghanistan 
the united states had called on moscow to confirm in writing 
that it accepted the us compromise on the issue of military 
assistance to afghan elements after the soviets carry out a plan to 
remove their estimated 115000 troops from afghanistan 
no details of the soviet response were revealed however the 
soviets earlier this week were reported to have informally 
accepted the us proposal 
sondra mccarty a state department spokeswoman said shultz had 
received a response from soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and its being studied 
the reply was turned over to the us embassy in moscow and 
cabled to washington said another us official speaking on 
condition of anonymity he said shultz may go to geneva to join 
shevardnadze at the signing ceremony of a comprehensive 
unsponsored afghan settlement 
shultz returned friday night from a grueling fivecountry 
sixday trip to the middle east and has already scheduled an april 
1926 trip that will take him to moscow to prepare for president 
reagans may 29june 2 summit with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
un mediator diego cordovez announced on friday after six years 
of negotiations that an accord was ready for signature by 
representatives of pakistan and the warring afghan government and 
resistance forces 
under the accord the soviets would start pulling their troops 
out of afghanistan on may 15 and complete the withdrawal in nine 
months with half the soviet soldiers leaving in the first three 
months 
afghan refugees mostly in pakistan would be allowed to return 
home and afghanistan would become a neutral and nonaligned nation 
under us and soviet guarantees 
the us proposal permits the superpowers to continue military 
support for their clients in afghanistan the moscowbacked 
government in kabul and the mujahedeen rebels who have been 
receiving us weapons 
shultz had hoped the soviets would agree to a mutual cutoff of 
aid to the factions in afghanistan but the soviets asserted their 
right to keep supplying the kabul government so the united states 
suggested an agreement on mutual continuation of aid 
officials in washington said the deal could eventually lead to a 
cessation of aid if the soviets decide to stop assisting the 
afghan government the united states might be prepared to follow 
suit with a symmetrical cessation of its aid to the resistance 
us aid including portable stinger antiaircraft missiles said 
to have downed hundreds of soviet helicopters and planes has been 
credited by resistance leaders and us officials as the key 
assistance element that permitted afghan guerrillas to wage 
effective campaigns against the soviet troops 
moscow sent its army into afghanistan in december 1979 to take 
control of antiguerrilla operations the prosoviet afghan army had 
been waging ineffectively and to oust a kabul government whose 
support for soviet policies was wavering

victor posner one of the nations highest paid 
executives who runs a multibilliondollar business empire has 
traded the executive suite for the mean streets as he embarks on a 
courtordered campaign to aid the homeless 
posner pleaded no contest in february to a charge of income tax 
fraud for inflating the value of a land donation he was sentenced 
to fund a 3 million program to study the extent of homelessness in 
south florida and come up with some solutions 
in addition since his sentencing the 69yearold posner has 
spent one day a week as a volunteer at camillus house a miami 
shelter for the downandout 
since february i have been studying and learning about the 
problems of the homeless both nationally and in florida posner 
told us district judge eugene spellman last week 
but the practical businessman noted all the studies in the 
world will not help one homeless person you must give the 
homeless a home so they will feel like people not animals 
the selfmade industrialist who dropped out of high school at 
13 runs a 40company empire that has been valued at about 4 
billion business week named him the nations toppaid chief 
executive for 1985 with an estimated salary of 127 million in 
1986 he slipped to third at 84 million 
his legal troubles however took him from the rarefied 
atmosphere of high finance to helping on the bread line at camillus 
house 
brother paul johnson the roman catholic clergyman who runs 
camillus house said posners eyes have been opened by the 
experience which the judge ordered as part of his probation 
i was surprise and pleased said johnson he was quite a 
bit concerned with the people 
posner serves food hands out clothing and signs people into the 
shelter at night johnson said but the alcoholics anonymous and 
substance abuse meetings seem to have affected the highpowered 
businessman the most 
he commented that the guys were intelligent he said i 
think he was very surprised about that it made him realize they 
really are victims of substance abuse 
johnson said posners instincts are generous almost to a fault 
at one point the clergyman kidded the multimillionaire about giving 
out too much bread on the food line 
he was giving them all they wanted said johnson he told 
me i could always get more 
posner has shown his generosity before he donated 100000 to a 
fund for ronnie desillers a miami boy who died last year in 
pittsburgh after three unsuccessful liver transplants desillers 
mother maria is accused of misusing some of the funds raised for 
her son 
but posner has also shown an insensitivity that angers his 
detractors 
after his first conviction on fraud charges which was later 
thrown out because jurors had received outside information about 
the case posner said these people on the jury are making 150 
a week theyre poor people they just dont understand 
the us attorneys office denounced posners sentence to 
charity as a slaponthehand for wrongdoing that could have sent 
posner to prison for 40 years 
laudable as the project envisioned by this court may be we 
submit it would disserve and cause disrespect for our system of 
justice and only emphasize that the rich can trade money for 
liberty while the poor cannot us attorney leon kellner said 
last monday in a motion challenging the sentence 
posner and his attorney wellknown washington lawyer edward 
bennett williams told spellman they would go ahead with the 3 
million homeless project whether or not that part of the sentence 
was upheld williams must reply formally within 30 days to 
kellners motion 
the project will be monitored by spellman and a 10member 
blueribbon committee of prominent area residents the first part 
due to be finished by may 16 is a census of the homeless in dade 
broward and palm beach counties who they are and what resources 
are available to them 
next posner said should come some kind of pilot program that 
shows what can be done 
i will come to you with what will solve the problem posner 
told the judge 
although hes paying for the study posner emphasizes it was 
mandated by the judge and the industrialist clearly is more 
interested in the project itself he is already talking up 
federally subsidized housing plans as a realistic approach to help 
the homeless 
sister jeanne oloughlin president of barry univeristy which 
is administering the study said she hopes the money and attention 
posner is giving to the homeless will be the catalyst for what 
could become a 300 million program and she said she expects 
posner to stay involved 
he has a very fast mind she said hes creating solutions 
even before we give him all the data

trailed by a large crowd the tall 
dark stranger definitely had a way about him as he strolled through 
town staring into shop windows 
clearly this was not your ordinary 200pound black bear he 
was shopping for groceries in the 5000population community and 
until thursday night hadnt done too badly for himself 
they had to block off streets said cloverdale police 
dispatcher shauna tipler not to keep the bear from the people 
but the people from the bear they loved it it was comical there 
was this bear walking around town followed by a huge crowd 
it was the young bears third straight nocturnal visit to this 
town 80 miles north of san francisco his earlier trips won him 
meals of chickens and ducks but the bears third foray from the 
forest proved unlucky 
after a state department of fish and game trap failed a citizen 
committee of ad hoc vigilantes chased the bruin 35 feet up a tree 
where a police sharpshooter shot him with a tranquilizer gun the 
groggy beast hung onto a branch for about 10 minutes before falling 
into a giant canvas held by about 20 people 
the snoozing bear got a free ride to a holding cage at rancho 
cordova near sacramento and will be released into the wild later 
fish and game spokesman jim swanson reported 
its just a young foolish bear said swanson hes just a

it took only a single anonymous vote but an 
illinois state university student wasnt complaining about the 
unexpected launch of his political career 
diego alvarado 24 of normal received one writein vote for 
mclean county circuit clerk in the march 15 democratic primary no 
one else ran for the nomination and another person who received a 
writein vote declined it 
alvarado said friday he would run in the november general 
election for the clerks office which employs 55 people and keeps 
track of court paperwork 
i take this step because i believe the circuit clerks office 
should work primarily to serve the public alvarado said friday 
the political science junior has never held an elected public 
office but he was a delegate for gary hart at the 1984 democratic 
national convention in san francisco and has been active in campus 
political groups 
i feel i have something to offer the voters he said its 
been in my mind to run for office and ive been involved in 
politics all my life 
mclean county democratic party chairman john penn welcomed 
alvarados decision to run but the republican nominee 40yearold 
sharon siron expressed some disappointment 
there was no one on the democratic ticket at the time of the 
primary and i was hoping i wouldnt have a race in november she 
said but i hear its fun to campaign all summer

isham lincoln amp beale a law firm cofounded by 
abraham lincolns son is succumbing to internal strife and closing 
its doors after 116 years 
this has been a trying experience and one of the most 
regrettable results ive seen in my life said richard marcus a 
wellknown labor attorney and partner in the firm 
he said friday that partners voted to dissolve their practice 
two years after a merger with a younger firm that proved a dismal 
failure 
the ishamlincoln partnership was founded in 1872 by edward 
isham son of a vermont supreme court justice and robert todd 
lincoln a harvardeducated lawyer who later became us war 
secretary and us minister to great britain 
the firms clients have included commonwealth edison co 
mcdonalds corp tribune co firemans fund corp cbs inc and 
national broadcasting co inc 
but its financial difficulties became public in 1986 when the 
conservative firm merged with the younger and more aggressive 
reuben amp proctor in what was the largest law firm merger in chicago 
history 
the amalgam which retained the isham name initially had 225 
attorneys but by friday only 80 were left 
there was an inescapable feeling that there was no longer any 
sense of cohesiveness which is absolutely essential for a firm to 
stay together grow and attract new clients said marcus who 
will lead a small group of attorneys in joining the firm of 
sonnenschein carlin nath amp rosenthal 
it certainly indicates how transitory human organizations are 
and how important it is to be mindful of the human fabric said 
max wildman lead partner in another major chicago law firm 
wildman harold allen amp dixon 
with such distinguished lineage its most regrettable

white house chief of staff howard 
baker conceded saturday that economic sanctions against panama have 
hurt the people more than they have hurt strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
but baker called the measures carefully thought out and 
carefully executed and said they were unavoidable 
we grieve for the people of panama baker told reporters he 
said though that us officials hope the new economic sanctions 
announced on friday will further undermine noriegas hold on power 
the chief of staff also acknowledged that a series of economic 
sanctions taken against noriega to this point have had little 
effect on the general 
this contradicted bakers statement of friday in which he told 
reporters he thought the punitive measures by the united states had 
left the panamanian strongman a beleaguered and de facto leader 
of the central american nation 
on saturday baker acknowledged that the sanctions for the most 
part had wreaked havoc with the panamanian economy 
general noriega no doubt has money squirreled away who 
knows where and and i doubt very much that we have done much to 
interrupt his lifestyle or to diminish his assets the chief of 
staff said 
and it does hurt the people of panama and the people of 
panama are the ones that have been hurt for a long time by the 
authoritarian rule of general noriega and by his drug trafficking 
to their detriment baker added and we regret that were 
extremely concerned about not only the security of the canal and 
the security of americans but also the welfare of the people of 
panama 
but the answer to that is the resumption of constitutional 
government in that country he said and it is our fervent hope 
that that will occur soon and occur in a satisfactory way 
whereas a senior administration official early last week 
suggested that dissident elements in the panamanian defense forces 
might force noriega out baker indicated saturday the invocation of 
emergency economic powers by reagan might invite the panamanian 
people to demonstrate for noriegas removal 
baker said reagans decision to use the international emergency 
economic powers act to further impede the flow of us dollars to 
panama will have farreaching consequences and said the 
presidents hope is that it also will have a convincing effect on 
the people of panama and on general noriega 
but baker acknowledged that the steps taken to put pressure on 
noriega undoubtedly hurt the people of panama more than they hurt 
him 
noriega has clung to power despite one coup attempt in panama 
and increasing political military and economic pressure from the 
united states 
baker said he did not put much stock in reports of marxist 
intervention on noriegas behalf saying i dont know that 
theres anything going on thats particularly alarming or 
particularly different but were keeping very close touch with 
it 
last week the washington times reported that an international 
marxist brigade of up to 1200 troops had gone into panama to help 
protect noriega but us officials said they had no confirmation 
of that 
baker also refused to speculate on what options reagan might 
elect if the latest economic sanctions do not succeed 
the president of the united states does not signal in advance 
what his next steps if any will be baker said 
the chief of staff laid much of the problem in panama to 
noriegas alleged involvement with drugpeddling 
noriega has been indicted by a federal grand jury in miami on 
drugtrafficking charges and there have been some suggestions 
within the administration that the united states would not seek to 
extradite and try the panamanian strongman if noriega fled to a 
third country 
the drug component is bigger than almost anybody imagines 
baker said adding 
the international drug cartels are so big and so powerful and 
have so permeated the governments of some of the countries of this 
hemisphere that it becomes a threat to the national security of 
this nation 
we are addressing that baker said the president is 
addressing the situation aggressively the first lady nancy 
reagan has addressed it aggressively it is a component in our 
concerns about central america 
it is not something that will be solved easily or quickly 
he said it is a situation that as we approach a solution will 
produce resistance from those who are deeply engaged in the drug 
business but the drug business is awful the drug business is 
destructive to our lifestyle and the security of this country and 
weve simply got to face it for what it is

a businessman who was a member of the 
secret army that won israels independence has been granted 
clemency to complete his florida murder sentence on a kibbutz in a 
deal with the state cabinet 
william shapiro 62 of miami has served 13 years of his life 
sentence but plans to board an el al jet monday evening in miami 
and renounce his us citizenship upon arriving in israel his 
attorney alvin lodish said saturday 
high officials in the israeli government florida legislators 
and others sought clemency for new yorkborn shapiro citing a lack 
of credibility in the evidence that put him in prison for the 
murder of business partner burt dewitt 
they argued a man with shapiros distinguished background as a 
combat officer in the us marines during world war ii and the 
korean war as a 12year veteran and ballistics officer with the 
israeli national police and as a liberator of israel could not have 
been guilty of murder 
the evidence just wasnt very strong against shapiro said 
lodish who was asked by israels consul general in miami rahamin 
timor to handle the case it is highly unusual to have someone 
convicted of firstdegree murder on evidence like that 
pleas on shapiros behalf were sent by former israeli ambassador 
to the united states meir rosenne jerusalem mayor teddy kolek 
former bnai brith international president william wexler and a 
man who shapiro says was a member of the haganah a jewish defense 
force formed secretly under british rule to counter arab attacks 
it became the core of the israeli army after the jewish state was 
founded in 1948 
a dade county circuit court jury convicted shapiro in february 
1976 of firstdegree murder and conspiracy to commit murder 
shapiro was convicted on the testimony of larry d murren who 
pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder and was sentenced to 10 
years in prison in exchange for his testimony according to court 
records murren was paroled after less than four years 
the only real evidence and testimony against shapiro was this 
guy murren who had admitted he lied initially when he told the fbi 
his story said lodish 
another codefendant michael salvatore was sentenced to death 
for the dewitt murder in 1975 but that was commuted to life in 
prison in 1981 he remains in jail 
according to shapiros legal file there was never any doubt 
that shapiro didnt participate directly in dewitts pipe beating 
death 
prosecutors claimed he hired murren and salvatore to do the 
deed but other evidence suggested the two men killed dewitt and 
dumped his body at sea so they could steal back a stolen boat they 
had sold to dewitt 
shapiro needed last months clemency deal with gov bob martinez 
and the independently elected state cabinet sitting as the board 
of executive clemency because the united states and israel have no 
prisonerexchange treaty said lodish 
conditions of the agreement require shapiro to renounce his us 
citizenship and be relocated at the kibbutz ayelethashachar in 
northern israel where he will work at least eight hours a day six 
days a week 
herut lapid director of the united kibbutz movement and 
director of prisons and rehabilitation assured state officials in 
a letter that a rehabilitation plan has been worked out for shapiro 
florida has no way of ensuring shapiro will finish his sentence 
at the kibbutz once in israel but the promise of a job and dozens 
of letters from wellrespected sponsors make martinez and the 
cabinet believe he will honor the agreement 
we would hope that a nation such as israel would live up to 
whatever agreement that we use here to engage in clemency 
said martinez

the frontrunner for the republican 
gubernatorial nomination secretary of state jim waltermire died 
in a plane crash as he was returning from a campaign stop 
authorities said saturday 
waltermire who was in a threeway race for the gop nomination 
was flying back from glasgow in northeastern montana when the 
twinengine cessna 310 went down friday night in a field east of 
east helena said his campaign manager chuck brooke the pilot 
also was killed 
waltermire of helena and his two gop rivals had addressed a 
lincoln day dinner in glasgow 
lewis and clark county coroner mickey nelson identified 
waltermires body and that of the pilot james a morris 64 of 
dillon 
the plane disappeared from radar at 1123 pm as it approached 
the helena airport in light snow said nick wantiez a spokesman 
for the federal aviation administration in seattle 
the plane crashed a few minutes later in a field about four 
miles from the airport runway and a quartermile north of us 12 
said nelson searchers found the plane about four hours later 
the planes wreckage was scattered along a path about 200 yards 
long and 50 to 75 yards wide nelson said 
it was believed it the plane originally had a pilot and two 
passengers but theres a possibility that one of the passengers 
deplaned were just not sure wantiez said 
brooke said he knew of only two people aboard 
nelson described morris as a very experienced pilot who was 
familiar with the airport but he said a severe springtime 
storm could have contributed to the crash it was snow and 
sleet and fairly high winds he said 
waltermire 39 was elected secretary of state in 1980 and was 
reelected in 1984 opposing him for the gop gubernatorial 
nomination was state rep cal winslow and former state sen stan 
stephens 
waltermire began his political career in 1977 when he was 
elected missoula county commissioner he ran unsuccessfully for the 
western district congressional seat in 1978 before becoming 
secretary of state two years later 
he began laying the groundwork for his gubernatorial bid shortly 
after being elected to a second term putting in place an elaborate 
funding operation to pay for what he said could be a 1 million 
campaign 
waltermire had been at the center of controversy since assuming 
the secretary of states office ten months after his election he 
was embroiled in a dispute over his plan to create an ethics 
commission 
in 1985 he was criticized for using official trips at state 
expense to arrange financing and support for future political 
campaigns he also came under fire for adding two political 
advisers to his office staff and for using state phones to talk 
with former campaign consultants and contributors 
last year the courts overturned the election on two ballot 
measures because of mistakes made by waltermires office in the 
preelection publication of the initiatives

latin americas most violent 
antius demonstration of the year took place in washingtons 
closest regional ally 
as workers shoveled charred debris into bins saturday and 
engineers assessed damage to the firegutted us consulate 
diplomats asked themselves what was behind the outbreak of 
bitterness that left five people dead and caused millions of 
dollars of damage 
honduras receives more than 300 million a year in us aid 
hosts military maneuvers involving thousands of us troops and has 
been the staunchest supporter of washingtons nicaragua policy 
which has involved funding the contra rebels for many years the 
insurgents had bases in honduras 
north americans in latin america are elephants in a crystal 
shop a south american ambassador in central america told the 
associated press friday night 24 hours after a mob of nearly 2000 
people attacked the us embassy complex in tegucigalpa capital of 
honduras 
i dont have a bone of antiamericanism in me said the 
envoy who has served in several latin american nations and spoke 
on condition he not be further identified but i cant understand 
why when they the americans have all these problems in the 
region panama nicaragua they create another one i honduras by 
acting arrogantly 
he referred to the arrest tuesday of juan ramon matta an 
alleged drug lord long wanted in the united states 
on tuesday honduran officials took matta from his tegucigalpa 
home in a predawn raid and hustled him onto a plane to the 
dominican republic without a passport 
dominican officials put matta on a new yorkbound flight and he 
was arrested aboard the jetliner by us marshals according to 
us law enforcement officials 
matta held at the maximumsecurity federal prison in marion 
ill was wanted by us officials for questioning in the 1985 
slaying in mexico of a us drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena salazar 
honduran legislators angrily called the incident a 
kidnapping and the foreign ministry launched an investigation 
the honduran constitution prohibits the extradition of citizens 
the move raised a storm of protest much of it from groups 
outside the small honduran marxist left which blasts the united 
states as a matter of course 
the daily newspaper el tiempo said in an editorial in less 
than a month honduras has been moved to indignation by two events 
which affected national dignity integrity and sovereignty 
in both cases the offense has come from the united states 
the events show that the honduran nation does not exist because 
its authorities carry out the orders of another state and negate 
their own institutions 
besides the matta case the paper referred to the dispatch to 
honduras last month of 3200 us troops in response to a reported 
incursion by nicaraguan forces into honduras the government of 
president jose azcona asked for the support but honduran 
congressmen complained they were not consulted 
oswaldo ramos soto rector of the national university in 
tegucigalpa said of mattas arrest i think drug smugglers 
should be captured and tried but the extradition of matta means 
that our constitution has been flagrantly violated the united 
states has created with this incident a situation that will be 
taken advantage of by communists in our country 
azconas government as well as the us embassy contend the 
infuriated mob that set fire to the consulate is a tiny minority of 
marxist subversives police said four men and a woman died of 
gunshot wounds during the riot 
they said privately contracted honduran guards who take over 
guard duty from us marines at night fired into the mob with 
shotguns 
but an embassy spokesman commenting on condition of anonymity 
denied that any personnel under contract to the mission opened fire 
the spokesman rejected the suggestion that there was antius 
feeling in honduras about to explode 
that thursday night was a small misguided group that does 
not represent the great majority of the honduran people he said 
he said however that the ferocity of the reaction to mattas 
extradition was somewhat surprising

mississippi democrats dealt a major blow 
saturday to the influence of newly inaugurated gov ray mabus 
retaining the nations only black party chairman over the candidate 
backed by the governor 
the heated campaign between ed cole an assistant to sen john 
stennis dmiss and billie thompson a white tupelo 
businesswoman had been seen by some as the sign of a split in the 
party however cole thompson and a spokesman for mabus who did 
not attend all said the party would remain unified 
cole 43 who became chairman in november when his predecessor 
resigned received 56 of the 97 votes cast to win a full fouryear 
term thompson was the choice of 41 members of the 100member 
committee two members were absent and one who attended did not 
vote 
thompson was a strong supporter of mabus during his successful 
campaign last year cole supported former gov bill waller in the 
first primary but switched to mabus in the runoff 
thompson said she had offered cole her congratulations and 
pledged him my total and complete support 
i really think the party is going to get together we dont 
have any choice she said 
democrats face major elections this year with 4th district rep 
wayne dowdy a democrat facing 5th district republican rep trent 
lott in the race to succeed stennis who is retiring after 41 years 
in the senate 
democrats who generally dominate mississippi politics also 
face strong republican opposition in the races for dowdys and 
lotts seats 
cliff treyens mabus director of communications said the 
governor was called at the governors mansion and informed of the 
outcome of saturdays vote and his reaction was to congratulate 
cole 
we knew it would be a tough effort treyens said 
mabus had refused to comment publicly on the fight 
cole said he did not ask for a fight with the governor but 
wanted mabus to accept that he belongs to our party and our party 
does not belong to him 
cole took over as party head when steve patterson of jackson 
resigned before announcing his unsusccessful bid for the partys 
nomination in the 4th congressional district 
patterson who supported coles effort to win a full term and 
said he was tickled to death with the outcome 
while the fight over the chairmanship had been described as 
split along racial lines all the nominating and seconding speeches 
were made by blacks

mercedes vaca winces at the thought 
that imprisoned contra rebels and former national guardsmen maybe 
men who killed her son might go free under a government amnesty 
sylvia aleman says her two brothers were falsely accused of 
being antigovernment guerrillas and she fumes at the idea that 
they remain behind bars 
in the hearts of these two women both prominent members of 
mothers movements with opposing views there can be no truce no 
lasting peace 
sandinista government troops and contra rebels have observed a 
60day ceasefire since april 1 during that time they have tried 
to negotiate a permanent truce in the 6yearold civil war that 
has killed or injured an estimated 60000 people 
as part of the ceasefire the sandinistas have pledged 
gradually to free 3300 political prisoners and allow exiles to 
return to nicaragua 
mrs vaca 69 a staunch government supporter and member of the 
governmentsupported mothers of heroes and martyrs bristles at 
talk of the release 
we are afraid she said last week we dont have any trust 
in the contras they killed they are savage animals 
do you know how many children died in their mothers arms how 
can we forgive that she asked sitting in a rocking chair at her 
home in a middleclass managua neighborhood 
for me there will always be pain she said i lost my 
son 
jacinto vaca is a hero to many nicaraguans they count him among 
martyrs who died to bring the sandinistas to power in a 
revolutionary war that ousted dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
vaca began fighting when he was 13 years old when he was 24 he 
was killed in a northern village by members of somozas national 
guard which the rightist proamerican leader had used to maintain 
power 
i felt he was too young to be a revolutionary said mrs 
vaca a petite elegant woman with white hair but it was a time 
when it was a crime just to be young 
vaca was arrested three times held incommunicado tortured and 
beaten but he stayed loyal to the revolution his mother said 
after the last time he was taken prisoner he said hed rather 
die than go back to jail she said they the national guard 
were inhuman i cant tell you all the horrors all the blood what 
criminals they are 
the contra rebels grew from a group of national guardsmen that 
fled to honduras and the northern mountains after somoza was 
overthrown by late 1981 trained and supplied by the cia they 
began to mount attacks to oust the sandinista government 
over the years many poor peasants joined their ranks 
mrs aleman a member of the opposition jan 22 movement said 
last week two of her younger brothers were hauled off to jail four 
years ago and summarily charged by a revolutionary court the group 
is named after the day it was founded in 1987 
about 10 military jeeps surrounded the house said mrs 
aleman 36 a leader of an antigovernment group of mothers and 
other relatives of political prisoners 
it was terrible they were state security agents and they 
searched the house beat up my nephew and planted weapons she 
said 
they took away juan pablo aleman 32 and sentenced him to 18 
years in prison later that day police picked up her other 
brother elias aleman 34 on a street in managua she said 
we didnt know where elias was they wouldnt say said mrs 
aleman waiting to take statements from relatives of other 
political prisoners at an office of the democratic coordinate an 
antigovernment umbrella group 
we didnt know anything for two months he has been tortured 
and beaten she said 
mrs aleman says she detests and mistrusts the sandinistas who 
sentenced elias to 30 years in jail she said many of the 4000 
mothers who belong to her group tell similar horror stories of 
clandestine jails and torture 
the sandinistas are as they always have been deceiving 
lying to the people the darkhaired woman with coffeecolored 
complexion said they will never live up to the ceasefire 
agreement on their own 
mrs aleman said she had prayed her brothers would be among the 
first 100 prisoners freed march 27 
i didnt get emotional when i saw they werent included maybe 
im tired we have suffered so much only god can help us she 
said lowering her eyes 
mrs vaca says she has sympathy for people like mrs aleman for 
their children she feels something else we feel sorry for them 
because they have children who are murderers

the courtroom battle for the child once 
known as baby m ended last week when the woman who bore the child 
under a surrogate contract won greatly expanded visitation rights 
now the dispute over 2yearold melissa sterns future moves out 
of the public eye and into the privacy of the counselors office 
mary beth whiteheadgould the childs biological mother and 
william and elizabeth stern who have custody of the girl have 
been ordered to undergo counseling to come to terms with their new 
and complicated relationship 
the sterns and mrs whiteheadgould disagree over how how easy 
it will be to work out their problems 
the sterns still distrust mrs whiteheadgould and feel she 
doesnt have the childs best interest in mind said frank donahue 
a lawyer for the tenafly couple 
i think to make this work mary beth is going to have to 
recognize that although shes the mother bill and betsy are the 
ones who are going to shape and form this child and they will be 
the role models donahue said 
but mrs whiteheadgoulds attorney joel siegal said the new 
arrangement will proceed much more quickly than the parties 
themselves realize 
theyre all nice people theyre intelligent they all love 
melissa they recognize that its counterproductive not to 
cooperate he said 
wednesdays ruling by superior court judge birger m sween was 
the final legal word in a dispute that began moments after 
melissas birth on march 31 1986 and went on to capture worldwide 
attention 
both sides enter into their new relationship with victories and 
losses in the courts 
the sterns he a biochemist she a pediatrician won custody 
of melissa in a feb 3 new jersey supreme court ruling that upheld 
the custody portion of a march 31 1987 lowercourt decision the 
supreme court then returned the case to superior court to resolve 
the visitation issue 
the sterns both 42 had hired mrs whiteheadgould 31 to bear 
them a child for 10000 by being artificially inseminated with 
sterns sperm 
when the child was born however mrs whiteheadgould changed 
her mind about the arrangement and refused to give up the baby no 
money ever changed hands 
under sweens visitation ruling the sterns will be in charge of 
most of the childs upbringing including such matters as education 
and religion in effect stern will be the father mrs stern the 
stepmother 
but the sterns lost their fight to cut mrs whiteheadgould off 
completely from the child sween granted the east brunswick 
housewife immediate unsupervised visitation for six hours one day 
a week 
the judge ruled the visitation is to be expanded to include an 
extra day every other week overnight some holidays and a twoweek 
vacation in the summer of 1989 
the visitation and the counseling are to begin immediately but 
the exact dates were put under seal by the judge 
lori andrews a researcher with the american bar foundation who 
has followed the case closely said the key to protecting the child 
is cooperation among the adults 
if the parties can see it as a final action and cooperate 
theres less of a chance of harm if theyre both trying to enlarge 
their rights constantly the child will become more of an object 
ms andrews said

georgia will prohibit the execution of people 
found guilty but mentally retarded when a newly signed bill 
prompted by a 1986 execution takes effect this summer 
the measure passed the 1988 general assembly despite initial 
opposition to early drafts from prosecutors gov joe frank harris 
signature last week puts it on the law books july 1 
the law allows juries or judges if a jury trial is waived to 
return a new verdict of guilty but mentally retarded and 
stipulates that individuals so convicted could be sentenced to life 
but cannot be executed 
georgia law previously allowed verdicts of not guilty by reason 
of insanity and guilty but mentally ill but had no separate 
provision for the mentally retarded 
before being allowed to enter a plea of guilty but mentally 
retarded an individual would be required to undergo a 
psychological examination and satisfy the judge that there was a 
factual basis for him to enter the plea 
atlanta lawyer clive staffordsmith said georgia may be the 
first state to take such a step in his research in defending 
indigent prisoners including one who is mentally retarded he 
found no other state with such a law he said 
staffordsmith also said the measure is probably the first 
validly antideath penalty law in the history of the state of 
georgia laughlin mcdonald southern regional director of the 
american civil liberties union described the measure as 
progressive legislation 
georgia attorney general michael bowers who opposed an earlier 
version of the legislation said he believes the final product is 
progressive and a step forward in explicitly recognizing we are not 
going to impose the death penalty on persons who are mentally 
retarded 
the new law was prompted in part by widespread criticism of the 
execution of jerome bowden 
bowden whose attorneys contended he should not be executed 
because of mental retardation was sentenced to death for a 1976 
murder 
when his appeals were exhausted and the execution date drew 
near the state board of pardons and paroles granted a oneweek 
stay to allow time for a new iq test 
despite the finding that bowdens iq was 65 100 is considered 
average the board concluded that bowden knew right from wrong and 
voted to allow the execution to be carried out he was executed 
june 24 1986 
more recently the georgia supreme court has ordered new murder 
trials for two other men whose attorneys contend they are mentally 
retarded 
in one case the supreme court said the trial judge should have 
held a hearing to determine whether the defendant was competent to 
stand trial in the other the supreme court said the trial judge 
erred in instructing the jury about provisions of the guilty but 
mentally ill statute 
in neither case however did the court rule specifically on the 
execution of mentally retarded people 
rep charles thomas chairman of the house judiciary committee 
said court decisions suggested the need for legislation 
in the opinion on the jerome bowden case the supreme court 
more or less said this is something the general assembly needs to 
look at and there have been several other cases where the 
defendants were borderline or clearly retarded but there was no 
provision in the law to deal with them other than as if they were 
competent adults thomas said 
fulton county district attorney lewis slaton said his concern 
during the debate over the law was not with banning the execution 
of mentally retarded people 
what weve always been concerned about is that we are 
leery of changing the law because it means that every person on 
death row can now raise another ground he said

the case against three cigarette companies 
accused of liability in the lungcancer death of rose cipollone 
began with a review of 60 years of research into the health effects 
of smoking 
it ended this week with some observers in the federal courtroom 
weeping as mrs cipollones husband antonio gave a tearful 
account of his wifes death 
in between the jury heard expert witnesses discuss cancer mrs 
cipollones 40year smoking addiction her medical condition and 
how cigarettes are advertised and marketed perhaps most damaging 
to the industry was the blitz of secret internal documents obtained 
over years of courtordered pretrial discovery by cipollones 
lawyers 
the documents and testimony by researchers provided the most 
sensational grist for tobacco opponents who seized on the 
information as a major aid in future lawsuits 
the evidence included memorandums that spoke of the hurdle 
of the smoking and health issue of the risk that selling a safer 
cigarette would bring more liability lawsuits and of the public 
relations war against health charges 
the trial began feb 1 except for testimony in early march by 
an addiction expert who described mrs cipollones smoking habits 
it was only toward the end of the plaintiffs case that mrs 
cipollone came to life for the jury 
in the past few weeks her daughter took the stand and 
depositions from mrs cipollones sisters were read to the jury 
jurors also heard mrs cipollones own words in a deposition made 
before her death at age 58 in 1984 
on wednesday cipollone testified 
he is seeking damages from the defendants lorillard inc 
philip morris co and liggett group inc charging that they 
failed to do enough research on cigarettes and health to tell the 
public what they did know and to put a safer product on the market 
the industry which has never lost such a case is focusing on 
the individual as the key to its defense which began thursday 
the companies argue that it was mrs cipollones choice to smoke 
as an intelligent independent and strongwilled woman who knew the 
risks of smoking at least as articulated by critics the industry 
does not acknowledge that cigarettes are a proven cause of cancer 
the companies began presenting their case with an economic 
historian who testified about the information mrs cipollone would 
have had available to her namely hundreds of articles on the 
risks of smoking that appeared in newspapers she read 
morris attorney peter bleakley said friday the defendants case 
should last three to four weeks 
this week they expect to call mrs cipollones brother to the 
stand to testify about what she knew and heard about smoking and 
health 
then come more excerpts of mrs cipollones testimony and 
experts on consumer behavior marketing cancer and addiction to 
counter evidence by the plaintiffs experts 
both sides agree on a fundamental decision the jury has to make 
did mrs cipollone believe smoking was legitimately dangerous 
and if she didnt was it the industrys fault 
its going to come down to how much personal responsibility 
you put on her and how much you put on the defendants said 
cipollone attorney cynthia a walters

michael dukakis on a brief foray into an 
economically depressed coal and steel area called saturday for 
enactment of a national law on plant closings and said i know 
what its like to work with communities like this one 
campaigning for the democratic presidential nomination the 
massachusetts governor appeared at a mine workers union parade in 
southwestern pennsylvania before flying to upstate new york 
the current delegate leader in the threecandidate race dukakis 
hopes victories in upcoming primaries in new york pennsylvania and 
ohio will effectively clinch his claim to the nomination 
dukakis and rivals jesse jackson and sen albert gore jr are 
concentrating on new york which holds its primary on april 19 
pennsylvania votes a week later and ohio the the week after that 
asked to differentiate himself from jackson dukakis replied 
im not just a talker im a doer i know what its like to work 
with communities like this one i know what it takes to bring them 
back 
dukakis was asked whether that meant as criticism of jackson 
whose ability as a speaker far outshines that of his rivals 
no its a statement of fact about the strengths i bring to 
this campaign he replied 
from pennsylvania dukakis flew to rochester ny and toured a 
hightech plant 
his final stop of the day was a community forum at a steel 
workers union hall in dunkirk ny outside of buffalo 
people who lined the main street of california to watch the 
parade and hear dukakis told of a community that has lost thousands 
of jobs in the past 10 years 
a nearby steel plant once employed 10000 and now has a skeletal 
force of 400 coal mines that employed thousands more have shut 
down or installed machinery that drastically cut the need for 
miners 
this is the most depressed area in the country said one 
retired miner its going down down down 
twentysixyearold boys as healthy as can be and they cant 
get jobs interjected another 
a woman said franklin d roosevelt was the last great president 
there was a complete turnaround she said we had 
confidence 
as for the current candidates i dont see an outstanding 
leader in none of them 
people who voiced support for dukakis said it was because they 
felt he would be prounion 
hes strictly for labor thats what theyre after labor 
said edward mathews a retired member of the united mine workers of 
america 
i know what youve been going through here in the mon 
monongahela valley said dukakis years and years of lost 
jobs 
he said the election was about people about jobs and the 
next president must be someone who knows how to build a strong 
economy and has done it 
he said massachusetts has one of the most comprehensive plant 
closing laws in the nation that not only required companies to 
give long advance notice of plans to shut down a plant but also to 
require them to provide extended health care benefits to displaced 
workers 
he said he would press for enactment of similar legislation on a 
national basis if elected president 
at a news conference after his speech dukakis said that japan 
requires companies to give three years notice before closing a 
plant 
i dont think the american people ought to tolerate whats 
been permitted to happen to people and families and communities 
like this one he said

the governing national party 
faced with dwindling support among rightwing whites has launched 
an aggressive political and military offensive aimed at its 
numerous foreign and domestic opponents 
in recent weeks president pw bothas government has 
effectively banned 18 opposition groups arrested prominent 
clergymen threatened and raided neighboring countries in pursuit 
of alleged terrorists and brazenly challenged the united nations 
to impose sanctions 
the hardline actions have provided fresh ammunition to 
antiapartheid activists abroad and suggest the government has 
chosen to ignore virtually all its critics except the conservative 
whites who contend botha is capitulating to the nations 26 million 
black majority 
under apartheid blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts 
schools and health services 
so far the nationalists toughguy posture has not worked 
white voters opted for the staunchly proapartheid conservative 
party in three special parliamentary elections in march and the 
conservatives appear headed for additional gains in nationwide 
municipal elections in october 
the nationalists now hold 133 seats in the 178member dominant 
white chamber of parliament conservatives hold 23 the 
antiapartheid progressive federal party holds 17 and other parties 
hold five 
the setbacks led two progovernment newspapers to question the 
political prospects of the national party and its vaguely defined 
reform proposals 
there can be no survival without reform said the citizen 
but without providing the whites with the security they crave 
the national party will have a tough time surviving 
numerous nationalists feel the road ahead should be more 
clearly spelled out said beeld an afrikaanslanguage daily 
we get the impression that the ordinary man now feels the np 
has risen so high above him that it has completely lost contact 
the national party says it seeks gradual race reform with 
blacks gaining a voice in national politics but with whites 
maintaining ultimate control the conservatives oppose all 
concessions to blacks and seek to rescind reforms implemented in 
recent years 
government opponents including blacks white liberals and 
foreign critics say the reforms are totally inadequate but their 
voices have been dismissed as irrelevant during the increasingly 
bitter debate between the nationalists and the conservatives 
ironically the governments crackdown began at a time when 
black unrest was at its lowest level in years the foreign 
sanctions campaign was on the wane and domestic opposition groups 
had been crippled by detentions and legal restrictions 
when the government released govan mbeki leader of the african 
national congress guerrilla group last november there was 
widespread speculation of additional releases and increased 
political reform 
mbekis release did not spawn any upsurge in demonstrations or 
violence but it did produce a backlash among conservative whites 
who felt botha was caving in to black militants 
since that time the government has sought to make clear that it 
will protect the privileged position of the white minority 
the latest crackdown began on feb 24 when the government 
banned 18 leading antiapartheid organizations from participating 
in politics and placed individual restrictions on more than a dozen 
activists 
the army raided a house in gaborone botswana on march 28 
killing four people they said were guerrillas of the african 
national congress 
six other congress officials have been killed in foreign 
countries this year the most recent was dulcie september the 
groups representative to france killed in paris on march 29 
south africa has denied responsibility in the deaths but 
repeatedly has said it will enter other countries in pursuit of anc 
members 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu the 1984 nobel peace prize 
winner and 24 other clerics were arrested march 29 during a 
peaceful demonstration near parliament in cape town botha has on 
several occasions warned the clergy to avoid political 
confrontation 
the government on march 21 shut down the new nation newspaper 
for 12 weeks saying it fanned revolution several more 
publications appear likely to be closed 
south africas ambassador to the united nations les manley 
recently told the security council to do your damndest and 
impose sanctions a subsequent sanctions measured died because of 
vetoes from britain and the united states 
political observers say the recent string of actions indicates 
the national party now perceives the conservatives as a genuine 
threat to the 40 years of unbroken rule of the nationalists 
the government regularly attacks the conservatives and their 
close ally the afrikaner resistance movement a paramilitary 
whitesupremacist organization that uses nazistyle symbols 
botha recently made public a letter he sent to movement leader 
eugene terreblanche who advocates creation of a whitesonly 
afrikaner state 
you are building emotions around nebulous dreams which have 
little relationships to the practical circumstances and demands of 
south africa botha wrote 
throughout the world there is enough undeserved hatred toward 
the afrikaner so we cannot afford in this country that afrikaners 
by their own actions are made the subject of hatred and 
ridicule botha added 
botha and his party having promoted gradual change for the past 
several years now face the prospect of losing their traditional 
afrikaner base if they continue to call for apartheid reforms 
it would be foolish for the nationalists to go back on 
reforms said willem kleynhans a prominent political scientist 
but if they introduce new reforms they will lose support they 
are in a tight spot

milos jakes leader of the 
communist party urged its 17 million members saturday to support 
reforms and win more popular support for the party 
earlier saturday the party elevated two officials to the ruling 
politburo and three others to senior party posts as it wrapped up 
its twoday central committee session ten people were named 
central committee members 
jakes who took over the party leadership last december said 
one aim of the personnel changes was to elevate younger comrades 
and thus create conditions for further successful fulfillment of 
party tasks 
in a closing speech jakes said he was sure communist leaders 
could get the party going to overcome shortcomings in 
czechoslovakias economy and social life the theme was echoed in 
an 11page resolution adopted by the central committee 
despite a relatively high membership 17 million people in a 
population of 155 million the communist party has had difficulty 
mobilizing popular support since a warsaw pact invasion crushed the 
partyled reforms of alexander dubcek in 1968 
in the 1970s czechoslovakia enjoyed a relatively high standard 
of living but the economy is now slowing down with growth around 2 
percent a year and the communists admitted last year reform is 
needed 
but the party has appeared divided over how much reform to allow 
and has moved slowly to enact change 
the central committees resolution limits the party leader to 
two fiveyear terms restricts regional officials to three 
consecutive terms and reduces the number of jobs one person can 
hold 
the resolution published by the state news agency ctk did not 
mention a vague proposal made by jakes in a speech friday to 
separate the functions of party and state organs leaving 
daytoday administration to the latter 
jakes said saturday that the central committee meeting paid 
great attention to how communists should maintain their traditional 
leading role in czechoslovak society 
the point is not to substitute for economic and state organs 
national committees social organizations but to influence their 
activity through communists working there jakes said 
the resolution accused communists of being too bureaucratic and 
said they failed to set an example for the rest of society 
it stopped short however of accepting party responsibility for 
the flagging economy and what it termed bitter social problems 
jakes said the party would draw efficient conclusions 
especially in higher party bodies about some members passivity 
toward restructuring as the reforms are known the term is also 
used for mikhail gorbachevs introduction of freemarket elements 
into the soviet economy 
ctk said the party leadership changes were agreed by secret 
ballot however several of them had been widely rumored in prague 
before the plenum 
jan fojtik 60 an expert in communist ideology and slovak 
communist ignac janak 57 were promoted to the ruling politburo 
and prague party boss antonin kapek was dropped 
kapek 65 had been on the politburo since 1970 and has headed 
the prague party since 1969 he was considered a hardliner in the 
late 1960s but lately has tried to overtake others in promoting 
economic reform he is said to have irked jakes by pushing too hard 
for economic changes 
miroslav zavadil 56 head of the staterun trade unions was 
named a candidate politburo member and jozef lenart 60 the slovak 
party leader comes to prague to take over jakes old job as head 
of a party commission on economic reform 
frantisek hanus 45 was elected a member of the secretariat of 
the central committee 
most of the 10 new members elected to the central committee are 
between 30 and 50 years of age 
in his speech jakes said there would also be government changes 
but gave no details 
according to informed sources a number of ministries are to be 
amalgamated and between 30000 and 50000 bureaucrats will lose 
their jobs in a plan to be announced later this month

whether former gov evan mecham is in or 
out of politics his 15month tenure as governor and sudden removal 
are likely to have strong reverberations in arizona politics for 
years lawmakers say 
some of the senators who voted at his impeachment trial to 
remove the firstterm republican from office last week hope mecham 
will fade from the political scene and take the recent 
roughandtumble out of arizona politics 
mecham himself isnt yet tipping his hand he says he wants to 
run for reelection in the may 17 recall vote that was aimed at 
removing him if the election is still held and if he is allowed to 
be on the ballot arizona courts are expected to decide those 
issues 
the former auto dealer also says he is writing a book and would 
like to hit the lecture circuit to take his conservative political 
message nationwide 
also facing him is a may 19 criminal trial postponed friday 
from april 21 on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
the senate convicted him monday of trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat and of misusing 80000 
from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership however senators failed to muster the twothirds vote 
to bar him from holding any future public office 
i believe that the political career of evan mecham is done 
with i do not believe he will ever hold elective office again and 
i do not believe that he will be a major factor in politics in this 
state again said sen greg lunn who voted to convict the 
governor on both counts 
but in the days after his ouster mecham packed them in at public 
appearances and he was introduced as the peoples governor at 
one meeting in a conservative gop stronghold in suburban mesa 
he said he plans to keep making public appearances but added it 
would be premature to consider running for any public office other 
than governor 
i think he ought to run for the state senate joked minority 
leader alan stephens who voted to convict the governor id like 
to have an office next to him 
state gop chairman burton kruglick suggested mecham might be 
better off for now if he were to concentrate on his family and 
finances since he is selling his mecham pontiac dealership to avert 
financial ruin 
sen pat wright a republican and staunch mecham backer said 
the former governor stimulated new interest in politics from 
conservative arizonans who now are attending gop district meetings 
in droves 
the democrats hope this new conservative interest will 
ultimately give their party some gop seats and possibly the senate 
majority in the fall elections at present republicans outnumber 
democrats 1911 
that hope is based on the idea that some gop lawmakers who 
opposed the governor face likely primary challenges in september by 
strong mecham backers if the incumbents lose some believe those 
seats could be vulnerable to democrats in the general election 
some major questions must be settled first the arizona supreme 
court is to hear arguments tuesday on a lawsuit aimed at canceling 
the may 17 recall election on grounds its target mecham already 
has been removed from office 
if the court rules the recall is to be held and if mecham 
decides he wants to run a court probably will be asked to 
determine if he is still entitled to be on the ballot 
but if mecham is convicted in criminal court he would lose his 
right to run for office for the duration of any prison term or 
probation 
at least some ballots were being printed without mechams name 
attorney general bob corbin said recently it was his opinion 
that since mecham has been removed from the governorship and since 
mecham didnt file a nominating petition as other candidates were 
required to do his name should not be on the ballot

five opec oil ministers agreed saturday 
to call two special meetings later this month to consider ways of 
halting the decline in oil prices according to the cartels 
nigerian president 
the ministers at the end of a full day of closeddoor meetings 
made no recommendations for immediate opec action to combat the 
slipping prices said nigerias rilwanu lukman who was chairman of 
the session 
he said he and the oil ministers of saudi arabia algeria 
venezuela and indonesia would invite at least seven nonopec oil 
producing nations to meet with them in vienna on april 23 to 
discuss ways of cooperating to stabilize oil prices 
lukman declined to identify the nonopec countries but industry 
sources said they would be mexico egypt oman angola brunei 
malaysia and colombia 
when asked lukman said he would not rule out inviting 
representatives also from the soviet union and norway the soviets 
are the worlds largest oil producers 
oil ministers of all 13 members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries will then meet in vienna on april 25 lukman 
said he suggested that the nonopec representatives might be asked 
to attend that session as official observers 
opec had not previously planned to hold any meetings until its 
regularly scheduled summer conference june 8 
lukman said the five ministers had decided that special meetings 
were needed to look into the situation generally in the market 
and to consider ways of cooperating with nonopec countries 
opec oil ministers held two meetings with representatives of 
mexico angola egypt malaysia oman and brunei in the spring of 
1986 but the cartel was unsuccessful in persuading those countries 
to reduce their production 
this time the situation is different according to lukman 
nonopec countries have on their own realized the need to 
cooperate among themselves and with opec lukman told reporters 
after the meeting 
opec often has declared in recent years that it alone cannot be 
expected to bear the burden of cutting production in order to 
stablize oil prices 
opec controls only about 35 percent of the total world oil 
supply down from more than 60 percent in the late 1970s 
lukman said the separate april 25 meeting of all 13 opec members 
was called because of the severity of the recent price decline 
the price is not what we expected it to be after having 
decided last december to maintain strict oil production limits he 
said 
oil prices in the open market are at least 3 below opecs 
official target level of 18 a barrel 
lukman said saturdays meeting had made no recommendation about 
whether opec should reduce its production either unilaterally or 
jointly with nonopec producers as a way of boosting prices 
he said increased production by nonopec producers this year was 
partly responsible for the oil price slump 
although iran was not invited to saturdays meeting its deputy 
oil minister kazempour ardebili flew to vienna and met separately 
with members of the group 
he said later in an interview in his hotel room that iran had 
proposed that opec cut its production by at least 5 percent 
immediately he said this should be done with or without parallel 
action by nonopec oilproducing countries 
ardebili accused some opec members which he did not name of 
sabotaging iranian initiatives to boost prices by cutting output 
his comments appeared to be directed at saudi arabia an opponent 
of further cuts in opecs share of the world oil market 
persian iran has been at war with arab iraq since september 
1980 and iran often accuses other arab countries of supporting 
iraq directly or indirectly in the conflict both iran and iraq 
count on revenues from oil exports to help finance their war 
efforts

colby college trustees voted saturday 
to keep the school open to all groups for recruiting including 
the cia ending a debate that put liberal professors at odds with 
more conservative students 
the trustees voting unanimously also approved guidelines that 
would allow the college to require employers seeking to recruit to 
discuss publicly on campus their policies and practices 
last november the faculty passed a motion by a 52 margin 
opposing campus recruitment by the cia as a result of its illegal 
incursions into nicaragua its role in illegal arms sales its 
illegal investigations into the lives of private citizens until 
it obeys the us constitution 
in response the student association passed a motion in favor of 
allowing cia recruitment some opponents of the ban argued that the 
real issue was student rights 
the private college has an enrollment of 1700 
board chairman h ridgely bullock and colby president william r 
cotter issued a statement saturday saying that the trustees had 
weighed the very real concerns of cia critics against colbys 
historic commitment to free speech and freedom of choice for its 
students 
we have concluded that free speech and freedom of choice must 
prevail they said characterizing the vote as one in favor of 
greater access and discussion not less 
the student associations president john mcninch a senior from 
lenox mass said he had opposed a recruiting ban and was pleased 
by the trustees vote but added that he also supported the proviso 
requiring an open dialogue with recruiters 
a panel representing students faculty members administrators 
and trustees is to be established to implement the guidelines at 
the school

american businessmen complained 
saturday that new us sanctions against the government controlled 
by gen manuel antonio noriega have thrown them into confusion 
dont ask me how the restrictions will affect us firms 
said one manager speaking on condition of anonymity at a large 
american company saturday im sure itll take our legal 
department back home some time to figure it out 
the new restraints announced friday by president reagan forbid 
payments to the noriega regime by us citizens and organizations 
either in the united states or panama the executive order also 
freezes all assets of the panamanian government in the united 
states 
cynthia farrell a spokeswoman for the us embassy said tax 
payments should be transferred to the federal reserve bank in new 
york into an account set up for deposed president eric arturo 
delvalle who was forced from office by noriega in february after 
trying to fire the general 
the united states still recognizes delvalle who has been in 
hiding as panamas legal president 
noriega panamas military chief has been indicted in the 
united states on federal drug trafficking charges 
with the united states and domestic opponents trying to oust 
noriega panama has been thrust into an economic and social crisis 
noriega forced banks to close march 4 and the government has been 
unable to pay its estimated 130000 employees and 15000 troops for 
more than a month 
a manager of a us franchise in panama suggested saturday the 
presidents executive order could give noriega an excuse to shut 
down us companies doing business in panama 
the us has very little to say in this situation as far as 
preventing us companies from deciding whether or not to pay taxes 
in panama if you dont pay your right to operate here can be 
taken away he said 
also looking for answers was alfredo arango spokesman for petro 
terminales sa which operates a pipeline carrying alaskan crude 
oil across panama for shipment to gulf and east coast markets in 
the united states 
arango said 60 percent of the companys stock is owned by two 
american companies northville industries corp and chicago bridge 
and iron international with the rest held by the panamanian 
government 
he said the pipeline is the biggest single customer of the 
staterun electric company paying it 84 million a year 
the us commerce department estimated american investment in 
panama at more than 43 billion at the end of 1986 the last year 
for which figures are available it said most was concentrated in 
petroleum refining agriculture fishing and food processing 
the us chamber of commerce in panama city lists 190 members 
including representatives of such giant american firms as 
cocacola johnson amp johnson borden general mills ibm kodak 
colgate palmolive and texaco many members are smallbusiness men 
who own franchises licensed by firms such as mcdonalds burger king 
and kentucky fried chicken 
most us and other foreign firms doing business in panama are 
lightly taxed one reason that many have made the country their 
branch headquarters for central and latin american operations 
still when american firms paid their quarterly social security 
and business license taxes to the government at the end of march 
the us embassy estimated the total at about 56 million that 
did not include taxes paid on light gas telephone and other 
utility bills 
cynthia farrell a spokeswoman for the us embassy said 
saturday the treasury department in washington probably would 
exempt from the sanctions relatively small tax payments for such 
things as utilities and airport landing fees 
the new sanctions fall under a 1977 law designed to protect 
national security the seldomused emergency act was last invoked 
to try to oust libyan leader moammar khaddafy and the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini of iran both remain in power

the government will issue detailed guidelines 
outlining the technical requirements for testing federal workers 
for illegal drug use an official said saturday 
the guidelines to be published monday in the federal register 
set forth conditions under which urine specimens would be taken 
and the standards labs would have to meet said campbell 
gardett a spokesman for the department of health and human 
services 
the rules do not cover which employees will be tested or under 
what circumstances gardett said confirming a report in the 
washington post such matters will be delineated in plans by 
individual departments and agencies he said 
currently only the defense department and the transportation 
department test employees in sensitive positions 
public employee unions have been resisting the tests contending 
they violate workers constitutional rights and have filed suit to 
block them 
the publication of the technical requirements for testing is the 
first of three steps necessary before widespread testing of 
civilian government workers begins 
the second step an hhs review of testing plans from departments 
and agencies should be completed within several months he said 
the third step which he said should follow soon after that is 
a report to congress from the office of management and budget 
estimating the cost of the program which the post said is 
preliminarily estimated at about 7 million 
the technical guidelines were proposed nearly 14 months ago in 
response to a september 1986 executive order issued as part of 
president reagans campaign for a drugfree workplace 
they are to guard against cheating by requiring that toilet 
water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of the urine sample and that 
the temperature of the samples be taken to prevent substitution by 
another sample smuggled into the toilet stall 
according to the newspaper the guidelines require testing for 
cocaine and marijuana and permit testing for pcp opiates and 
amphetamines

new york gov mario cuomo moved saturday to close the door on a 
draft for the democratic presidential nomination while in his home 
state michael dukakis and jesse jackson campaigned for next weeks 
primary in hopes of breaking the logjam in the race to the 
convention 
cuomo said he did not want any confusing signals to be sent to 
anyone but may have done just that moments after he said he 
ruled out accepting a draft an aide denied that that was what 
the governor meant 
cuomos presence has loomed over the campaign for the april 19 
presidential primary in new york where the 255 delegates at stake 
could have a crucial impact on the overall race for the democratic 
nomination dukakis and jackson currently are separated by a 
relative handful of delegates 
cuomo said last year that he did not want to run for president 
in 1988 but he has been mentioned time and again as a possible 
draft candidate if the party becomes deadlocked over a nominee 
cuomo told a news conference saturday in albany ny that a 
draft is counterproductive and unwise but when pressed by 
reporters to say whether he would refuse one cuomo as he has 
done in the past complained about the insistence for magic 
language 
he later telephoned the associated press to clarify his remarks 
at the news conference and again was asked specifically whether he 
would rule out accepting a draft 
cuomo replied ive ruled it out and went on to point out 
that he had done so in a letter to democratic party chairman paul 
kirk 
moments after the story on cuomos statement was transmitted 
his press secretary gary fryer denied that the governor had 
intended to say he would refuse a draft but meant instead that a 
draft should not take place 
dukakis meanwhile made a brief side trip from new york to 
pennsylvania where he told people at a union parade that he would 
press for a national law setting strict requirements for companies 
wanting to close their plants 
i know what youve been going through here in the mon 
monongahela valley dukakis said in california pa which has 
seen thousands of jobs lost in the last 10 years as nearby steel 
mills and coal mines have closed down or laid off employees 
im not just a talker im a doer i know what its like to 
work with communities like this one dukakis said i know what 
it takes to bring them back 
asked if that was meant as criticism of jackson dukakis said 
no its a statement of fact about the strengths i bring to this 
campaign 
jackson campaigned saturday in brooklyn where he drew large 
crowds and at one point was greeted by steel drum music of a 
calypso band as he arrived to speak at an episcopalian church 
jackson when asked about criticism leveled against him by new 
york mayor ed koch over his postitions on the middle east said 
in my campaign i want to keep working on healing people 
were already in a very tender situation and responsible leadership 
must move to heal people and not to extend their fears 
tennessee sen albert gore jr stayed in washington saturday and 
planned to resume campaigning in new york on sunday 
while the democrats struggled for their nomination vice 
president george bush cruised across the south saturday on air 
force two attending republican fundraisers in texas and florida 
while his campaign approached the legal limit for raising money 
and was not starved for cash bush longed for some of the attention 
that has gone elsewhere since he secured a virtual lock on the gop 
nomination 
ive got to look more frantic the vice president joked 
you pick up the papers and its all the three democratic 
campaigns there and were finished

women with tickets got in photographers 
were kept out and the previously maleonly 40 amp 8 lasocietes 
annual oyster dinner and political gettogether went off without a 
hitch 
the group an offshoot of the american legion had earlier said 
it would continue to bar women from its 25th annual fundraising 
dinner at mount view high school on friday night 
but after republican congressional candidate marianne brewster 
kicked up a fuss the group backed down and said any woman with a 
previously purchased ticket would be admitted no tickets were sold 
at the door 
the group also barred news photographers from the dinner but 
allowed one television crew inside 
brewster was one of a handful of women who showed up at the 
event which drew about 1200 people state democratic chairwoman 
sally richardson was the guest of state sen h truman chafin who 
was indicted thursday on a felony bribery charge 
chafin said he wouldnt let an indictment keep him from an 
important political rally while richardson said she had made the 
appointment to attend the dinner with chafin some time ago 
society members were unhappy about the womens presence and the 
press coverage that preceded the event 
its no good said larry johnson of kimball men like to 
be together by themselves once in a while 
the oyster dinner is a traditional campaign stop for state and 
local politicians as well as a way of raising money for youth 
sports programs 
society member jr miller said the group planned to meet sunday 
to decide whether the event will be terminated because of this 
years controversy when announcing its decision to let women in 
this year the group indicated this would be the final year for the 
event

in miami bush told reporters that any trip he took out of the 
country would have to be substantive not cosmetic 
bush attended a 250aplate fundraising barbecue and had a 
similar event planned for later in the day in miami 
the vice president is campaigning at a leisurely pace with a 
series of fund raisers arranged before his campaign last week 
reached the 27 million federal limit for preconvention 
contributions 
bush staff aides said money raised on the current twoday swing 
through texas and florida and from events scheduled for next week 
in new york and connecticut will be used toward a 28 million 
compliance fund 
the fund which is exempt from the federal limit will be used 
for expenses incurred in complying with federal election commission 
rules 
once those funds are raised however the wellheeled campaign 
will accept no further contributions itself but will turn its 
attention to helping the republican national committee raise some 
8 million for the general election according to campaign 
treasurer fred bush 
bush said he intends to continue campaigning particularly in 
populous states with primaries to comethere is no way that 
anybody is going to get elected in this country if you dont pay 
proper attention to the big states bush told reporters 
i will flesh out and extend the themes that we have talked 
about all during the primary he said 
i dont think i have to have a sixpoint program on every 
subject but i think the voters will want to know what im going 
to do on some of these important areas 
the general election contest is going to be close and it is 
going to be a tough race he said 
it always is after an eightyear cycle he said later in an 
interview with local reporters 
bush said democrats jesse jackson and michael dukakis believe 
the same things on how to solve the problems of this country and 
theyre both wrong 
both of them come out of the more liberal tradition he said 
aides said bush would probably campaign for two or three days 
each week between now and the summer conventions campaign 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity also said that 
an outofcountry official visit for the vice president was likely 
in june either to europe or the far east in an effort to raise 
his visibility 
late friday bush and his wife barbara made a surprise 
appearance in fort worth at a lampoon dinner sponsored by texas 
journalists 
there must be some mistake bush told the annual texas 
gridiron dinner i thought this was the wimp convention 
his selfmocking joke brought howls from the audience

police patrolled tegucigalpas 
streets saturday under the state of emergency imposed to quell two 
days of antiamerican riots that left five people dead and the us 
consulate burned 
the state of emergency decreed friday by the government of 
president jose azcona which gave authorities sweeping powers to 
crack down on the demonstrations brought a forced calm to the 
country 
troops also patrolled the capital in light tanks and trucks 
military units guarded bridges government ministries and key 
intersections 
radio and television stations were forced to suspend regular 
programming under the emergency order as authorities maintained 
control of broadcast outlets for the second straight day 
at intervals an announcer read communiques from the governments 
information secretariat 
the government blamed thursday nights attacks on the us 
embassy compound on what it called a small group of marxist 
radicals the mob estimated at nearly 2000 people burned and 
sacked the us consulate and offices of the us information 
service but did not penetrate the embassy portion of the complex 
five people all hondurans were reported killed thursday night 
the violence began with a studentled demonstration to protest the 
arrest tuesday of accused drug trafficker juan ramon matta and his 
extradition to the united states 
on tuesday honduran officials took matta from his tegucigalpa 
home in a predawn raid and placed him on a plane to the dominican 
republic 
dominican republic officials put matta on a new yorkbound 
flight and he was arrested aboard the jetliner by us marshals 
matta held at the maximumsecurity federal prison in marion 
ill was wanted by us officials for questioning in the 1985 
slaying in mexico of a us drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena salazar 
some honduran legislators called the handling of matta a 
kidnapping and the foreign ministry ordered an investigation of 
the procedures used 
the honduran constitution prohibits the extradition of citizens 
but honduran authorities working in concert with us officials 
seized matta 
the two days of rioting was the worst antiamerican 
demonstration in latin america this year although the protests 
were carried out largely by leftists who are regular critics of 
us policies the extradition of matta was seen by many as a 
flagrant violation of honduran law 
other antiamerican sentiment apparently was fueled by the 
presence in honduras last month of 3200 us military personnel 
dispatched after nicaraguan government forces reported encroached 
on honduran land to pursue nicraguan rebels known as contras the 
3200 us troops returned to america within two weeks 
many hondurans oppose the presence of the bases of the 
usbacked contras in honduras 
the disturbances that began thursday continued friday with 
police using tear gas to break up concentrations of protestors 
lawmakers newspaper columnists and academics denounced mattas 
arrest government statements spoke in general terms of drug 
traffickers and marxists 
one said the states intelligence has detected a vast plan 
that terrorist elements serving foreign ideas in conjunction with 
international drug traffickers intended to carry out to sow chaos 
and disorder 
another said we call on all sectors campesinos private 
enterprise students and professionals so that the people 
government and armed forces can together slam the door on the 
penetration of marxismleninism in our country 
international drug dealers have reached the extreme of 
threatening to assassinate high officials of the republic and of 
the armed forces a third statement said 
the government also said elements of the farabundo marti 
national liberation front were involved in the violence the 
leftist guerrilla group is waging a civil war in neighboring el 
salvador 
a spokesman for the us embassy denied any guards at the 
mission fired on the rioters thursday night the spokesman who 
commented on condition of anonymity also said no us agents took 
part in mattas arrest 
police sources in tegucigalpa who spoke with the condition they 
not be identified said two members of the us drug enforcement 
adeministration were present when matta was seized 
the embassy spokesman said honduran security forces delayed for 
more than two hours before going to the embassy compound to help 
disperse the rioters 
there were honduran police in the area sitting on their 
thumbs we have asked for an explanation at the highest level he 
said this is a matter of intense and urgent discussion

one of japans wealthiest men has added to his 
extensive hawaii real estate holdings by paying a record 38 
million to acquire the remaining 55 acres of the kaiser estate 
his attorney said 
billionaire genshiro kawamoto paid 45 million earlier this 
year to purchase the estates picnic house property and picked 
up an option to buy the rest of the estate built by industrialist 
henry kaiser 
when another interested buyer offered 38 million kawamoto 
exercised his option according to his attorney robert j lombardi 
real estate agent scully rogers broker for the sale and 
appraiser robert hastings said the purchase price was the highest 
ever paid for a residential property in hawaii 
the previous record of 21 million was set in march also by a 
japanese buyer 
hawaii has drawn more japanese property investment than any 
other state including an estimated 3 billion since 1986 and the 
increasing japanese appetite has sparked controversy recently 
honolulu mayor frank fasi last month proposed state legislation 
to prohibit the sale of residential agricultural or preservation 
property to anyone who is not a us citizen has no plans to 
become a citizen or would not live on the land at least half the 
year the proposal has little chance of being considered by the 
legislature because it was submitted late in the session 
kawamoto has spent an additional 369 million to buy 130 acres 
of land and 142 homes and condominiums on oahu the island where 
honolulu is located 
kawamoto said friday he planned to use the estate sold by a 
trust for the goldman family as a vacation home while in hawaii on 
monthly trips from japan 
the picnic house purchase included nearly two acres of land and 
a boat harbor the latest purchase includes two houses and an 
olympicsize swimming pool 
to go through them is like a james bond movie rogers said 
you lose track of the amenities because you are so in awe of 
them

real estate tycoon donald trump was 
saved 86000 when a court ruled that his taxes on a 118room 
mansion should be based on its purchase price not on the countys 
calculation of its value 
trump bought maralago in 1985 for 7 million it was the first 
time the estate built in 1926 had been sold 
however palm beach county property appraisers had valued the 
property at 115 million and trumps taxes were figured on that 
basis 
circuit judge richard burk ruled in trumps favor on friday 
it is significant to note that this is the only purchase ever 
of this property burk said surely in this case one sale does 
in fact make a market 
trumps attorney robb maass said the decision was a very 
proper way of looking at the market value 
but attorney gaylord wood who represented palm beach county 
property appraiser rebecca walker promised to appeal 
donald trump has demonstrated once again that there is no one 
better in this country at buying things for less than what they are 
worth wood said 
trump challenged the assessment in a 1987 lawsuit after the 
county said he owed 208000 in taxes on maralago trump 
contended that the bill should be only 122000 including a 4 
percent discount for early payment 
during two days of testimony last month two real estate 
appraisers explained the methods they used to place a value on 
maralago even though both appraisers used a system that 
considers the value of comparable properties their assessments 
were 34 million apart 
in his ruling however burk wrote that trumps 7 million 
purchase price established maralagos market value because the 
estate has no equal

stephen cohen of princeton university was 
taken aback when during the summit in washington last december 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said hed read cohens biography 
of nikolai bukharin a bolshevik theoretician who for 50 years was 
a nonperson 
a month later cohen stood before a packed lecture hall in 
moscow and led what he says must have been the first public 
discussion in the soviet union of bukharin since he was executed 
in march 1938 
american historians of russia for years denounced by the 
kremlin as bourgeois falsifiers are now finding eager ears in 
moscow as soviet scholars heed gorbachevs call to fill in the 
blank pages in soviet history books 
cohen has been at the forefront because his writings have been 
among the most thorough examinations of the theory that joseph 
stalins bloody collectivization of agriculture forced 
industrialization and purge of the party were needless 
despite gorbachevs reforms however the stalinist form of 
government remains largely intact and until gorbachev came to 
power official histories praised stalin 
even now the rewriting of history is directed by central 
communist party authorities 
another american historian robert v daniels of the university 
of vermont says he is going to moscow this fall to discuss with 
soviet historians their efforts fill in the blanks 
i make no bones about my independent position said daniels 
who has been much more critical than cohen of many aspects of 
soviet history i have been frequently denounced in the soviet 
press as a bourgeois falsifier and all that sort of thing 
but soviet scholars have told daniels you wont have to take 
that any more they are interested in hearing what you have to 
say he said russian scholars have encouraged him to submit 
articles to soviet journals 
a soviet historian yuri mukhachev denied speculation that the 
soviets might go so far as to publish cohens biography of 
bukharin bukharin and the bolshevik revolution a political 
biography 18881938 and a book by daniels conscience of the 
revolution 
but as to scholarly debates with our colleagues in the west 
concerning soviet history we are willing to engage them 
mukhachev said in answer to questions posed by the associated press 
through the semiofficial soviet news agency novosti 
mukhachev took part in a conference with foreign scholars last 
may on the 1917 bolshevik revolution and we saw that we had more 
points in common than differences on a lot of topics 
many important episodes of soviet history remain outside the 
bounds of official scholarship despite the rehabilitation of 
bukharin among them are 
the central role of leon trotsky murdered in mexico on 
stalins orders in directing the bolshevik revolution and creating 
the red army 
the bolshevik decision in 1917 to dissolve the constituent 
assembly whose antibolshevik majority was considered likely to 
form a more democratic form of government 
the suppression of religion including widespread executions 
the forced relocation of large ethnic populations under stalin 
involving hundreds of thousands of deaths 
the deaths of thousands of polish officers at the beginning of 
world war ii western and many unofficial polish historians blame 
the executions on the russians but the soviets blame the nazis 
few observers expect an objective assessment from a joint 
sovietpolish commission appointed to study the issue 
the precise number of people who died in the forced 
collectivization of agriculture in 192932 estimated by western 
historians to be as high as 10 million recent soviet articles have 
said that millions were repressed but have not delved into the 
actual number killed 
bukharin was the leading opponent of the collectivization and 
the forced industrialization that accompanied it and many western 
sovietologists view his rehabilitation as an important step in 
rewriting soviet history 
to americans history may seem the province of tweedy 
professors but the effort to rework the soviet history books is 
central to gorbachevs drive for economic reform known as 
perestroika 
history is one of the principal questions today said the 
us ambassador to moscow jack matlock the degree to which they 
can go over the history pages and fill in the blanks is a gauge of 
how successful the restructuring can be matlock said in a recent 
lecture in washington 
perestroika needs an intellectual basis they needed to 
rehabilitate bukharin and they need to deal with stalin said 
matlock one of the leading us government experts on the soviet 
union 
gorbachev has been nudging bukharin back into vogue last 
november he became the first soviet leader in 50 years to publicly 
utter bukharins name which had been systematically excised from 
soviet books and newspapers 
several days after cohen spoke in moscow the authoritative 
soviet journal kommunist published a longforbidden article by 
bukharin and in february the communist party rehabilitated 
bukharin who was accused of treason and executed on stalins 
orders at the height of the purges 
the next likely steps are the rehabilitation of bukharins ideas 
and the publishing of new histories and text books reflecting the 
change in official thinking

presidential candidate jesse jackson 
saying that people are coming alive to his presidential 
candidacy campaigned saturday before racially diverse overflow 
crowds of new yorkers 
he avoided direct bickering with mayor ed koch over jewish 
concerns but he did take a sideswipe at koch when asked if the 
mayors negative comments were hurting him in new york 
jackson said his campaign is focused on healing and without 
mentioning kochs name suggested the mayor is heightening 
blackjewish tension in light of various recent incidents of 
racial violence he said we are already in a very tender 
situation and responsible leadership must move to heal people and 
not extend their fears 
jackson told each of his enthusiastic audiences from crown 
heights to coney island i love you very much 
as new yorks april 19 primary looms jackson also said that in 
fairness he should be the overall leader not only in the popular 
vote to date but in presidential delegates 
he said he earned the atlarge delegates from the illinois 
primary last month but is being kept from receiving them by sen 
paul simon of illinois who is no longer an active candidate but is 
clinging to his delegates 
jackson suggested simon should withdraw formally and said im 
simply appealing for consistency and fairness 
jackson devoted the day of rallies and speeches in brooklyn to 
discussing his economic justice message and emphasizing his 
positions on the caribbean haiti panama and south africa 
crowds that could not fit into the churches and halls where he 
spoke lined the streets and stood on fire escapes 
security around jackson was intense as he waded into the throngs 
of people who mobbed him shaking hands and holding babies 
jackson called his campaign hope reborn and said people 
are coming alive 
in trendy park slope jackson addressed a racially mixed outdoor 
rally of a few thousand 
in crown heights he was greeted by a steel drum calypso band 
and he delighted the sidewalk crowd by taking up a tambourine and 
bouncing to the beat 
in coney island several hundred screaming supporters lined the 
block outside the church where he was to speak chanting go 
jesse 
but he was dogged by questions about kochs criticisms most 
recently in saturdays new york times where koch was quoted as 
saying jackson is evading talking about issues of concern to jews 
as the candidate emerged from speaking to a wildly enthusiastic 
black audience in st marks episcopal church about two dozen 
darksuited orthodox jewish men stood somberly at the edge of about 
200 supporters waiting outside 
they listened quietly while the rest of the onlookers cheered 
jackson wildly as he talked about brotherhood 
the group said they came out of curiosity one who declined to 
give his name because he said he should not give interviews on the 
sabbath said he planned to vote for massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis and that if jackson wins the democratic nomination ill 
vote republican 
another said he was supporting sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee but of jackson he said i think hes great i just 
wish he knew more about the middle east 
in an impromptu address to the crowd jackson shouted without a 
microphone about new yorks multicultural multiethnic character 
we seek to draw people together across lines of race and sex 
and religion he said to rapt cheers from the largely black crowd 
we know what makes us different our race our sex our 
religion our culture but what binds us together 
in answer he listed central issues of his candidacy economic 
justice fighting drugs improving child care and education 
later jackson told reporters seeking his reaction to kochs 
remarks we are dealing with a highly politicized situation and 
you expect some of that but well keep our eyes on our real 
agenda 
he refused to be drawn into a titfortat with koch 
our campaign is an outreach campaign he said were going 
to keep it at that level 
however he denied evading any issues noting that he has spoken 
often about the middle east he supports a palestinian homeland and 
repeated saturday his call for recognition of israel by the arab 
states 
on foreign policy jackson said the united states should demand 
free and fair elections and human rights in haiti 
he called for us humanitarian aid to the panamanian people who 
are suffering under us sanctions aimed at ousting panamanian 
strong man general manuel noriega 
he said he supports the sanctions but also said there should be 
a congressional investigation of the cia s past role with noriega

gov mario cuomo said saturday ive ruled 
out a draft for the democratic presidential nomination but he 
declined to endorse a candidate until after the primaries end june 
7 
at a news conference saturday and in two later conversations 
with the associated press cuomo said he did not want the 
democratic party to draft him or anybody else as its presidential 
nominee 
but in the second conversation with the ap he refused to say 
pointblank that he would turn down the nomination if he were 
drafted at the democratic national convention in atlanta july 1821 
cuomo was attempting to douse a draft movement begun during the 
week by a former democratic congressman but the confusion arose 
when he declined to close the door on circumstances that might 
arise at the convention 
ive ruled out a draft cuomo said 
cuomos statements about a draft and endorsements came as he 
released a letter to former new york rep richard ottinger a 
leader of a draftcuomo move in new york asking him not to go 
forward with your intention to encourage a draft 
in his letter cuomo also said he would not endorse any of the 
democratic candidates before the end of the primaries june 7 the 
governor explained that he wanted to be uncommitted at that point 
so he could help the frontrunner collect enough uncommitted votes 
to put him over the top for the nomination 
asked to clarify his statements on a draft cuomo told the ap 
we can go around forever i could have ended it a long time 
ago by saying general sherman said and so i will say but im not 
going to do that because that means that you accept the principle 
that you have to use whatever language the press says you must use 
to meet their requirements and theyll keep inventing new 
language 
it was civil war gen william tecumseh sherman who rejected an 
appeal to draft him as the republican nominee in 1884 with the 
political disclaimer i will not accept if nominated and will not 
serve if elected 
im not going to use your language said cuomo i said 
how could i rule it out as counterproductive and unwise and still 
accept it i have ruled it out 
cuomo announced more than a year ago that he would not seek his 
partys presidential nomination and has taken steps to keep his 
name off state primary ballots 
and despite his repeated insistence that he did not want to be a 
candidate questions have persisted over whether he would accept the 
nomination if it were offered to him anyway 
cuomo started out saturday with a news conference in which he 
indicated that he would reject a draft but when pressed to clarify 
his position he complained to reporters about your insistence 
for magic language 
after the news conference he telephoned the ap to say he was 
making his statement because obviously this is in the midst of 
the new york primary campaign and i dont want any confusing 
signals to be sent to anyone 
but the confusion continued 
after a story was transmitted saying that cuomo ruled out 
accepting a draft his press secretary gary fryer called to draw 
the line at the word accept 
i asked him that specifically and he said i never told him 
that im not going to tell him that fryer said

decades after residents of 
this remote coral atoll left to make way for us atomic bomb 
tests work has begun to clean up lingering radiation and bring the 
nuclear nomads of bikini home to stay 
some 50 bikini leaders and a delegation of us officials 
gathered on the windswept island of eneu last week to mark the 
start of the cleanup and resettlement project 
eneu is now the only inhabited island of the approximately two 
dozen islands that comprise the bikini atoll it is on the 
southeast tip of the island ring about five miles south of the 
island of bikini 
officials say it could take seven years of work before the 
bikinians can safely repopulate bikini island and estimates of the 
cleanup cost range from 130 million to 200 million 
tomaki juda mayor of the marshall islands kili island where 
many bikinians now live said thursdays groundbreaking isnt a 
day of great happiness 
a day of great happiness for the bikinian people will be 
coming back to an island that is free of radiation and which we can 
stay on without being afraid juda said through an interpreter 
the ceremony this afternoon marks the beginning of a great 
effort but we cannot celebrate until the radioactivity has been 
removed from the coral soil of our home island said henchi 
balos a senator representing the bikinians and acting president of 
the marshall islands 
juda and balos were among 146 people who left bikini in 1946 
when us officials told them the western pacific atoll was needed 
for testing the atom bomb the americans promised to return the 
islanders to bikini when tests were completed 
between 1946 and 1958 the united states detonated 23 nuclear 
bombs at bikini an atoll of islands surrounding a lagoon 24 miles 
long and 11 miles wide 
the american promise was something the bikinians wanted the 
delegation including rep barbara vucanovich rnev and 
congressional staff members to remember 
there are only a few elders left who know our traditional 
customs and it will not be long until they are gone also juda 
said we hope it will not be long before we can restore our 
traditions 
vucanovich a member of the house subcommittee on energy and 
environment told the bikinians the time had come for the united 
states to fulfill its promise to return them home 
these small islands have paid a great price for the freedom we 
have all enjoyed she said now its up to us using our 
scientific advances to ensure that bikini will once again give 
abundant life to those who live here 
a small group of bikinians returned in the early 1970s when 
radiation levels were thought safe but tests in 1978 found they 
were ingesting dangerous amounts of radioactive materials drawn up 
from the soil by food plants and they were evacuated 
today the question is is this a true dream juda said 
are we going to be able to come back here 
since their exodus the bikinians have moved several times 
through the marshalls hence the nickname nuclear nomads the 
largest group settled at kili an island 500 miles south of bikini 
congress appropriated 23 million for the cleanup and 
resettlement project this year most was earmarked for design and 
engineering for bikini island but some will be used to begin 
development of a base camp on eneu which has an airstrip 
the problem on bikini island is the radioactive cesium137 in 
its soil the radioactive isotope has a half life of about 30 
years meaning it takes that time for half of it to decay in an 
additional 30 years half of the remainder will decay 
the danger from direct exposure is minute scientists say but 
without controlling or removing the cesium137 they say bikinis 
soil might not produce plants safe for human consumption until 
sometime in the 21st century 
with treatment researchers say the bikinians could begin 
returning to their home island within seven years 
larry l morgan of the interior departments office of 
territorial and international affairs said his department which 
oversees the project is awaiting a report on cleanup alternatives 
before requesting funding the report is due july 31 
scientists are considering three alternatives removing the 
topsoil in which the radioactive cesium is concentrated treating 
the soil with potassium to prevent plants from absorbing the 
cesium and flushing the soil with seawater

a judge has cleared the way for a state 
agency to pay for a liver transplant for a 5yearold mexican boy 
with chronic liver disease who previously was denied aid because 
he was not a us resident 
superior court judge robert olsen rejected a california 
childrens services request friday that would have made armando 
vargas ineligible for state funds for the operation which costs 
approximately 150000 the judge found that the boy is eligible 
because his guardian is a california resident 
sharon yackey the deputy los angeles county counsel 
representing childrens services a branch of the state department 
of health services said the agency would not appeal the ruling 
she also said the agency had approved funding for the operation 
and contacted officials at the university of california los 
angeles medical center requesting that the boy be placed on the 
hospitals donor list for a new liver 
armando and his family came to california seven weeks ago from 
their home in central mexico in hopes of getting the statefunded 
surgery they had previously been turned down in texas 
the boy who doctors say can live only a matter of months 
without a transplant was not eligible for aid because he is not a 
legal us resident 
but after news reports of his case a group called the right to 
life committee established a guardianship for him so he could 
qualify 
on friday olsen denied the california childrens services 
request to vacate the guardianship 
the judge ruled that the boy was not a legal resident but he 
also determined that as a ward of a legal guardian who is a 
resident the youth qualifies for the funds 
its an exciting victory said susan carpentermcmillan a 
spokeswoman for the right to life committee

tennessee walking horse breeders are 
seeking a stay of a recent court ruling restricting the use of 
devices that give the horses their distinctive highstepping 
stride their attorney said 
the us department of agriculture recently banned the stacked 
shoes and limited the weight of leg chains used in showing the 
horses 
the departments ban followed a ruling last month by us 
district judge oliver gasch who ordered the new regulations after 
reviewing a suit filed by the american horse protection association 
against the department the association charged that the devices 
caused soreness and swelling in the animals legs 
proponents argued they are being penalized for abuses corrected 
long ago when chemical irritants were used on horses hooves they

sen albert gore jrs campaign has all but 
given up on winning the new york primary on april 19 but wants a 
strong enough showing to rekindle doubts about michael dukakis 
thus allowing for a late charge at the democratic presidential 
nomination 
weve got to prove we can get a lot of northern votes said 
one aide speaking anonymnously and if we do that i think the 
race gets shaken up once again 
but gore has been trying to find a northern state where he could 
run strongly since he vaulted near the front of the pack with 
several border state victories on super tuesday a month ago 
since then his campaign has encountered a string of defeats in 
illinois michigan connecticut wisconsin and elsewhere while 
piling up a debt of 15 million even though he spent as much or 
more on television advertising in some states as dukakis his best 
showing of the past four weeks was 17 percent of the vote in 
wisconsin a week ago 
he has gained only 49 delegates since super tuesday in the 
associated press delegate count and now trails rivals dukakis and 
jesse jackson by more than 300 delegates 
thus one aide conceded and if he fails in new york it will be 
very very difficult to go on in a meaningful way 
nevertheless gore campaign manager fred martin insisted on 
saturday that strategy in new york is to win not just do well 
its certainly true that were underdogs martin said 
its certainly true that were behind in the polls but we are 
trying to win this state 
anyone who says differently doesnt know what hes talking 
about martin said by telephone from new york 
at least one democrat says failure in new york could do more 
than spell the end of gores 1988 democratic candidacy 
particularly given the senators decision to criticize black rival 
jackson 
hed better be careful that hes not burning bridges new york 
may pose a much more serious longterm risk to gore than he may 
imagine said robert g beckel who is not advising any of this 
years democratic presidential contenders after managing walter f 
mondales bid in 1984 
beckel said that by attacking jackson gore risks the animosity 
of black voters not only in a national campaign but in his home 
state of tennessee its a very risky strategy and i frankly see 
a lot more downside than i see upside for him 
an occasional adviser said that the impact on a future campaign 
is on gores mind as he makes the rounds in 1988 al believes 
hes old enough to be president but too young to be vice president 
he hopes to leave a good impression and maybe hell try again some 
day said this source speaking on condition of anonymity 
at the dukakis campaign aides believe that gore cannot win the 
nomination but they fear that he could seriously damage their own 
mans chances if he split the white vote and enabled jackson to eke 
out a victory 
thus they seek to belittle gore whenever they can with dukakis 
pointing out that the senator has failed to carry a dingle 
congressional district since super tuesday 
we see it as a twoman race with jackson says susan 
estrich dukakis campaign manager hes had one good day in this 
campaign as far as i can tell she said referring to gores 
sixstate victorties on super tuesday 
gore himself has not publicly discussed the longterm 
implications of next weeks primary with 255 delegates at stake 
new york has always been friendly to underdogs and i am the 
underdog he said last week 
to achieve his new york goal gore is making a strong appeal to 
win new yorks sizeable jewish vote supporting israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs opposition to the reagan administrations 
peace proposal and despite a 15 million campaign debt has 
embarked on a costly advertising campaign that also stresses his 
record on environmental civil rights and consumer issues in a bid 
to woo voters who want a moderate alternative to dukakis and 
jackson 
in personal campaigning gore has attacked both jackson and 
dukakis for lacking sufficient foreign policy experience he 
accused aides to the massachusetts governor last week of saying 
that a vote for gore was a vote for jackson a charge that dukakis 
denied he also has accused dukakis of being absurdly timid in 
his treatment of jackson 
coming at a time when many party officials are anxious to avoid 
a prolonged battle for the nomination gores criticisms have 
earned him rebukes from new york gov mario cuomo and democratic 
party chairman paul kirk it does not work and its terribly 
dangerous cuomo told one interviewer 
gore shook off the criticism and made it clear he intends to 
continue portraying his rivals as short on foreign policy 
experience spokesman arlie schardt said the senator is going to 
continue campaigning just as vigorously pointing out the difference 
with dukakis and jackson 
schardt said the gore campaign didnt view his comments as 
negative campaigning and aides said they knew of no current plans 
for television commercials that would attack dukakis or jackson 
gores aides concede he is starting at the back of the pack in 
new york campaign his support in public polls is measured in 
single digits but they insist a strong showing can scramble the 
democratic race 
one aide speaking on condition of anonymity said gore hopes to 
enlist the support of democrats who fear that dukakis cannot lead 
the party to victory in the fall although the senator has 
generally dropped this refrain in recent weeks 
one aide says that when jackson became the hot candidate in the 
race recently the fear over dukakis was temporarily shelved 
because jackson is even less electable 
if we get a meaningful bite out of the apple in new york we 
can go on to meaningful victories in other northern states 
including pennsylvahia ohio and elsewhere said one adviser

government and rebel officials are not 
far from agreeing on technical aspects of a ceasefire even though 
they suspended discussions because of some differences a 
negotiator said saturday 
im optimistic said paul reichler a washington attorney 
who is with the sandinista governments negotiating delegation 
weve come this far 
talks between military leaders of the government and the rebels 
known as contras broke off friday after four days of discussions 
negotiators are dealing with the technical aspects of a 60day 
ceasefire that formally went into effect on april 1 
both sides agreed on seven zones where the contras are to gather 
during the ceasefire but failed to agree on how the rebels would 
receive supplies and ways of verifying compliance with the truce 
the ceasefire is part of a peace plan leaders of the warring 
parties agreed to on march 23 the pact called for the rebels to 
gather in the ceasefire zones by april 15 but left details for 
carrying out that plan to later technical discussions 
on thursday the contras released a 34point proposal outlining 
rebel activity in the zones the sandinistas on friday released a 
25point plan for the zones 
reichler said there were only two points in the contra proposal 
that were absolutely unacceptable nonnegotiable 
he said one would allow the rebels to periodically replace 
arms ammunition and war material and the other would bar the 
government from receiving military aid during the truce most of 
nicaraguas arms come from the soviet bloc 
reichler said the sandinistas were frustrated at not reaching an 
agreement after six meetings earlier talks were held between 
military delegations march 2829 
he said the contras were unwilling to continue the talks 
saturday and called for a fourday recess 
were talking about a ceasefire peoples lives and they 
want to work 10to5 with a twohour lunch reichler said 
the government said technical subjects could be discussed 
friday when highlevel talks are scheduled to be held in managua 
those talks called for under the peace plan were to have opened 
last wednesday but the contras asked for a postponement 
contra leader adolfo calero in an interview from miami said 
the sandinistas were to blame for the breakdown of the technical 
talks 
he said he was not sure the friday meeting would be held because 
the government has not responded to the contras demand for free 
access to political opposition figures during their visit to the 
capital 
in the peace pact the rebels agreed to accept only humanitarian 
aid delivered by a neutral organization such as the international 
red cross 
the sandinistas are insisting on inspection but would allow the 
goods to be delivered by air land or sea to the zones 
the sandinistas have agreed to gradually release 3300 political 
prisoners allow the contras to take part in political dialogue and 
restore democratic freedoms 
some 50000 people have been killed or wounded in six years of 
fighting 
the peace plan was signed after three days of talks at the 
border post at sapoa 90 miles south of managua

the oscar show will keep its identity as a 
little hollywood party whose course will be unaffected by the 
writers strike one of the hosts and the shows producers said 
saturday 
the 60th annual academy awards show set for monday on abctv 
will be broadcast live from the 6000seat shrine auditorium the 
first time the oscars have been held there since 1948 
this years show will feature virtually all the nominees in 
person and a script that was unfinished when members of the 
writers guild of america went on strike march 7 against producers 
and studios 
you know something people are making too much of the writers 
strike oscar cohost chevy chase told reporters at a news 
conference in front of the shrine auditorium 
the writers strike doesnt affect us as much as you think 
were really more prepared to do something thats normally 
considered adlib its the nature of the show 
chase told reporters that the material for the show had been 
prepared long in advance and said of the writers guild of which he 
is a member theyve been good to us and weve been good to them 
its not a big deal 
the show for this year is probably the most difficult because 
we have the change of venue director marty passetta said 
he told reporters that among the problems he faced was the 
shrines stage which is 30 feet deep at the dorothy chandler 
pavilion the location for the oscar in previous years the stage 
is 125 feet deep 
but the cavernous shrine will allow 19 camera positions this 
year giving the show a greater sense of action passetta said 
samuel goldwyn jr producer of the show for the second 
consecutive year said the show will try to keep the focus on 
movies as well as glamour 
although this has now become a world famous event this is 
still our own little hollywood party its just become a very big 
party he said 
the show usually lasts more than three hours and goldwyn has 
refused this year to say he will try to keep it under that 
however talkative winners this year will have chatty acceptance 
speeches electronically overcome a warning light will flash at 
increasing speed as the allotted time wanes and finally the 
orchestra music will be brought up slowly while the volume of the 
podium microphone is turned down 
and then you hear a gunshot chase joked 
but film critic roger ebert at the shrine on assignment for the 
chicago suntimes warned that the hosts rather than award 
recipients could lengthen the show 
this could be the comic olympics these guys have been 
brought out this year because they are experienced with live 
television the problem is theyre also experienced with working in 
front of audiences and getting laughs and adlibbing and it may 
turn into a competition to see whos the funniest he said 
noting that among the cohosts and presenters are chase and eddie 
murphy 
during the news conference workers continued putting final 
touches on the grandstand and sprucing up the front of the 
auditorium six 24foot oscar statues were in place in front of the 
auditorium which has a moorish design complete with filigree 
cornices and facade 
because workers were still constructing the stands no 
earlybird fans had yet taken up position to capture the most 
coveted seat in hollywood the grandstand view of the stars 
entrance 
this building looks like the academy award should be held 
here ebert said it looks like james mason and judy garland 
should be walking into it in a scene from a star is born

fourday trip overseas that included a visit to northern ireland 
saying his public criticism of that country was unavoidable 
if you walk into that kind of situation with the kind of 
siege mentality that exists there you can only call it what you 
see if that happens to upset people you let the chips fall where 
they may the 35yearold massachusetts democrat said after 
landing at logan international airport 
earlier in the day kennedy told a cheering crowd in wexford 
ireland that the british have no right to occupy northern 
ireland

get back to massachusetts as quickly as possible 
we had a really eyeopening trip to northern ireland into the 
tremendous oppression that exists in the area into the 
intimidation of irish catholics kennedy said in boston 
he said the problems of the strifetorn british province could 
be solved if the british government used fair employment practices 
and justice and fought discrimination 
we should be electing a president who cares about the people 
of northern ireland and who will stand up to prime minister mrs 
margaret thatcher he said when asked what americans can do for 
the northern irish he didnt say who his choice for president 
would be 
kennedy drew loud cheers when he spoke from the steps of the

the occupying forces are telling us what to do what to eat

problems of northern ireland 
you wouldnt be satisfied with me if i came here simply as a 
tourist he said we all have brothers in the north and they

iran and iraq reported sporadic attacks 
and shellings saturday in their 7yearold war but both appeared 
to be observing a tacit ceasefire in their missile attacks in the 
war of the cities 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia said 
iranian artillery shells hit the battered southern port city of 
basra and four other iraqi border towns farther north killing an 
undisclosed number of civilians 
but neither side reported firing or being hit by any longrange 
missiles since friday the missile duel has taken hundreds of lives 
in the past seven weeks 
a military spokesman in baghdad said iraq had refrained from 
bombarding tehran the iranian capital and other iranian cities 
friday while iranians went to the polls to elect a new 270seat 
majlis or parliament 
but he did not say if the iraqi restraint would continue until 
the results of the election will be known sometime next week 
in manama bahrain a navy spokesman announced that us 
warships safely escorted two reflagged kuwaiti oil tankers out of 
the persian gulf in the 23d such convoy this year 
the supertanker middletown and liquefied gas carrier gas 
princess were escorted on the 550mile journey from kuwait to the 
southern strait of hormuz by the guided missile frigates samuel b 
roberts and the john a moore 
the spokesman said the convoy left kuwait april 5 sailed 
through the gulf without incident and passed through the strait of 
hormuz overnight saturday 
iraqs official news agency quoted the military spokesman as 
saying iraq halted its missile and air attacks on iranian cities 
to facilitate some people of goodwill to cast their votes in the 
election 
he said iraq made the decision out of the hope that some good 
and responsible people might be elected to the majlis and work 
toward ending the war in accordance with a united nations 
security council ceasefire resolution passed july 20 
some small iranian opposition groups want a truce in the war 
that began in september 1980 
the last iraqi missile was fired at irans holy city of qom 
south of tehran at 615 am friday iran retaliated by firing 
missiles at baghdad and other iraqi cities but then ceased the 
attacks 
iranian officials have made no comment on iraqs reports but 
they have said repeatedly iran was only retaliating for iraqi 
attacks 
since the latest spasm in the war of the cities began feb29 
when iraqi warplanes bombed tehran the two sides have fired more 
than 300 missiles into each others population centers 
iraq reported its helicopter gunships flew 79 combat missions 
saturday against iranian military positions along the 730mile 
front but reported no major ground actions 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency also monitored 
in nicosia reported iranian artillery shelled iraqi troops in 
several sectors inflicting heavy casualties

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said saturday 
that israels security and statehood are as important in any middle 
east peace settlement as similar rights for palestinians 
gorbachev made the comments during a meeting with palestine 
liberation organization chief yasser arafat according to the 
official tass news agency 
according to the tass account gorbachev mentioned israels 
rights several times during the meeting in the kremlin 
it quoted him as saying the palestinian people has the right 
to selfdetermination in the same measure as it is ensured for the 
people of israel 
at another point gorbachev said just as recognition of the 
state of israel and its security interests the solution of this 
question of palestinian selfdetermination is a necessary element 
of the establishment of peace and good neighborliness in the region 
on the basis of principles of international law 
but before a middle east peace settlement can be worked out the 
soviet leader told arafat israel must fulfill the key 
precondition of withdrawing from arab land it occupied in the 
1967 middle east war 
the soviet union broke diplomatic relations with the jewish 
state in 1967 
gorbachev has said the lack of relations is not normal but 
insists israel must withdraw from the occupied west bank of the 
jordan river and gaza strip before ties can be restored 
arafat who arrived in moscow on thursday has said he will 
accept un security council resolutions recognizing israels right 
to exist if israel and the united states recognize the plo and 
endorse other un measures calling for israels withdrawal from 
the occupied territories 
gorbachev also told arafat the best way to seek settlement of 
the arabisraeli conflict is an international conference under the 
auspices of the five permanent un security council members the 
soviet union united states britain france and china 
arafat outlined his view of an international conference to 
reporters after his talks with gorbachev and foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
we are favoring such a conference that would be really 
efficient active and would not be limited by any ceremonial 
functions arafat told a news conference 
us secretary of state george p shultz during a fiveday tour 
of the middle east last week pushed the idea of a peace conference 
that would prepare for israeliarab negotiations but would exclude 
the plo 
the conference gorbachev envisions would be open to the most 
diverse forms of interaction of its participants and would give 
the permanent security council members the right to collectively 
or individually table proposals and recommendations according to 
tass 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir has said he opposes an 
international conference under un auspices because he fears the 
soviet union would tilt the forum in the arabs favor and make 
demands that would jeoparize israels security

a jury saturday found john zaccaro jr 
guilty of selling cocaine to an undercover officer two years ago 
rejecting defense arguments that he was entrapped by a pretty state 
trooper 
the jury deliberated for slightly more than two hours before 
finding the son of 1984 vice presidential candidate geraldine 
ferraro guilty of selling onequarter gram of the drug in february 
1986 while he was a student at middlebury college 
zaccaro 24 sat impassively as the verdict was read his 
parents and other family members behind him he faces up to five 
years in prison and a 10000 fine a sentencing date was not 
immediately set 
outside the courthouse ferraro read a statement acknowledging 
that her son had done wrong in the case 
but she also criticized addison county states attorney john 
quinn for prolonging the agony for two years regarding her 
sons fate ferraro promised to appeal the guilty verdict 
she said she and her husband john zaccaro sr had tried to set 
up a plea agreement shortly after their son was arrested but quinn 
would not allow a plea bargain that would not include a felony 
conviction 
we as his parents would not allow him to plead guilty to a 
felony she said 
ferraro said there were several drug cases recently in vermont 
in which plea bargains were easily arranged and light sentences 
were given to defendants convicted of selling larger quantities of 
drugs 
in her statement ferraro blamed the case on four people her 
son quinn former middlebury police detective sgt david wemette 
who initiated the investigation after rumors circulated that 
zaccaro had earned the campus nickname of the pharmacist and 
herself because of the pressure her 1984 candidacy put on her 
family 
ferraro refused to answer reporters questions as she and her 
family walked to their car and drove off 
quinn said the verdict sends a message that drug pushers will 
not be tolerated in vermont in my mind its been difficult 
dealing with the publicity in the case i dont care who his 
parents are 
the states attorney has an unlisted home telephone number and 
could not be reached for further comment on the question of plea 
bargaining 
the verdict came at the end of a sixday trial more than half 
of which was taken up by jury selection 
zaccaros defense attorney charles tetzlaff presented no 
witnesses but told jurors in closing arguments that they should 
find his client innocent by reason of entrapment 
in his instructions to the vermont district court jurors judge 
francis mccaffrey said they could find zaccaro innocent by means of 
entrapment if they believed he was induced to commit a crime he 
normally would not commit entrapment could not be used as a 
defense if the jury had considered the lesser charge of possession 
the judge said 
tetzlaff said police acted improperly by sending an attractive 
female undercover agent to zaccaros apartment to buy cocaine he 
asked the jury to send a message to police that society should not 
condone such activities 
quinn told jurors that the issue was whether zaccaro sold 
cocaine to state trooper laura manning 
yes she was deceptive shes not going to the defendants 
house dressed in a uniform that would be ludicrous quinn said 
i cant deny laura manning is attractive i cant deny shes 
female but i can deny she was bait 
he described the deal as just another sale for zaccaro 
when he takes a packet off the tray he opens it up being the 
good merchant that he is looks at it wraps it up and gives 
it to manning quinn said 
earlier saturday the final prosecution witness state police 
chemist frank durkee testified that a packet of powder zaccaro 
sold to manning tested as cocaine 
tetzlaff who rested his case soon after durkees testimony had 
said in his opening statement the defense will not dispute the 
allegation that he sold a regulated drug this is a case of 
improper and overzealous police conduct 
the attorney also said that manning an officer on her first 
undercover assignment had brought up the subject of drugs not 
zaccaro 
manning testified friday that she went to zaccaros apartment 
with instructions to buy onequarter gram of cocaine 
when asked what she said to zaccaro manning responded i 
said a couple of people told me that you could sell me some 
coke 
and what did he say quinn asked 
sure manning quoted zaccaro as responding 
the judge banned the use of mannings taperecorded drug buy as 
evidence in the trial he also refused to allow prosecutors to use 
items taken from zaccaros car including documents described as 
drug records 1630 and eight grams of cocaine the barring of the 
evidence in the car resulted in the dropping of a second charge 
against zaccaro possession with intent to sell 
the defense also had raised the argument that zaccaro was 
unfairly singled out because of the publicity surrounding his 
mother but the vermont supreme court refused to overturn the 
charges on that basis

police renewed an unprecedented 1000officer 
blitz on street gangs saturday redeploying a special task force 
that made nearly 600 arrests in an antigang dragnet the night 
before 
all day long we have been lifting the hammer said police 
spokesman bill frio the chief called at 3 pm and said to drop 
it 
the force made 592 arrests during the citywide sweep friday 
night and early saturday for a variety of felonies and 
misdemeanors and also impounded at least 10 guns and 96 vehicles 
police said 224 of those arrested were believed to be gang members 
police had earlier reported 634 arrests but later corrected the 
figure which was caused by confusion during booking frio said 
officials were unsure how many of those arrested were held and how 
many released on bail he said 
the huge show of force began friday evening with mayor tom 
bradleys pledge to take back the streets and continued 
through the night with even police chief daryl gates and an 
assistant chief making arrests 
gangs were blamed for 205 killings in the city of los angeles in 
1987 countywide the death toll from gang violence last year was 
387 many of the victims bystanders caught in the gangs trademark 
driveby shootings 
only one violent gangrelated incident was reported in the city 
during the sweep friday night police said 
shots were fired at an officer serving a search warrant at a 
house a special weapons and tactics team was summoned but there 
was no further violence frio said six people were arrested for 
investigation of narcotics possession cocaine cash and several 
guns were seized 
in a gangrelated incident outside the city los angeles county 
sheriffs deputies in nearby lynwood arrested a young man after a 
twohour standoff that began when he was spotted with a gun which 
he allegedly pointed at a deputy 
the sweep was the city police departments biggest attack ever 
on drug dealing and street violence over the past month smaller 
task forces have arrested a total of 1400 suspected gang members 
frio said 
the police chief made a collar of his own when he stopped a man 
in gang dress frisked him and discovered a bottle of prescription 
drugs in somebody elses name the man was held for investigation 
of possession of a controlled substance said lt mark leap 
assistant police chief robert vernon who was on patrol on the 
southside also made an arrest his collar was wanted for a parole 
violation frio said 
about half the special force went to augment regular patrols in 
the southcentral area the rest of the officers spread out in gang 
areas throughout the city 
the task force was assembled by putting officers on overtime at 
a cost of 150000 a day bradley has vowed to spend whatever it 
takes to intimidate the gangs 
drug dealing and gang violence have long been a fact of life in 
the poor minority neighborhoods of southcentral los angeles 
but wider community attention and political will focused on 
the violence in february when a woman was shot to death during a 
gang confrontation in the affluent mostly white westwood 
entertainment district near the university of california los 
angeles 
more recently after a good friday attack killed one man and 
injured a dozen others none of them gang members gates announced 
plans for the new task force 
bradley has budgeted funds for 400 new police officers next 
year and political opposition to lawandorder measures aimed at 
gangs is virtually nonexistent 
city councilman robert farrell a longtime southside 
representative said as the task force formed friday evening that 
there was strong support for the police effort and no opposition 
over potential civil rights violations 
the expansion of the police force is what is necessary to 
maintain a sense of order decency and civility and the police 
deployment is appropriate he said 
the police departments use of a suspect profile 
intelligence work and preliminary planning is why youve not 
heard anyone raise the issue of civil rights concern he said

former president richard m nixon said in an 
interview broadcast saturday that his biggest mistake in office was 
in not bombing and mining north vietnam sooner 
i would say the major mistake i made as president was one 
this will suprise you was not doing early in 1969 what i did on 
may 3 of 1972 and on dec 15 of 1972 and that was to bomb and mine 
north vietnam nixon said in an interview taped for sundays 
meet the press on nbc 
i wanted to do it i talked to henry kissinger about it but 
we were stuck with the bombing halt that we had inherited from the 
johnson administration with paris peace talks he said i knew 
that just like the cease fire talks down here in nicaragua i 
didnt trust them at all and they proved to be of course phony 
but if we had done that then i think we would have ended the 
war in vietnam in 1969 rather than in 1973 nixon said in a 
segment of the interview shown on nbc news on saturday that was 
my biggest mistake as president 
in the hourlong interview the former president who resigned 
in 1974 when threatened with impeachment for his role in the 
watergate scandal also discussed presidential pardons attorney 
general edwin meese iii and the 1988 presidential candidates nbc

the soviets will join america in guaranteeing a 
settlement of the war in afghanista mikhail s gorbachev was 
quoted saturday as saying and he hinted a dispute over superpower 
aid to rival factions has been resolved 
the aid issue has been a key obstacle in the negotiations in 
geneva on a settlement of the war and the withdrawal of an 
estimated 115000 soviet troops in afghanistan 
un mediator diego cordovez announced friday that agreements 
were ready to be signed and us sources said the signing would 
take place thursday 
in a speech he gave in the republic of uzbekistan on friday but 
not released until saturday gorbachev did not directly refer to 
the dispute over whether the soviet union would stop military aid 
to afghanistans marxist government and the united states would end 
its support of afghan rebels 
but the soviet leader said the communist party politburo had 
found a way so that the signings of the agreements by the 
afghan and pakistani sides and the simultaneous signing of certain 
documents by us and the americans in the capacity of guarantors 
could take place 
us officials said saturday in washington they received a 
written soviet response to a reagan administration proposal for the 
two superpowers to continue military support of afghan factions 
after the soviet withdrawal 
no details were released but the soviets last week were 
reported to have informally accepted the us proposal us 
secretary of state george p shultz was studying the soviet 
response and was considering a trip to geneva to attend the signing 
of the accord aimed ending soviet invovlement in afghanistan us 
officials said 
in his speech gorbachev also repeated the statement that soviet 
troops would begin withdrawing from afghanistan on may 15 he gave 
the speech in the communist party central committees chambers in 
the central asian republics capital of tashkent 
gorbachev and afghan leader najib met in tashkent on thursday 
and released a joint statement saying all obstacles to a war 
settlement and soviet troop withdrawal had been removed 
the soviets sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
help the government battle anticommuniust insurgents 
tass the official news agency released a text of gorbachevs 
remarks and the evening television news program vremya broadcast 
the 55minute speech as its lead item on saturday some excerpts of 
the speech which focused mainly on domestic economic issues were 
released friday 
gorbachev said lastminute problems developed during the geneva 
talks 
difficulties threatening to torpedo the agreements arose at 
the concluding stage he said this required additional 
intensive efforts he said the politburo met and found 
approaches which as we think provide now a possibility to 
conclude this process 
he did not specify the difficulties but appeared to be 
referring to us demands for symmetry in the cutoff of 
superpower military aid 
shultz had proposed ending all us and soviet aid to the two 
sides but the soviets rejected that saying their aid to 
afghanistan is a bilateral matter not subject to international 
consideration shultz then offered the compromise calling for 
symmetrical levels of aid 
it is not known what role the united states and soviet union 
would play in guaranteeing the geneva accords because texts the 
agreements have not been released

the guardian angels picketed actor sean 
penns mansion saturday to denounce his latest movie as a 
recruitment film for street gangs but penn and his wife pop 
star madonna were reportedly out of town 
the anticrime group wearing their trademark red berets and 
carrying signs and mock coffins marched outside the gates of 
penns mansion in this seaside celebrity enclave demanding an end 
to local screenings of the film colors 
the demonstrators chanted profit from the movie colors will 
not profit the crying mothers a toilet seat adorned with penns 
photo was set up outside the gates 
the movie pumps gang members up its better than what a 
professional coach does said paul barrera the angels regional 
coodinator if i was a 14 15yearold kid i would say wow i 
want to go out and join 
barrera claimed that up to 50 people took part in the 
demonstration but malibu sheriffs sgt bill hutton put the number 
at closer to a dozen 
the picketing which was peaceful lasted about three hours 
hutton said 
the penns are out of state hutton said its possibly 
nothing more than a media event for the guardian angels 
the group planned to picket the home of director dennis hopper 
on sunday 
the guardian angels are the latest group to criticize the movie 
which stars penn and robert duvall as tough cops battling gangs on 
the streets of los angeles 
although los angeles police acted as technical advisers on the 
film several lawenforcement officials who attended a prerelease 
screening last month denounced the final product 
they like the angels said it glorifies gangs which were 
blamed for nearly 400 killings last year in los angeles county and 
were the target of massive police sweeps this weekend 
its a recruitment film barrera said it never once 
showed these guys for what they were parasites on our community

candidate sonny bono isnt sure how 
hell do in this desert resorts mayoral election tuesday but just 
ask him about his exwifes chances for an oscar 
i had this vision bono said this incredible thought 
occurred to me chers going to win the academy award i called 
her yesterday i said cher youre going to win 
she said from your mouth to gods ear 
cher is a nominee for best actress in monday nights academy 
awards for her performance in moonstruck and her former 
singing and marriage partner is on the ballot for mayor the next 
day in this celebrity desert resort 
wouldnt it be fun if she won the academy award and i was 
elected mayor bono said in a recent interview at his lavish 
mansion here it would be unprecedented in that sonny and cher 
stays alive in so many ways years later 
its been 23 years since the bellbottomed furvested couple 
hit the top of the record charts singing ive got you babe and 
14 years since both their television show and marriage ended 
bono who recently appeared in offbeat movie hairspray and 
also runs a restaurant announced his candidacy a year ago drawing 
hoots and howls from people who remembered him as the longhaired 
butt of chers jokes and whose career bottomed out after guest 
spots on love boat and fantasy island 
they thought it was a joke bono said of townspeoples 
reaction to his candidacy they came around because i put my body 
out there for people to start shooting at and people came around 
they now take me very seriously 
show business he says was never as tough as running for 
office not even close 
the pressure and anxiety reached major proportions march 31 when 
he burst into a televised candidates forum and exploded at the 
moderator for not explaining that he wasnt participating because 
his pregnant fourth wife mary 26 was hospitalized with the flu 
the couples first child is due april 17 
i shouldnt have gotten that emotional or let it affect me 
that much but it did he said apologetically 
although there are seven candidates for mayor the media 
spotlight is on bono 
we got calls from europe an australian television station 
abc is coming in tomorrow its just crazy said campaign worker 
glenn symonds 
bono is fueling his campaign by selling 15 sonny bono for 
mayor tshirts the sales of shirts buttons and bumper stickers 
account for 37000 of his 53000 campaign war chest the largest 
of the candidates 
bonos opponents are vice mayor eli birer businesswoman deyna 
hodges accountant lloyd maryanov agua caliente indian tribe 
secretary ray patencio real estate agent neil beatty and retired 
dentist lewis friedman 
ive never run against a celebrity before its really 
tough birer said 
bono moved to the desert four years ago to escape los angeles 
the tranquility relaxed him and he enjoyed the smalltown 
atmosphere 
but he soon had runins with city officials over the size of a 
sign for his italian restaurant bono and about a retaining 
wall he was building at his home so like carmels clint eastwood 
he decided to run for mayor 
it was very dictatorial very controlled very hostile bono 
said of the city government i have a big investment in this 
city i dont want to see it deteriorate or decline 
incumbent frank bogert 76 is stepping down after two twoyear 
terms the new mayor will serve a fouryear term and be paid 
15000 a year the parttime nonpartisan official presides over 
the city council while a city manager handles daily operations and 
makes recommendations to the council 
whatever townspeople think of bonos candidacy most agree that 
palm springs needs revitalization it has lost business clout and 
tourists to other nearby desert communities such as palm desert and 
rancho mirage where frank sinatra lives 
if hes elected bono has plans to draw tourists to this town 
120 miles southeast of los angeles including a film festival with 
bigname celebrities a sporting event such as a marathon or 
triathalon and concerts 
but win or lose bono knows he made a difference by getting the 
issues discussed and people interested an election in this 
community of 38000 residents usually draws about 6000 of its 
18000 registered voters thats expected to double tuesday 
at least i added excitement to the race he said it would 
have been a yawn without me

strike by advertisers including presidential candidates who 
were willing to meet the unions demands he said 
about 400 companies agreed to make commercials under the interim

the national institutes of health and two 
congressional panels are about to launch investigations into 
charges that a molecular biology manuscript written by a nobel 
laureate and his colleagues misrepresented research data 
an official at the nih said a special committee has been named 
to review allegations of scientific misconduct involving a study on 
duplicating immunity cells in laboratory mice the project was 
headed by nobel laureate david baltimore director of the whitehead 
institute in boston and theresa imanishikari of tufts university 
four other researchers were coauthors 
mary miers an executive in the nih office that investigates 
allegations of research misconduct said the special committee was 
organized after two nih scientists walter w stewart and ned 
feder raised issues about research performed by imanishikari 
miers said stewart and feder reported their allegations in a 
manuscript that has been provided to the committee the two men 
who in the past have raised questions about the credibility of 
other research efforts declined to discuss the case with a 
reporter 
baltimore who won the nobel prize in 1976 for research in 
cellular biology said in an interview on friday that he welcomed 
the nih investigation and hopes it will silence the charges of 
stewart and feder who he said have acted like a judge and jury 
in the case 
testimony on the controversy will be heard by two separate 
congressional subcommittees both of which have called stewart and 
feder as witnesses 
on monday the house subcommittee on government operations and 
human resources will hear the nih scientists along with other 
witnesses on the general subject of scientific fraud 
on tuesday the house subcommittee on oversight and 
investigation will plow some of the same ground feder and stewart 
will again testify along with a researcher margot otoole who 
assisted imanishikari in the controversial study 
the study coauthored by baltimore imanishikari and four other 
researchers was published in the prestigious journal cell on 
april 25 1986 the paper titled altered repertoire of 
endogenous immunoglobulin gene expression in transgenic mice 
containing a rearranged mu heavy chain gene deals with the 
replication of immunity cells in a type of genetically altered 
laboratory mice 
baltimore said he performed the molecular biology work that 
contributed to half of the paper and that imanishikari conducted 
the research that dealt with the immune system 
the allegations of misconduct he said stem from a difference 
in interpretation of research conducted in the laboratory of 
imanishikari who then was at massachusetts institute of 
technology 
he said otoole who was a postdoctoral student assisting in 
the research disagreed with an interpretation by imanishikari of 
how a monoclonal antibody attached itself to types of immune cells 
otoole brought charges of misconduct against imanishikari but 
her allegations were investigated and dismissed by officials at mit 
and at tufts 
the subject was dropped until somebody got stewart and feder 
interested in the case said baltimore

police ended a 15hour sitin at penn 
state university on saturday by arresting students who said the use 
of force typified the schools insensitivity toward blacks 
we were dragged out and we got pulled out by the state 
troopers people were manhandled by the state troopers said 
darryl king a senior from philadelphia and a student leader of the 
almost entirely black group occupying the schools 
telecommunications building 
i think its a terrible message to send to students when the 
president of the university would rather send state troopers to 
meet with them than come himself said seth williams president 
of penn states student government and one of those arrested 
more than 150 students began the protest friday afternoon after 
student leaders and school administrators failed to agree on ground 
rules for a discussion of minority issues with university president 
bryce jordan and top administration officials 
black students said they wanted to outline grievances on 
minority issues at an open meeting with jordan 
after the sitin began university officials read students a 
preliminary injunction ordering them to leave the 
telecommunications building at 8 pm and again at 10 pm but 
negotiations continued until 2 am 
at least 75 university local and state police began arresting 
students at 525 am said david stormer director of university 
safety ninetyone protesters were arrested on charges of 
trespassing in the building or being disorderly outside stormer 
said 
this is symbolic of the way they treat us here at penn 
state said king a former president of the black caucus a 
student organization 
robert blair a spokesman for the black caucus said minority 
students should have a voice in programs at the university that 
affect them and criticized penn state for failing to meet a 
courtmandated goal for black enrollment 
jordan issued a statement saturday night in which he called the 
arrests an unhappy day for penn state 
we are anxious to reestablish communications with the 
students involved he said we wish to discuss their concerns 
under mutually agreeable conditions so that the universitys 
affirmative action program can move forward with the support of the 
entire penn state community 
last fall penn state failed to reach the 5 percent black 
enrollment it agreed to meet under court order penn state has a 
36 percent black enrollment or 2424 black students out of about 
67000 
jordan agreed to a meeting tuesday after a group of nine black 
students and a local black pastor staged an 11hour sitin outside 
his office the university president sent two senior administrators 
friday to speak privately with the students 
but student leaders said they wanted an open meeting with jordan 
and 12 administrators and faculty 
carol cartwright chairman of the universitys equal opportunity 
planning committee said the administration wanted to meet the 
student leaders somewhere else to set up a public meeting for their 
grievances 
stormer said he waited until dawn to make the arrests in part 
to ensure a smaller crowd outside the twostory brick building as 
many as 200 students had gathered to show their support but their 
numbers had dwindled to about 30 when police started making arrests 
state troopers dressed in riot gear formed lines on either 
side of the building while officers inside arrested protesters 
onebyone 
students many holding yellow citation slips were released 
almost immediately and walked through police lines to be greeted by 
hugs from friends and cheers from supporters 
carol herrmann executive assistant to the president said the 
administration had no choice but to arrest the students when hours 
of negotiations failed to get them to leave the building 
i hope it wont alienate the black community i think that the 
administration is ready always to address concerns of campus 
environment she said 
i think it went very smoothly stormer said there was no 
resistance in the form of being combative they merely resisted in 
the form of holding onto each other 
about 130 protesters were in the building when police started 
making arrests but many chose to leave rather than face 
prosecution stormer said 
craig millar assistant vice president for student services 
told the students who were arrested they also face charges under 
the universitys code of conduct and could be expelled 
operations at the telecommunications building which houses the 
universitys central switchboard were not interrupted by the 
student protest university spokesman roger williams said

rainy night in georgia died saturday a hospital official 
said he was 56 
benton who lived in queens died at mary immaculate hospital in 
queens according to the hospital administrator who identified

ballads set against lush orchestral arrangements one of his 
biggest years was 1959 when he had four top 20 hits its just a 
matter of time so many ways endlessly and thank you 
pretty baby 
among his later hits were the boll weevil song think 
twice revenge frankie and johnny and for my baby

most popular of which were baby youve got what it takes and 
a rockin good way

elegance yet the swirling strings dont obscure his emotional 
intensity said the record guide

been found buried in shallow graves since september

jail guards police officers sheriffs deputies and reserves fire 
marshals chaplains and an el paso city councilman 
deputy police chief gus massey said although no bodies were

saturdays desert scouring was prompted by the discovery of the 
sixth set of skeletal remains by aluminum can collectors march 14

all of the remains have been of young women and police believe 
that three missing young women may also be victims of what they 
have labeled a serial killing

to know were making an extra effort officer george salas said 
as he took a break from digging to rest in the shade of a national 
guard truck

national guard armory where they met for a 645 am briefing 
searchers divided into 10 teams and covered specific areas of 
the desert 
el paso county sheriffs deputy jack waite said searchers took 
into consideration that the bodies have been found in shallow 
graves within 30 feet from dirt trails 
we spread out a few feet apart and we just followed the 
roadways he said 
lt jr grijalva said the search has not assured officials that 
there are no more bodies in the desert he said authorities will

francis a keating like the other top deputy 
just named by attorney general edwin meese iii belongs to an 
allwhite country club raising the prospect that both of the new 
justice department officials could face confirmation difficulties 
keating now assistant treasury secretary for enforcement and 
tapped for the no 3 job at justice listed a stock share in the 
southern hills country club in tulsa okla on his 1987 financial 
disclosure form a club official who did not want to give his 
name confirmed that keating is still a member of the club 
keatings father anthony f keating contended saturday that 
his son was no longer a member of southern hills country club 
according to the sunday editions of tulsa world 
he doesnt belong anymore the father told the newspaper 
he used to be a member but gave it up when he went to 
washington 
keating was confirmed to his treasury job in 1985 two years 
before completing the disclosure form that still listed the stock 
share in the country club 
it was reported last week that john shepherd named by meese to 
fill the job of deputy attorney general the no 2 post in the 
department is a member of the allwhite bellerive country club 
and the allmale missouri athletic club in the st louis area 
keating and shepherd have yet to be formally nominated by 
president reagan and still face confirmation hearings by the 
senate keating would succeed associate attorney general stephen 
trott who is leaving to become a federal appellate judge in 
california 
the president of southern hills thomas j hughes said that 
although he is not steeped in the tradition of the club to 
my knowledge there never has been a black member 
hughes said a person becomes a member of the club by being 
sponsored by a current member he said he could not disclose the 
clubs initiation fee keating valued his membership stock as worth 
between 5001 and 15000 in his financial disclosure form 
keating also was once a member of another allwhite club in 
tulsa the tulsa club 
but charles adams office manager for the tulsa club said 
keating resigned his membership when he left town 
keating 44 was out of the country on a business trip and could 
not be reached for comment terry eastland a justice department 
spokesman declined comment 
shepherd a former president of the american bar association 
was named by meese last tuesday to fill the deputy attorney 
generals job following the sudden resignation march 29 of arnold 
burns 
burns quit along with assistant attorney general william weld 
because of their apparent concern about the 11month criminal 
investigation of meese 
as head of enforcement at treasury keating oversees the secret 
service the customs service and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms 
the issue of federal appointees membership in exclusionary 
clubs has arisen before with mixed results president carters 
nominee for attorney general griffin bell told the judiciary 
committee during his confirmation hearings he would resign from 
such clubs president reagans first attorney general william 
french smith refused to follow that example and was confirmed 
anyway 
more recently us circuit judge anthony kennedy resigned from 
membership in two exclusionary clubs when his name was first 
mentioned as a possible nominee for the supreme court he was 
subsequently confirmed as a justice

a cuban chess grandmaster who won 10000 in a 
prestigious chess tournament in new york city has been barred from 
taking the money out of the united states according to a published 
report 
guillermo garcia 34 of havana went home thursday without the 
money because of the enforcement of a provision of the trading with 
the enemy act of 1917 the new york times reported in its sunday 
editions 
quoting an unidentified treasury department spokesman the times 
said the sanctions against cuba were put into effect by president 
kennedy in 1963 
its very unfortunate and it saddens me garcia told the 
newspaper before boarding a plane home after competing in the 
125000 new york open which ended march 30 
this is something that i never heard happen before in the 
history of chess where a grandmaster wins a prize and he cant 
receive it said garcia one of about 250 grandmasters in the 
world and cubas national champion three times he was secondplace 
winner in the new york city tournament 
he said he believes politics should not intrude on sports 
activities 
lawyer harold a mayerson is exploring the possibility of suing 
the treasury department the times said 
mayerson said the law probably wasnt meant to be applied in 
cases like garcias and if it was it carried a questionable 
policy the blockade of cuba to a ludicrous conclusion he added 
the treasury department spokesman said the 10000 garcia won 
will go into an interestbearing account in his name in the united 
states 
but an official of the treasury departments office of foreign 
assets control said the account will be blocked so that he can have 
access to it only if he establishes permanent residence in a 
country other than cuba libya vietnam north korea and cambodia 
the nations the law applies to the times said 
the official who also was not identified said the sanction is 
to prevent transfer of hard currency to cuba and to provide 
leverage to reach a settlement with cuba because of their 
expropriation of us property back in the early 1960s

police say that george white the architect of 
the capitol suffered minor injuries friday when his government car 
struck one of the barricades that white recommended be installed to 
protect the capitol from terrorists 
officer dan nichols of the capitol police force said white who 
is responsible for the capitols buildings and grounds was treated 
by capitol physicians along with a driver who also received minor 
injuries 
nichols said whites car struck the mechancial barrier at the 
south entrance to the capitol plaza as the device called a 
slammer was being lowered to allow entry 
preliminarily it looks like driver error said nichols 
adding that the investigation was continuing 
white a passenger in the back seat disagreed with that 
assessment he said he thought the barrier had been lowered and 
then rose unexpectedly either because of a mechanical malfunction 
or a barrierkeeper pushing the wrong button 
weve had a couple of incidents like that white said my 
drivers first rate hes never had an accident i cant imagine 
him doing that 
white said his eyeglass frames were broken and his nose 
scratched when the impact threw his head against a frontseat 
headrest he said the driver oscar womack received a cut on his 
lower lip 
he said the incident taught him that back seat passengers should 
wear safety belts and that the barriers really work 
they bring you to a sudden halt he said 
the front bumper of whites large black mercury came to rest 
atop the barrier cooling fluid was leaking from the vehicle and 
the right front tire was flat 
the hydraulic barriers intended to prevent unauthorized 
vehicles from entering the capitol grounds were installed last 
year as part of a 13 million plan white recommended to tighten 
security according to elliott carroll whites executive assistant 
no terrorists have been reported snared by the slammers but 
last june a lowered barrier popped up as a white house car was 
passing over it leaving the vehicle stranded three feet in the air

police set up a command post at memorial 
coliseum and a holding tank for arrestees friday in preparation for 
a gang crackdown officials likened to the security taken for the 
1984 summer olympics 
officials were tightlipped about details of the planned sweep 
friday night through gangterroized neighborhoods however police 
chief daryl gates pledged last week to put 1000 officers on the 
streets to combat the gangs whose driveby shootings have claimed 
numerous lives particularly in poor southcentral neighborhoods 
margie reid a department spokesman said she could not reveal 
the specific number of officers to be deployed but acknowledged it 
was the largest such operation ever carried out by the department 
it is similar to the olympics reid said referring to the 
elaborate security measures for the 1984 summer games in los 
angeles 
a command post was established at the coliseum along with a 
temporary holding facility for arrestees 
everything you could think of has to be arranged reid said 
gangs were blamed for 387 killings in los angeles county in 
1987 and as many as 85 so far this year 
gang violence has long been a problem in los angeles and some 
neighboring cities in los angeles county and upsurges in violence 
have triggered occasional outcries 
however local political leaders and police officials reached a 
consensus for action when a recent gang shooting in the westwood 
district killed a young woman and a driveby shooting on good 
friday killed one man and left a dozen other people wounded 
the police department began largescale sweeps of gang 
territories using several hundred officers and mayor tom bradley 
announced his next city budget would include allocations for 400 
new police officers 
in sacramento the state assembly voted 4813 on thursday to 
amend a bill to allow police to use wiretaps against suspected drug 
dealers 
there also have been calls for gov george deukmejian to send 
california national guard forces to los angeles to help in gang 
suppression but city and county officials have made no formal 
requests said tom beerman a spokesman for the governor in 
sacramento 
on thursday deukmejian suggested that it might be better to

a federal jury awarded south dakota 
200 million friday in the states antitrust lawsuit against kansas 
city southern railway co over the demise of a coal slurry project 
lawyers said the damage award would be tripled under federal 
antitrust laws 
glen johnson a lawyer for the state said the tripled damages 
exceed the 500 million that the railroad listed as its net worth 
he had said during the trial that it was the largest case ever 
tried in south dakota in terms of damages 
the jury found that kansas city southern conspired with other 
railroads to thwart the project in which energy transportation 
systems inc known as etsi would pipe crushed coal from wyoming 
to southern states using missouri river water that would be 
purchased from south dakota 
jurors also said the conspiracy resulted in restraint of trade 
in the coal transportation market hurt interstate commerce and 
damaged the state of south dakota 
the jury deliberated 4 days after hearing nine weeks of 
testimony in us district court in sioux falls 
kansas city southern lawyer john shenefield called the verdict 
incorrect and predicted that the decision would be reversed on 
appeal 
gov george mickelson said the state should not plan to spend 
the award yet its not over he said 
the jury said kansas city southern intentionally interfered with 
etsis contract to buy missouri river water from south dakota 
the damages amount to what the state said was its loss of net 
profits in the water sale contract which was canceled after the 
coal slurry project was abandoned in 1984 
former south dakota gov bill janklow who negotiated the water 
sale contract with etsi and who initiated the antitrust lawsuit 
said the tripled amount of damages is almost twice what the state 
takes in every year in sales taxes 
the state said in its suit that kansas city southern was 
designated as the lead railroad in a conspiracy to kill the 
pipeline project because it threatened to compete with hauling of 
lowsulphur coal from wyoming by rail 
etsi planned a 38 billion 1400milelong coal slurry line 
but needed to cross railroad tracks and win numerous environmental 
permits the state contended that kansas city southern and other 
railroads which were not named in the lawsuit teamed up to force 
delays that eventually killed the project 
kansas city southerns lawyers argued that the pipeline never 
would have been built and would have failed if it had the defense 
admitted railroads were opposed to the project but denied any 
conspiracy

gov mario cuomos message to new york 
democratic officials to get behind one of the partys three 
presidential candidates may be helping michael dukakis more than 
the other two a cuomo aide said friday 
after yesterday i got a clear sense of some movement to 
dukakis said john marino executive director of the state 
democratic committee by next monday or tuesday well have a 
much better felling for that maybe therell be a bandwagon effect 
for dukakis but you may have a backlash reaction 
but the message from the governor seemed a bit ambiguous later 
friday when cuomo declared at a news conference that he did not 
care whether democratic leaders endorsed candidates or not 
i did not offer instruction to people that they must endorse 
or should endorse why should i i havent endorsed myself im not 
instructing or suggesting the governor said 
cuomo also revealed that he has already voted by absentee ballot 
for one of the candidates but refused to say which one 
and the governor said he was in discussions with the three 
candidates about making campaign appearances with them all time 
permitting ill go anywhere with them he said 
while there appeared to be some move among new yorks most 
influential democrats toward the massachusetts governor jesse 
jackson and tennessee sen albert gore jr were also picking up 
endorsements 
marinos comments came a day after state democratic chairman 
laurence kirwan told the state committee that they should line up 
behind dukakis jackson or gore 
while kirwans message direct from cuomo was a repeat of a 
cuomokirwan missive delivered several months ago it had new 
significance because it came so close to the april 19 primary 
the first major leader to take kirwans advice was erie county 
chairman joseph crangle a former state chairman who said he would 
support dukakis rochesters thomas fink the state committee 
secretary and a close ally of kirwan also lined up behind dukakis 
also the new york times reported that several other major 
democrats brooklyn democratic leader howard golden new york city 
comptroller harrison goldin queens borough president claire 
shulman and rep stephen solarz of brooklyn were expected to line 
up behind dukakis soon 
one super delegate who wasnt quite ready to toe the line was 
suffolk county chairman dominic baranello also a former state 
chairman 
what are they going to do take away my citizenship said 
baranello were going to sit tight awhile 
while marino was talking about a possible move to dukakis by new 
yorks democratic leaders jackson scored a victory thursday when 
he picked up the backing of bronx borough president fernando ferrer 
also rockland county chairman vincent monte said friday that 
he rockland county executive john grant orange county chairman 
ellie habig and sullivan county chairman kay bodgen would all 
endorse gore at a sunday night news conference 
at the state committee meeting thursday kirwan told the 
democratic leaders that one thing cuomo didnt want was for them to 
remain on the fence or to back an uncommitted slate of 
prospective delegates on the new york primary ballot who want to go 
to the national convention and help orchestrate a draftcuomo move 
we cant force them to endorse but we can tell them in no 
uncertain terms that this is what we want them to do said marino 
of kirwans message to state party leaders there is no 
uncommitted option for cuomo because there is no cuomo candidacy 
were not going to pay any attention to it said former new 
york rep richard ottinger of kirwans message ottinger said the 
uncommitted delegates hoped to convince other convention delegates 
to turn to cuomo if none of the announced candidates could lock up 
the nomination 
we feel its important to have our strongest candidate said 
the westchester county lawyer we think thats cuomo 
while cuomo has said he doesnt want to be a candidate himself 
he has refused to rule out accepting a draft for the nomination if 
theres a deadlocked convention

a former juror in a federal drug conspiracy 
trial was sentenced friday to three months in jail for writing 
thankyou notes to a defendant who left flowers on her car and 
telephoned her during deliberations 
us district judge john f gerry also ordered the juror 
patricia hand of millville to pay 46850 to the government to 
cover the costs of the 1987 trial 
five of the seven defendants were convicted but gerry threw out 
the verdicts after learning of mrs hands contact with one 
defendant 
it was a cancer that she implanted on the judicial system 
the judge said before sentencing mrs hand this travesty of 
justice that resulted from her conduct brought the entire system 
into disrepute for a short while 
he also ordered mrs hand to serve three years probation term 
for what he called the indifferent folly and selfindulgence of 
this woman 
mrs hand who pleaded guilty last june to a charge of contempt 
of court declined comment after fridays sentencing 
she was a juror from feb 11 to april 3 1987 in the trial of 
seven men charged with running a multimilliondollar cocaine ring 
in north caldwell township 
mrs hand testifed at a posttrial hearing that she spoke on the 
telephone with defendant george pepe twice one night when he called 
her at home during deliberations she also said she left two notes 
for pepe at a luncheonette near the courthouse after he left two 
carnations on her car 
a waitress at the luncheonette testifed that mrs hand asked her 
to act as gobetween 
mrs hands attorney howard johnson told gerry his client was 
a naive innocent victim manipulated by pepe the actions of my 
client were admittedly improper and in her words stupid he said 
in the 1987 trial the jury convicted five of the six other 
defendants but did not reach a verdict on pepe 
pepe who faced a retrial also pleaded guilty to a reduced 
charge of using a telephone to advance a narcotics conspiracy 
gerry sentenced pepe friday to a twoyear suspended sentence on 
that charge pepe faces sentencing april 18 on a conviction of jury 
tampering

king hussein told us secretary of state 
george p shultz that his country will not stand in for the 
palestinian people or the plo in proposed middle east peace talks 
the government said friday 
shultz who visited jordan this week as part of a shuttle 
mission to push the talks has suggested that a team of jordanians 
and nonplo palestinians negotiate for palestinians 
the official jordan news agency said king hussein gave shultz a 
working paper of jordans principles for peace with israel 
during their three days of meetings shultz returned to washington 
on friday 
the secretary of state vowed to return and praised hussein for 
having engaged seriously with us for peace in the region 
the jordanian paper laid out six general principles calling for 
israeli withdrawal from occupied territories selfdetermination 
for the palestinians and an international middle east peace 
conference to include the five permanent members of the un 
security council the united states soviet union britain france 
and china 
the paper contained major differences with the shultz peace 
plan israel and the united states reject the idea of palestinian 
selfdetermination which implies statehood the us plan offers 
limited selfrule for palestinians 
jordan has attempted to repair its tattered relations with the 
palestine liberation organization whose prestige has increased in 
the arab world because of a fourmonth wave of violent protests 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
jordan will not represent the palestinian people in that 
international peace conference and will not negotiate a 
settlement on the israel issue in place of the palestine liberation 
organization the paper said 
shultz said in israel and again in jordan that the plo could not 
take part in peace talks unless it renounces violence and accepts 
israels right to exist 
jordan said it is willing to attend the peace conference in a 
joint delegation with palestinians if the concerned parties agree 
to this principle 
the plo obviously one of the concerned parties has 
rejected the idea of a joint delegation 
jordan said the international conference should be more than an 
international gathering aimed at starting direct negoations a 
reference to shultzs concept but it left unclear the extent to 
which the conference would affect talks between warring states 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel opposes any 
international conference arguing it would be stacked against his 
country he also opposes any proposal to surrender the west bank 
gaza strip and golan heights captured by israel in 1967 from 
jordan egypt and syria 
shultz told shamir he would have to give up some territory to 
achieve peace but did not favor the total withdrawal the arabs 
demand 
jordan said peace talks must be based on the illegality of 
occupying other peoples lands by force wording taken from 
united nations security council resolution 242 which calls on 
israel to trade the captured lands for peace

a proposed 250000 fine against ryan 
air service 10 months before one of its planes crashed killing 18 
people was cut by more than 90 percent after a federal aviation 
official questioned how the fine was calculated investigators were 
told friday 
the official federal aviation administration regional counsel 
donald boberick testified during a national transportation safety 
board hearing probing the nov 23 crash of ryan air flight 103 
the crash was the 10th ryan air accident in eight years four 
involved fatalities the november crash was the nations worst 
commuter airline crash in 19 years only three of the 21 people 
aboard the twinengine commuter plane survived 
during the 2day hearing the fourmember ntsb panel has 
pointed out previous ryan air violations and wanted to know why the 
proposed 250000 fine for scores of record and flight violations 
was slashed to 16500 
ryan air has sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of federal bankruptcy laws its planes were grounded in january as 
part of a consent agreement with the faa ryan air had been 
alaskas largest commuter airline serving more than 80 cities and 
communities 
the 250000 fine was recommended by faa operations inspector 
lou gossen after he inspected ryan air 10 months before the crash 
boberick said gossen had calculated that ryan air should have a 
penalty equivalent to the loss of profit for 15 days but that he 
rejected the proposal because it was not a recognized method of 
calculating sanctions 
fines can range from 100 to 1000 for each violation boberick 
said a revised proposal following that guideline was then submitted 
to his office with the fine reduced to 25000 the lawyer said 
further review by his office lowered the fine to 16500 because 
some violations had been counted more than once and some were 
given the maximum fine when they should not have been 
gossen had considered prior infractions in figuring the 250000 
proposed fine but boberick said he had not been aware of earlier 
violations 
a final ntsb report on the november crash is expected later this 
year

california the day after protesters angry about the arrest and

american consumers are borrowing more but 
monthly repayments have not been growing more difficult at the same 
time 
this odd situation has developed for several reasons and the 
consequences of it are puzzling economists whose job it is to 
determine what the potential consequences could be 
here is the situation 
1 payback periods on installment loans have been extended thus 
reducing monthly repayments the extension of maturities which 
began during the high interest times of the 1970s is especially 
true in the automobile market 
2 interest rates today though considered high in relation to 
the 1960s are considerably lower than they were in the late 1970s 
you can buy more today without incurring higher monthly charges for 
interest 
3 home equity loans have been developed over the past few 
years allowing homeowners to buy almost any type of product on 
credit while enjoying a tax deduction 
moreover the interest costs on home equity loans is lower than 
rates on installment loans the credit lines are bigger too 
largely because of housing price inflation thus encouraging some 
buyers to go more deeply into debt 
the situation exists in spite of one factor that might have been 
expected to make the use of credit less attractive that is that 
only 40 percent of credit card interest is taxdeductible vs 100 
percent two years ago 
while the phasing out of this deduction has reduced the growth 
rate of creditcard debt to only 48 percent in 1987 versus 18 
percent annually from 1983 to 1986 many borrowers have simply 
switched to home equity loans 
the consequences of what many people feel is a tooeasy an 
attitude toward borrowing are difficult to determine 
clearly the use of credit does not instill fear in consumers as 
it did the during the highinterest period just a few years ago 
the monthly burden has been lessened and confidence in the future 
is bolstered by strong employment 
the sense of security that comes with a low unemployment rate is 
enhanced further by a liveable inflation rates and 
expectations of higher incomes that seem to be developing after 
several years of wage stability 
economic experience demonstrates however that the credit so 
easily handled now can easily become a burden in the future 
economic volatility is a fact of life the economic climate can 
change overnight as dramatic oil price hikes and declines 
since the early 1970s have demonstrated 
another troubling question is whether the longer repayment terms 
are merely putting off the day of reckoning how far into the 
future for example can a couple hope to extend their payments in 
order to lower the montly burden 
perhaps the most reassuring evidence comes from the federal 
reserve often considered an ogre on such matters the feds 1986 
survey of consumer finances which compared 1983 and 1986 
households showed 
1 a strong correlation between growth of debt payments and the 
growth of household income 
2 most households which were heavily in debt in 1983 were less 
so by 1986 a result of debt being paid down or growth of family 
income 
3 about 835 percent of all outstanding installment debt in 
1986 was matched by financial assets or home equity of greater 
value

robert campeau has visions of turning 
bloomingdales the star division of federated department stores 
inc into a national chain after he takes the retailer over 
there are fewer shopping centers being built these days but 
industry analysts say campeau can still accomplish his goal 
at a news conference in new york this past week campeau the 
chairman of the torontobased developer campeau corp said he 
wants to expand bloomingdales after he completes his acquisition 
of federated the new yorkbased chain one of the hottest names in 
retailing has 17 stores mostly in the east 
but with approximately 1500 large malls across the country 
those with more than 400000 square feet and at least two 
anchors or major stores the potential for expansion through 
new shopping malls is limited 
theyve just filled the country with the things said fred 
wintzer an analyst with the investment firm alex brown amp sons 
inc in baltimore there isnt room for a lot of malls 
in the heyday of mall construction in the early 1970s malls 
were being built at a rate of about 35 a year said john chapman 
research director of the international council of shopping centers 
a trade organization 
today thats down to about 25 a year he said 
demographics dictate how many malls will be built and where 
when the population of an area begins to swell mall developers 
begin to build 
during the boom in the oil patch in the late 1970s and early 
80s store chains expanded and malls were built in texas and 
oklahoma 
today the washington dc area is ripe for expansion wintzer 
said noting that two new malls are being constructed in mclean 
va right next to an existing center 
but in areas where there already are a number of malls a 
developer can still build as long as he constructs a dynamic 
exciting mall 
hes going to put up a much better mousetrap with better 
anchors to entice away business from more stodgy competitors 
wintzer said 
developers also are building in what wintzer called 
secondtier markets such as allentown pa or sheboygan 
wis which are smaller metropolitan areas 
thomas tashjian an analyst with the investment firm seidler 
amdec securities inc in los angeles cited california and texas 
despite the latters recent economic slump as other markets for 
new malls 
if campeau wants to open stores in those two states he likely 
would have to do so through new malls he has agreed to sell 
federateds bullocks stores in california and its foley division 
in texas 
campeau could use bloomingdales as an anchor in malls he might 
build but analysts say his ownership of stores like bloomingdales 
also will give campeau leverage in malls being planned by other 
developers 
bloomingdales would attract to a new mall the other retailers 
that a developer needs campeau might use his chain as a bargaining 
chip to get a piece of the action in another developers mall 
there also are ways for campeau to expand his chain without new 
malls 
he can take some of the space in existing department stores 
and renovate it into a bloomingdales said tashjian 
campeaus expected focus on a bloomingdales expansion reflects 
the fact that many department stores have little growth potential 
bloomingdales and stores like the seattlebased nordstrom chain 
are perceived as unique and different wintzer said but other 
department stores such as filenes in the northeast are not known 
outside of their region 
those kind of operators will have a difficult time moving into 
cities where they dont have a presence he said 
the campeau story was not the only retail takeover news this 
past week 
fw woolworth co the nations 11th largest retailer said it 
had been notified that dart group corp planned to buy a 
substantial amount of its stock analysts expect dart which has a 
string of unsuccessful takeover attempts behind it to make a bid 
for woolworth

wall street analysts are looking for good news 
on the dollar and international trade to put some fresh impetus 
into the stock markets early1988 rally 
such sustenance could come in the week ahead they say from a 
meeting of the socalled group of seven industrialized nations in 
washington or from the commerce departments monthly report on the 
us trade balance for february 
advance estimates call for the trade data to show continuing 
improvement from the record levels it reached last fall 
but even when stocks rose friday to new highs since the october 
crash the mood of many analysts and money managers remained 
subdued and unenthusiastic 
brokeragefirm analysts complain of a shortage of ideas or 
investment themes that stir up any interest among their customers 
stanley berge analyst at the firm of tucker anthony amp rl day 
inc describes current sentiment in the market as 10 percent 
longterm bulls 10 percent longterm bears and 80 percent 
somewhere in the middle 
much of the caution of course is the legacy of the crash last 
fall but some of its also may derive from memories of what 
happened in the markets at this time a year ago 
an inflation scare shot through the bond market sending 
interest rates sharply higher 
stockmarket investors couldnt shrug that off the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials after hitting a thenrecord high of 
2405 on april 6 fell to 2216 by may 20 
as it turned out that was nothing compared to the collapse that 
was coming later in the year still it remains in wall streeters 
memories as a period in which even some bigtime professional 
traders got badly burned 
it doesnt help now that bond traders are once again talking 
about the possibility of federal reserve credittightening to keep 
inflation at bay yields on longterm government bonds climbed from 
about 8 percent to the neighborhood of 8 percent in the past few 
weeks 
the atmosphere could improve many observers believe if the 
markets keep getting encouragement from the news on the dollar and 
foreign trade 
hopes on that score helped the dow jones industrial average 
climb 10213 points to a postcrash closing high of 209019 in the 
past week 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 543 to 15203 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 719 to 
38183 and the american stock exchange market value index 406 to 
30049 
volume on the big board remained subdued however averaging 
17089 million shares a day against 14680 million in the 
holidayshortened previous week 
in the view of michael sherman analyst at shearson lehman 
hutton inc the stock market has fared pretty well lately given 
the circumstances 
the markets ability to shake off periodic plunges and to 
internalize problems in the bond market is a healthy sign he 
argues 
since we believe that the economy is continuing to grow at a 
moderate pace with further increases in profits to be expected and 
since we believe that the problems in the bond market are not 
severe we think there is still a good chance that stocks will work 
significantly higher by the middle of the year 
one risk to this forecast sherman acknowledged would be an 
unpleasant surprise on the trade deficit 
we expect it to continue to improve he said but that 
remains a key variable although we dont anticipate a major and 
continuing deterioration in the trade deficit from this level such 
an eventuality would be negative

could the bond market invigorated by an 
impressive rebound this past week be in for a nasty replay of last 
years april disaster 
now as then the dollar is the key 
bond prices had been depressed early in the week in response to 
the governments latest report on unemployment which showed 
another drop in the jobless rate in march 
strong economic news is often read as a negative signal by bond 
traders because it portends a jump in inflation which would dilute 
the value of fixedrate investments 
but by weeks end bond prices had rebounded as the dollar 
stabilized in foreignexchange trading and inflation fears subsided 
the yield on the treasurys closelywatched 30year bond up as 
high as 890 percent on monday settled back to the 875 percent 
range where it had finished the previous week 
the yield on the long bond moves inversely to its price 
the battered dollar was lifted by reports that finance ministers 
of the seven major industrialized countries would seek to stabilize 
the us currency at a meeting this coming week in washington dc 
the dollar is monitored by the credit markets as a sign of where 
inflation might be headed a falling dollar raises the prospect of 
importled inflation as well as the possibility that foreign 
investors may not expand dollardenominated holdings 
last april the dollars steep decline hammered bond prices 
catapulting the yield on the long bond from 781 percent on march 
31 to 870 percent on april 24 its highest level since february 
1986 
that agonizing april cost brokerage firms around 650 million in 
trading losses on bonds reckons perrin long a securities industry 
analyst for lipper analytical services inc bond traders called it 
a month of bloody mondays 
hardest hit was the sprawling less liquid municipal market 
prices there fell sharply as nervous investors rushed to redeem 
their mutual fund shares 
a year later the precarious nature of the dollars recovery has 
traders wondering if history could repeat itself this april 
theres this lurking negativism said william v sullivan 
director of moneymarket research for dean witter reynolds inc 
if the dollar continues to weaken it is the problem for the bond 
market this april as well 
the dollars firmness could soon be tested if the industrial 
powers that comprise the group of seven the united states 
britian france italy west germany japan and canada fail to 
provide fresh support for the us currency 
in addition to the upcoming meeting of the g7 finance 
ministers the markets will have to digest another us merchandise 
trade report due out thursday if report shows a lack of 
improvement in the us trading deficit in february the dollar and 
bonds could come under renewed pressure 
the dollar has been pushed down in recent months by negative 
news on the trade deficit which has indicated to traders that the 
currency might have to fall further in order for us exports to be 
sufficiently competitive 
the february trade figures and the parley of the group of seven 
may well seal the bond markets fate for this april

an additional 500000 metric tons of us 
wheat has been sold to the soviet union at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said friday 
the sale equal to about 184 million bushels was handled by 
the peavey co 300000 tons cargill inc 50000 artfer inc 
50000 garnac grain co inc 50000 and louis dryfus corp 
50000 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the grain was sold under terms 
of the longterm grain agreement between the united states and the 
soviet union 
sims said the subsidies averaged 2161 per ton or about 59 
cents per bushel of wheat 
no selling prices were announced but wheat has been averaging 
about 272 per bushel recently according to the usda that could 
mean a farm value of about 50 million 
the pact which expires sept 30 calls on moscow to buy at 
least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that the 
purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
if more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year the soviets 
are required to seek us approval the soviets were given approval 
to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans 
so far the soviets have bought more than 85 million tons of 
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year as well as 41 
million tons of nonsubsidized corn 818400 tons of us soybeans 
and 13 million tons of soybean meal 
subsidies are provided under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep private exporters are given surplus commodities 
owned by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
the subsidies or bonuses have run between less than 20 to 
more than 40 per ton roughly 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
sims said the soviets have more than 510000 tons remaining in 
their current eep authorization an additional 1 million tons were 
announced on april 4 plus some left over from earlier 
authorizations

the us government ruled friday that 
japanesemade forklift trucks are being exported to this country at 
less than fair value a major step toward ordering steep 
antidumping duties on the vehicles 
us customs will be instructed to collect antidumping duties 
ranging from 14 to nearly 57 percent if the us international 
trade commission determines in the next 45 days that the japanese 
imports threaten material injury to domestic industry a commerce 
department announcement said 
fridays ruling came in response to a yearold petition by an 
american forklift manufacturer the hyster co of portland oregon 
four of its labor unions and other employees aimed at halting 
alleged dumping of underpriced japanese vehicles 
itc hearings on the dispute have been scheduled in washington 
next wednesday with the final ruling expected in late may on 
antidumping duties on forklift truck imports that in 1987 reached 
245 million dollars 
us law provides for antidumping duties on imports with an 
unfair price advantage over comparable americanmade products 
unfairness is established by the degree to which the vehicles were 
sold in this country at prices less than those in their home 
market said commerce department spokesman john thomas 
the department listed percentages for major japanese forklift 
makers representing both the amount of alleged underpricing and the 
level of duty to be collected they included toyota 1719 percent 
nissan 5133 komatsu forklift co 4773 sumitomoyale 5133 
toyoumpanki 5133 sanki industrial 1365 and kasagi forklift 
5681 all other makers would be assessed 395 percent 
william h kilkenny chairman of the hyster firm said in a 
statement we are encouraged that the department of commerce has 
confirmed our view of the unfair pricing practices of japanese lift 
truck producers we are hopeful that the international trade 
commission will now make a similar determination that will restore 
fair market conditions

fears about a career crash in the 
aftermath of black monday have abated at leading graduate business 
schools but many students are shying away from wall street in 
favor of other positions ranging from consulting to property 
development delegates to an annual conference say 
for me real estate management was the way to go and it became 
even more attractive after the market crash said david marino a 
24yearold student at the university of california graduate 
business school 
marino was one of 120 student delegates from nearly 30 of the 
nations top business schools attending the threeday conference 
that began friday at northwestern universitys jl kellogg 
graduate school of management in evanston a stately community on 
lake michigan just north of chicago 
the theme of the conference sponsored by nabisco brands inc 
was the outlook for the service industry but against a background 
of economic uncertainty raised by the oct 19 stock collapse 
career paths was an unofficial discussion topic 
at the opening of the conference the kellogg school released a 
survey of delegates that showed the crash generally had not 
affected their career plans the survey also showed nearly half 
intend to pursue finance or consulting jobs upon graduation others 
said they would go into high technology advertising and 
entertainment industries a few chose careers in nonprofit 
businesses 
i never felt threatened by the stock crash but there were a 
lot of people worried said james depina a 27yearold 
university of michigan delegate who has accepted a summer position 
at the bank of boston 
students said many wall street firms which historically have 
been heavy hirers at leading business schools still visited 
campuses this year but the number of recruits had shrunk 
in october there was strict panic said kelly kay a 
28yearold student at the university of southern californias 
graduate business school 
the shock has settled somewhat said kay but he has 
accepted a healthcare consulting job upon graduation 
others said the allure of investment banking renowned for its 
grinding hours and high pay had faded at many schools replaced by 
management consulting and accounting careers which also offer 
lucrative starting salaries ranging from 50000 to 100000 
consulting is the rage now the growth in consulting is 
explosive and it pays incredibly well said dartmouth student red 
barrett who has accepted a position at bostons fidelity 
investment management mutual fund company upon graduation 
but barrett an english major who worked at a small wall street 
firm before going to business school expressed mild concern about 
his choice partly because fidelity announced postcrash layoffs 
earlier this year 
when i looked at the headline about fidelity i said oh boy 
is this a mistake barrett said though he noted that most of 
the layoffs affected clerical staff hired during the companys 
precrash boom 
conference events ranged from panel discussions by leading 
members of the service industry to worshops on marketing one of 
kelloggs biggest strengths delegates from stanford university 
planned to show a 20minute video they produced on business ethics 
another emerging curriculum item in business schools in the wake of 
the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
james p gorter a partner at goldman sachs amp co and one of 
the conference speakers said a large number of students had 
declined offers from the firm this year although the firms 
recruiting needs had declined 
he speculated part of the reason was the tainted image of 
investment banking in general caused partly by boesky and 
coconspirator dennis levine 
some students saw the bloom was off the rose and got into 
consulting gorter said but im not sure thats the right way 
to go 
mark sheridan a 28yearold cornell delegate who pursued a 
double engineeringbusiness degree said he believed a good part of 
his class had pegged hopes on wall street careers before the crash 
you see a lot of chameleons out there sheridan said 
suddenly theyre all into consulting 
some students said the crash indirectly affected their career 
plans because of personal stock holdings which declined sharply in 
value 
i had some equity investments financing my businessschool 
education said bryce hausmann jr a 30yearold delegate from 
the university of washington asked how he managed after the crash 
hausmann said i went into the debt market i took out a student 
loan
