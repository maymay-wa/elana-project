a federal jury awarded 10 million friday to a 
northern virginia child who suffered irreversible brain damage 
during birth 
the fourman twowoman us district court jury decided on the 
award after hearing testimony that three doctors named in the case 
did not act quickly when tests indicated the babys heart rate was 
slowing 
jack olender attorney for 3yearold edward leahy jr said he 
believed it was the largest medical malpractice award ever in the 
district of columbia 
olender said obstetricians richard newman julian safran and 
stephen horwitz performed an emergency caesarian section delivery 
about four hours after problems were first noticed 
the operation was not conducted in time to prevent the child 
from suffering irreversible brain damage olender said 
hes unable to walk talk or feed himself said olender 
everything has to be done for him 
the judgment is about 6 million dollars greater than the 
malpractice insurance policy held by the doctors who are in 
partnership 
the childs parents edward r and patricia leahy of mclean 
va will receive no compensation in the award olender said 
instead the money will be placed in a trust fund under court 
approval and used for the childs care 
attorneys for the doctors did not say whether an appeal of the 
verdict or award is planned 
problems in the birth arose around 4 am on dec 11 1984 when 
an electronic fetal monitor indicated that the childs heart rate 
was slowing olender told the court 
in such cases a declining heart rate often indicates a shortage 
of oxygen usually resulting from a pinching of the umbilical cord 
and emergency caesarian section deliveries are usually performed as 
soon as the problem is discovered olender asserted 
the emergency operation did not take place until 915 am 
columbia hospital for women the washington dc hospital 
where the birth took place originally was named in the suit but 
was dropped from the case when it agreed to pay 800000 in a 
settlement

a publisher convicted in a retrial of maliciously 
publishing statements denying the holocaust was sentenced friday to 
nine months in jail 
ernst zundel 49 arrived at the district courthouse bearing a 
small coffin inscribed with the words free speech is dead 
after his 1985 conviction he went to his sentencing carring a 
heavy wooden cross also signifying the demise of freedom of speech 
in canada 
as in his earlier conviction zundel is seeking to appeal his 
sentence and jury conviction and has applied for bail to keep him 
out of jail at least until his appeal can be considered but he had 
to start the weekend behind bars awaiting a bail decision 
the west german immigrant won his first appeal and was granted a 
new trial in district court that ended in the second conviction 
zundel who operates samisdat publishers in toronto was charged 
under a law forbidding publication of statements known to be false 
or likely to cause injury or mischief to the public interest 
zundel was charged with publishing a booklet which he did not 
write that denies official accounts of nazis exterminating jews 
in wartime prison camps the booklet says the horror stories about 
the holocaust were all a hoax and a fraudulent scheme by zionists 
to extract financial reparation from postwar germany 
however judge ronald thomas took judicial notice of the 
holocaust at the beginning of the trial recognizing it as a 
historical fact from then on zundels essential defense was that 
he honestly believed the contents of the pamphlet and was not 
knowingly spreading false news as the charge alleged 
jewish leaders were happy with the verdict saying it would 
serve to protect ethnic minorities from social intolerance 
the canadian jewish congress said it demonstrates that 
canadians will not tolerate the vilification of ethnological 
communities 
it reaffirms the effectiveness of the criminal code in 
upholding social and racial harmony group officials said 
bnai brith canada expressed confidence the outcome will 
serve to deter hatemongers no matter who their targets may be 
from pursuing their aim of dividing canadian society and turning 
some of us against our fellow citizens

of the apartment he shares with his wife three daughters and 
78yearold motherinlaw when police arrived outside his door 
seven or eight members of the threedepartment southern alameda

the face said the officers grabbed his wife jung ja kim

a divorced man who defied a principals 
prohibition against escorting a high school student to her prom was 
promptly arrested on trespassing charges after arriving with his 
date friday 
troy cripps iii dressed in a black tuxedo was taken into 
custody at the dekalb county high school prom after arriving with 
18yearold tammy sliger said dekalb county sheriffs deputy steve 
johnson 
cripps 23 was freed on 250 bond johnson said he was 
scheduled to appear in court may 25 
circuit court judge john maddux had ruled earlier friday that 
the school board and principal ernest ray could bar cripps from 
escorting sliger to the dance 
ray had barred four divorced men from the prom after receiving 
an anonymous letter threatening trouble if they were allowed to 
attend said school superintendent aubrey turner 
we felt that it was probably from one of the divorced wives 
saying they didnt feel the school should let this type of thing 
occur he said there was a threat as far as just causing a 
disturbance 
sliger and laura lea cooper 17 asked the court for a 
restraining order arguing that that school officials were 
discriminating against their dates because of age and marital 
status said carolyn todd sligers mother 
shes just crushed and her feelings were hurt so bad mrs 
todd said after the court ruling 
turner conceded that the fact that the four men were divorced 
may have disturbed some school officials 
i cant say that that wasnt a factor that might be a 
secondary factor because that gets into morals he said the 
primary factor was that there might be some problems we have to 
ensure a safe environment for their prom 
mrs todd said that divorced people had been allowed to attend 
the prom in the past and that school officials overreacted to the 
anonymous letter 
if they can keep people from going to the prom then they can 
keep people who write a threatening letter from coming into the 
prom she said

the internal revenue service is promising that 
next years tax returns will be a little easier to understand 
thanks in part to a handful of college students 
the students working through the university of akrons center 
for taxation studies told a senate subcommittee earlier this year 
that tax forms and the instructions for filling them out can be 
made simpler they took their recommendations to the irs friday and 
the irs was impressed 
we intend to look at the result of their wrestling with the 
instructions of our wrestling and then use the best of both 
said arthur altman chairman of the agencys forms committee 
its a friendly effort he added theres going to be good 
come out of it 
nicholas creme director of the taxation center in northeast 
ohio agreed the 1040ez and the 1040a should be a lot easier and 
understandable come next january he said 
students at the center who help lowincome taxpayers facing irs 
penalties were spurred on by a study showing that more than half 
of americans cannot understand the instructions for the simplest 
tax form the 1040ez 
they tackled first the instructions for the 1040ez and the 
1040a and presented these recommendations friday by july 1 they 
hope to complete their proposed revisions of those two tax forms 
later they want to rewrite thusands of pages of tax regulations 
and publications that are used by lawyers and other tax 
professionals 
altman and leaders of the student effort met for more than an 
hour friday its a terrific experience to work with folks 
outside our organization and give them an opportunity to stand in 
our shoes altman said he acknowledged however that we still 
have a long way to go 
john nye an akron law student praised the irs for its interest 
in the effort many people dont realize the problems of taking 
new tax laws and converting them into readable instructions he 
said were interested in getting a real good product for the 
taxpayers 
mary ray a carnegiemellon university graduate student who is 
serving as design consultant for the project called it the type 
of work we live for to take a document and see what it really 
means what the people really need to know 
the bulk of the suggestions for cleaning up the tax instructions 
dealt with format and layout 
one of the key suggestions was that a final checklist be 
included in the instructions since the irs acknowledges that most 
penalties are imposed because of mathematical errors another urged 
that the instructions be written alongside the tax forms another 
called for fewer words and more white space on each page 
the students also urged that the tone of the instructions be 
made more friendly by generous use of the word please they 
called for elimination of most of the multisyllable words and of 
double and triple negatives 
as an example of how the wording can be cleaned up the students 
pointed to a sentence in the instructions aimed at taxpayers who 
dont get homedelivered mail 
the instructions now read if your post office does not 
deliver mail to your street address and you have a post office box 
enter your post office box number on the line for your personal 
home address instead of your street address 
the students suggestion if your mail is not delivered to 
your home and you have a post office box number put that number 
in the place of your street address

the lawyer for a woman convicted of poisoning two 
people with cyanide said he wants a mistrial after a juror admitted 
settling an unrelated product contamination lawsuit shortly before 
the trial began 
us district judge william dwyer questioned jurors friday about 
whether they were improperly influenced during deliberations in the 
nations first deathbyproducttampering trial 
most of the questioning was directed at juror laurel holliday 
who has acknowledged being the lone holdout for stella nickells 
acquittal before switching her vote to guilty on monday the fifth 
day of deliberation 
mrs nickell 44 of auburn was convicted of five counts of 
contaminating overthecounter medicine capsules with cyanide they 
included two counts of spiking the excedrin capsules that killed 
her husband bruce nickell 52 and susan katherine snow 40 of 
auburn in june 1986 
she faces possible life imprisonment at a june 17 sentencing 
prosecutors said she killed her husband to collect 176000 in life 
insurance 
before a verdict was reached ms holliday told dwyer she had 
received an anonymous phone call the previous friday telling her 
mrs nickell had failed an fbi lie detector test that information 
was inadmissible at trial 
after the verdict it was revealed ms holliday had filed a 
lawsuit of her own last year in a contaminated product incident 
but had not mentioned that fact during jury selection 
ms holliday sued pepperidge farm inc after she bit into a 
goldfish cracker in july 1986 that she said contained an 
aspirinsubstitute pill the matter was settled out of court for 
500 less than two months prior to ms hollidays selection for 
mrs nickells jury 
ms holliday told dwyer she dismissed the anonymous call from 
her mind and judged the case on the facts she also said she did 
not mention her own lawsuit during jury selection because she did 
not think it was relevant 
ms holliday also said friday that during the trial she had 
talked with friends about writing an article about her jury 
experiences but did not discuss facts of the case 
after the unusual session friday defense lawyer thomas hillier 
said he would file a mistrial motion within a week 
the testimony of juror holliday raised very serious and 
troubling questions on her ability to sit on this jury hillier 
said 
ms hollidays failure to reveal her own suit kept lawyers from 
questioning her about that fact hillier said further he said 
there was no way to verify her statements that the phone call had 
no effect on her decision 
federal prosecutor joanne maida declined to comment

known dead and said 53 people were injured 
gilberto sanchez radio officer at police headquarters said 
about 60 soldiers from the army garrison joined firefighters 
police and volunteers in the rescue effort bulldozers and cranes 
were brought from as far away as salamanca 78 miles to the 
southwest 
aguascalientes a city of about 500000 people 320 miles 
northwest of mexico city is the capital of aguascalientes state 
by late friday two or three people were believed still trapped 
in the rubble celia de la torre a state government spokeswoman 
said 
juan diaz head of special services for the local red cross 
said hundreds of people came to help in the rescue 
at least 116 workers were in the building when the four upper 
stories collapsed said diaz reached by telephone from mexico city 
relatives of the victims practically attacked the ambulances 
trying to identify the victims he said 
the building still under construction consisted of three 
basements a main floor and three upper stories 
as workers were about to pour the last concrete late thursday 
afternoon it collapsed onto a furniture factory that occupied the 
ground floor and part of the basement area 
lower floors of buildings in mexico often are occupied while the 
upper stories are constructed 
roberto padilla an aguascalientes state government spokesman 
said the state attorney generals office was investigating the 
collapse of the building which was three blocks from the main 
plaza and the state capitol 
jorge castaneda head of the aguascalientes civil engineers 
association said a committee of engineers and architects also 
would investigate 
juan navarro a police duty officer said by telephone they 
were apparently pouring fresh concrete when it caved in apparently 
the building did not resist the weight 
juan flores a survivor who was buried for five hours was 
quoted by the excelsior news agency as saying 
i had finished working and was about to leave when all of 
a sudden everyone started yelling hysterically that there was an 
earthquake i dashed under a table and all of a sudden everything 
went dark and there was this terrific noise and there was dust 
everywhere 
he said a slab of concrete fell on the table and that is what 
protected me from the rest of the debris 
flores said he was quiet at first but the fear and the 
anguish of being buried impelled me to yell very loud and the 
rescue squads dug me out earlier friday the red cross had 
reported 18 killed and 96 injured 
juan manuel diaz the red cross duty officer at aguascalientes 
said there had been confusion about reports from the scene he did

the senate has joined the house in ordering 
the pentagon to jump into the war on drugs even though lawmakers 
say the plan wont solve americas illicit drug problems 
i think we all know the drug epidemic in this country is far 
past the stage where interdiction can stop it said sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan agreed noting that 
ordering the military to help shows that were serious about 
drugs but i dont think anybodys certain how much impact 
this will have 
dole and nunn were among the supporters friday night as the 
senate voted 836 to order the military to join the antidrug war 
including having navy officers arrest suspected drug traffickers 
who are stopped by us warships in international waters 
the plan was tacked on as an amendment to a pentagon budget 
bill which the senate is likely to approve early next week 
senate passage will send the measure to a housesenate 
conference committee to be reconciled with the different pentagon 
budget bill passed wednesday by the house 
that measure includes an even stronger antidrug package 
ordering president reagan to have the military seal us borders 
against drug traffickers 
senators trying to fashion an antidrug plan for the military 
had spent three days working out the details with the arrest 
provisions being the chief stumbling block 
the military is prohibited from enforcing civilian laws by 
tradition and by the 1878 posse comitatus act but that law is in 
force only within the united states and its territorial waters and 
the navy arrest powers would be outside that jurisdiction 
sen john glenn dohio voted against the plan and criticized 
his colleagues for voting in a great hysteria 
were posturing on this glenn said we all get up 
posture make our little statements and it isnt going to make any 
difference this is not the mission for the military 
military officials have generally opposed the plan arguing that 
military personnel are trained differently than civilian law 
enforcement officials and noting that traditionally there has been 
a firm line drawn between civilian and military law enforcement 
but defense secretary frank c carlucci worked on the plan with 
the senators and reagan approved it before the senate voted dole 
and other senators noted 
sen pete wilson rcalif said he had originally opposed using 
the military to fight drugs but changed his mind because the 
drug flow has reached flood tide we cannot ignore 
in other action on the bill friday the senate

business leaders and reagan 
administration officials are betting that democrats have worked too 
hard to fashion trade legislation to scuttle it after president 
reagans expected veto 
members of congress have put a great deal of work in this 
legislation and my judgment is that these persons will not wish to 
see the bill disappear us trade representative clayton k 
yeutter said friday they have a great deal of time effort 
energy and creativity invested in this piece of legislation 
yeutter said he expected the president to deliver his veto 
message to congress next week but he said he was optimistic about 
it not meaning the end of the threeyear effort to write the trade 
bill 
although not specifically mentioning house speaker jim wright 
dtexas by name yeutter noted that a provision repealing the 
windfall oil profits tax is dear to the hearts of texas legislators 
i suspect it will be particularly difficult for them to 
explain to texas constituents that they were willing to drop a 
piece of legislation so important to the state of texas he said 
yeutter spoke with reporters after addressing a private session 
of the business council 
composed of 61 chief executives of the nations largest 
corporations the council meets twice a year at the homestead a 
posh resort in the mountains of southwestern virginia 
reagan is vetoing the massive trade bill because of a provision 
that would require companies to give 60 days notice of plant 
closings and major layoffs 
the administration supports much of the 1000page bill but 
objects to the plantclosing provision which yeutter called 
onerous 
yeutter said the technical language of the provision would 
provide a field day for lawyers and a nightmare for american 
businessmen by providing a legal basis for challenging virtually 
every plant closing or layoff 
american express co chairman james d robinson iii one of the 
executives attending the retreat ending today acknowledged that a 
veto of the trade bill risked losing very constructive 
legislation but he said the business community is prepared to 
take that risk 
its been called simple plantclosing legislation well its 
10 sections and 56 subsections and inconsistent language he said 
the business executives in an economic report issued at the 
start of their conference predicted that last years record trade 
deficit of 1712 billion would drop below 150 billion this year 
but the forecast which reflects a consensus of the member 
companies chief economists said the reduction would not be enough 
to stem the fall of the dollar 
it said the dollar which has lost about half of its value 
against the japanese yen in two years would fall from its present 
level of 125 yen to about 115 yen by the end of 1989 
john s reed chairman of citicorp the nations largest bank 
holding company said a substantial improvement in the trade 
deficit was iminent because of the devalued dollar 
a weaker dollar improves us export prospects by lower the cost 
of us goods overseas 
there is a price at which the trade balance will turn around 
and most of us think were pretty close to it reed said 
generally the executives forecast painted a rosy picture of 
moderate economic growth manageable inflation and low unemployment 
it said growth as measured by the gross national product would 
be 24 percent this year down from 38 percent last year 
inflation of consumer prices was expected to be 39 percent this 
year down from 44 percent in 1987 unemployment now at 54 
percent should remain under 6 percent through 1989 the executives 
said

a big question for farmers is whether the 
general recovery in us agriculture will continue long enough for 
them to pull out of the financial mire that has gripped many since 
the early 1980s 
the agriculture department isnt making flat predictions about 
that but one of its economists says general economic conditions 
are not expected to make or break the us agricultural sector 
during the next 18 months 
ralph monaco of the departments economic research service says 
the next year and a half will be one of those periods when 
macroeconomic factors arent likely to set the course for the 
nations farmers 
by contrast the financial crunch on farmers in the early 80s 
sprang largely from events over which they had no control a 
worldwide recession a rise in the value of the us dollar against 
foreign currencies and high interest rates 
for the last couple of years however the farm outlook has 
improved dramatically overall and in 1987 usda says the net cash 
income of farmers was at a record level of 57 billion this years 
forecast is down perhaps in the range of 50 billion to 55 
billion because of higher production costs and a reduction in 
federal payments 
but monaco whose assessment was reported in this months 
farmline magazine says he is optimistic about the us economy in 
general and that he expects a replay of 1987 conditions 
for the next year and a half monaco thinks the real growth of 
the us economy will be about 3 percent a year inflation will not 
accelerate significantly remaining at 35 percent to 4 percent 
annually interest rates will be relatively stable and 
unemployment will continue its slow decline 
some other monacos observations 
both the federal budget deficit and the us trade deficit 
should continue to improve the budget deficit dropped to 150 
billion in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 from 221 
billion in 1986 the trade deficit improved in real terms by 10 
billion last year the first substantial gain since 1980 
exports of both agricultural and nonagricultural products are 
likely to continue gaining in 1988 a key factor has been the 
decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies 
which makes it cheaper to buy us products 
the improved exports and business investment should continue to 
drive the current us economic expansion now in its sixth 
straight year in the 198386 period however the economy was led 
by consumer and government spending 
real growth as measured by the nations gross national 
product or gnp has done well since 1982 the last recession year 
averaging a gain of 31 percent a year 
in general positive signs seem to prevail over recent 
concerns about deficits and stock market volatility monaco said 
but he added prospects for the rest of the world are less 
favorable than for this country low export earnings and high debts 
are still a serious problem for many developing countries and 
economic growth remains uneven around the world

farmers are hiring more workers this spring 
and they are paying more for them according to an agriculture 
department survey 
the department said friday that its survey last month indicated 
958000 hired workers were employed by farmers compared with 
885000 in the comparable period of april 1987 
those did not include 224000 agricultural service workers 
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors those were up from 
188000 a year earlier the report said 
field work was hampered in some parts of the country by rain and 
wet ground when the survey was taken during the week of april 
1016 the report said but corn planting was getting under way in 
most major production states and was about 6 percent completed by 
the end of the week 
planting of cotton spring wheat and other crops also took place 
during the week surveyed 
lettuce harvest was just beginning in salinas calif and was 
very active in the san joaquin valley the report said harvest 
of cantaloups watermelons and honeydew melons progressed well in 
arizona floridas valencia orange harvest continued and 
grapefruit movement was strong 
the report said the national figures for hired workers had a 
sampling error of 45 percent 
average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was 5 per 
hour up from 490 a year earlier the report said 
for those workers provided by contractors there was no national 
wage rate available however workers in california averaged 568 
per hour down from 615 a year ago while those in florida 
received an average of 615 per hour in april up from 585 a 
year ago the report said

composers from china and taiwan will meet in new 
york in august in the first largescale conference supported by 
professional arts organizations from the two rival governments 
organizers say 
in a release received in beijing today the center for 
uschina arts exchange at columbia university said 10 composers 
each from china and taiwan will take part in the aug 614 
conference on tradition and the future of chinese music 
center director chou wenchung said the 1987 relaxation of 
restrictions on taiwan residents visiting mainland china 
contributed to a growing interest in cultural and educational 
exchanges 
because the center is in touch with artists in both places we 
were aware that this moment offered an extraordinary opportunity 
he said 
chou said he hoped the conference would lead to greater cultural 
cooperation and contact in the arts between china and taiwan 
the nationalist government on taiwan has rejected all proposals 
by beijing for direct trade and cultural contacts however 
taipeis decision last year to let residents visit the mainland led 
to a sharp increase in contacts between people on both sides of the 
taiwan strait 
the release said consultants who will help choose the conference 
participants include hsu tsanghouei chairman of the chinese 
composers league in taiwan and wu zuqiang secretarygeneral of 
the china federation of literary and arts circles 
the center is the only us agency dedicated solely to cultural 
exchange with china it brought arthur millers death of a 
salesman to china and was behind the academy awardwinning film 
from mao to mozart isaac stern in china

trade legislation passed by congress could 
cost the united states thousands of jobs in the nations nearly 
10000 importedauto dealerships their trade association says 
the massive american imported automobile market is going to be 
held hostage said robert mcelwaine president of the american 
international automobile dealers association at a news conference 
friday 
the 40 billionayear imported automobile industry is a likely 
target if the united states move to restrict imports in a trade 
dispute mcelwaine said 
we are the first target for retaliation he said we are 
such a huge target not only is there a large volume of product it 
is such an expensive product and there is a large amount of money 
involved 
president reagan has vowed to veto the trade bill because of a 
provision requiring advance notice of plant closings 
should reagan veto the bill congress would be in a better 
position next year to write less damaging trade legislation 
mcelwaine said 
by next year according to our calculations the trade deficit 
will have been drastically reduced the export wave will be at full 
flood and americas prosperous economy will be so 
exportdependent that few would be willing to risk derailing the 
economy with an illadvised trade bill mcelwaine said 
mcelwaine said the danger to his industry comes from provisions 
designed to encourage the executive branch to retaliate against 
nations restricting us access to their markets 
i think it would cause us damage mcelwaine said 
restrictions on imports of koreas hyundai cars alone could 
potentially cost 15000 jobs at dealerships mcelwaine said

the government is lifting controls on most art 
troupes and will let individuals organize their own performing 
groups the official china daily reported today 
the daily quoted culture minister wang meng as saying staterun 
art troupes will be replaced with a system that will permit free 
and open competition among troupes performers will be allowed to 
set their own box office prices and decide their own programs as 
long as they are licensed and do not violate state laws and 
regulations 
wang said the reforms are designed to stimulate the professional 
enthusiam of the 200000 people working in the nations 3094 art 
troupes 
he said many staterun troupes where lifetime employment 
prevails are overstaffed especially with those who are old and in 
poor health 
wang said the state will continue to run a small number of the 
countrys best troupes or those needing special state support 
among those are new experimental groups and groups in ethnic 
minority areas 
wang said staterun troupes will also adopt a new salary system 
with outstanding performers receiving better pay than those with 
mediocre skills or past their prime 
the states decision to give up its monopoly over the arts has 
drawn some criticism in the official press with artists being 
quoted as saying many traditional chinese and minority musical 
dance and opera troupes are doomed by the survival of the 
fittest policy 
concern has also been raised that troupes forced to pay their 
own way will turn to sex violence and superstition to draw 
audiences

senate leaders appear satisfied enough with 
verification measures worked out in geneva to open debate next week 
on the ussoviet mediumrange missile treaty 
but majority leader robert c byrd dwva said he will not 
formally schedule that debate until three senate committees hold 
hearings and approve the agreement 
i want to hear what the chairmen and ranking republican 
members of these committees have to say following these hearings 
byrd said they are the experts in this field 
some senators said there is now at least a chance the senate 
will consent to the ratification of the treaty by the time 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev convene 
their moscow summit on may 29 
secretary of state george p shultz is set to testify before the 
foreign relations committee on monday afternoon on the agreement he 
reached this week in geneva with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze the armed services and intelligence committees 
announced they will hold a joint private meeting late monday 
afternoon 
following a 90minute luncheon briefing friday by white house 
national security adviser colin powell byrd said he and other 
senate leaders were told the agreement removes a roadblock and is a 
forward step 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas quoted powell as 
saying byrds decision last week to postpone senate action on the 
treaty did make a difference in geneva 
negotiators addressed concerns in the senate that the soviets 
were backing away from effective implementation of the onsite 
inspection provisions of the treaty 
other senators who attended the briefing also said the results 
of the geneva talks seem constructive 
im optimistic we can move ahead said sen claiborne pell 
dri chairman of the foreign relations committee 
i think at this moment there is more optimism for the passage 
of this treaty than at at any other time during this long 
process said sen john warner rva the ranking gop member of 
the armed services committee 
warner said the soviets changed their position to meet us 
objections on every issue that was raised 
reagan and gorbachev signed the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty providing for the total elimination of us and 
soviet midrange missiles at their washington summit last december 
sen sam nunn dga the armed services chairman said he now 
hopes that the treaty can be ratified in the 15 days that remain

the deaths of 10 bald eagles that 
apparently ate illegally poisoned animal carcasses threaten the 
comeback of the endangered birds in the chesapeake bay area 
federal officials said 
while our national symbol is making a recovery it cannot 
sustain this rate of loss month after month nor will we tolerate 
it said frank dunkle director of the us fish and wildlife 
service 
five dead eagles one adult and four immature bald eagles were 
found may 3 in a field near the carcasses of three raccoons a deer 
and a vulture five others were found elsewhere in dorchester 
county between march 12 and may 1 including the blackwater 
national wildlife refuge near cambridge 
the birds are not in danger of becoming extinct because of 
illegal poisoning of animals but the deaths resulting will have 
some impact on their recovery because the deaths are occurring in 
an area where we have a large amount of bald eagles glenn d 
therres the nongame and endangered species program manager for 
the maryland forest park and wildlife service 
state and federal officials said they are particularly concerned 
because the county has the greatest concentration of bald eagles in 
the chesapeake bay area the eagle population devastated by the 
use of the pesticide ddt in the 1950s and 1960s had been restored 
to its highest levels on the east coast 
officials are testing tissue from the dead eagles and the 
carcasses for chemicals results are expected in several weeks but 
because the eagles had been dead at least a month before they were 
found such analyses can be difficult said inez connor a 
spokeswoman for the fish and wildlife service in newton corner 
mass 
the fact there has been a carcass near all of the eagles we 
have found leads us to think that they died as a result of eating 
poisoned animals ms connor said criminal charges could be 
brought against anyone found to be poisoning animals bald eagles 
are protected under federal law

independent counsel lawrence e walsh says the 
justice department has the final word on whether certain classified 
material can be used in the irancontra trial of oliver north and 
three codefendants 
that concession could enable the department to scuttle the 
prosecution of the fired national security council aide former 
national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
richard v secord and albert hakim 
in a legal memorandum filed in the case walsh said he must be 
deferential to the executives determination as to whether national 
security concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classified 
information 
walsh has amassed 50000 classified government documents that 
may be relevant to the prosecution of charges that hakim north 
poindexter and secord conspired to illegally divert to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels the profits from sales of us arms to 
iran 
another 250000 secret documents may contain information 
relevant to the defense of the case 
by walshs description the most sensitive 5 percent to 10 
percent of the documents contain secrets about us intelligence 
and military operations and sensitive foreign policy initiatives 
under the classified information procedures act cipa the 
attorney general must certify to the court that disclosure of 
certain documents as evidence in court would endanger national 
security the law provides for substitution of summaries of the 
documents or statements of what the evidence would prove if 
revealed in open court 
the court has the power to dismiss criminal cases if too much 
evidence is withheld 
us district judge gerhard a gesell has warned that he would 
dismiss charges if relevant secret documents are not declassified 
for use at the trial as evidence 
gesell also has expressed an unwillingness to spend a lot of 
time rewriting classified documents so that they could be presented 
as evidence in a public trial 
he has given walsh until june 10 to submit a list of documents 
the independent counsel wants to use as prosecution evidence that 
wont be declassified 
the legal memorandum from walsh to gesell was filed in response 
to a question about the issue that the judge posed during a may 6 
hearing 
walsh said it is an inherent function of the executive branch 
to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive national security 
information to the extent necessary to permit the government to 
conduct its foreign affairs and national defense activities 
effectively 
neither the independent counsel statute nor the regulation 
purports to confer upon independent counsel any general power of 
declassification 
attorney general edwin meese iii who has been questioned 
repeatedly by the irancontra grand jury about his november 1986 
investigation of the armsforhostages deals has recused himself 
from the case or any others involving independent counsels 
any decision about classified information in the irancontra 
case would have to be made by an acting attorney general 
walsh said that under a 1982 executive order on classified 
documents he has no authority to declassify government secrets and 
must therefore defer to the authority of the attorney general 
walsh said he agreed to comply with the 1982 executive order 
when he obtained the 300000 pages of classified documents in the 
course of his investigation

the pilots who safely landed an aloha airlines 
jetliner april 28 after the cabin blew open at 24000 feet said 
friday they look forward to returning to the air in a few days 
ive ridden in a couple airplanes since the incident the 
pilot robert schornstheimer said at a news conference im 
really more comfortable at the controls of an airplane than i am in 
this setting here 
schornstheimer and copilot mimi tompkins landed the boeing 737 
on the island of maui after a third of the cabin peeled away on a 
hilotohonolulu flight a flight attendant was swept to her death 
and 61 passengers were injured 
a check of federal aviation administration records friday showed 
14 cracks or instances of corrosion were found in several routine 
maintenance checks on the plane before the accident but none of 
the defects was found in the area of the damage 
according to faa records each of the cracks or corroded areas 
was repaired by replacing sections of the planes metal skin 
a federal investigation has focused on metal fatigue as a 
possible cause of the accident 
neither pilot would discuss the cause however they related the 
15 harrowing minutes while they guided the crippled plane to an 
emergency landing 
it was a splitsecond thing there was a loud noise and the 
cockpit door was gone and there was blue sky schornstheimer 
said he added normally you dont expect to lose that much of 
an airplane and still be able to fly it 
according to faa records the defects uncovered during routine 
maintenance by aloha were on the rearbottom portions or wings of 
the plane during routine aloha inspections the top of the cabin 
peeled away in the accident 
nick wantiez aloha director of engineering said the number of 
defects was not untypical of some airplanes but probably better 
than most 
generally it was in quite good shape from a corrosion 
standpoint wantiez said the basic airplane looked quite 
clean

a new opposition group challenging the communist 
partys political monopoly has outlined a platform that calls for 
free trade unions and end to soviet domination of the baltic states 
and of eastern europe 
the weekold democratic union whose members have been harassed 
by authorities as antisocial said in unveiling the progam 
friday that it plans to try to register with the state but expects 
to be rebuffed 
at least a dozen uniformed policemen milled around outside as 
party organizers gathered in a crowded eighthfloor apartment in 
northwest moscow to discuss plans for political action 
police made no attempt to stop those entering or leaving 
the groups declaration of goals and principles followed a week 
of meetings in which organizers said more than 150 soviets from 27 
cities took part 
yuri denisov one of the partys 15 central coordinating council 
members told journalists it would try to comply with laws 
requiring groups to register their activity but of course we 
expect problems with that and we do not expect to succeed 
another coordinating council member alexander lukashev 
outlined broad party policies he said the group aims to present an 
opposition to the communist partys monopoly on power and 
political thought 
the group opposes the soviet occupation of the baltic states 
of lithuania latvia and estonia and soviet actions in eastern 
europe that have helped keep communist government in power there 
he said 
the party has called for independent trade unions and on friday 
issued a statement denouncing polish officials actions to halt 
industrial strikes over the past month in the sovietallied country 
the democratic union comes out in opposition to 
totalitarianism of political parties the groups statement of 
principles declares as its first objective 
the party program sets out methods for calling elections and 
filling leadership positions and says funds raised by the group 
will be used for informational activity agitation printing 
costs and organizational needs 
party activists complained that their first week was marred by 
repressive and unconstitutional actions of the kgb local 
police forces and the staterun press 
the official tass news agency denounced the party on wednesday 
accusing the activists of slanderous antisocial activity 
dozens of participants were detained by police after meetings 
last weekend with sentences of five to seven days in jail handed 
down summarily to four of them including dissident magazine editor 
sergei grigoryants 
grigoryants who edits the unofficial magazine glasnost 
remained jailed friday night and no one had been permitted to see 
him the activists said 
denisov said the party planned a political conference in the 
fall but that details of that gathering had not been worked out 
yet

the battle to keep a landmark art deco 
hotel from being turned into a parking lot heated up as 
preservationists and the city struggled to save it and the owner 
began pulling plumbing from the building 
people are distressed and distraught that we would be losing a 
building nancy liebman legislative liaison for the miami design 
preservation league said friday as a work crew carted plumbing and 
scrap metal from the beachfront senator hotel 
while its still here its worth a continuous battle she 
said 
the threestory greenandwhite hotel was built in 1939 and is 
on the national register of historic places ms liebman said it 
is one of 800 art deco buildings in the milesquare area that 
comprises the only official art deco district in the world she 
said 
the closed hotels owner the royale group must raze the 
senator for parking spaces as a condition for obtaining bank loans 
to renovate other art deco buildings it owns royale attorney 
harold rosen said 
its not were antipreservation but we have to be practical 
too rosen said a date for demolishing the building has not been 
set 
mayor alex daoud said he hopes lastditch negotiations scheduled 
next week with the royale groups owners will keep the wrecking 
ball away 
were doing everything within our power to preserve it said 
daoud whose staff is checking legal avenues possible land swaps 
and the feasibility of buying the hotel 
preservationists will keep an eye on the building ms liebman 
said 
its hard to see where this urgent crush for parking is she 
said the senator has every single deco feature its a perfect 
example an important masterpiece 
the art deco districts buildings are painted pastel colors and 
sport geometric designs its sidewalks are painted pink and its 
often featured on nbcs miami vice television show 
the city is pushing for the renovation of the districts 
buildings in its effort to bring back the glory days of tourism 
the 70room senator is a crucial part of the district said barbara 
capitman president of the art deco society of miami beach and the 
national art deco societies of america 
the senator has probably the most famous etched glass in 
the district mrs capitman said it is a particularly 
seductive building 
ms liebman and mrs capitman accuse the royale group of 
ignoring pleas from them and city officials to save the hotel 
which was closed after the group bought it in 1984 
rosen countered that in the nine months it took his clients to 
obtain a demolition permit no one offered a viable alternative he 
said none is expected now 
our people are more active in preserving than any others on 
the beach rosen said preservationists have blinders on 
theyre not in the real world 
daoud said he remained optimistic but understood the royale 
groups problems 
they first started to restore it purchased new doors and 
fixtures but what happened was they had to provide this parking 
daoud said 
its almost a catch22 youve got a developer renovating the 
area doing a great job and hes the same individual whos 
knocking down one of our architectural treasures to make room for 
parking

permit the union pacific and mkt merger 
the union pacific a 21500mile network proposed in november 
1986 to acquire the 3100mile mkt system known as the katy line 
for 110 million and to assume its outstanding debts 
as proposed the merger would eliminate about 1100 katy jobs 
because of closing of rail yards and repair shops union pacific 
also proposed the abandonment of 405 miles of track mostly 
operated by katy 
the union pacific the nations third largest railroad system in 
terms of track mileage serves about 20 states with routes from los 
angeles san francisco and seattle in the west to chicago and new 
orleans 
the company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the union 
pacific missouri pacific and western pacific railroads 
the katy serves six states with mostly northsouth routes 
running from omaha to the gulf coast in texas 
dennis watson an icc spokesman said he had no information on 
how commissioners had voted in the case and could not confirm or 
deny that the merger had been approved 
the sources said retiring commissioner malcolm sterrett who did 
not seek reappointment to a new term on the agency did not vote 
the agency made its decision by a voting system that does not 
require a public meeting 
the railroads say consolidating their operations would provide 
shippers with better service at lower costs and offer direct 
singleline routes in some areas without the merger the icc has 
been told the financially troubled katy will have difficulty 
surviving against bigger competitors

dr donal m billig will leave the navy next 
week free and clear of charges that he killed three patients 
through surgical negligence 
the navy decided friday against appealing a military review 
courts decision to overturn billigs conviction on 
involuntarymanslaughter charges the charges stemmed from billigs 
tour as chief heart surgeon at the navys flagship bethesda md 
naval medical center 
navy secretary william ball also has approved a request from 
billig a commander in rank to be released from active duty said 
lt brian cullin a spokesman for the service 
he will be released without pension sometime next week 
cullin said 
cullin said the decision against an appeal was made by navy 
secretary william ball and the navys judge advocate general rear 
adm h don campbell 
billig 57 was convicted in early 1986 on charges of 
involuntary manslaughter and negligence in the deaths of three 
patients he was sentenced on march 3 1986 to four years in 
prison and last summer was rebuffed in his first bid for parole 
from fort leavenworth kan 
billigs case attracted extensive public attention in part 
because of the sensational nature of some of the charges it also 
prompted congressional reviews of military health care in general 
and several large monetary settlements between the government and 
relatives of billigs patients 
prosecutors described billig as an egocentric man nearly blind 
in one eye who hid his visual handicap and continued performing 
complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was 
killing patients 
the us navymarine corps court of military review concluded 
april 13 however the prosecution never showed that billigs 
surgical technique and conduct in the operating room were so out of 
line as to constitute criminal conduct 
the spokesman said 36 legal claims totaling 1536 million were 
ultimately filed against the navy in connection with cases handled 
by billig to date 12 have been settled for a combined 22 
million eight denied and 16 are pending cullin said 
after reviewing the opinion the judge advocate general 
has determined there is no viable legal basis for further 
review ball said in a statement

rabbit another relied on a bright red compact car gutted and lined 
with iron to fashion a cooker

accounting of the amount of meat cooked by the competitors they 
predicted the total would be in the tons

rescuers cleared crumbled concrete 
on the fading hope that someone might still be alive under the 
rubble of an unfinished fourstory building 1 days after it 
collapsed killing at least 13 people 
officials said friday that at least 53 people were injured when 
the structure came crashing down as workers were about to pour the 
last concrete at a furniture factory that occupied the ground floor 
and part of the basement 
some of the injured were buried for hours 
i had finished working and was about to leave when all of 
a sudden everyone started yelling hysterically that there was an 
earthquake said juan flores who was buried for five hours 
i dashed under a table and all of a sudden everything went 
dark and there was this terrific noise and there was dust 
everywhere he told the excelsior news agency 
he said a slab of concrete that fell on the table protected him 
from the rest of the debris 
flores said he was quiet at first but the fear and the 
anguish of being buried impelled me to yell very loud and the 
rescue squads dug me out 
the aguascalientes state government said 13 people died 
including a 16yearold boy riding past the building on a bicycle 
when it collapsed thursday but a red cross official said at least 
14 people were known dead 
all day friday officials gave conflicting estimates of the 
number of people believed trapped under the rubble 
eduardo zapata chief red cross attendant on duty late friday in 
this city 320 miles northwest of the capital said crews were 
painstakingly working their way down through the massive rubble 
rescuers swung sledgehammers at chunks of rubble and passed 
concrete blocks down a line as they cleared the debris piece by 
piece 
below we think there is no longer anyone alive because there 
wouldnt be enough air zapata said 
he said a large amount of dirt had fallen in with the building 
which had three basement levels a main floor and three upper 
stories 
we have the building plans and we are making tunnels where we 
think there may be people and when we determine there are not we 
will begin to use machines he said 
he said workers planned to search through the night 
gilberto sanchez the radio officer at police headquarters in 
this city of half a million residents said about 60 soldiers from 
the army garrison joined firefighters police and volunteers in the 
rescue effort 
bulldozers and cranes were brought from as far away as 
salamanca 78 miles to the southwest 
celia de la torre a state government spokeswoman said late 
friday the number of dead stood at 13 zapata said 14 were known 
dead he said 12 bodies had been recovered and two others remained 
in the rubble 
two people were missing he said mrs de la torre said 
authorities believed two or three may still be trapped 
mrs de la torre said original estimates that several dozen 
people were trapped may have been high and many may have escaped 
uninjured 
juan diaz head of special services for the local red cross 
said at least 116 workers were in the building when it collapsed 
roberto padilla marquez a state government spokesman said the 
state attorney generals office had begun an investigation to 
determine who was responsible for the collapse of the building 
three blocks from the main plaza and the state capitol

furniture paintings and other items that belonged 
to the late john steinbeck will be sold at auction next weekend 
says an estate broker hired by the authors sons 
the furniture is nicked and scratched knobs are missing from a 
china cabinet and the frame is pulling away from an oil painting 
some pieces seem vintage garage sale 
were not talking a great deal of monetary value on these 
pieces said sylvia link a denver estate broker and antiques 
dealer who will conduct the sale at estate brokerage house on 
friday through sunday 
steinbeck author of the grapes of wrath and the 1962 nobel 
prize winner died in 1968 
the sale has been commissioned by his sons john 41 and 
thomas 43 who live in california john lived in boulder from 1979 
to 1987 and his fathers belongings remain stored there 
the collection accounts for much of the authors estate with 
the exception of some silver sold earlier and items kept by the 
family according to johns wife nancy steinbeck 
the furniture and art is an eclectic mix much of it american 
and oriental acquired by the man whose works such as cannery 
row and of mice and men were sympathetic to the common man 
the items reflect steinbecks apparent casual attitude toward 
material possessions 
a chippendale corner cupboard normally would sell for about 
3000 because it belonged to steinbeck it probably will sell for 
about 5500 link said

the makers of the only drug approved for 
treatment of aids say that for nearly two years the medication has 
continued adding to the life spans of patients who have used 
according to a published report 
officials of burroughs wellcome co told an advisory committee 
of the food and drug administration that even in longterm 
treatment the beneficial effects of azidothymidine known as azt or 
zidovudine continue without an increase in negative side effects 
the washington post reported saturday 
an unidentified fda official said the treatment adds at least 
six months but no study has yet documented how much time the drug 
adds to the life of aids patients 
one study of 229 people with aids and severe aidsrelated 
complex found that 58 percent of those who received longterm 
treatment with the drug were alive after 21 months while 50 
percent of those who never received the treatment were dead after 
nine months the company said 
another study of 4800 people with aids and aidsrelated complex 
who received the drug between october 1986 and september 1987 found 
that 73 percent were alive 11 months after starting treatment 
this is significantly better than what might be expected for 
such patients had they not been treated said dr david berry 
vice president of research at burroughs wellcome

the internal revenue service has given 
writers painters and other artists a reprieve on an partial 
exemption they had lost in the 1986 revision of the federal tax law 
the irs ruling on friday will allow the group to deduct some of 
the expense of creating their works even before the artwork or 
written work like a book begins to produce income 
the irs said artists will be allowed to write off operating 
expenses over three years with a 50 percent deduction permitted in 
the first year and 25 percent in each of the next two the rule 
will apply the irs said only where the personal efforts of the 
individual are mainly responsible for the creation of a work of 
art 
it certainly alleviates the complexity concern these people 
have had said tom evans a tax counsel for the treasury 
department 
i guess 50 percent is better than nothing said bestselling

asia says the united states should take the lead in stemming the 
drift into dissolution of people seeking asylum from vietnam 
the un high commissioner for refugees with strong support 
from the united states also should call an international 
conference to highlight the issue said the washingtonbased us 
committee for refugees 
unless the us government gives the problem new priority it 
will be to blame for permitting a vital humanitarian initiative 
to drift into dissolution the group said 
thailand lit the fuse in january when it began to push back 
vietnamese boats from its eastern and southern coastlines 
committee director roger winter added in a statement 
what we are seeing now is the predictable chain reaction to 
bar asylum throughout the region he said citing increased

center but about half probably will have intermittent dial tones 
by sunday officials said 
it will take until at least june before all the customers in 
western suburbs will have full service illinois bell vice 
president james eibel said friday 
we could have as many as 21000 lines up in hinsdale by the 
end of this week but its not going to be the standard of service 
that illinois bell wants to provide eibel said 
thats my most optimistic view if everything absolutely goes 
right and frankly it will not eibel added 
technicians originally thought the digital switching device 
damaged by smoke and water in the fire sunday could be repaired 
but eibel said illinois bell has decided to purchase a new one from 
atampt there were no injuries in the fire 
a telephone systems analyst told the chicago tribune on friday 
that such a switch could cost as much as 16 million 
meanwhile state rep james r stange introduced a house 
resolution friday calling for an investigation of the fire by a

gen manuel antonio noriega vowed not 
to give in to us demands that he step down as panamas military 
leader after claiming negotiations with the reagan administration 
had fallen apart 
in washington on friday the white house said us officials 
still were talking with noriega about his resignation but 
noriegas spokesman said the general would refuse any deal that 
includes a deadline for such a departure 
a us attorney prosecuting noriega on drug charges meanwhile 
sharply criticized the reported us offer to throw out the charges 
in exchange for noriegas resignation as defense forces chief and 
at least temporary exile 
asked friday about the talks noriega said everything fell 
apart 
later he said the dignity of panama is not negotiable while 
there are foreign troops on our territory humiliating our soil 
while there is economic aggression as long as there are threats 
as long as there is psychological war as long as us 
ambassador arthur davis does not get out 
noriega spoke with reporters friday at ceremonies in this rural 
town 90 miles from panama city on the anniversary of the death of 
a revolutionary hero and during a meeting with local officials in 
rio hato 60 miles southwest of the capital 
asked in washington about noriegas comments white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said he says that all the time he 
said fall apart or something similar before we are still 
talking we are still negotiating 
the reagan administration has been trying through economic 
sanctions to pressure noriega into stepping down since february 
when he was indicted in florida on drugtrafficking charges 
as military chief noriega is the countrys de facto ruler 
the general said friday that state department envoy michael 
kozak was in panama but added i have not talked with mr 
kozak 
maj edgardo lopez noriegas spokesman said there was little 
variety in what the united states has been offering 
the thing is kozak comes each time with the same plan the 
original plan a little more elastic he said 
the plan has a deadline for noriega resigning his post a 
deadline for leaving the country with those conditions and that 
pressure neither the general nor any other panamanian nor any latin 
american will cede 
in washington reagan administration officials acknowledged 
discussing with noriega the possibility of dropping the drug 
charges in exchange for his departure from power 
but attorney general edwin meese iii on friday argued against 
dismissing the drug charges said us attorney leon kellner of 
miami who obtained one of the indictments 
kellner said dropping the drug charges would send the wrong 
message to americans 
us customs service chief william von raab whose agencys 
investigation contributed to the drug indictments against noriega 
also said friday that noriega should be prosecuted 
noriegas lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal 
of the drug charges in about a month they contend the charges are 
politically motivated 
in la negrita noriega did not address the crowd but listened 
to three speeches by local authorities denouncing yankee 
aggression 
when a reporter asked if he could run for president in elections 
scheduled for next may he smiled broadly 
legally yes he answered surrounded by supporters 
asked if he was actively considering running for president 
noriega merely laughed 
a dignity battalion of about 100 men attended the ceremony 
they had vintage rifles and were dressed in blue jeans tshirts 
printed with not one step backward and redandwhite baseball 
caps saying i dont sell out my country 
the united states still recognizes eric arturo delvalle now in 
hiding as panamas legitimate president noriega had him dismissed 
on feb 26 the day after delvalle tried to fire the general

summer heat waves are deadlier for 
northerners and midwesterners than for southerners where almost no 
one dies when the mercury soars a researcher says 
the top six cities for weatherrelated deaths are st louis new 
york philadelphia detroit kansas city mo and chicago said 
dr lawrence kalkstein of the university of delawares center for 
climatic research 
during an average summer 183 people die in st louis because of 
weather alone kalkstein said in new york its 139 and in 
philadelphia 118 
the cities with the lowest weatherrelated death rates are 
southern areas dallas new orleans and oklahoma city 
in those three cities in an average summer season almost no 
one dies from heatrelated problems kalkstein said 
when the temperature in a city exceeds a certain threshold such 
as 92 degrees in new york the number of people who die can 
increase by up to 50 percent kalkstein said 
kalkstein determined the threshold temperatures using a weather 
stress index in work funded by the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
in a 225000 study funded by the environmental protection 
administration kalkstein is looking at other aspects of weathers 
impact on human health such as pollution and the effect of world 
temperatures that are expected to continue rising into the year 
2060 
the epa has given kalkstein scenarios for determining what will 
happen as temperatures go up 
kalkstein said however that the future heatrelated death rate 
is uncertain because its unknown whether people will acclimatize 
or adjust to increasingly warm weather 
we wonder if new yorkers will react like they do today or like 
people in jacksonville fla kalkstein said 
assuming people do not adjust if the temperature warms by 7 
degrees new york would see an estimated 1294 deaths instead of 
the current 139 said kalkstein who arrived at the figures by 
combining weather and deathrate data st louis would face 1664 
deaths instead of 183 
in general people adjust so there is no real reason to 
believe they wont acclimatize in the future but were concerned 
that conditions might get so much warmer that it might be too much 
for humans to tolerate kalkstein said 
as the earth warms kalkstein said there are other factors to 
consider such as housing 
st louis is the best example most innercity people live in 
red brick houses with black roofs even if people acclimatize 
those houses will be uninhabitable for humans because they will 
be too hot he explained 
people over age 65 were more stressed in hot weather than 
others kalkstein said he determined that the elderly are 
generally more affected by hot dry days while younger people are 
more affected by hot humid weather 
the duration of hot weather appeared to have more effect on 
death rates than the intensity of the heat kalkstein said 
in the summer the kind of day that killed most people was not 
necessarily a day when it got very very hot but it got pretty hot 
and remained warm all day and all night he said 
the research also showed that heat waves in the beginning of the 
season had more impact on mortality than latesummer heat waves 
by the time august comes around people are used to heat 
kalkstein explained

as a gay man willing to talk openly about his illness 
exploit me he said my time is limited i want to be 
exploited by whoever can use me to put windows on what is now 
happening with aids and what is likely to happen 
my years in public school work have groomed me im not 
embarrassed by the questions 
other scheduled participants in the conference which concludes 
sunday include officials and researchers of the atlantabased cdc

friday to like his new home a 45 million outdoor rain 
forest where finally he will live like the western lowland

rain and ran back in 
a very intelligent thing to do pronounced a proud zoo 
atlanta director terry maple 
later the door again was thrown open and the great ape hopped 
out to meet his public 
a minute later he climbed back in 
another minute later out again six minutes after that a car 
horn sounded and he scampered back inside 
all the while his eyes darted back and forth alert to the 
slightest movement or sound 
but after 40 minutes willie boldly climbed a small hill outside 
his door and picked up a few pieces of fruit thrown by his keeper 
he heard peacocks zoo construction trucks an airplane and car 
horns 
and for the first time in 27 years he felt the sunshine on his 
back 
within an hour he was jumping in the air trying to delimb his 
first tree 
the zoo director beamed 
this is a very special moment maple said i will always 
treasure this time im delighted with the way he responded to

two chinese men who hijacked a jetliner from the 
mainland to taiwan were air force veterans who had worked as radar 
operators the official china daily said today taiwan said it was 
weighing charges against the men 
the report indicated that the hijackers knowledge of air routes 
foiled an attempt by the pilot to fly the boeing 737 to hong kong 
rather than land in taiwan seat of the rival nationalist 
government 
in taiwan the countrys chief security agency recommended today 
that the two hijackers be prosecuted the taiwan garrison command 
said the two violated taiwans civil aviation code 
if charged with hijacking the men could face the death penalty 
the air pirates zhang qingguo 27 a worker at an arsenal in 
yunnan province and long guiyin 26 a steelworker from guizhou 
province have been granted political asylum in taiwan 
they comandeered the plane thursday about an hour after it left 
the southeast coastal city of xiamen for canton on a domestic 
flight 
the plane escorted by taiwanese jet fighters landed at 
taiwans qingquangan air force base it was refueled and flew back 
to xiamen 136 miles across the taiwan straits to end the 
ninehour ordeal for the 105 passengers and 11 crew members aboard 
the china daily said zhang and long first overpowered the 
planes security guard with a dagger and what appeared to be a gun 
they wrapped the chief flight attendant who tried to set off an 
alarm and another attendant in a cotton curtain and threatened to 
blow up the plane with explosives 
after entering the cockpit they covered the heads of the radio 
operator and copilot with plastic bags it said 
an earlier report by the official china news service said the 
hijackers covered the head of the pilot yang yongling and told 
him they had guns and knives zhang later told a television 
interviewer in taiwan that he had a toy pistol and fake explosives 
as the plane entered hong kong air space yang tried to trick 
the hijackers and land there but the two realized his ploy and 
forced him to continue toward taiwan the china daily said 
in taipei taiwan officials said the director of the taiwan 
garrison commands court martial division had recommended that the 
hijackers be prosecuted for endangering flight safety a charge 
that carries a maximum penalty of 7 years in jail 
command officials refused to say whether the mroe severe charge 
of hijacking might also apply 
liu chingyi presiding judge at the taipei district court told 
reporters the court would consider the charge with compassion 
because of the hijackers motives 
the garrison command delivered to the court a statement by the 
two hijackers saying they hijacked the plane because they detested 
the brutal rule of the chinese communists and wanted to seek 
freedom in taiwan 
it was the second time a commercial chinese airliner was 
hijacked to outside the mainland six chinese commandeered a 
trident owned by the civil aviation administration to south korea 
in may 1983 
they were imprisoned in south korea for a little more than a 
year then released and allowed to go to taiwan

its gone too far now robin strode said friday after her 
son duffey strode received his fourth suspension from eastfield 
elementary school in this tiny town in the blue ridge mountains of 
western north carolina 
duffey surrounded by dozens of reporters stood in the school 
parking lot friday morning ignoring requests from assistant 
principal shirley ramsey that he stop preaching and come in out of 
the rain 
he accused onlookers of various sins 
thou shall not take the name of the lord thy god in vain 
duffey shouted thou shalt not commit adultery youre guilty 
even your eyes are filled with adultery men cant keep their eyes 
off women and women cant keep their eyes off men adulterers shall 
be put to death and their blood shall be upon them 
after several minutes mrs ramsey left duffey standing on the 
sidewalk and went into the school after talking to his mother he 
entered the building to hand in some homework five minutes later 
the boy emerged carrying a letter of suspension 
the letter did not mention preaching but said duffey was 
suspended for 10 days for being insubordinate refusing to abide by 
school policies refusing to accompany mrs ramsey into the school 
and disruptive behavior 
duffey appeared unrepentent id rather get gold and silver up 
in heaven than an education down here he said 
this things going to court mrs strode said she said she 
has contacted an attorney through the rutherford institute which 
she described as a nonprofit christian legal foundation based in 
manassass va 
duffeys brother matthew 5 and sister pepper 6 also were 
suspended for defying school officials earlier this month 
mrs strode said they probably will be suspended again when they 
return to school thursday 
i told them if they want to go back and preach thats fine 
she said in an interview at the familys home 
mrs strode blames the familys problems on school officials 
they are the ones who are keeping my children from getting an 
education she said 
mrs ramsey said the strode children could return to school 
monday if they would agree to stop shouting bible verses on school 
grounds she said expulsion was unlikely since the school year was 
almost over 
but mrs strode said she couldnt guarantee duffey would quit 
preaching 
i just leave that up to him and if he wants to preach ill 
back him 100 percent she said and if he doesnt thats fine 
too

president hussain muhammad ershad has 
underscored his efforts to make islam the state religion by 
ordering members of the armed forces to offer five prayers a day 
ershad said friday that the prayers are now compulsory for 
bangladeshs 150000 servicemen because they had taken the pledge 
to defend the sovereignty and independence of the country by 
putting their hands on the holy koran the moslem equivalent of 
the bible 
about 90 percent of bangladeshs 105 million people are moslems 
hindus christians and buddhists serving in the armed forces are 
exempted from the mandatory prayers according to an official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the five daily prayers which are recited while facing mecca 
are one of the five main duties of the islamic faith 
the government on wednesday introduced legislation to make islam 
the state religion since ershads jatiya party holds 251 of 
parliaments 300 seats the bill is expected to be approved 
opposition politicians womens groups and professional 
associations have denounced the legislation saying it could cause 
friction among religions and curtail womens rights 
major opposition parties are not represented in parliament they 
boycotted the march 3 elections because they refuse to participate 
in a government headed by ershad 
the opposition has been campaigning since nov 10 for the ouster 
of the former army general who seized power in 1982 he later was 
elected president in a vote that was marked by charges of flagrant 
misconduct

the art institute of chicago has purchased 
fullpage newspaper ads apologizing for a students painting of the 
late mayor harold washington in frilly womens underwear 
the painting titled mirth and girth was seized by a group 
of black aldermen last week who stormed the schools halls and was 
later confiscated by police 
while the art institute prepared its apology the american civil 
liberties union threatened a lawsuit on artist david nelsons 
behalf and discord over the black aldermens seizure of the 
painting led to angry words exchanged in the city council 
the art institute and its school where the painting was shown 
briefly in a private juried student show plan to run fullpage 
advertisements in three daily chicagoarea newspapers offering an 
apology for the caricature of the citys first black mayor who 
died of a heart attack in november 
it contains an apology for the distress and concern that the 
painting caused to the community art institute spokeswoman 
eileen harakal said of the ad which will run in sundays chicago 
tribune and chicago suntimes and in monday editions of the 
chicago daily defender which has a primarily black readership 
we would like to see calm in the community she said friday 
we never intended for there to be any unrest in the first place 
and want to put the entire incident behind us and move on 
ms harakal refused to release the text of the ad before 
publication 
the art institute and its school came under fire wednesday when 
aldermen began receiving telephone complaints about the work by 
nelson the city council passed a resolution cutting off city funds 
for a school program unless the painting was removed and demanded 
an apology 
the black aldermen then stormed the school and removed the 
painting 
the painting was returned to nelson thursday defaced with a 
5inch gash on washingtons left shoulder after the aclu 
intervened with the city corporation counsel said jay miller the 
illinois aclus executive director the organization is considering 
a lawsuit seeking monetary damages from police for violating the 
artists civil rights he said 
mayor eugene sawyer who succeeded washington said he was 
disgusted by the work it should never have been hung in fact 
it should never have been painted 
several white aldermen complained friday that black colleagues 
had overreacted 
the whole thing could have been resolved with a phone call 
said alderman david orr now by going to the council floor and 
grandstanding on the issue millions of people will have seen this 
sad insensitive disgusting picture as opposed to a few dozen 
but at a meeting of black ministers friday the rev willie 
barrow executive director of operation push the civil rights 
group founded by democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
described the painting as the latest in a series of escalating 
attacks and insults against the black community 
the art institute meanwhile received dozens of calls friday 
from people supporting an artists right to show his work ms 
harakal said students said they had consulted attorneys about 
filing a civil rights lawsuit against the aldermen and police for 
impounding the painting

government forces fired at the golden 
temple today after seizing surrounding buildings and tightening 
their grip on the shrine where militant sikh separatists were 
holed up for a sixth day 
sikh extremists and government commandos traded intermittent 
fire through the night inside the sprawling temple complex home of 
the sikh faiths holiest sanctuary at least 27 people mostly sikh 
militants have been killed during the siege that began monday 
about 20 women and children thought to be relatives of the 
militants remain in the temple amritsar police chief kps gill 
said 
government forces on friday seized about onethird of the 
complex including adjacent temple offices and a hostel that left 
the militants with the equivalent of 3 city blocks including the 
temple 
the extremists inside the temple complex are thought to number 
fewer than 100 police sharpshooters killed at least six militants 
friday including one who tried to shoot his way out of the complex 
police said no government troops have been killed since the 
siege began about 2800 troops are posted outside the temple 
most of the militants are believed to be entrenched at the 
western side of the complex officers said but they said any 
government assault would more likely come from the west officers 
said 
the eastern side is difficult to enter because terrorists are 
still holding two 80foot towers overlooking that entrance said 
a paramilitary officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
authorities escorted journalists to a sandbagged position atop a 
buildimg overlooking the towers today 
in a twohour period government troops regularly fired machine 
gun bursts into the temple compound but only sporadic shots were 
returned 
sds aswal deputy superintendent of the central reserve 
police force said the sikhs did not fire from the tower in 
daylight because that would give away their position they start 
firing from portholes cut into the tower after late evening 
the bunker had a commanding view of the golden temple and the 
sacred pool that surrounds it one body was seen lying near a 
marble walkway 
in the square facing the compounds main entrance canewielding 
police charged at a group of sikhs who attempted to march into the 
temple at least eight marchers were arrested said witnesses who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the siege is the biggest massing of forces outside the golden 
temple since june 1984 when the army stormed the 400yearold 
shrine to dislodge the sikh militants 
more than 1200 people were killed and prime minister indira 
gandhi who ordered the raid was assassinated five months later by 
her sikh bodyguards 
sikh militants have waged a campaign of violence often gunning 
down whole family of hindus and moderate sikhs in their battle to 
establish a sikh homeland in northern punjab state which includes 
amritsar 
although sikhs form only 2 percent of indias total population 
they are a majority in punjab the sikhs say they are discriminated 
against by hindus who comprise 82 percent of indias 800 million 
people

the united auto workers contracts with chrysler 
corp will stand despite a narrow rejection by skilled trades 
workers of a pact ratified by a majority of 66000 union members 
uaw leaders say 
the international executive board after reviewing all the 
issues has determined that this contract stands properly 
ratified the union said friday in a statement attributed to uaw 
president owen bieber and vice president marc stepp 
the contract was ratified by 54 percent of the vote wednesday 
skilled trades workers who have an additional separate contract 
but cast a single vote for or against both pacts narrowly rejected 
it 
chrysler says it has about 10500 active skilled trades workers 
delegates to the uaws 140member national chrysler council who 
represent skilled trades workers met in chicago on friday with 
stepp and other union leaders to determine whether negotiations 
should resume 
the union and chrysler could have returned to the bargaining 
table to discuss skilled trades issues if those had been behind the 
rejection however if the rejection was on issues in the main 
contract such as economics then the uaw would take no further 
action 
the unions decision indicated that the rejection concerned the 
main contract union officials had said before the meeting that 
they believed the rejection was economic and blamed it on a 1000 
signing bonus 
chrysler workers received a 2120 bonus in 1985 for signing a 
threeyear contract 
the uaw executive board which includes bieber stepp other uaw 
vice presidents and regional directors decided to ratify the 
contract after receiving a report on the chicago meeting 
the contracts reached may 5 after 2 weeks of early 
negotiations cover 66000 hourly and salaried chrysler workers in 
15 states

a bomb exploded inside a truck today 
near reviewing stands being prepared for farewell ceremonies to 
mark the retreat of soviet soldiers eleven afghans were killed and 
12 reported wounded 
the blast occurred in the heart of kabul at 545 am 915 pm 
edt friday in a housing area on the banks of the kabul river 
a western photographer on the scene told the associated press 
that a baby and 11yearold girl were among those killed and all 
the casualties were afghan civilians most appeared to have been 
occupants of nearby homes destroyed by the impact of the explosion 
he said 
when the bomb exploded some of the houses nearby just 
collapsed 
witnesses said they saw four bodies being removed from one house 
the blast was so great that it shattered the windows of a bus 
depot across the river 300 yards away and left a crater 20 feet 
wide and 10 feet deep 
soviet troops arrived afterward the photographer said by 
telephone 
vladimir sevruk deputy chief of the soviet communist party 
central committees propaganda department also provided casualty 
figures to foreign reporters covering the pullout which is to 
begin sunday 
in moscow the official tass news agency reported that the blast 
killed 11 people and wounded 13 and blamed afghan antigovernment 
formations 
the explosion demolished embankment walls on both sides of the 
river which threads through this ancient capital city whose 
streets are now filled with soviet troops tanks and armored 
personnel carriers 
blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal 
belongings including carpet slippers were scattered in the street 
witnesses said flames were visible when they arrived shortly 
after the blast the bomb had been planted in a large truck that 
was badly mangled 
last month six people were killed and 49 wounded in another 
bomb blast along the river banks on the 10th anniversary of the 
april 1978 revolution that brought a marxist government to power 
and triggered widespread insurrection 
anticommunist guerrillas also were blamed for a may 4 attack on 
a soviet convoy north of kabul that killed a photographer for the 
soviet newspaper izvestia and an undisclosed number of soldiers it 
also wounded sevruks son who also works for izvestia 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
sovietallied government put down the insurrection 
about 115000 soviets have been assisting najibs troops but 
they will begin leaving the country on sunday in observance of a 
peace agreement signed in geneva on april 14 
half of the soviets must be out by aug 15 and the rest are 
expected to follow quickly although the accord gives them nine 
months to complete the pullout 
at a new conference today the head of the soviet military 
contingent in afghanistan said the guerrilas were taking their toll 
on soviet and afghan troops but that rebel attacks would not deter 
the withdrawal 
the opposition may have some effect on us but not much and 
certainly they will not be able to frustrate the timetable lt 
gen boris gromov told reporters 
troops manning the soviet armor in kabul have been setting out 
gasoline pumps and supplies along the route of retreat for 
security reasons soviet officials have been tightlipped about the 
exact number of troops who will begin the move north on sunday 
the soviet national news program vremya reported friday night 
that soldiers were ready for the withdrawal but gave no figures 
vremya reported that 167 soviet encampments would be left behind 
for the afghans to use but that some of the facilities would be 
put to civilian use as hospitals and schools 
information for this account was based in part on a news agency 
pool report from kabul by reuters and on moscow monitoring of 
soviet news broadcasts the associated press was not allowed to go 
on the trip to kabul because of questions it asked najib in the 
capital last month

berlin philharmonic conductor herbert von 
karajans frequent absences and canceled west berlin concerts have 
struck a chorus of sour notes from onceloyal berliners and will be 
taken up by the citys senate 
the council said friday that it would debate those issues may 30 
a social democratic delegate to the senate walter momper said 
it would also examine recording and other contracts made by 
karajans agent that may involve work by the entire berling 
philharmonic 
berlin and its orchestra are not a vehicle that exists solely 
to advance karajans economic interests he told reporters 
karajan the orchestras 80yearold conductor for life has 
been sharply criticized in recent months by berlin fans and city 
cultural officials who disburse the public funds that help bankroll 
the orchestra 
he canceled a heavily advertised berlin concert on sunday april 
24 then flew off to japan for a tour with the orchestra the next 
day provoking widespread complaints from berliners 
karajan has suffered medical problems in recent years including 
severe back pains that have forced him to cancel conducting 
appearances but city cultural officials say he has on several 
occasions called off concerts under questionable circumstances 
during a tour of west germany last november karajan called off 
a concert appearance in duesseldorf saying he couldnt mount the 
podium because he said he had food poisoning from eating tainted 
fish 
karajan later changed his mind and performed but called off 
another appearance in stuttgart during the same tour 
michael dieterici a city cultural affairs office spokesman 
recently told the associated press that west berlin provides some 
25 million in subsidies to the orchestra he said he did not know 
how much money karajan receives directly 
west german publications have recently carried reports about 
enormous sums of money karajans agents allegedly demanded last 
year for a concert tour of taiwan the tour was later called off 
because of the fees karajan was demanding according to the reports

battles in the area where the prosyrian amal and the 
iranianbacked hezbollah were also fighting kept reporters out

the shiyah district seeking to dislodge amal of its last 
stronghold in the area the thuds of exploding shells echoed across 
west beirut as the two factions battled with heavy artillery 
mortar and tank fire

into shiyah amal spokesmen said the assault was repulsed and that 
a counterattack was launched to retake positions captured by 
hezbollah 
police said they were unable to verify the claims 
the two groups were fighting in a 16squaremile enclave where 
most of the 18 foreign hostages were believed held by kidnappers

magazine ashshiraa said friday the hostages had been moved from an 
exposed hezbollah barracks to the home of sheik ibrahim alamin 
hezbollahs spokesman in a less vulnerable neighborhood

us arms sales to iran made in an effort to free the hostages who 
include nine americans 
syria meanwhile escalated its war of words with hezbollah a 
ranking syrian official said hezbollah has become an aberration 
on the lebanese scene 
this phenomenon is destabilizing tranquility and warrants 
immediate and drastic treatment the official told the moslem 
voice of nation radio without elaborating the broadcast did not 
identify the official 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 25000 troops 
in the bekaa and in north lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate though irans main arab ally syria has been 
alarmed by tehrans attempt through hezbollah to dominate lebanons 
12 million shiites

which has thrown some 6500 militiamen into the battle 
hezbollah also said amals military headquarters on the main 
beirut airport highway were overrun during the night amal denied 
the claim 
hezbollahs snipers killed a syrian on the airport highway on 
friday and syrian soldiers fired back killing five hezbollah 
fighters it was the first time that the syrians directly

expresident ferdinand marcos today 
pledged support for president corazon aquino and told his followers 
not to stage a new coup about 5000 people rallied to demand the 
ousted leaders return 
marcos also asked mrs aquino to allow him to return to bury his 
95yearold mother josefa edralinmarcos who died may 4 
on friday marcos claimed he was negotiating with manila and 
washington to return for the funeral and he expected the talks to 
be finalized in a few days 
there was no immediate comment from the government to marcos 
latest statement broadcast by manila radio stations earlier 
today mrs aquinos spokesman said the imminent return of marcos 
was impossible 
i reiterate that i oppose violence that i have no 
intention of mounting a coup detat or causing a civil war 
marcos said in a statement read by telephone from hawaii by his 
spokesman gemmo trinidad 
instead let us join forces with madame aquino so that the 
communists and some rebel bands would not venture to commit acts of 
adventurism to challenge the stability of the current government 
in another statement issued friday by his followers marcos said 
he hoped an agreement on his return could be reached in a day or 
two 
mrs aquinos spokesman teodoro benigno branded the statement 
meaningless us ambassador nicholas platt told reporters that 
american officials just havent been involved at all in 
negotiations regarding marcos return 
meanwhile a bomb exploded near sundown today at military 
headquarters killing one soldier officials said the building has 
been vacant since being set ablaze during an august coup attempt 
navy lt anselmo cabingan a military spokesman said the victim 
was believed to be a member of a roving guard force and may have 
picked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed 
its an accident cabingan said its not connected with 
anything political or whatever its just a simple accident as we 
see it 
mrs aquino citing national security has refused to allow 
marcos to return for his mothers funeral benigno said the 
decision was unanimously endorsed by the cabinet 
there is nothing that should cause worry excitement or 
nervousness on our people about reports that expresident marcos 
will return benigno said there is no truth to that 
marcos supporters gathered today under a blistering sun in a 
downtown square and marched to the mendiola bridge about 300 yards 
from the presidential palace march leader salvador panelo said 
they would remain there until mrs aquino reversed her decision or 
marcos appeared before them 
police agreed to allow the estimated 5000 protesters to remain 
there as long as the protest was peaceful about 200 riot police 
backed by four water cannon and four firetrucks guarded the 
approach to the palace 
protesters waved banners reading give us marcos or give us 
death while others claimed marcos was the only one who could 
stop the communist insurgency which erupted and spread nationwide 
during marcos 20year rule 
marcos supporters have been linked to several attempts to topple 
the aquino government marcos fled to hawaii in february 1986 after 
a popular uprising 
marcos told abc news in an interview friday that he would 
support the aquino government if he were allowed to return 
my mother is dead and id like to go home he said in slow 
somewhat slurred speech from his home in honolulu i will support 
the aquino government to prevent any adventurism or prevent any 
attempt at the takeover by the communists 
there is nothing that madame aquino should fear from me he 
said i mean well and if i should be any obstacle we will be 
able to work it out 
the body of marcos mother has been lying in state at a suburban 
church since her death marcos supporters say she will be buried in 
northern luzon but have given no firm date for the funeral or for 
the body to be taken north 
the united states barred marcos from leaving hawaii without 
permission after the aquino government claimed he had chartered a 
plane in january 1987 to return home if a coup attempt succeeded

american trumpeter chet baker a 
jazz virtuoso who found fame in the 1950s but whose career was 
haunted by heroin addiction died in a fall from the second floor 
of his hotel 
baker who was 59 took heroin just before he fell from the 
hotel window shortly after 310 am friday police spokesman klaas 
wilting said today authorities found baker dead in the street 
wilting said suicide was possible but ria wigt of wigt 
productions bakers worldwide agent said baker wasnt the type 
of man who would commit suicide 
born chesney baker in yale okla in 1929 the musician set the 
standard for what jazz buffs knew as the cool school 
in 1952 he was working with charlie parker on the west coast 
when he joined the pianoless quartet of british saxophonist gerry 
mulligan 
with his good looks and youth and fragile introverted tone 
baker soon became a cult figure in 1953 he topped the metronome 
trumpet poll and started his own quartet his work became more 
assured and outgoing 
baker looked something like actor james dean and sounded 
something like famed jazz trumpeter bix beiderbecke as a player 
miles davis was his main inspiration 
in 1955 baker took a group to europe that showed high promise 
then his career started to suffer an italian court sentenced him 
to a 16month prison term in 1960 for drug possession 
in san francisco in 1968 baker said he was beaten up by 
hoodlums and suffered severe injuries that included the loss of his 
teeth a trumpet players nightmare 
for two years baker didnt play but he said recently he had 
quit drugs he began recording again and made an album with pop 
star elvis costello 
in 1974 critic john s wilson wrote in the new york times that 
baker had developed more range and assertiveness within the 
wistfully ruminative style with which he has also been associated 
baker had scheduled several appearances in the netherlands as 
part of a tour that also included west berlin and france 
he had been staying at the prins hendrik hotel close to 
amsterdams drug district said wilting 
the way it looks he had just been using heroin wilting 
told the associated press traces of heroin use were found in 
bakers hotel room he added 
maybe he started acting funny said wilting he was alone 
and shoved the window open himself and either fell or jumped out 
i dont suppose well ever find out which 
a receptionist at the hotel where baker checked in thursday 
said the musician was a little nervous when he arrived he did 
not elaborate 
the receptionist who refused to give his name said the window 
of bakers room slides open vertically leaving a 10inch gap at 
most 
how he got through there i dont know the receptionist 
said he must have been dead straight away he said 
the hotel official said baker showed no signs of drug abuse

endeavour are used as motherships or oil storage depots 
the sources said the spanishflag 235000ton barcelona which 
was taking on cargo from the seawise giant was sinking as a result 
of the attack four spanish crewmen were missing and 26 were 
rescued said the spanish national news agency efe quoting 
londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit 
the other two stricken vessels were the 231712ton iranian 
tanker khark and the 152004ton cypriot ship argosy both shuttle 
tankers used by iran to carry oil down the persian gulf to larak 
the sources said these were still aflame but damage was not severe 
the iraqi news agency said large numbers of jets took part 
in the rare longrange raid and all returned safely to base 
an air raid siren sounded at larak around 105 pm 505 am 
edt as iraqi warplanes made one of their rare longrange raids on 
larak at the northern end of the strait of hormuz the gulfs 
gateway 
the seawise giant also was hit in iraqi raids last year once in 
october and again in december the huge vessel is chartered by 
irans governmentowned oil company as a floating storage depot for 
oil at the larak terminal 
it was not known whether the burmah endeavour was serving as a 
similiar role or picking up an oil cargo 
most of irans oil customers pick up shipments from larak the 
iranians use a special fleet of chartered tankers to shuttle crude 
to larak from the kharg island terminal in the northeastern gulf 
kharg 350 miles from larak is in the iraqideclared exclusion 
zone where ships entering are susceptible to attack 
shipping sources said the iranians apparently warned off a us 
warship when it tried to move closer to larak to check out the 
situation the unidentified american ship was not heard to reply 
and radios afterward were silent the sources said 
a us source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
us navy had monitored a radio message from an iranian f4 phantom 
jet requesting permission to attack a ship there was no 
american vessel in the area at the time and there was no 
indication of what ship was referred to the source said 
us warships are now permitted to intervene on request in 
attacks on neutral shipping as well as to provide humanitarian 
aid to nonus flag vessels but only in international waters 
todays attack occurred inside irans territorial waters 
the iraqis have recently intensifed air raids on tankers plying 
iranian waters as part of baghdads bid to throttle the vital oil 
exports that help tehran finance the 7yearold war 
the baghdad high command has claimed nine air raids on large 
maritime targets meaning ships off irans coast in the past two 
weeks three have been confirmed by lloyds shipping intelligence 
unit 
iraqi attacks mainly are directed at tankers in iranian waters 
closer to kharg and sometimes off lavan island a terminal in the 
central gulf 
iraqi air forays against larak which would necessitate midair 
refueling of the jets are rare

praise for jesse jackson and a talk on party unity from new york 
gov mario cuomo helped calm troubled waters between jackson and 
democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis but cuomo 
continued to withhold his endorsement of either man 
vice president george bush meanwhile campaigned at a defense 
plant in fullerton calif where he called dukakis views on 
defense naive at best and warned they would be dangerous 
dukakis spent much of friday fending off attacks from jackson 
and bush suggesting his democratic rivals call for a big spending 
increase for education doesnt make any sense in the face of 
federal budget deficits 
cuomo emerged friday from a 1hour private meeting in san 
francisco with jackson saying the democrats needed him 
the democratic party needs reverand jackson for his personal 
input for his personal capacity for his ability to deal with the 
issues intelligently not just to articulate them which he does 
with eloquence and effectiveness but understanding the issues 
especially questions of foreign policy cuomo said at a 
fundraiser for a local congressional candidate 
but cuomo who eliminated himself as a possible presidential 
contender last month during his states sometimes rancorous 
primary also praised dukakis as a man of great intelligence 
great sensitivity and great practicality 
the balancing act helped cuomo keep an earlier promise not to 
endorse any candidate until after the june 7 california primary 
where 336 delegates to the national convention are at stake 
jackson immediately praised cuomos stand on an endorsement 
saying that waiting until after june 7 is the appropriate thing 
to do that was the governors commitment and he has remained true 
to his position 
jackson put in an appearance earlier friday at a drug treatment 
center in los angeles jackson who has made fighting drugs a 
primary theme of his campaign criticized dukakis for not putting 
forth a comprehensive plan 
and in an interview with the new york times jackson compared 
dukakis with bush saying like bush dukakis almost brags about 
putting forth no plans like bush dukakis says i have not said 
anything concrete to anybody about anything 
we fundamentally are on the same side of history said 
jackson later muting his criticism of dukakis following his 
meeting with cuomo 
bush the certain republican nominee told the crowd of defense 
plant workers the dukakis doctrine is the doctrine of wishful 
thinking and it is bad thinking 
the soviets respect only strength to think that they 
would agree to cuts in their strategic and conventional arsenals in 
the face of unilateral american abandonment of major weapons 
programs is the height of folly 
bush also went on the offensive on the environmental issue 
i want to make the environment a republican issue he told a 
cheering crowd of about 800 republicans at a rally in portland 
oregon i would like to be remembered the same way as teddy 
roosevelt next to the national security its the condition of 
the earth that you will leave to generations to come we can do 
better 
meanwhile a pollster for president reagan said friday that bush 
faces an uphill battle against likely democratic nominee dukakis in 
november because of growing national pessimism about the countrys 
future 
richard wirthlin in an interview with the detroit news said a 
national survey he completed last month for the republican national 
committee found that polls showing bush trailing dukakis are 
accurate 
bush is behind at this point wirthlin said i dont 
believe he is in a hole that he cant get out of but he has a 
major task ahead 
wirthlin who has advised reagan for eight years worked for 
bushs early political season rival kansas sen bob dole 
bush was to visit a tree nursery near medford ore today take 
a raft trip sunday and visit a tree research lab in washington on 
monday 
dukakis dismissed jacksons accusation that he is too vague 
pointing to his record as massachusetts governor 
it will come as a surprise to the white house and mr bush if 
my views on the world and my style of political leadership has any 
similarity to his one of the things i have is a record people 
dont have to guess about it he said 
speaking to about 200 students at jefferson high school in daly 
city in a suburb of san francisco dukakis warned against illegal 
drugs and called for increased public emphasis on education 
his wife kitty told students of her own 26year dependency on 
diet pills 
dukakis also hit back at jackson on education 
you cant go around talking about 20 billion more for public 
education out of the federal budget when youve got a 170 billion 
deficit that doesnt make any sense he said youve got to 
pick your priorities and pick them carefully

they turn out faithfully to wave 
banners and chant slogans for their exiled leaders return but 
supporters of ferdinand marcos are dwindling and some of his 
former champions believe the ousted president is history 
the death may 4 of marcos mother josefa edralinmarcos 
revived the spirits of his diehard followers they have 
transformed her wake into an ongoing rally to demand that marcos 
70 be allowed to return from exile in hawaii for the funeral 
give us marcos or give us death read the banners in 
downtown manila on saturday as thousands rallied to demand the 
ousted leaders return 
nearly 10000 marcos supporters turned out wednesday for a noisy 
rally and vowed to camp near president corazon aquinos residence 
until she changed her mind and allowed their leader to come home 
but most of the crowd drifted away in the hot summer night even 
before the 4 am deadline imposed by the military for them to 
disperse 
more than two years after a popular uprising drove marcos from 
power thousands of filipinos still long for the return of the 
apo or the grand old man who dominated philippine 
politics for two decades 
but most filipinos dont expect let alone want him to return 
to power 
mrs aquino refused to let marcos come home for his mothers 
funeral citing his continued threat to national security in the 
wake of several attempts to topple her 
another fact that the loyalists would have to accept is that 
marcos is already part of history and that mrs aquino is president 
of the philippines for better or worse until 1992 wrote 
columnist alvin capino in the philippine daily globe which has 
been critical of her leadership 
marcos loyalists are loosely organized into several political 
groups including the i am a filipino movement and the new 
society movement 
those groups routinely muster crowds of several hundred who 
turn out for promarcos rallies at public squares and in front of 
the american embassy 
the crowds are a curious mix of middleaged men and women aging 
movie queens former marcosera officials and northerners studying 
in manila 
reliable figures on the number of marcos supporters are 
unavailable his lawyer rafael recto insists that marcos still 
enjoys broad albeit discreet support 
after all marcos was elected and proclaimed by the people 
while cory was just put in the chair by two men ramos and 
enrile recto told the newspaper businessworld 
he was referring to the role of sen juan ponce enrile a former 
defense minister and defense secretary fidel ramos the former 
military chief in the february 1986 uprising that toppled marcos 
but results of congressional elections in may 1987 and of 
regional balloting last january show the new society movement with 
little support except in marcos native north and in scattered 
areas of mindanao island 
loyalty to marcos remains strongest in his home province ilocos 
norte and other areas of northern luzon where the ilocano language 
is spoken ilocanos make up about 10 percent of the 58 million 
filipinos and have a reputation here for clannishness 
the trouble with us ilocanos is we feel prouder of the honor 
of having a president from among us rather than the benefits it 
brings said rosario lazo an ilocano member of a proaquino 
party in a recent interview 
elsewhere there are numerous signs that most filipinos no 
longer believe marcos has a role to play in philippine politics 
a survey of about 2000 manila residents conducted in march and 
released thursday by the respected ateneo social weather station 
found that the percentage of those who opposed marcos return 
declined from 68 percent in october to 39 percent in march but it 
appeared the decline was due more to a feeling that marcos was no 
longer a danger than to any new support for him 
even some military dissidents who have tried to topple the 
government seem reluctant to link themselves to marcos 
rightwing sources say former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan leader of the aug 28 coup attempt has refused to join 
with two other renegades former lt col reynaldo cabauatan and 
former brig gen jose marie zumel because of their 
identification with marcos 
honasan who escaped from a prison ship last month played a key 
role in the february 1986 military revolt that triggered the mass 
uprising against marcos 
rep ramon durano jr a congressman from cebu island and son of 
marcos longtime friend and political ally ramon durano sr said 
recently that despite personal ties to the marcos family political 
reality has forced him to cooperate with the aquino administration 
if i dont cooperate with the administration my bills wont 
get passed and i cant work for my constituents he said

after a fouryear study on new technologies 
the government has concluded that the next two decades will be a 
time of massive change in which virtually every us product 
service and job will be reshaped 
the study done by the congressional office of technology 
assessment and released on saturday said that americans in the 
21st century should enjoy longer more productive lives than any 
preceding generation 
the study said that emerging technologies should offer the 
opportunity to expand educational opportunities extend life and 
reduce sickness and make work more rewarding by using machines for 
tedious repetitive jobs 
but the study warned that rapid change also threatens to shake 
the foundations of the most secure american businesses 
with each opportunity for progress there are opportunities 
for serious misstep the study said change can create an 
america in graceless decline its living standards falling behind 
those of other world powers 
the report is titled technology and the american economic 
transition eight congressional committees ordered researchers to 
take an indepth look at the forces now at work on society and what 
the implications were for policymakers 
we know that we are moving away from an economy heavily 
dependent on raw materials where most businesses were isolated 
from international trade said project director henry kelly 
as one example of how change has already reshaped the country 
the study said that the number of lawyers bankers scientists and 
accountants needed to supply americans with food was now roughly 
equal to the number of farmers 
in fact only four out of every 100 jobs in food production is 
on the farm more than half of the jobs in food production now are 
held by sales people precision craftsmen managers and data entry 
clerks 
the study said that for the country to take full advantage of 
emerging technologies congress should consider making fundamental 
changes in its tax laws and various government regulations 
regulations designed to protect consumers may have 
outlived their usefulness in areas ranging from banking to housing 
to electric utilities the study said 
in the tax area the study urged reducing or abolishing the tax 
on capital gains and reforming or abolishing the corporate income 
tax the report said these taxes reduce needed investment to boost 
us productivity 
the study also said that the deduction for housing interest 
should be limited to a fixed amount because it made little sense to 
encourage investment savings in the form of home purchases but not 
permit the complete deductibility of educational expenses because 
this discouraged investment in human capital 
among the reports predictions about the future 
new technologies for collecting storing and manipulating 
information have the potential to revolutionize the economy 
businesses are already spending 40 percent of their investment 
dollar on computers and other information machines double the 
1978 share 
the potential productivity gains in this area the movement 
and organization of information are at least as great as those 
produced by the first industrial revolution the study said 
increased foreign competition was inevitable with the 
postworld war ii recovery of japan and western europe and the 
emergence of sophisticated production in places like korea and 
taiwan undisputed us economic leadership may be lost but the 
change does not necessarily mean that us living standards will 
decline living standards in britain rose steadily for a century 
after it lost its dominant position in the world economy 
consolidation of farm ownership is likely to continue so that 
by the year 2000 the 14 percent of farms with annual sales higher 
than 250000 will account for between 80 percent and 90 percent of 
total sales likewise grocery stores will continue getting larger 
socalled super stores with 200000 square feet of space offering 
20000 products now account for 28 percent of all grocery store 
sales 
the us housing industry to combat the decline in home 
ownership may follow the trends of sweden and japan moving toward 
prefabricated homes built on assembly lines sold in showrooms and 
then put together on the site 
the nations educational system is on the brink of major 
technological changes through the use of computers that will make 
learning more productive and fun while allowing teachers more time 
to spend with individual students

attorney general edwin meese iii has told 
president reagan he shared objections by prosecutors to dismissing 
drug trafficking charges against panamanian military leader manuel 
antonio noriega one of the prosecutors says 
meese told me that he also opposed any dismissal and he 
would convey my thoughts to the president us attorney leon 
kellner of miami said friday after meeting with the attorney 
general in washington 
he did that today kellner said 
us attorney robert w merkle whose office in tampa obtained 
one of two drug indictments against noriega in february said from 
florida if he were ordered to sign an order dismissing charges 
against noriega they wouldnt have to fire me i would resign 
i could not myself sign an order of dismissal but i may not 
be in a position to stop it merkle said friday in his first 
public comment about the negotitations reportedly going on to 
remove the military leader from power 
reagan administration officials have said they were plea 
bargaining with the panamanian military chief and de facto ruler 
over the possible dropping of drugsmuggling indictments returned 
in february by grand juries in miami and tampa fla 
the state department apparently believes that dismissal of the 
indictments is the only way to induce noriegas departure but the 
justice department sees that concession as too high a price to pay 
but kellner said dismissing the case would send the wrong 
message to the people of this country 
what it says is that the bigger you are and if you have more 
threats to give to this country well let you get away with 
criminality kellner said explaining his objections 
how do we continue going after the little fish when the 
big fish can walk away he said referring in particular to the 
colombiabased medellin cartel 
as he has since word of a possible deal with noriega leaked out 
wednesday meese told reporters he would have no comment on the 
matter 
sen bob dole rkan today lauded the administrations 
objective of getting rid of noriega but said the charges against 
him must stand letting him off the hook would send exactly the 
wrong message at exactly the wrong time to the worlds drug 
kingpins the peddlers of death and misery said the former 
presidential candidate in a statement released by his office 
at the white house on friday presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater was asked about assertions by noriega that negotiations 
with the united states on his eventual departure from power have 
collapsed 
he says that all the time fitzwater said he said fall 
apart or something similar before 
we are still talking we are still negotiating 
fitzwater said elliott abrams assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs met with reagan on friday afternoon he 
would not say what the subject of the meeting was or who else if 
anyone attended 
the president left for his weekend at camp david a halfhour 
later than originally scheduled but fitzwater would not say 
whether the meeting caused the delay 
earlier friday panamas foreign minister denied that noriega 
was negotiating to have the drug charges dropped 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter interviewed on 
abctvs good morning america said no deal involving noriega 
was imminent and the drug indictment isnt really part of the 
negotiations he did not elaborate on what was being discussed 
a top state department official michael kozak has been engaged 
in secret negotiations with noriega in panama and administration 
sources said wednesday the military chieftain was told that if he 
left panama for a year perhaps in august the indictments would be 
dropped 
however noriega said friday night i have not talked with mr 
kozak and he called for the us ambassador to panama to leave 
the country 
the dignity of panama is not negotiable while there are 
foreign troops on our territory humiliating our soil while there 
is economic aggression as long as there are threats as long as 
there is psychological war as long as ambassador arthur davis 
does not get out noriega said during a meeting in rio hato 60 
miles southwest of panama city 
state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty said she had no 
comment on noriegas statements or whether the united states was 
considering withdrawing davis from panama 
noriega has survived widespread public protests and an economic 
collapse at home as well as sustained us diplomatic and economic 
pressure

parts of george orwells celebrated novel 1984 
about a mindnumbing totalitarian society have been published in 
the soviet union with an introduction saying soviets are ready to 
judge it for themselves 
however the excerpts appearing in this weeks literaturnaya 
gazeta also carry an editorsnote suggesting orwells fictional 
society bears no resemblance to the soviet union of today 
the page of excerpts was published in the literary newspaper 
with an introduction by sergei zalygin editor of novy mir 
magazine novy mir plans to publish the 1949 novel in full later 
this year the novel has never before been published in the soviet 
union 
the excerpts included the omnipresent warning of orwells 
imaginary regime that big brother is watching you and the 
mindbending recitations of the ministry of truth that war is 
peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength 
orwell an indianborn briton who died in 1950 grappled with 
the nature of human freedom in his essays and novels which include 
animal farm 
zalygin compared orwells 1984 with the writings of mikhail 
bulgakov and yevgeny zamyatin their tales of dictatorship the 
master and margarita and we were long suppressed 
its possible that orwell wrote his work with a concrete 
address the address of socialism but that time has been passed 
when we were frightened and to put it delicately confused 
zalygin wrote 
the repression that marked josef v stalins 29 years in power 
has been denounced by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev who has 
also advocated a freer hand in the arts and release of longbanned 
literary works 
zalygin wrote of orwell now not only can he judge us but we 
judge him as we know where he was right and where he was not 
popular novels often are serialized in largecirculation monthly 
journals in the soviet union where books are usually published in 
too small a quantity to satisfy public demand

the nicaraguan contras poorly supplied and 
politically divided may face disintegration with impact beyond 
nicaraguas borders according to us officials 
less than two months after the rebels signed a temporary 
ceasefire agreement with nicaraguas leftist government 
administration analysts on central america say the contras future 
seems bleak for a variety of reasons 
up to 3000 rebels denied delivery of us humanitarian aid 
shipments have fled across the nicaraguan border into honduras in 
search of food 
serious rifts have emerged in the contra ranks an undetermined 
number of rebels mutinied recently against military commander 
enrique bermudez at a contra camp in southern honduras bermudez 
also faces opposition from at least two members of the rebel 
political directorate 
if fighting resumes after the current cease fire ends on june 
1 the contras have enough military supplies to last only one to 
two months congress rejected president reagans military aid 
request on feb 3 and there is little support at present for a 
reversal of that decision 
soviet military supplies are continuing to flow to the 
sandinistas at a rate slightly ahead of the 1987 pace according to 
us estimates soviet military deliveries totaled 105 million for 
the first three months of 1988 
the contras seem to be in the process of disintegrating 
said one official insisting on anonymity the consolidation of 
sandinista rule is upon us 
the official said all of the predictions he and some others in 
the administration had made in february after the congressional 
rejection of contra aid are being borne out 
specifically he said the aid vote has contributed to increasing 
rightleft political polarization in guatemala reflected in a 
failed military coup attempt there last week and in el salvador 
where the rightist arena party won impressively in national 
elections in march the official said 
he added that the prospective demise of the usbacked rebels 
in nicaragua has had the effect of emboldening leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador who are aligned with the sandinistas 
these views however are not universally shared in the 
administration another official also speaking privately said the 
trends in guatemala and el salvador are the result of internal 
developments unrelated to the situation in nicaragua 
the prevailing view among more conservative members of the 
administration is that consolidation of sandinista rule would 
generate nervousness in neighboring countries forcing them to 
shift priorities from democratic development to concerns over 
internal security 
if military coups occur congress would retaliate by drastically 
reducing assistance creating both economic hardship and increasing 
sympathy for leftist rebels according to this scenario 
the contras and the sandinistas signed a temporary truce in 
sapoa nicaragua on march 23 they agreed to try to negotiate a 
permanent ceasefire during a 60day period starting april 1 
with the deadline for reaching agreement on formally ending 
their sixyear war just two weeks away there has been virtually no 
progress toward that objective 
disputes between the sandinistas and the contras have prevented 
delivery of us humanitarian aid to the rebels inside nicaragua 
leaving the administration with no option but to try to send them 
cash via couriers 
if no final agreement is reached by the june 1 deadline the 
contras have two obvious alternatives available to them neither 
very promising the officials said 
as one official described it the contras could resume the war 
and face defeat against superior sandinista firepower or they 
could reach agreement with the sandinistas on a truce extension 
enabling the sandinistas to maintain slowpace negotiations in 
hopes that total demoralization of the rebels eventually would set 
in 
if the sandinistas decide to resume the war this would win 
renewed sympathy for the rebels in the us congress but the 
contras also could be confronted with what one official said was 
the possibility of a quick knockout blow 
in that case he said if the congress decides to approve more 
aid there would be no one to give the aid to

the south once solidly democratic in 
presidential races but now reliably republican is a tough 
battleground for michael dukakis as he tries to put together an 
electoral coalition to defeat george bush and enable the party to 
recapture the white house 
with many states in the politically conservative region viewed 
as beyond his reach in november dukakis is being urged to choose a 
running mate who could help the democrats carry texas or florida 
the two largest states south of the masondixon line 
dukakis won the democratic primaries in both those states on 
super tuesday a fact that gives democrats reason for optimism 
supporters of the massachusetts governor also are quick to argue 
that bush does not have the hold on southern voters that ronald 
reagan could claim 
its possible for dukakis to find the 270vote electoral college 
majority outside the south a coalition that would require every 
big industrial state in the north plus california and farm belt 
states where economic hard times the past seven years have made the 
reaganbush administration politically unpopular 
but any dukakis strategy without the south would require an 
electoral shift of historic proportions for a democratic victory in 
november 
they cannot let us sweep it the south said vince breglio 
a republican consultant and authority on electoral college 
strategies if we take florida texas georgia north carolina 
and the rest of the cotton south i dont think they can win 
what i cant figure out is how you get the numbers if you 
dont run strong in the south said walter f mondale the 1984 
democratic presidential nominee 
mitch daniels who served president reagan as white house 
political director predicted that the democrats would decide the 
south is a mirage and that their best hope lies in a sweep of the 
industrial belt 
larry sabato a political scientist at the university of 
virginia said that if the political trends go in dukakis 
direction and he is headed for a big victory he would run well in 
the south but if its a close election id say he has very 
little hope of carrying much outside of perhaps a couple of border 
states 
for generations 16 southern and border states gave democratic 
presidential candidates a solid electoral base in 1944 franklin 
d roosevelt took all 167 electoral votes from those states 
dwight d eisenhower broke the democratic hold on the region in 
1952 and 1956 and in 1964 when democrat lyndon b johnson crushed 
sen barry goldwater the only bright spot for the arizona 
republican was the deep south alabama georgia louisiana 
mississippi and south carolina resisted the johnson landslide and 
backed goldwater the only states outside of arizona to support him 
since then southern and border states have voted strongly 
republican except in 1976 when georgian jimmy carter was the 
democratic candidate in 1980 reagan took 138 of the regions 169 
electoral votes and four years later the republican president 
received all but the 3 electoral votes of the district of columbia 
democratic pollster natalie davis is based in alabama and she 
pointed out that in 1984 mondale got 13 percent of the white vote 
in the state 
if the white vote tripled and the black vote came out the way 
it was supposed to then dukakis would beat bush by half a 
percentage point she said think about that as a mission 
weve got to triple what we did in 84 
when claibourne darden an atlantabased pollster was asked how 
dukakis was playing in the south he replied he doesnt play so 
hot he is your classical party activist democratic candidate for 
president of which weve seen many come and all go 
there was little agreement on whether texas or florida would 
offer the best hope for a dukakis breakthrough 
texas is where bush makes his home where he first became active 
in politics and where he was elected to a house seat 
a texas democrat who insisted on anonymity called it highly 
unlikely that dukakis could carry the state as unlikely that 
reagan would carry minnesota in 84 
jim quackenbush who was southern coordinator for the mondale 
campaign said he thought dukakis had a better chance of carrying 
texas than of winning florida 
florida is just a hard state for a democrat to take he said 
florida democrats talked optimistically about dukakis prospects 
against bush in their state 
the decision on the vice presidency will be fundamental 
said wayne bailey a professor of political science at stetson 
university in deland fla and a democratic party activist 
if dukakis chooses sen sam nunn of georgia or sen bob graham 
of florida said bailey the ticket will be very saleable in 
florida 
richard pettigrew former democratic chairman in dade county 
fla said nunn or sen albert gore jr of tennessee or sen john 
glenn of ohio would be the strongest running mates for dukakis 
because they would assure people on foreign and defense policy 
pettigrew and quackenbush said nunn would be a lot more 
effective in the south than graham 
sabato took the opposite view he said nunn might not get 
dukakis any state other than georgia while the senator could add a 
couple of points to the ticket in other southern states it might 
not be enough to carry any of them 
graham would make much more sense he said because the 
senator could bring home florida for the democrats 
even a partisan like quackenbush conceded that in the south if 
youre from massachusetts whether its reality or perception 
youre perceived as a liberal 
but he contended that dukakis can win support in the south by 
emphasizing the idea that as a governor he has been a fiscal 
conservative 
a big plus for dukakis in the south is the perception that bush 
does not have the hold on voters that reagan had 
bushs hold on southern voters is not intense said sabato 
nobody gets excited about george bush said davis

police on saturday detained 18 people 
demonstrating against the government of sitiveni rabuka as fiji 
marked the first anniversary of a military takeover that catapulted 
rabuka to power 
rabuka celebrated his first year in power by attending an army 
parade where he exhorted soldiers to be considerate in preserving 
order this weekend 
troops remained on full alert as a precaution against possible 
violence but no major trouble was reported 
police broke up a demonstration for democracy in downtown 
suva while rabuka attended the parade at the queen elizabeth 
barracks army headquarters he told his troops to be mindful that 
some sections of the community had suffered as a result of the coup 
the celebrations should not make things worse for people who 
might fear for their safety and their property said rabuka in 
an apparent reference to indians who outnumber ethnic fijians in 
the 715000 population 
on may 14 1987 rabuka then a lieutenant colonel and third in 
the armys chain of command led 10 masked soldiers into parliament 
and arrested the elected indianmajority coalition government of 
prime minister timoci bavadra 
rabuka said he staged the coup to protect the interests of 
ethnic fijians who comprise 47 percent of the population bavadra 
had been in office only a month after defeating prime minister ratu 
sir kamisese mara in april elections 
after the coup an interim government was set up but when it 
didnt please rabuka he staged a second takeover on sept 25 
since then a nervous calm has settled over fiji the countrys 
touristbased economy is in shambles 
gross domestic product is down 11 percent sugar production 
the countrys major cash crop is down 203 percent tourism has 
plummeted 269 percent and the fiji dollar has been devalued by 33 
percent 
at his home in viseisei western fiji bavadra issued a 
statement vowing to continue to push for racial equality in fiji a 
group of 300 islands east of australia 
at the parade rabuka presented good conduct and meritorious 
service medals to six highranking army officers several of whom 
were involved in the may 14 1987 takeover 
he told supporters that the recipients of the medals were 
shining examples to follow 
among the demonstrators were members of the fiji womens rights 
organization and a catholic priest the women wearing black as a 
sign of mourning carried placards denouncing the coup 
banners reading only one race the human race and 
democracy lives were torn down by police who told the crowd to 
leave before it got out of control 
when they refused to move police herded some people into vans 
and took them away officials said the demonstrators were not 
charged and would be released later 
other demonstrators went to st andrews presbysterian church 
where watched from outside by police and soldiers they held a 
religious service 
on saturday the gates at the parliament building remained 
locked fiji has had no parliament since the coup and is now 
governed by an interim administration led by mara while a new 
constitution is being written to guarantee power for ethnic fijians 
no other incidents were reported and the army was not much in 
evidence around the country except for guards at key points such 
as power installations

the citys fire chief says he will seek a 
criminal investigation into an alleged delay by security guards in 
reporting a fire that ravaged the states tallest skyscraper 
fire chief don manning said friday he intends to pursue legal 
action to the extent possible in the wake of the may 4 inferno 
that devastated four floors of the first interstate bank tower and 
left one man dead 
security personnel allegedly failed to notify the fire 
department of the fire in a timely manner which is a violation of 
the los angeles municipal code said battalion chief dean cathey 
city officials said security guards reset fire alarms that went 
off on the 12th floor because they believed them to be false they 
say guards delayed notifying authorities for seven minutes 
allowing the blaze to spread through the 12th floor of the 62floor 
office building 
jim clauson an official with pedus security services inc has 
disputed fire officials version of events clauson said pedus 
guards called the fire department about a minute after the alarms 
went off 
fire officials said that when fire alarms sounded a third time 
on the 12th floor security officers sent a building engineer to 
the 12th floor to investigate the worker alex handy 24 died in 
the blaze 
manning spoke friday during state senate hearings currently 
being conducted in los angeles on proposed firesprinkler 
legislation a bill would require the installation of fire 
sprinklers in all highrise buildings in california 
clauson did not return telephone seeking comment about the 
investigation ordered by manning

outgoing secretary of education william j 
bennett says that if he runs for any political office in the 
future it will be the presidency 
bennett told the associated press that such an effort may be 
years away but after watching some of the people in the stakes 
for the presidency i could do that well 
i wont mention anybody in particular the outspoken 
educator said but he added that he was referring to both 
republican and democratic hopefuls 
bennett who announced last monday he is quitting the cabinet in 
midseptember to write and lecture brought up the white house 
himself when asked in an interview if he aspired to run for the 
senate 
bennett said he has had overtures about possible senate races 
from his native state of new york his adopted state of north 
carolina and from maryland where he now lives 
but he said neither the senate nor the possibility of a college 
presidency holds any interest for him 
right now if i were going to run for anything in the future 
id want to run for president he volunteered 
asked about the vice presidency bennett said im not sure 
id make a very good no 2 man i like to run things 
vice president george bush who has already locked up the gop 
nomination says he wants to be the education president his 
campaign has kept its distance from the controversial bennett who 
has warred with teacher unions and pilloried college presidents 
bennett did not mention bush by name but said well probably 
have a good republican president in 88 wholl be there for a 
couple of terms if i do this this could be way in the future 
a lifelong democrat bennett switched to the gop in may 1986 15 
months after president reagan put him in the cabinet he has proven 
a big draw at republican functions across the country 
asked if he was now wedded to the gop the 44yearold bennett 
replied probably 
only probably 
well sure look i was a democrat i shifted to the 
republican party because the democrats left the ranch and deserted 
their principles i dont see that happening in the republican 
party but i put country above party always have he said 
this will no doubt shock by sheer chutzpah some of my critics 
but we were not political we were principled and a lot of our 
principles went to the heart of what ronald reagan stands for 
and what a lot of liberal democrats stand against he said 
i know that im popular with audiences out there in the 
country and it doesnt seem to make much difference whether 
theyre democrats or republicans he said 
he said his relations with the education establishment may be at 
their worst but i would bet my relations with the american 
people are at an alltime high 
bennett expressed no regrets about his penchant for 
controversies 
he said he probably drove some people crazy by speaking out 
at cabinet meetings on issues other than education 
he said he decided from the start that i may never have a job 
like this again so im going to do it all the way 
sometimes people rolled their eyes and said there he goes 
again he related i talked about drugs a lot use of the 
military and justice ginsburg aids and nicaragua but i decided i 
wasnt going to leave this job and say darn it i should have 
said this boy if i had it to do all over again 
bennett took it upon himself to call douglas ginsburg last nov 
6 to urge him to withdraw as a supreme court nominee after 
ginsburgs admission that he smoked marijuana while a harvard law 
professor ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration the next 
day 
bennett said he has not considered making such a call to his 
mentor edwin meese iii the embattled attorney general 
no i have not its an entirely different situation what 
you have in the case of ed is lots of allegations no evidence 
bennett said 
asked if he were comfortable with an attorney general under 
constant investigation bennett replied it would be nicer it 
would be better if business were smoother but no one feels more 
uncomfortable than ed about getting all this but thats not a 
situation im going to enter into 
asked about the setbacks reagan has suffered of late bennett 
said there have been a lot of fly bites people nipping at him 
but with time the little things will slip away and the large 
impact will be clear he said this is a very great man 
and a good and important presidency

famed kenyan flyer beryl markham possessed 
the grace of the african animals she grew up with and her 
admirers admit at times was as cunning and ruthless 
beryl markham a shadow on the sun cbs fourhour 
miniseries starring stefanie powers as the famed aviator and author 
of west with the night a stirring account of life in colonial 
africa airs sunday and tuesday 
she was as much the scarlett ohara of british east africa as 
she was a wellliked african queen of the bushland said mary 
lovell author of straight on till morning the 1987 biography 
of markham 
markham tall slender selfpossessed fascinated people drawn 
to her fearless garboesque nature throughout her life her solo 
flight across the atlantic in 1936 the first from east to west 
made her an international heroine 
the miniseries which is actually based on a vanity fair article 
by james fox traces markhams life from childhood in british east 
africa where she hunted wild pig with nandi tribesmen she became 
the continents first female bush pilot and a renowned thoroughbred 
horse trainer 
according to her biographer markham angered and even frightened 
people with an imperious and pedantic nature 
people either utterly loved or loathed her said lovell in 
a recent interview from her home in england 
as if to make that point the movie details markhams often 
disastrous personal life including three failed marriages and love 
affairs with flyer tom campbell black and denys finchhatton the 
english elephant hunter played by robert redford in out of 
africa 
in her critically acclaimed memoirs west with the night 
first published in 1942 markham was praised as having a poets 
feeling for her land but preoccupied with the advent of world 
war ii the american public virtually ignored the book 
following its rediscovery by marin county calif restaurateur 
george gutekunst the book was republished in 1983 by may 7 it had 
sold 500000 copies it was listed on the new york times 
bestseller list for 79 weeks 
in some areas fascination with markham approaches cult status 
according to bernice green a new york publicist for cbs 
i cant believe that this was a woman who did what she did 
more than 50 years ago said green 
kenya in the 1920s and 1930s was a haven for titled europeans 
and markham lived among the upper class which earned the nickname 
the happy valley set in british newspapers because of their 
relatively loose morals 
those who knew markham described her as possessing an enchanting 
beauty critic judith thurman writes that to the common 
imagination she was a sort of circe referring to the greek 
mythological enchantress who turned men into beasts 
gutekunst said he was taken aback when he met markham in kenya 
for the first time ever the flirt she took to calling him 
georgieporgie borrowing from the nursery rhyme in which the 
boy kissed the girls and made them cry 
i called her the garbo of east africa not just because she 
really was beautiful at her age even when i first met her at 82 
but because of her carriage her long swanlike neck the mystery 
the confidence said gutekunst 
markham soared west across the atlantic in 1936 becoming the 
first person to fly solo from england to north america where she 
crashlanded in a bog in nova scotia she then fell into obscurity 
but not before tumultuous years in the united states where she 
worked as a consultant for hollywood producers married a heavy 
drinker published her biography and worked intermittently as a 
shortstory writer 
markham was born in melton mowbray leicestershire in england 
and was brought to a farm in kenya by her divorced father retired 
british army capt charles b clutterbuck 
she had less than four years of formal education but said her 
father made her read widely later she was given a crash course in 
literature and music by finchhatton the oxfordeducated 
aristocrat and lover of danish baroness karen blixen who wrote as 
isak dinesen 
by 1936 several planes had crossed the atlantic westward from 
europe but all had at least two people aboard markham in a 
singleengine percival gull monoplane departed britains abingdon 
royal air force aerodrome on sept 4 
despite crashlanding because of low fuel she was given a 
tickertape parade in new york her original goal markham died in 
nairobi in 1986 at the age of 83

abnormal atmospheric pressure patterns over 
the pacific ocean and western united states during the summer and 
fall may trigger earthquakes in california including deadly jolts 
in july 1986 and last october a scientist says 
ive found tantalizing but not completely conclusive evidence 
of a relationship between sealevel pressure patterns and their 
associated winds and moderate and larger earthquakes said 
meteorologist jerome namias 
namias spent 30 years as chief of the national weather services 
extended forecast division in washington and is now affiliated with 
scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla his work in 
longrange weather forecasting is widely respected 
the statistical correlation between earthquakes and air pressure 
is weak difficult to explain in scientifically respectable terms 
and definitely a farout idea said namias in a recent 
telephone interview 
but he speculated that if atmospheric pressure patterns are 
related to quakes it may be because winds associated with the 
patterns raise offshore sea levels slightly putting more pressure 
on the earth 
we know so little about why earthquakes occur when they do 
that weve got to keep an open mind even on what seems like a 
farout kind of idea said geologist clarence allen of the 
california institute of technology 
allen said that while he guesses the correlation will turn out 
to be coincidental its too early to rule out these kinds of 
things and namias is certainly a very respected scientist 
forces from unsual air pressure patterns and higher sea levels 
are smaller than the moons tidal influence on earth and its 
oceans and seismologists still debate whether lunar gravity 
triggers quakes said tom heaton scientist in charge of the us 
geological surveys pasadena office 
if we cant prove that tides do it it seems a longshot that 
any pattern of atmospheric pressure does it heaton said 
namias said he studied caltechs list of california quakes 
measuring 45 or more in the richter scale since 1947 
he found the quakes tended to occur more often a month to six 
weeks after the onset of an abnormally strong gradient between very 
high sealevel atmospheric pressure over the eastern half of the 
north pacific and very low surfacelevel pressure over the 
interior portion of the western third of the nation 
the unusual pattern existed prior to the 59magnitude whittier 
narrows quake and its aftershocks which rocked southern california 
last october killing eight people injuring more than 200 and 
causing 358 million in damage namias said 
he said the same pattern preceded three hefty jolts in july 
1986 the 59magnitude july 8 palm springs quake which caused 
53 million in damage the 53magnitude july 13 oceanside quake 
which killed one person injured 28 others and caused 720000 in 
damage and the 6magnitude july 21 chalfant valley quake near 
bishop which caused 436500 in damage 
the abnormal pattern involved barometer readings of roughly 301 
inches of mercury offshore and roughly 2975 over the interior 
namias said 
namias said the unusual largescale pattern is unrelated to 
local weather or to what some people contend is earthquake 
weather unseasonably hot dry windy conditions such as those 
last october 
namias said he first noticed the quakeair pressure pattern 
correlation years ago but even after the 1986 quakes he decided 
id keep my mouth shut on the topic because he knew 
seismologists would be dubious 
he changed his mind after last octobers shocks writing a paper 
published last month in the journal geophysical research letters 
namias said he noted the quakeair pressure correlation only 
during summer and fall months and that winter and spring 
circulation patterns apparently discourage the phenomenon 
in addition to speculating that winds related to the pressure 
pattern might raise sea levels namias said largescale winds might 
affect the ground directly he said earths rotation and thus the 
length of a day changes slightly over decades because of wind drag 
on earths surface 
other scientists have suggested a link between volcanic activity 
in indonesia and atmospheric pressure wind and sea levels namias 
said

the decision by congress to order the military 
into the war on drugs came despite warnings from pentagon leaders 
that soldiers arent trained for civilian law enforcement and fears 
it may blur the line between military and civilian authority 
our people are not trained to read miranda rights they are 
trained to shoot to kill defense secretary frank carlucci told 
congress last week 
sen ted steven ralaska said the military is uncomfortable 
with this thats true and i think there are very tricky questions 
here but they have to realize that the american public wants them 
to help 
theres a war going on against our people a war of drugs and 
we need the militarys help in fighting that war said stevens 
two weeks ago the house voted 38523 to order president reagan 
to have the military seal off us borders against drug trafficking 
last friday the senate voted 836 to order an expanded military 
role including arrest powers for navy officers aboard warships 
that stop drug boats in international waters 
both votes approved amendments to the separate pentagon budget 
bills passed by each chamber the bills now go to a housesenate 
conference to reconcile differences including the militarydrug 
provisions 
carlucci and other pentagon officials have outlined two major 
fears about expanding the militarys role in the drug fight one is 
practical and the other legal 
the practical objection is that having the military fight drugs 
takes away from the pentagons main task of defending the united 
states against military threats 
the legal objection arises from the nations traditional 
separation between military and civilian authority that separation 
is most clearly spelled out by the posse comitatus act an 1878 law 
which bans the military from enforcing civilian laws 
the military are not trained for the law enforcement 
mission carlucci said last week to suddenly tell them youre 
in law enforcement you have to shift the entire focus the 
training theres a major difference between military and police 
work 
pentagon spokesman dan howard noted that devoting military 
resources to drug enforcement means those resources will have to be 
taken from somewhere else and that can affect the readiness of 
this country to defend itself 
the two fears are legitimate noted stevens and other supporters 
of an expanded military role 
i dont think were really blurring the line too much he 
said any arrests the military would make would be on the high 
seas in international waters where a member of the military has 
the same arrest power that any citizen does 
as for the effect on the militarys readiness to fight stevens 
noted i believe thats something that were going to have to 
closely watch and if there is an effect on readiness then well 
have to deal with that but they have to be ready to help this 
country fight a war thats already going on a war against drugs 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said i think its very troubling to be using the 
military this way and one must be very careful because you run 
into all sorts of potential legal problems about the separation of 
the civilian and the military 
there are also potential problems with readiness said 
aspin the military is trained for specific roles and missions 
and to the extent you take them from those missions you detract 
from readiness 
but there is tremendous pressure to act aspin noted 
people want something done and the pressure is growing 
sens bob graham dfla and pete wilson rcalif said they 
understood the militarys objections particularly on legal issues 
but both are from states with long international borders and severe 
trafficking problems and they said those facts override the fears 
we have to stop the drugs before they get into the country 
said wilson we need to stop them on the seas or in the air 
local law enforcement is being overwhelmed by a flood of drugs 
once it gets into the united states it is immeasurably more 
difficult to control 
graham said this nation faces a terribly terribly serious 
drug problem i think that there is a narrow specific role for 
arrests by the military in international waters they have the 
resources to do this 
sen alfonse damato rny said we spend hundreds of 
billions of dollars a year on the military so we can be safe but 
this nation is already at war a war were losing and we need our 
best troops in that war 
damato speaking of pentagon complaints that drug fighting will 
hurt military readiness said this is a national security issue 
our military is supposed to help protect our national security 
drugs as bad an enemy as any other enemy we would face 
the loudest critic was sen john glenn dohio a retired marine 
pilot who chastised his colleagues friday for speaking rhetoric 
for press release purposes 
we all get up posture make our little statements and it 
isnt going to make any difference said glenn he said the nation 
lacks an effective coordinated antidrug plan 
this is not the mission for the military glenn said

it was a week that should have come up all 
roses for george bush with endorsements arriving from both the 
president and his only remaining republican rival but instead 
thorns littered the way 
in recent days bush and his lieutenants have been forced to 
take the defensive on a host of issues ranging from alleged drug 
trafficking by panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega to a 
lackluster endorsement from president reagan 
some of the troubles were minor irritants others loomed as 
potential major problems as the vice president sought to translate 
his lock on the republican presidential nomination into a fall 
general election strategy 
some of the recent problems besetting the bush campaign 
he unintentionally handed jesse jackson a new issue with his 
characterization of the democrat as the hustler from chicago in 
a speech to a gop audience in nebraska jackson seized upon the 
remark saying it was offensive and showed bush had started to 
panic 
despite enjoying a mathematical lock on the gop nomination 
since the april 26 pennsylvania primary bush won only 71 percent 
of the vote in last tuesdays nebraska primary 
sen bob dole rkan who had withdrawn from the race but whose 
name appeared on the ballot captured 24 percent while pat 
robertson who endorsed bush the following day to effectively end 
his own candidacy polled 5 percent 
questions intensified about bushs prior knowledge of alleged 
drug trafficking by noriega fueled by news accounts suggesting 
that bush might have known more about the situation than he has 
professed 
the political problems for bush grew even larger with midweek 
reports suggesting the reagan administration was considering 
dropping us drug charges against the panamanian general in 
exchange for his leaving power 
bush who stresses a resume laden with foreign policy experience 
and vows a strong antidrug effort again found himself in the 
position of having to plead ignorance on noriega 
fallout from the legal difficulties surrounding attorney 
general edwin meese iii continued to swirl about the bush campaign 
heightened by ontherecord assertions by two top bush advisers 
that meese had become a campaign liability bush called the 
statements unauthorized analysts said the meese affair could hurt 
bush with voters 
and finally after weeks of jockeying between bush aides and 
the white house over the timing of president reagans formal 
endorsment of his vice president reagan finally delivered but 
with a terse statement that neither praised bush nor touched on why 
americans should vote for him 
furthermore reagan mispronounced bushs name at one point 
calling him george bosh 
by weeks end the presidents mystifyingly brief endorsement 
appeared to be the least of the bush campaigns worries bush 
declared he couldnt be more pleased with the chief executives 
manner of support and presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
reagan was mortified to think that his words had been received 
as anything less than enthusiastic 
the campaign showed greater concern over the results of the 
nebraska primary which showed that bush could not win solid gop 
support in the state even while running virtually unopposed 
political analysts suggested the weak showing underscores a 
problem bush is likely to have in november throughout the midwest 
where the farm economy despite some recent signs of improvement 
is still troubled 
bushs track record in the region has not been good although he 
later went on to win commanding victories in other states he came 
in a disappointing third in the iowa caucuses last february 
he also lost to dole in south dakotas primary garnering only 
19 percent to doles 55 percent and in minnesota bush didnt 
even bother to mount a major effort a straw poll there in february 
showed only 11 percent for bush compared to 43 percent for dole 
and 28 percent for robertson 
bush campaign strategists argued that the vice presidents poor 
showings in the midwest reflect kansan doles popularity more than 
their candidates vulnerability 
dole is still very popular in nebraska and there was a very 
low turnout said bush deputy campaign manager ed rogers and 
well take 71 percent of the vote any day of the week 
equally troubling to bushs generalelection prospects 
according to analysts was new survey evidence suggesting that 
reagans popularity across party lines was unlikley to be 
transferred to his vice president 
no presidents popularity is rogers said whats 
important is were going to have the president as a great resource 
the president packs a lot of wallop out on the stump and everybody 
knows it 
but david carmen a former consultant to new york rep jack 
kemps presidential campaign said there are problems for bush 
that hes going to have to deal with and a lack of readymade 
support among bluecollar democrats is one of them 
its a problem hes going to to have to address through 
scheduling speeches and through issues carmen said 
to date said the consultant bush has had a problem in 
articulating a message hes been slow to do it but people want a 
horse race and there are more democrats than republicans in the 
country so it is nautral that the race is going to start out at 
least close or maybe with democrat michael dukakis ahead

the defense department in a surprise move 
has settled a lawsuit brought by two environmental groups by 
agreeing to sharply curtail research into a highpower electrical 
phenomenon known as electromagnetic pulse 
the settlement approved by us district judge john garrett 
penn late friday derails at least temporarily a program the 
pentagon had previously described as crucial to national security 
among other purposes the research involved ways to harden 
crucial commnications and weapons guidance equipment against 
electrical surges triggered by nuclear explosions 
the defense department must now determine whether its 
experiments involving simulations powered by nonnuclear means 
pose a danger to humans or wildlife 
jeremy rifkin the president of the foundation on economic 
trends one of the environmental groups which filed the lawsuit 
hailed the agreement as the first court victory of this magnitude 
recognizing the threat posed by electronic or electrical 
pollution 
were extremely pleased rifkin added this is the first 
recognition by the defense department and really the first on a 
national level at all of a whole new environmental hazard facing 
all of us 
the pentagon declined to discuss the matter or its reasons for 
settling the case 
the suit filed in march 1987 by the washingtonbased foundation 
and the potomac river association inc sought essentially 
exactly what we got an end to highpower testing until an 
assessment is performed of the threat to the environment and human 
and animal health rifkin said 
the settlement will shut down or sharply curtail the operations 
of a handful of army and navy generators and potentially one air 
force facility 
electromagnetic pulse or emp is a powerful wave or surge of 
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which 
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water 
emp became a matter of concern to the military in the early 
1960s when the pentagon discovered a nuclear bomb detonated at high 
altitudes could generate a pulse so strong it could disable the 
electronic components used in computers communications and 
guidance equipment 
as a result of that discovery military laboratories have 
studied the phenomenon for 25 years in the course of developing 
methods for enabling electronic weapons components to withstand emp 
in recent years emp work also has been performed with an eye 
toward harnessing the energy pulses for offensive weapons or zap 
guns 
under the terms of the settlement the army must now shut down 
emp generators located at woodbridge va redstone arsenal ala 
and white sands missile range nm 
the navy will be required to shut down its socalled empress 1 
generator at the patuxent naval air station md to refrain from 
starting construction of an empress 2 system and to significantly 
reduce the operating power of two other patuxent generators 
the air force meantime will be allowed to continue operating 
emp simulators at kirtland air force base nm but only if it can 
provide documentation within 14 days demonstrating there is no 
discernible environmental risk from that operation 
rick garcia public affairs director for the air force weapons 
laboratory at kirtland said we would be prepared to furnish 
the documentation one of the five emp simulators at kirtland is 
one dubbed trestle a 58 million structure which enables 
scientists to imitate emp effects upon aircraft electrical 
equipment 
the other emp facilities which are located in closer proximity 
to populated areas must remain shut down or operating only at low 
power levels until an environmental assessment of their operation 
is conducted rifkin said 
the assessment probably will take five to six months at which 
point all the generators may be returned to service but only at 
reduced power levels that ensure no electrical surge moves beyond 
the boundaries of the bases 
the pentagon must then satisfactorily complete a fullfledged 
environmental impact study a process that could take two years 
before the emp generators can be used at their current power 
levels rifkin said 
while the pentagon declined comment rifkin said he thought the 
government agreed to settle the case because the foundations 
attorneys learned that two army employees had warned the service 
against conducting emp experiments at woodbridge until an 
environmental assessment was completed 
when the foundation filed a motion to question the two workers 
pentagon and justice department lawyers suddenly indicated a 
willingness to negotiate rifkin continued 
they didnt want these guys to talk about the hazards he 
said we had them over a barrel 
the foundations lawsuit asserted that emp experiments can 
affect human health directly and through the disruption of 
electronic circuits in nuclear power plants automobiles 
computers airplanes phone lines and navigational systems can 
cause potential catastrophies under many possible circumstances

the national gallery of art is mounting the 
first big show in 20 years of works by fitz hugh lane known for 
his paintings of the first winner of the americas cup and of the 
first cunard line ship to cross the atlantic 
no other painter of the 19th century matched him in capturing 
the character of maritime new england in portraying the reflective 
sheen of calm water or the agitated surface of windblown waves the 
clarity of lightfilled still air or the moist atmosphere of cloudy 
humid days gallery director j carter brown says in a tribute 
appearing in the catalogue of the exhibit 
john wilmerding the museums deputy director and a specialist 
on lane classes him just below the painter winslow homer 
lane painted the americas cup race at least twice once in an 
unusual work that contains three views of the same yacht that one 
is in the peabody museum on salem mass 
the other painting lent to this show shows the finale of the 
first race in 1851 with britons waving their hats from a smaller 
boat while the americans look the other way a british sidewheeler 
packed with spectators is nearby 
lane painted the britannia the first cunard line ship entering 
boston harbor in 1848 eight years after its first transatlantic 
voyage 
nearly all the 61 paintings in the show are of new england 
scenes all are related to ships and the sea there is a kind of 
glowing silence about them that critics say typifies the american 
movement now called luminism 
lane died in 1865 long before the term was invented 
the exhibit opens sunday in the gallerys west building and will 
be there until sept 5 it then will move to the museum of fine 
arts in boston from oct 5 to dec 31 
the exhibit has been financed by a grant from the gte 
corporation

here is the text of president reagans 
weekly radio address as delivered saturday from his official 
retreat at camp david 
yesterday congress decided to send me a trade bill that 
threatens to destroy jobs and would begin to reverse the policies 
of the last seven years after three years of hard work by the 
congress and the executive it is unfortunate that i have no choice 
but to send this back to congress 
while there are many positive aspects of this legislation some 
of its provisions would move us a step further toward 
protectionism others would create new bureaucracies but my main 
objection to the trade bill involves the mandatory requirements it 
sets down for business to give advance notice of layoffs or plant 
closings 
now let me state very clearly that i believe businesses should 
give workers and communities just as much warning as they can when 
it looks as though layoffs or plant closings are going to become 
unavoidable advance notice gives the community and the workers 
themselves some time to begin adjusting its the humane thing to 
do 
but when big government gets in the middle of something like 
this dictating all its rules and regulations well the humane way 
has a way of becoming inhumane and whats intended to help 
everyday working men and women can actually end up hurting them 
when you study the plantclosing provisions of the trade bill you 
see that there are circumstances in which they would actually force 
a business to shut down 
once a struggling business issued a notice that it is likely to 
close or substantially reduce its workforce then creditors 
suppliers and customers would disappear eliminating any chance of 
survival the business might have had under these conditions 
temporary layoffs are sometimes necessary to manage costs and 
production and while the bill does contain a socalled 
struggling company exemption this exemption is too vague and 
unclear to be workable 
then too businesses will be very reluctant to add workers when 
it would put them over the arbitrary thresholds in this bill and 
subject them to yet another regime of federal regulation make no 
mistake these concerns are very real one independent study showed 
that if these provisions had been in effect between 1982 and 1986 
america today would have almost half a million fewer jobs 
yes as ive said our country should support advance 
notification of layoffs and plant closings but this should be 
decided by bargaining between labor and management not by some 
arbitrary rules laid down by politicians and enforced by washington 
bureaucrats 
and if i feel especially strong about this i guess its because 
i was a union president for years myself there were times when the 
union the screen actors guild took a hard line in negotiating 
with management but yes there were also times when the motion 
picture industry was having its ups and downs times when the union 
decided not to press quite so hard because we wanted to make sure 
the whole industry remained healthy and profitable 
the point is it was up to us the unions and management to run 
the motion picture industry together we didnt need washington in 
on this act i guess what it all really comes down to is this just 
what kind of a government do we want for these past seven years 
the administration has limited government cutting taxes and 
regulations alike the result the longest peacetime expansion in 
america history unemployment at the lowest level in almost 14 
years the creation of 16 million new jobs and i might add in the 
last three years four times as many businesses have opened as have 
closed 
we could go back to big government and indeed many of those in 
favor of these plantclosing provisions argue that theyre already 
in effect in many european countries well to tell you the truth 
im sort of proud of being an american proud that since 1983 the 
united states has created six times as many jobs as has western 
europe 
i dont want to leave the impression that the trade bill is 
completely bad on the contrary it contains a number of good and 
important measures including new authority for american negotiators 
seeking to open markets abroad it also included my proposal for 
helping workers affected by business failings by providing them 
with training education and job placement services the truly 
humane approach 
thats why i want a trade bill and why i so regret the addition 
of counterproductive measures that outweigh the positive features 
of this legislation so i urge congress to schedule prompt action 
on a second trade bill immediately after it sustains my veto on 
this one 
and now one final message at noon tomorrow in washington 
hundreds will gather to pay tribute to police officers and other 
law enforcement officials whove died in the line of duty so 
wherever you are at noon i hope youll join me in bowing your head 
and in resolving to let our law enforcement officials know that we 
understand what our mothers and fathers taught us the policeman 
is our friend

the ships and crewmen attacked by iraq 
saturday were ineligible for us distress assistance under the 
reagan administrations rules of engagement in the persian gulf a 
state department spokeswoman said 
the supertankers were inside one of the exclusion zones which 
both belligerents have declared and they were servicing the port of 
a belligerent spokeswoman sondra mccarty said each of these 
factors disqualifies shipping from us distress assistance 
us warships are now permitted to intervene on request in 
attacks on neutral shipping as well as to provide humanitarian 
aid to nonus flagged vessels but only in international waters 
todays attack occurred in iranian waters at the larak oil 
depot the latest target in iraqs intensified attempt to strangle 
petroleum exports that help tehran finance the war 
mccarty repeated us assertions that there can be no military 
solution the war and that any fighting that prolongs the 
conflict is regrettable 
she pleaded anew for un security council action to implement a 
10month old resolution calling for a truce in the conflict and an 
arms embargo against belligerents who fail to heed the ceasefire 
call 
the soviet union and china have declined to endorse the 
resolution asserting that diplomatic efforts toward a truce have

dr john cannell who uncovered the 
socalled lake wobegon effect on standarized tests that falsely 
reassures educators their students are above average says hes 
leaving west virginia 
cannell on friday said he has sold his share in a medical clinic 
and is moving in june to study psychiatry at the university of new 
mexico 
cannell said his involvement in education helped lead to his 
decision to switch from general medicine to adolescent psychiatry 
ive become convinced that many of the problems of adolescents 
can be blamed on the school system cannell said not all of 
them but a good part go back to the message of failure that the 
school systems give 
for years cannell claimed that west virginias education 
department exaggerated its accomplishments by trumpeting results of 
the mcgrawhill comprehensive test of basic skills every school 
district that used the tests claimed results above the national 
average 
cannell maintains that publishers of such tests deliberately 
market them to make school districts look good mcgrawhill and 
others have denied the allegation 
in february after meeting with cannell and studying his 
research assistant education secretary chester finn jr said some 
socalled achievement tests give a falsely optimistic picture 
of school district performances 
finn likened the test results to humorist garrison keillors 
mythical town of lake wobegon where all the women are strong 
all the men are goodlooking and all the children are above 
average

iraqi warplanes bombarded an offshore 
terminal in the strait of hormuz on saturday and set fire to five 
tankers including two of the worlds largest in a steppedup 
drive to destroy irans oil lifeline 
up to 54 crewmen were reported missing 
one of the ships the 235000ton spanish tanker barcelona was 
said to be sinking two others including the seawise giant at 
564739 tons the largest vessel afloat were blazing out of control 
hours after the midafternoon raid on larak island according to 
shipping sources 
gulfbased sources said iranian salvage tugs were battling 
flames aboard the ships some of which were moored together to 
transfer cargo 
iraq announced the raid five hours later the 10th attack it has 
claimed against iranian oil targets since april 29 
reports of casualties varied widely 
gulfbased shipping executives said at least 16 crew members 
were missing 14 from the seawise giant and two from the 
457841ton britishflag burmah endeavour 
in london lloyds shipping intelligence unit said that all of 
the approximately 50 people aboard the seawise giant and four from 
the barcelona were unaccounted for 
there were no reports regarding crews of the other two tankers 
the 152004ton cypriotflag argosy and the 231712ton iranian 
tanker khark the argosy is under iranian charter and the khark is 
government owned 
the attacks were part of an intensified effort by baghdad to cut 
off the export revenues that tehran uses to finance the war with 
iraq now in its eighth year 
penetrating iranian enemy defenses iraqi pilots struck at 
berthing supertankers off the island setting them ablaze and 
gutted in fire columns of smoke were seen billowing from the hit

communique 
the raid was the third in the past seven months against larak

750 miles each way requiring midair refueling en route to or from 
the target

estimates by maritime agencies and other sources indicate that 
more than 300 seamen have been killed and many injured

three kuwaiti tankers sailed through the hormuz into the gulf of 
oman without incident it was the 31st convoy of the year 
one of the escorting warships the destroyer stump later 
returned to the gulf passing through the strait where the smoke of 
laraks fires were still visible 
earlier in the day gulfbased sources quoted radio monitors as 
saying an iranian fighter plane had warned a us warship to leave 
an area in the southern gulf but there was no reply 
an american source said the navy had overheard an iranian f4 
fighterbomber requesting permission to attack a ship 
the source speaking on condition he not be named said there 
were no us ships in that immediate vicinity at the time 
meanwhile iran reported that it would soon begin 10 days of 
maneuvers in the southern gulf and the gulf of oman no specific 
date was given for the exercises the first since the iranians lost 
six naval craft in clashes with us forces on april 18

president reagan said saturday that while 
workers should get as much warning as possible before theyre fired 
or laid off he cannot sign a trade bill requiring such 
notification because it threatens to destroy jobs 
it is unfortunate but i have no choice but to send this back 
to congress reagan said of the 1000page trade measure white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the veto would occur in the 
coming week 
in his weekly radio address delivered from camp david md 
reagan zeroed in on the battle over the plantclosing section of 
the bill which is expected to become a campaign issue in the fall 
elections 
while the administration supports much of the bill it faults 
the requirement that companies notify workers at least 60 days in 
advance of layoffs or a plant shutdown 
the issue should be decided between labor and management not 
government reagan argued 
let me state very clearly i believe businesses should give 
workers and communities just as much warning as they can when it 
looks as though layoffs or plant closings are going to become 
unavoidable reagan said its the humane thing to do 
but when big government gets in the middle of something like 
this dictating all its rules and regulations the humane way has a 
way of becoming inhumane reagan said 
the president contended that the requirement would force 
struggling businesses to shut down at crucial times and that 
management needs the flexibility of using temporary layoffs to get 
a business back on its feet it would also keep companies from 
adding workers if it would subject them to the bills requirements 
the president said 
although there are exceptions in the bill for companies that 
find themselves in serious financial trouble but reagan derided 
them as too vague and unclear to be workable 
reagan argued that one independent study showed that if the 
plantclosing provision had been in effect from 1982 to 1986 
america would have almost half a million fewer jobs he did not 
cite the source of the study 
in the democratic response house speaker jim wright said the 
nation needs the bill to combat the worst trade deficit in history 
171 billion it weakens our country depresses wages reduces 
our standard of living wright argued 
he took issue with reagans threat to veto the bill over the 
plant closing provision 
this bill simply asks the nations biggest employers to 
give american workers at least 60 days notice before they close 
another plant thats not too much to ask not sufficient cause 
mr president to abandon the work of three years and scrap this 
vitally needed legislation wright said 
the house speaker contended that 86 percent of the american 
people support this plant closing provision 
top management knows in advance when its service is no longer 
required and builds golden parachutes worth millions of dollars for 
its comfort cant we give the workers of america at least 60 days 
to get their lives in order to get new training to cushion the 
blow wright asked 
democrats sent the bill to the white house last week with a 
parade of razzledazzle events and photo sessions and have 
threatened to hit republicans in the fall with the issue if reagan 
vetoes the measure 
the bill would overhaul the system for imposing import curbs to 
retaliate against international trade violations and aid american 
industries threatened by increased foreign competition 
while it cleared the house by a 312107 margin more than the 
twothirds needed to override a presidential veto it was approved 
in the senate by 6336 three votes shy of the margin sufficient to 
override

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address it was delivered saturday 
by house speaker jim wright dtexas 
good afternoon this is jim wright lets talk a little bit 
together about the most important thing to come out of congress 
this year 
the new trade bill we sent to the president this week can be a 
big victory for america it can help us get back on track to being 
no 1 in the world 
last year our country suffered the worst trade deficit in our 
history 171 billion we paid that much more for foreign goods 
than we sold in americanmade products and that can be devastating 
it weakens our country depresses wages reduces our standard of 
living in all the trade deficit cost the average american family 
about 3000 last year 
because of this were no longer no 1 in per capita gross 
national product last year we fell to no 3 
because of these trade deficits our country which was the no 
1 creditor nation in the world just five years ago is the worlds 
largest debtor nation today and foreign ownership of american 
banks american farms and real estate and americas marketable 
securities increases by about 25 percent each year 
america can do better than that we must do better than that 
the new trade bill will put us on an upward path its contents are 
summed up in three important words rules tools and schools 
new rules to make a level playing field to give american 
products a chance on foreign markets we ask other countries to 
treat our goods just as we treat their goods on our markets no 
better no worse 
new tools to strengthen our industrial base to modernize our 
plants to improve our american productivity 
better schools to prepare americas children for increasing 
world competition and to hone and sharpen the skills of americas 
work force 
america needs this bill and so we plead with president reagan 
please sign the trade bill give america a chance to excel on world 
markets again let made in the usa become a badge of quality 
and value throughout the world 
president reagan has threatened to veto this bill simply because 
it asks the nations biggest employers to give american workers at 
least 60 days notice before they close another plant thats not 
too much to ask not sufficient cause mr president to abandon 
the work of three years and scrap this vitally needed legislation 
eightysix percent of the american people support this plant 
closing provision this notification to workers they say its only 
fair 
top management knows in advance when its service is no longer 
required and builds golden parachutes worth millions of dollars for 
its comfort cant we give the workers of america at least 60 days 
to get their lives in order to get new training to cushion the 
blow 
in the name of the 2 million american workers who lost their 
jobs last year because of plant shutdowns and layoffs many of 
those plants going overseas twothirds of them given no notice at 
all mr president we ask you to sign this bill and let it become 
law 
in the name of patsy edwards and 117 employees who lost their 
jobs in tampa fla with only one day notice please sign the 
trade bill 
in the name of hank schrenko and 160 iron workers at a plant in 
syracuse ny which closed with only 15 minutes notice please 
sign this bill mr president 
in the name of wally barrett and 397 workers who lost their jobs 
at a plant in eau claire wis please sign the bill 
in the name of these and others in americas work force good 
americans who want to help us revive this country we call on you 
mr president to consider the equities and let this vital american 
initiative begin

anticommunist insurgents saturday 
offered limited amnesty to afghan government soldiers as soviet 
troops prepared for the start of their withdrawal from afghanistan 
gulbadin hekmatyar chairman of the sevenparty afghan guerrilla 
alliance said afghan security forces who voluntarily surrender 
within four weeks after soviet troops have left their districts 
would not be tried for war crimes 
once captured they will face islamic courts hekmatyar 
said at a news conference at the alliances peshawar headquarters 
he did not say what punishments they would face if convicted 
the insurgents have vowed to continue and intensify their fight 
until the last of the estimated 115000 soviet troops leave 
afghanistan and the marxist government in kabul falls 
hekmatyar said the rebels had postponed a swap of one soviet 
prisoner for 25 captured guerrillas he said his group will keep 
soviet prisoners until it establishes an islamic government in 
afghanistan 
he did not divulge how many soviet or afghan army troops were 
being held 
the leader of the extremist hezbeislami party said his party 
will hold onto soviet prisoners and try to exchange them for 
afghanistan president najib and other highranking members of the 
ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
he said the guerrillas want to put najib and his associates on 
trial for war crimes 
western observers disagree on how long najib can stay in power 
once his 100000strong security force is left to face the 
guerrillas alone 
the rebels claim to have overrun 50 posts and garrisons mostly 
in eastern afghanistan in the last month as red army troops have 
headed toward kabul in preparation for their withdrawal which 
begins sunday 
may 15 means the defeat of soviet forces militarily in 
afghanistan and the start of the puppet regimes collapse said 
hekmatyar the russian withdrawal is the first phase of our 
victory 
may 15 also proves that in wars modern weapons and number of 
troops do not matter he said adding no power however 
arrogant is able to crush a nation committed to its faith 
hekmatyar said the guerrillas would be willing to talk to united 
nations advisers who will oversee the ninemonth soviet troop 
withdrawal 
the 50man force headed by gen rauli helminen of finland is 
composed of military personnel mainly from european countries and 
canada 
the un good offices mission for afghanistan and pakistan said 
that starting sunday the group will inspect soviet afghan and 
guerrilla military bases in afghanistan and refugee camps in 
pakistan 
the guerrilla alliance composed of four moslem extremist groups 
and three moderate traditionalist parties has begun forming its 
own alternative government 
hekmatyar said the new islamicstyle government will establish 
itself inside afghanistan in the near future he has given no date 
najibs party seized power in a bloody 1978 coup soviet troops 
intervened in december 1979 replacing one promoscow government

bloodied but unbroken the soviet army begins 
pulling out of afghanistan on sunday amid threats of guerrilla 
harassment and grave doubts about the future of the marxist 
government it leaves behind 
on the eve of the withdrawal the soviet commander in 
afghanistan denied his men had been defeated in the brutal war that 
has claimed an estimated 10000 soviet lives 
but politically the fruits of the 8year soviet armed 
intervention seem meager militarily the soviet presence has 
proved far from decisive 
on saturday in the afghan capital of kabul a bomb exploded 
inside a truck near reviewing stands built for a ceremony honoring 
the departing soviet troops eleven afghan civilians were reported 
killed later three rockets hit a village outside kabul killing 
four people 
since dec 27 1979 when the kremlin sent tanks and troops into 
afghanistan soviet soldiers have been fighting to prop up the 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan but they have failed to 
break the back of a nationwide antimarxist insurgency 
acknowledging the kremlins unwillingness to keep bearing the 
military and diplomatic costs of the intervention foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze signed unbrokered accords in geneva on 
april 14 that commit the soviets to a ninemonth pullout beginning 
sunday 
as the first of an estimated 115000 soviet troops prepare to 
come home one major question is how or if the moscowaligned 
regime of president najib which claims just 40000 regular 
soldiers of its own can survive 
the first soviets to leave will be from a motorrifle division 
garrisoned at jalalabad a dusty provincial town 30 miles from the 
pakistan border military officials and soviet media have said 
lt gen boris v gromov soviet commander in afghanistan said 
saturday more than 1000 soldiers would leave jalalabad on sunday 
and that a quarter of the entire soviet contingent would be home by 
the time president reagan visits moscow on may 29june 2 
in recent days soviet media have issued alarming reports about 
increasing guerrilla activity perhaps to ready public opinion for 
losses during the withdrawal or to stress that the pullout will 
heighten the likelihood of bloodshed among the afghan factions 
locked in a 10yearold civil war 
soviet television took its viewers thursday to the 
kabulkandaharherat road a 650mile crescentshaped track that 
links three of afghanistans major cities for a taped interview 
with a red army officer assigned to screen the pullout 
the activity of armed opposition bands has been sharply 
increasing said lt col nv ivanov who spoke as a truck 
convoy crawled along the hilly road in back of him the road will 
apparently become an objective for which they will fight till the 
bitter end 
guerrilla commanders who refused to be party to the geneva 
agreements have vowed to give the soviets no respite during the 
pullout 
gulbaddin hekmatyar head of the sevenparty rebel alliance 
offered a limited amnesty to afghan forces who surrender within 
four weeks after soviet troops leave their districts 
he said saturday in pakistan that those who surrendered in time 
would not be tried for war crimes but he said those who dont 
surrender and are captured will face islamic courts 
gromov who spoke at a news conference in kabul said the rebels 
had recently received antitank weapons but warned if any group 
tries to use any weapons retribution will be quick and severe 
asked if the pullout was a defeat the 44yearold commander 
said the soviet army will return home after fulfilling its 
internationalist duty during the war not a single unit 
retreated in the face of the enemy so we cannot speak of a 
military defeat 
gromovs remarks were made available to the associated press in 
a pool report from the british news agency reuters the ap was 
excluded from the pool because of questions it asked najib in the 
afghan capital last month 
most of the soviets will be traveling by land rather than by 
airlift for some convoys the trek to soviet border cities like 
termez and kushka is expected to take three days or more often 
through rugged mountainous terrain where the rebels have been 
active in the past 
air cover for the retreating columns may be a crucial problem 
as the insurgents have usmade stinger missiles deadly against 
lowflying helicopters and planes 
fearing the heatseating stinger the soviets and afghans in 
1986 virtually ceased using their aircraft for ground support 
missions 
as they withdraw the soviets will hand over more than 170 
military bases with equipment worth 1 billion to their afghan 
allies gromov said 
najib 41 a burly mustachioed marxist who is a former head of 
the afghan secret police has scoffed when asked whether the 
departure of his soviet allies will bring about the downfall of his 
government 
however many of the dozens of posts handed over to his army in 
recent weeks reportedly have been overrun by wellarmed guerrillas 
soviet media reports have said soviet soldiers believe they have 
honorably performed their duty in coming to the support of a 
beleagured government but the media have made no secret of the 
mens desire to return home 
in the television interview lt col ivanov whose detachment 
will protect other units as they withdraw pointed to his men and 
said they say we will certainly envy the first columns that go 
home

republican leaders in the senate 
reassured the nations top business executives saturday that the 
outlook is good for shrinking the federal budget deficit 
the business council composed of 61 chief executives of the 
nations largest corporations heard from sen pete v domenici 
rnm and sen alan k simpson rwyo as the group wrapped up a 
twoday conference 
the sessions of the elite council are private but domenici told 
reporters before speaking to the executives im not one of those 
who is going to go before this business group and predict gloom and 
fear 
domenici is ranking republican on the senate budget committee 
and a member of a national bipartisan commission that began meeting 
last week to devise ways to lower the deficit 
the business executives as they opened their twiceayear 
conference at the homestead a plush resort in the mountains of 
southwestern virginia issued a generally upbeat assessment of the 
nations economic prospects this year but warned that the budget 
deficit remains disturbingly high during such a period of good 
times 
edmund t pratt jr chairman of pfizer inc a health care 
corporation said many business leaders enjoying the moderate 
economic growth have a sense of living on borrowed time because 
of government red ink 
i think most of us still regard the budget deficit as the no 
1 problem facing us said robert j kilpatrick chairman of cigna 
corp an insurance company 
the executives in a forecast representing a consensus of member 
corporations chief economists said that the budget deficit would 
rise from 1502 billion last year to 154 billion both this year 
and in 1989 the congressional budget office estimates the deficit 
will be 157 billion in 1988 
but domenici said weve made significant strides and 
predicted the government would very easily meet the 136 
billion 1989 target of the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
he said he did not want to prematurely divulge the positions he 
will be taking in the deliberations of the national commission 
but he said i dont think its as simple as some are 
saying that we ought to just look out there for some big tax just 
so its not income or corporate income tax 
we better be guarded about taxes with the american economy 
doing as well as it is he said 
simpson who is deputy republican leader in the senate spoke to 
the executives friday night 
he told reporters saturday that the government must limit the 
growth of federal entitlement programs to achieve any meaningful 
reduction in the deficit 
when we deal honestly with medicare social security 
veterans benefits then well get something done all else is 
dancing in the night he said 
he said he believed the national commission would propose a 
sensible package because the cochairmen former transportation 
secretary drew lewis and washington lawyer robert strauss are 
pretty gutsy guys 
on another matter simpson said he was optimistic that congress 
despite a tight schedule will pass a second and better trade bill 
after president reagan vetoes the bill sent to him last week 
simpson said two key democratic leaders house speaker jim 
wright dtexas and senate finance committee chairman lloyd 
bentsen dtexas were unlikely to let the legislation die because 
of strong support in their home state for repeal of the windfall 
profits tax on oil which is included in the massive trade bill 
the president is expected to reject the legislation because of a 
provision that would require companies to give 60 days notice of 
plant closings and major layoffs 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter who went before 
the business group on friday said the plant closing provision was 
onerous because it would provide a legal basis for challenging 
virtually every closing or layoff

burj indiapakistan border ap as night falls on the rugged 
frontier the rattle of guns of indian border guards serves as a 
warning to potential sikh infiltrators and arms merchants who try 
to cross into india from pakistan 
the guards take target practice 500 yards from the frontier to 
warm up for the nightlong vigil 
in the past eight weeks at least 56 people have died in 47 
encounters between indian border security force and wouldbe 
infiltrators or arms smugglers 
the days of the war game are over we are faced with a 
situation where we must stop infiltration from pakistan by any 
means border force inspector general parkash singh said at the 
burj border post in punjab state 
india wants to close the border with fences men and strict 
vigilance 
the urgency to seal the 348mile section of border in punjab 
stems from escalating violence in the state where hundreds of 
people have died in sikh separatist violence this year 
sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent 
sikh homeland in punjab 
indias border with pakistan stretches 1836 miles running 
through the indian states of kashmir punjab rajasthan and gujarat 
it is a nervous border 
both nations station military forces in nearby garrisons in 
memory of the three wars they have fought in the last 41 years 
it is like firecrackers strewn all over the place what is 
needed is just a matchstick to start fullscale confrontation a 
border official told journalists who were taken to the border on a 
government tour for foreign news organizations he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the sikh terrorist campaign has prompted the indian government 
to take drastic steps india has accused pakistan of sheltering and 
arming the sikhs charges repeatedly denied by pakistan 
an estimated 15000 indian border guards are deployed along the 
punjab sector of the frontier 
in addition 40000 indian army men are garrisoned in punjab 
subject to callup on two hours notice 
reporters saw indian foot patrols in full combat readiness at 
burj 26 miles west of the sikh holy city of amritsar at a nearby 
100foot high observation tower two guards were looking through 
binoculars and keeping their foot patrols informed about movement 
on the pakistani side 
after sundown the tower guards use nightvision devises 
whenever a potential infiltrator is spotted the patrols are 
alerted they first ask the wouldbe infiltrators to stop and 
identify themselves 
we give them a oneminute response time if they try to run or 
fail to respond we fire said vijendra singh sirohi the border 
forces deputy inspector general for the punjab sector 
in an effort to stop infiltration the indian government has 
started fencing vulnerable sections with barbed wire 
senior officers in charge of border operations and intelligence 
say sikh violence can only be contained if infiltration from 
pakistan is checked 
the oxygen for the sikh terrorists is coming from pakistan if 
we can stop the oxygen supply terrorism will die said saran 
prasad chief of operations at the border forces headquarters in 
new delhi 
before we would have hesitated to name pakistan but now it is 
as clear as daylight i mean their help to terrorists prasad 
said 
reporters were shown arms and ammunition the officers said were 
captured from infiltrators 
the weapons included rocketpropelled grenade launchers 
sovietdesigned ak47 rifles and pistols 
it is the ak47 that worries us the most prasad said 
the border security force has nothing to match the ak47 whose 
firepower and light weight make it an ideal weapon for untrained 
gunmen 
border troops are equipped with singleshot rifles in addition 
to light machine guns that must be mounted before firing

zoo officials posted an extra guard and took 
tigers and other large cats off public display after receiving 
telephone calls demanding death for a siberian tiger that killed a 
zoo keeper 
houston zoo officials said friday that they have no plans to 
kill or transfer miguel the 450pound siberian tiger that fatally 
mauled ricardo tovar on thursday 
no one saw or heard the attack on tovar but officials said the 
tiger apparently smashed through a reinforced wireandglass 
window and dragged tovar outside before killing him 
this is a wild animal said parks department director donald 
olson its not a domesticated animal one of the purposes of a 
zoo is to preserve species and tigers are not a domesticated 
species 
the tigers and other cats would be kept off display at least 
until monday olson said were leaving them off display to let 
things settle down he said 
olson said he didnt know what was said in the phone calls but 
that the calls came from people who wanted the tiger killed 
officials have said that the animal which is on the endangered 
species list poses no danger to the public 
while some were calling for miguels death several zoo visitors 
vigorously defended the tiger on friday 
im sorry for the man but i dont think he would have wanted 
it destroyed said pat hodge 
suzy sanders 23 who has a special interest in big cats and 
goes to the zoo regularly said i dont want to be mean but i 
think it was more human stupidity they knew that animal was 
dangerous obviously i think more caution should have been taken 
larry warrendorf 52 a night keeperwatchman at the zoo said

the deal between french and english canada to 
recognize quebec as a distinct society and bring it back into 
the constitution has bogged down in arguments over minority and 
womens rights and the future of the nations political system 
former prime minister pierre trudeau and other critics want last 
years agreement scrapped trudeau a leader in creating the 
nations new constitution in 1982 says the pact could lead to the 
breakup of canadas federation of provinces 
others want the accord renegotiated womens groups the 
countrys 500000 indians and eskimos and language minorities in 
several provinces want their rights enshrined in the constitution 
the northwest territories and yukon claim the deal makes it 
virtually impossible for them to become provinces 
the accords importance stems from quebecs refusal to sign the 
1982 constitution because it failed specifically to protect the 
provinces french culture 
despite all the critics quebec premier robert bourassa thinks 
he can persuade the country to ratify the agreement which was 
signed by the federal government and the 10 canadian provinces a 
year ago at meech lake quebec 
but his chief provincial ally ontario premier david peterson 
says theres only a 5050 chance i wouldnt bet the family farm 
on it he said recently 
however peterson warned that the political consequences of 
not signing this could be very severe 
it will be an enormous political risk for the country to 
refuse it we dont need it to survive but we do for political 
stability he said 
the risk of unrest isnt always apparent in quebec the mainly 
frenchspeaking province has evolved in the past decade from a 
bastion of french separatism into a prosperous society of 66 
million people 
the turning point was the rejection by a 6to4 margin of a 
1980 referendum to open talks on a limited form of independence 
robert maule the us consul general in montreal describes 
todays sprawling city of 29 million as one of entrepreneurs and 
yuppies not political extremists he said the 81percent 
frenchspeaking majority feels more secure about its fate on an 
englishspeaking continent 
first posted here in 1976 maule said in those days if you 
went into a store and said hello to someone theyd glare at 
you now if they greet you first in french they apologize and say 
hello right back 
yet it doesnt take much to revive the old anglofrench 
antagonisms 
about 25000 french quebecers marched through the streets last 
month to proclaim the inviolability of the provinces frenchonly 
language law the protesters reacted after bourassa wavered over an 
election promise to permit bilingual business signs and after two 
western provinces diluted french minority rights 
todays frenchspeaking quebecers who number about 5 million 
descend from settlers who followed on the heels of 16th and 17th 
century french explorers once called new france quebec came under 
british control after a defeat of french soldiers on the bank of 
the st lawrence river in 1759 
all parties initially hailed conservative prime minister brian 
mulroneys skillful negotiation of the meech lake accord and the 
deal was ratified oct 26 by the house of commons the pact has 
been approved by four of 10 provinces quebec alberta 
saskatchewan and prince edward island 
but with a june 1990 deadline for unanimous assent new 
brunswick premier frank mckenna opposes the pact a minority 
government in manitoba lacks the votes to pass it and four other 
provinces have delayed ratification 
meanwhile the countrys main opposition liberal party is 
sharply divided over meech lake and seeks amendments 
in addition to the distinct society clause for quebec meech 
lake gives provinces new powers in the appointment of supreme court 
judges and senators and the right to opt out of national 
sharedcost programs 
trudeau says such a scenario could shatter the canadian 
federation other critics say the phrase distinct society is 
illdefined and will cause endless litigation over the division of 
federal and provincial powers 
mulroney says objections can be taken up at later constitutional 
talks meech lake will pass the way it is this is an undertaking 
we gave to the people of canada and the people of quebec he said 
but peterson did not close the door to changes im prepared 
to look at anything he told reporters 
this pledge upset bourassa who argued that unanimous consent 
for change is now impossible he said native rights and other 
matters can be dealt with separately and that a constitutional 
provision requires consent from only seven provinces or those 
representing 50 percent of the population 
in reopening the deal they will kill the deal and keep quebec 
outside the constitution he said

in the hours after his car plunged off the 
bridge at chappaquiddick sen edward m kennedy wanted to tell 
police that mary jo kopechne was alone in the car according to a 
new book about the accident 
in an account attributed to kennedy cousin joseph gargan 
kennedy told gargan and a friend paul markham the morning after 
the accident that im going to say that mary jo was driving 
kopechne drowned in the accident which has shadowed kennedys 
political career for 19 years 
the book by leo damore is senatorial privilege the 
chappaquiddick coverup and is purportedly based in part on the 
first extensive interviews gargan has ever given for publication 
gargan and markham went with kennedy to the bridge shortly after 
the accident to try to rescue kopechne from the submerged car 
a statement issued by kennedy spokesman jeff smith said as 
the record shows no reputable publisher would touch this book the 
charges about senator kennedy are false the book is an 
irresponsible rehash of all the old rumor and innuendo and we have 
no intention of making any further comment 
gargan a lawyer who is now a member of the massachusetts state 
insurance divisions board of appeals did not return repeated 
telephone calls over the past week contacted recently by the cape 
cod times he said my god that was 19 years ago its just not 
worthy of discussing anymore 
the book is being published by regnery gateway a conservative 
publishing house based in washington after being rejected by a 
number of new york publishers damore of old saybrook conn is a 
former cape cod resident who has written several books including a 
flattering account of john f kennedys years on the cape 
random house had given damore a 250000 contract but cancelled 
it saying an early version of the book was too unwieldy and that 
the author failed to provide tape recordings to authenticate the 
gargan interviews penthouse magazine canceled an excerpt plan on 
ground that damore couldnt verify key parts of the gargan 
interviews 
but jimmy smith a former kennedy campaign aide and now a us 
magistrate on cape cod said in a telephone interview that he was 
present for nearly all of the damoregargan sessions in 1983 he 
declined to go over specifics but vouched for the books accuracy 
gargan also read the book and made corrections prior to 
publication smith said 
according to damore gargan told him kennedy concocted the 
proposal that authorities be told kopechne was alone in the 
senators oldsmobile when it plunged off tiny dike bridge over an 
inlet on the east side of the massachusetts island 
the accident occurred the weekend of july 1819 1969 kopechne 
was one of six women known as the boiler room girls who had 
worked on robert f kennedys 1968 presidential campaigns and who 
attended a party gargan had organized 
kennedy was having alternative ideas about the situation 
wrote author damore why couldnt mary jo have been driving the 
car why couldnt she have let him off and driven to the ferry 
herself and made a wrong turn 
kennedy asked to be brought back to the cottage to establish 
the story after a while he could leave kennedy suggested that 
when he was back in edgartown gargan could discover the 
accident and report to police that mary jo had been alone in the 
car 
but gargan purportedly rejected the idea noting that the trio 
did not even know if miss kopechne could drive or had a license 
the senator testified at an official inquest that he had full 
intention of reporting the accident when the trio returned to the 
chappaquiddick ferry landing and the senator swam back to edgartown 
alone but he said the tide was pulling him out and for the 
second time that evening i knew i was going to drown 
the next morning markham and gargan arrived at the edgartown 
hotel to find a freshly shaven and neatly dressed kennedy chatting 
with several acquaintances about sailing on the hotel balcony he 
had not reported the accident 
i told them about my own thoughts and feelings as i swam 
across that channel that somehow when they arrived in the 
morning that they were going to say that mary jo was still alive 
the senator has said 
the book said kennedy did not decide to tell police that he was 
driving until speaking by telephone with aide david burke it took 
about 10 hours for kennedy to report the accident an action that 
he later called irrational and indefensible and inexcusable and 
inexplicable 
the senator pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of 
an accident he received a twomonth suspended sentence and had his 
license revoked for a year 
a manuscript of the book which is scheduled to be published 
june 23 was made available to the associated press washingtonian 
magazine said it plans to run excerpts in its june issue 
the book quotes gargan as saying to kennedy in 1982 ive 
given you 30 years of my life and what do i have to show for it 
im a fool in the eyes of my own children because of 
chappaquiddick 
markham who did not talk to the author declined comment 
the book reporting the scene on the night of the accident said 
kennedy watched gargan and markhams rescue operation and called 
out can you see her is she in there 
the account continued gargan saw the senator stretched out on 
the bridge on his back hands clapsed behind his head knees drawn 
up the senator was looking into the sky rocking back and forth 
repeating oh my god what am i going to do

the first person arrested under new regulations 
banning smoking on short airline flights says hes willing to plead 
guilty to smoking but would fight any more serious charge 
in an interview published saturday in the seattle times darryl 
seigel denied an officials suggestion that he may have tampered 
with a smoke detector in an airliner restroom during a usair flight 
from seattle to reno nev 
seigel 38 of seattle admitted smoking a cigarette in a 
lavatory during the thursday flight but said he did so 
absentmindedly he said that if he is charged with smoking in 
the lavatory ill plead guilty but if its for anything else ill 
fight it 
regulations that went into effect three weeks ago ban smoking on 
domestic airliner flights lasting less than two hours 
federal aviation administration spokeswoman elly brekke said 
seigel is apparently the first passenger to be arrested under the 
new rules 
the lack of an alarm from the lavatory smoke detector caused the 
flight crew to suspect it was tampered with brekke said it was 
given to maintenance workers for an inspection 
but seigel said of the smoke detector i touched it thats 
all but i did not do anything other than look at it out of 
curiousity 
brekke said the investigation should take 60 days and seigel 
faces three possible charges smoking when a no smoking sign is on 
which carries a 1000 fine smoking in the lavatory also a 1000 
fine and tampering with a lavatory smoke detector a 2000 fine

cocaine and communism have dominated us relations 
with latin america this decade while the regions festering 
economic and political problems are being neglected experts warn 
in an 84page report issued here 
miami report ii was prepared by bankers oil executives 
clergymen and academics led by ambler moss former us ambassador 
to panama it follows up on the groups first report in 1984 which 
accurately forecast a gradually worsening economic crisis in latin 
america 
without a solution there will be severe erosion of fragile 
democracies in latin america moss said in an interview friday 
he is now dean of the university of miami graduate school of 
international studies you cant run a democracy when the economy 
is going to hell he said 
since the early 1980s money has steadily flowed out of latin 
america to the united states depriving the underdeveloped nations 
of desperately needed capital says the study which was released 
friday by the end of 1987 latin america was staggering under a 
debt burden of 460 billion 
the authors say the region is mired in its worst depression 
since the 1930s 
argentinas elected president raul alfonsin who has had to put 
down attempted military coups frequently warns the united states 
that his regions economic troubles threaten its political 
stability 
but us policy has ignored the deeper problems concentrating 
instead on battling communism in central america moss said 
there has been almost an obssession with nicaragua to the 
exclusion of everything else moss said in the absolute worst 
case we could send troops into nicaragua but we cant send them 
into every country in latin america 
the other dominant theme in uslatin relations has been 
narcotics trafficking says university of miami professor bruce 
bagley who specializes in international relations and prepared the 
miami report ii section on drug trafficking he pointed to the 
inability of the united states to either unseat or prosecute 
panamas gen manuel antonio noriega on drug charges 
our argument is that there are many other problems equally 
fundamental bagley said in a separate interview friday by 
failing to deal with these problems the noriegas of the world can 
flourish 
even in fighting the traffickers the reagan administration has 
failed to come up with concrete antidrug aid to financially 
strapped countries or with programs to cut us demand bagley 
said 
but cocaine rhetoric and gettough policies instead of deeper 
economic issues dominate us relations with the bahamas 
jamaica mexico panama colombia peru and bolivia he said 
this is a lost decade for democracy and development in latin 
america bagley said 
the report acknowledges it is timed for the 1988 presidential 
elections and calls on us voters to demand more substance in the 
candidates latin america policy 
a section of the report by msgr bryan walsh of the miami roman 
catholic archdiocese also calls for a more realistic immigration 
policy criticizing the government for narrowing its definition of 
political asylum to thwart latin and caribbean immigrants 
miami report iis main focus is economic however and the 
authors offer what they say are moderate policies to curb the 
departure of capital from the region 
they call for latin american nations themselves to adopt 
internal policies that reassure investors moss noted that 
argentina with a foreign debt of 53 billion has flight 
capital of 39 billion deposited outside the country by 
argentines worried about the nations political and economic health 
but us policy or lack of it takes a large share of the 
blame the report says and must be changed 
one suggestion is for the us treasury to lower interest rates 
on loans made directly to smaller countries 
another is for the united states to increase funding available 
for latin america through the interamerican development bank

university of illinois landscape architects 
are working on designs to help the government of india attract more 
tourists to key buddhist religious sites 
university officials will go to india this summer to present 
plans for redeveloping sarnath where buddha delivered his first 
sermon more than 2500 years ago 
it gives our students handson experience and it is an 
exciting challenge to develop tourism there said vincent 
bellafiore head of the universitys department of landscape 
architecture people can see a totally different religion and 
culture 
sarnath in the northern part of india contains landmark 
structures such as a temple a museum and architectural ruins but 
there also are mud houses cycle rickshaws and streets lined with 
vendors selling everything from silk to peanuts 
one goal for the university team was to create designs that suit 
both religious and recreational activities at sarnath and would cut 
down conflicts between the two 
some people come for religious devotion said bellafiore 
others picnic on the grass next to the temple with a 
ghettoblaster and barbecue meat and that is very offensive 
so the illinois students and faculty visited sarnath and 
returned with pictures and ideas then spent months on campus early 
this year developing plans for improving the site 
graduate student miki stuebe concentrated on the zoo creating 
more natural settings for animals in place of the small cages now 
used for example one of her drawings depicts an island for the 
zoos monkeys 
we want to tie into buddhist concepts like compassion for all 
living things she said 
one alternative in the plan calls for moving the zoo away from 
the key religious area 
richard blumeweaver another graduate student rolled out a 
drawing of proposed new footpaths intended to keep people from 
walking on the architectural ruins 
around some buddhist structures the plans show two paths one 
for religious pilgrims who spend much more time there and another 
for tourists who want to walk past more quickly 
in other areas of sarnath the plans along a main road include 
trees more typical of those found during buddhas time concepts 
for touristrelated market spaces and hedges to restrict the 
movement of farm animals into the site 
for overnight tourists there are concepts for new housing 
designed to blend in with the architecture of the current village 
we dont want a chichi resort in the midst of abject 
poverty said bellafiore who hopes the housing will be decorated 
with pottery and weavings by village craftsmen to help the local 
economy 
the us national park service and indias ministry of tourism 
agreed on this project the only cost was transportation and food 
and lodging in india for the university team said bellafiore 
bellafiore said he will return to india with other university 
officials to deliver the designs that will provide the indian 
government with alternatives that are not enormously expensive 
i think our plans will satisfy indias goal to increase 
tourism said blumeweaver id also like to see the ruins 
better preserved and id like to see the place respected more as a 
religious site 
similar designs may be developed by the illinois team for other 
buddhist sites in india

michelangelo was not contrary to popular 
belief an angry loner who spent countless hours lying flat on his 
back as he painted the ceiling of the sistine chapel a washington 
university art historian concludes 
in fact the italian renaissance master did his work standing on 
innovative scaffolding and he had help from as many as 13 
assistants says william e wallace assistant professor of art 
history 
one of the larger myths about him is that he was incapable of 
working with others wallace said friday but the fact is that 
for very large projects it was necessary to work with assistants 
i think of him as something of an entrepreneur a fairly 
efficient businessman wallace said its just another side of 
an artist whos constantly surprising us 
depicting the biblical story of creation on the chapels ceiling 
was not without discomfort however michelangelo described his 
painting position on his feet head tilted back to a friend in 
this way 
my beard toward heaven i feel the back of my brain upon my 
neck 
wallace spent last year in italy on a grant from the national 
endowment for the humanities researching michelangelo and studying 
the ceiling which is undergoing a major renovation workers are 
using a special mild solvent to remove layers of dirt candle 
smoke and even greek wine which was once used to brighten the 
colors 
its truly stunning said wallace who climbed the 
scaffolding four times as the restorers worked to bring out the 
works true colors for leisurely closeup looks 
i think the thing thats most important is the coloration 
he said although it comes as a surprise to some people its 
really probably exactly as michelangelo intended it 
wallace said michelangelo used vibrant colors so they could be 
seen from the floor 65 feet below 
now that hes back home wallace is working on a book about 
michelangelo and the assistants he used on his major works 
in italy he spent hours compiling scattered information on the 
sistine project which took from 1508 to 1512 and came up with a 
list of 13 assistants who helped michelangelo 
an architect friend helped design the overhead scaffolding and a 
carpenter named piero basso built it wallace said michelangelo 
also hired assistants to grind colors mix paints trim and clean 
brushes and take care of other mundane tasks and he recruited 
other artists and instructed them in the technique of fresco 
painting 
some historians have believed michelangelo had help in the 
project but workers cleaning the ceiling in the 1930s were the 
first to notice the telltale details wallace said he thinks his 
book will be the first to provide an overall picture of 
michelangelos assistants in the sistine chapel 
examination of the ceiling from the scaffold clearly reveals 
the presence of helping hands especially painting in the 
architecture decoration and many of the secondary figures 
wallace said 
much of the architecture for example was a reptititous task 
that required competence but no imagination and the presence of 
more than one hand is particularly evident when viewed at close 
range he said 
wallace said the myths about michelangelo painting alone will 
probably continue however because they are fictions that 
attempt to grasp a superhuman achievement 
but knowing he had a little help does not in any way detract 
from the greatness of the work of art 
rather it is to the credit of his genius that the final 
product is a unified work of art

democrat michael dukakis was jeered saturday 
as he appealed for votes from homosexual political activists some 
of whom confronted him for supporting a policy making it difficult 
for gay couples to be foster parents 
dukakis speaking to several dozen people at a meeting of a gay 
political action committee promised youre going to be deeply 
involved in what we do 
however the massachusetts governor was confronted over a policy 
in his state giving low priority to homosexual couples as foster 
parents the policy gives higher priority to heterosexual couples 
with children and relatives of the child needing placement 
dukakis campaigning for gay support in californias june 7 
primary was met with some hisses and occasional shouts of protest 
as he explained his position on foster care 
dukakis also pointed to his record of support for spending money 
to combat the deadly aids disease whose chief victims have been 
homosexual men he also said massachusetts spends more money per 
aids case than any other state 
he called aids the most serious public health problem weve 
had in our lifetime 
dukakis said he had vetoed legislation as governor that banned 
homosexual couples from providing foster care but said he backed 
the policy in effect that gives first priority to heterosexual 
couples with child raising experience and above that relatives of 
the child in need of care 
when asked repeatedly why he favored that policy dukakis said 
because i think its best all things being equal for a child to 
grow up in a household with a mother and father and other 
children 
dukakis added that his policy does not prohibit gays from 
becoming foster parents if they are best for the child but dukakis 
aides acknowledged the massachusetts policy effectively prevents 
gays from becoming foster parents in most cases 
a handful of protesters greeted the massachusetts governor 
outside a hotel inside one man shouted bigot and another 
yelled youre antigay why dont you admit it 
dukakis was warmly endorsed by jean oleary executive director 
of a group called national gay rights advocates 
we have in mike dukakis a candidate who is instinctively 
supportive who has a good record on gay rights who wants our 
support and who can win she said lets stop comparing michael 
dukakis with jesse jackson and start comparing him with george 
bush 
dukakis said he would not support an executive order banning 
discrimination based on sexual orientation but said he believed 
such discrimination was already prohibited by the us constitution 
dukakis aides said they were pleased with the meeting despite 
the protests 
i thought it was very good very open i thought governor 
dukakis dealt with the communitys concerns very honestly said 
alice travis the campaigns national political coordinator 
at a news conference later in pasadena dukakis responded to 
criticism from vice president george bush the expected republican 
nominee who has blasted dukakis for opposing weapons systems and 
said the democrats approach to defense amounted to wishful 
thinking 
anybody who sat there and did nothing while we traded arms to 
the ayatollah khomeini had better not be lecturing other people 
about naivete and wishful thinking dukakis said referring to 
bushs role in the irancontra affair 
dukakis also faced questions on his opposition to the death 
penalty as he appeared with californa attorney general john van de 
kamp who endorsed him 
the massachusetts governor said he opposed the death penalty 
because i dont believe in killing people there are other ways 
of stopping violent crime

war

people pushing baby strollers holding 
toddlers and carrying union signs gathered saturday near the 
washington monument in support of socalled family legislation 
for working parents and the elderly 
hurrah hurrah for the american family said rep claude 
pepper dfla 87 the oldest member of congress and a champion of 
bills to expand job and medical benefits for working parents and 
senior citizens 
the rally was sponsored by a coalition of labor organizations 
and religious civil rights and womens groups about 3000 people 
were in attendance according to officer maria gonzalez of the us 
park police 
let us rededicate ourselves to the sanctity to the nobility 
and the wellbeing of the american family the base of our great 
society the base and strength of our great america said pepper 
as rallygoers cheered 
the event at washingtons big outdoor pedestrian mall featured 
entertainment for the children such as a chinese lion dance and 
trampolines adults marched with union signs or set up picnics on 
the grass 
bills now pending in congress would require businesses to give 
unpaid leave to workers with a newborn newly adopted or seriously 
ill child and provide home health care for the chronically ill 
the parental and medical leave legislation is opposed by many 
business groups who object to federally mandated workplace 
benefits 
the reagan administration also contends that such matters should 
be worked out between employers and employees not ordered by 
congress 
government was not created for defense alone said rep tony 
coelho dcalif the house majority whip this administration 
does not understand this message for they are out of touch with 
the needs of everyday working americans 
he told the rally that passage of the bills would signal an end 
to the long national nightmare that has been the reagan years 
we know that our family and our future do not belong to ronald 
reagan and the right wing of the republican party coelho said 
to compete in this economy our kids need more than a right wing 
and a prayer 
lane kirkland president of the aflcio said the rally 
celebrates the family values that are advanced and supported 
by the whole american labor movement men and women mothers and 
fathers sons and daughters and grandparents alike 
irene natividad president of the national womens political 
caucus urged people to sign petitions in support of the 
legislation and to vote in the fall only for lawmakers who worked 
for the measures 
the house education and labor committee last november approved a 
family and medical leave bill requiring firms with at least 50 
employees to offer up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave over a twoyear 
period to workers with a newborn newly adopted or seriously ill 
child employees with serious medical conditions of their own would 
be entitled to up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave over a years time 
the house leadership has not yet scheduled floor action on the bill 
in the senate sen christopher dodd dconn is sponsoring a 
family leave bill that would require businesses with more than 15 
employees to offer up to 18 weeks of unpaid leave upon the birth 
adoption or serious illness of a child the bill which does not 
include medical leave for employees is pending in a senate 
subcommittee 
cost estimates by the general accounting office range from less 
than 500 million for the dodd bill to less than 200 million for 
the house measure a compromise worked out by democrats and 
moderate republicans business groups contend the costs would be 
higher

from the heights of the andes to the 
tropical lowlands pope john paul ii has carried a message of 
selfreliance and prodded latin americans to take the initiative in 
solving their deep social and political problems 
from combating drug trafficking and corruption to stemming the 
brain drain the pope has argued that it is up to the people 
themselves to do battle 
addressing a mass on saturday in the amazon basin city of 
trinidad the pope insisted that constant intense honest and 
efficient work by everyone was needed to overcome poverty 
we cant expect everything from outside he said 
the 12day tour of uruguay bolivia peru and paraguay is john 
pauls ninth pilgrimage to a region he calls the continent of 
hope 
many people along his route have hoped for his help and 
blessings about 20 women occupied a roman catholic church saturday 
in lima peru to ask the pope to intercede for leftist rebels held 
in prison 
the group occupied the sacred heart of jesus church 12 blocks 
from a seminary where the pope was to speak sunday witnesses told 
reporters that police took the protesters away in vans police 
confirmed the incident but said they had no information on arrests 
john paul was scheduled to meet there with priests nuns and 
seminary students as well as celebrate an open air mass and close 
a conference of latin american bishops before moving on monday to 
his last stop in paraguay 
the vatican estimates that half the worlds roman catholics who 
now number 860 million will be living in latin america by the turn 
of the century 
the pontiff has been greeted here by wildly enthusiastic crowds 
entire cities have turned out to see him schoolboys have run after 
his popemobile in motorcades and schoolgirls have screamed as if 
he were a rock star as he entered a stadium for a youth rally

their difficulties at a mass friday in tropical santa cruz

superpower rivalry

bolivia and later addressing a mass in santa cruz the pope 
deplored both the excesses of freemarket capitalism and marxism 
but he also said in improvised remarks in santa cruz that the 
key for latin americans in resolving eastwest leftright 
divisions is found here in your human social and christian 
realities 
drug trafficking emerged as a major theme as the pope visited 
eastern bolivia where cocaine barons ship narcotics to consumers 
in the united states and western europe 
john paul while flying to south america told reporters it was 
unfair to punish only poor south american countries for drug 
trading but he challenged his audiences in bolivia to take on the 
traffickers declaring that the rampant corruption was destroying 
their society 
the pope insisted that an answer lay in following ethical 
christian values not public and private immorality

communist premier branko mikulic on 
saturday survived calls for his resignation from yugoslavias most 
westernized republics when the parliament rejected their plan to 
topple his government 
in a 75minute speech to the federal assembly yugoslavias 
national parliament mikulic denounced slovenia and croatia the 
two most advanced of yugoslavias six republics for demanding a 
vote of no confidence in his administration 
the parliament then held separate closed debates in its two 
chambers the federal chamber and the chamber of republics and 
provinces each chamber voted against even calling a vote on the 
slovenian and croatian proposals for a noconfidence motion the 
tanjug news agency said 
if mikulic had been voted out of office it would have been the 
first such vote against a communist government anywhere in eastern 
europe 
yugoslav television said the federal chamber voted 125 to 64 in 
a show of hands against a noconfidence motion the vote in the 
other chamber was 64 to 23 tanjug said 
the federal chamber has a total of 220 delegates and the other 
chamber 88 deputies some deputies were apparently absent from 
saturdays session while five federal chamber members abstained 
yugoslavia has been grappling with a prolonged economic and 
social crisis that has recently prompted calls for a multiparty 
system to replace the communists current monopoly on power 
in his speech mikulic suggested alternative political systems 
could eventually be debated noting that our situation is so 
serious that we have no right to put off a debate on the true 
reasons which caused it and on its eradication 
for the moment however he said there is no political 
alternative to socialist selfmanagement the system of worker 
management bequeathed by josip broz tito and now widely blamed for 
some of the nations economic woes 
sixteen percent of the workforce is unemployed and the foreign 
debt exceeds 20 billion inflation touched almost 200 percent 
before the government slapped a sixmonth freeze on wages and 
prices last november 
the freeze was to be lifted sunday night but the government 
announced wednesday it would stay in force at least 10 more days 
while yugoslavia tries to raise an emergency 300 million loan 
that money is needed to stave off virtual bankruptcy before a 
new agreement with the international monetary fund takes effect 
the imf has worked with yugoslav officials for more than six 
months to devise a package of marketoriented reforms aimed at 
reducing inflation to 90 percent while rescheduling payments on 2 
billion of debt and extending 14 billion in new loans 
by backing mikulic parliament signaled that it supports the 
reforms 
mikulic said the new measures would be harsh but warned that 
even greater stagflation and drastic reductions in real wages 
lay ahead if inflation exceeds the target of 90 percent 
the premier blamed the antiquity lack of flexibility and 
inefficiency of yugoslavias current economic system for the 
crisis 
he outlined the new economic reforms in general terms saying 
they aimed to curb import restrictions open up competition with 
the world market and strengthen the role of the national bank in 
monetary policy 
mikulic said he agreed with his critics that yugoslavias 
situation was grave but he defended his governments two years in 
office so far noting that each of its acts had been approved by 
the national parliament and republican assemblies 
several slovenian and croatian deputies argued against this in 
what tanjug termed an occasionally very sharp and polemical 
debate 
joze marolt a slovene delegate recalled that in july 1986 
mikulic submitted what was then called an emergency economic 
package and warned that yugoslavia stood before an abyss 
today we are not just in front of the abyss we are in it 
marolt said according to tanjug

president francois mitterrand dissolved the 
national assembly on saturday and announced that parliamentary 
elections will be held june 5 and june 12 
mitterrand made the announcement in a nationwide television 
address 
mitterrand said he made the decision after his new premier 
michel rocard informed him that despite his efforts he did not 
believe he could bring together a solid and stable majority that 
all governments need to carry out their programs well 
rocard said friday he had sought support from centrists in the 
577seat assembly for his government and received a negative 
response 
in his threeminute address mitterrand deplored the fact that 
the opening to the center that i sought could not be brought 
about to the extent that i wished therefore it was my duty to 
draw the appropriate conclusions a few seconds ago i signed a 
decree dissolving the national assembly 
he said the tworound election would be held on the first and 
second sundays of june 
mitterrand was reelected to a second term may 8 and appointed 
rocard his premier after conservative premier jacques chirac who 
had run against mitterrand for president resigned 
according to an opinion poll to be published sunday in the 
journal du dimanche 47 percent of the french favored dissolution 
of the assembly while 28 percent opposed dissolution 
the poll indicated that the socialists the largest party in 
france would get 41 percent of the vote 24 percent would go to 
the neogaullist rally for the republic and 15 percent would go to 
the centerright union for french democracy 
the rest of the vote would go to minor parties on the left and 
the right the poll indicated nearly 20 percent of those polled 
said they would not vote 
former president valery giscard destaing a prominent 
centerright leader told mitterrand earlier he should convene the 
assembly before deciding on dissolution 
giscard said in a letter to mitterrand the action should come 
after a serious discussion on what is possible and what is not 
he said he opposed dissolution for two reasons 
the french now will have to vote five times in 15 months in 
various elections which giscard described as great waste of time 
and energy 
he also said that the central problem facing the country was how 
to get the left and the right to work together 
how can we achieve this if the first decision before any 
attempt to work together is to send the two camps face to face 
against each other in every electoral district in france 
mitterrand acted six days after winning a secondseven year term 
with 54 percent of the vote he also dissolved the assembly after 
winning his first term in 1981 and was rewarded with a victory by 
the socialists in the legislative elections that followed 
the last dissolution before that was pronounced by charles de 
gaulle on may 30 1968 after the student uprising in paris

admiral sergei gorshkov the man credited with 
turning the soviet union into a modern naval power has died the 
soviet news agency tass said saturday he was 78 
gorshkov who was replaced in december 1985 by vladimir n 
chernavin died friday following a severe and prolonged 
illness tass said it did not specify the cause of death 
in his 29 years as naval commander gorshkov showed a talent 
of organization and deep knowledge of the naval science tass 
said quoting an obituary signed by the central committee of the 
communist party the presidium of the supreme soviet and the soviet 
council of ministers 
gorshkov had a feeling for the new and showed creative 
approaches in his work and in a combat situation he displayed 
courage will and fortitude it said 
it credited gorshkov with making a big contribution to the 
development of the soviet navy 
a western military attache said at the time of gorshkovs 
retirement that he had been an extraordinary naval officer of our 
time 
the admiral was appointed to head the soviet navy in 1956 by 
nikita s khrushchev who considered josef v stalins emphasis on 
large surface vessels to be impractical because of their 
vulnerability to rocket attacks 
in a book titled sea power of the state gorshkov said the 
soviet navys development of a fleet of submarines and 
missilelaunching warships had frustrated illusory hopes of 
imperialist aggressors that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea 
they would have no strong opponent 
he also argued that nuclear modernization was as important as 
the initial acquisition of nuclear weapons to end the 
unreachability of the american continent

a bomb saturday ripped through a truck 
parked near reviewing stands to be used for ceremonies marking the 
withdrawal of soviet troops eleven afghans including a baby were 
killed 
residents said three rockets later hit a village on the 
outskirts of kabul killing four people and wounding four others 
the official soviet news agency tass put the death toll at three 
tass monitored in moscow blamed both attacks on afghan 
guerrillas and said one of those responsible for the 545 am 
truck attack was arrested 
soviet communist party central committee official vladimir 
sevruk reported that 11 people were killed and 12 injured in the 
explosion 
the blast killed a baby and an 11yearold girl and all the 
casualties were afghan civilians according to a western 
photographer on the scene 
most appeared to have been occupants of nearby homes destroyed 
by the impact of the explosion he said 
when the bomb exploded some of the houses nearby just 
collapsed said the photographer 
the blast was so great that it shattered the windows of a bus 
depot across the river 300 yards away and left a crater 20 feet 
wide and 10 feet deep 
soviet troops arrived afterward the photographer said by 
telephone 
the blast demolished embankment walls on both sides of the river 
that threads through this ancient capital 
blood was visible on the gates of a nearby factory and personal 
belongings including carpet slippers were scattered in the street 
the bomb had been planted in a large truck that lay badly 
mangled at the scene 
last month six people were killed and 49 wounded in another 
bomb blast along the river on the 10th anniversary of the april 
1978 revolution that brought a marxist government to power in 
afghanistan and triggered widespread insurrection 
tass said the rockets saturday hit the village of chamane 
baraqi killing an old man and two children residents said one 
rocket hit a hut killing two children inside and that an elderly 
man and another child were killed by debris the village is located 
about a halfmile from the british embassy 
at a news conference for foreign journalists who gathered for 
the beginning of the soviet withdrawal afghan president najib said 
his government will survive because it offers peace he added that 
he will address the un special session on disarmament in new york 
next month and planned trips to czechoslovakia and cuba 
we can state confidently that we will last because we strive 
and struggle for peace he said our opponents offer the afghan 
people war and the people hate this 
also at a news conference saturday the head of the soviet 
military contingent in afghanistan said the anticommunist rebels 
were taking their toll on the soviet and afghan troops but that 
rebel attacks will not deter the withdrawal which begins sunday 
the opposition may have some effect on us but not much and 
certainly they will not be able to frustrate the timetable lt 
gen boris gromov told reporters we have the means at our 
disposal to fulfill the timetable 
the comments by gromov and najib and the report of the rocket 
attack were carried in a reuters news agency pool report from 
kabul the associated press was excluded from the pool because of 
questions it asked afghan president najib last month 
under an accord signed in geneva on april 14 the soviets will 
complete their withdrawal within nine months half of the soviets 
must be out by aug 15 according to the peace agreement 
soviet soldiers entered the war in december 1979 to help the 
allied government fight off the insurgents and about 115000 
remain here to back forces loyal to president najib

soviet dissident natan sharansky recalls in a 
new book how he forced kgb agents out of his building and into the 
cold in moscow in 1974 by threatening to call the police 
it is one of the lighter moments in sharanskys book fear no 
evil excerpted in the may 23 issue of us news amp world report 
in the years before his arrest in 1977 on suspicion of passing 
secrets to the cia sharansky was a prominent dissident who had 
been repeatedly refused permission to emigrate from the soviet 
union 
he was often followed by the kgb and says he sometimes found 
them a source of amusement he says the most fun he had at the 
kgbs expense was on nov 7 1974 a soviet holiday when sharansky 
had been assigned to work at the institute for oil and gas to take 
care of emergencies 
three tails followed me to work but because no outsiders were 
allowed in our building they had to remain in the car a little 
later the security guard called from downstairs to report that a 
group of men had come into the lobby to warm up sharansky said 
he called the kgb identified himself and said he was in charge 
of the building that day 
downstairs in the lobby are three kgb men who are following 
citizen sharansky did you give them permission to enter 
there was a long pause sharansky said and the voice asked his 
identity 
sharansky he replied 
youre making fun of us its only noon and youre already 
drunk the voice said and hung up

him to tell the three men he had spoken to their boss who didnt 
approve of their being in the building 
if they dont leave ill notify the police sharansky

spy he was freed in february 1986 in an eastwest prisoner 
exchange and joined his wife in israel

said a residential developer who lost 10 freshly planted dogwood 
trees the trees worth 150 each were uprooted on may 2 from a 
neighborhood dotted with homes worth about 300000 to 500000 
burglars also snatched six shrubs from the citys posh south 
hills district on april 21 police said 
in spencer about 35 miles northeast of charleston police

the luxury yacht monkey business which 
ferried former presidential candidate gary hart to the bahamas with 
model donna rice was seized saturday when us coast guard 
officers found marijuana on it officials said 
they found one gram of marijuana thats onetwentyeighth of 
an ounce according to zero tolerance if we find enough to test 
positive its enough to seize the vesssel said petty officer dan 
vogeley 
the 82foot yacht was boarded during a routine safety check 
about 22 miles northwest of the bahamian island of bimini and a 
member of the boarding party spotted rolling papers used to make 
marijuana cigarettes 
we consider that probable cause said vogely a search 
uncovered a single joint of marijuana in the pocket of a jacket 
hanging in a closet the cutter cape shoalwater then escorted the 
yacht to the coast guard base here 
during a dockside search coast guard lt jim mccauley said his 
men found an additional 8 grams of marijuana in another garment 
hanging in a closet 
the four people on board whose names were not released have 
not been arrested because the marijuana has not been linked to 
anybody vogeley said 
vogeley said the yacht worth at least 1 million is currently 
registered to turnberry isle marina and the four crewmembers were 
wearing turnberry isle tshirts 
when hart his friend william broadhurst ms rice and her 
friend lynn armandt took their trip in march 1987 to bimini about 
55 miles east of miami the chartered yacht was owned by 
millionaire developer donald soffer and kept at turnberry isle in 
north miami beach 
soffer has an unlisted number a woman who answered the phone at 
turnberry isle said the club would have no comment 
hart withdrew from the race for the 1988 democratic presidential 
nomination on may 8 1987 only weeks after he had announced his 
candidacy when the miami herald revealed his liaison with ms rice 
hart who also had ms rice as a weekend guest at his home in 
washington maintained that the relationship and the trip to bimini 
were innocent he eventually reentered the race but did not do 
well and finally withdrew again 
the multidecked aluminumhulled motor yacht with a hot tub and 
a bar adorned with an oriental rug has a flashy history beyond 
presidential politics 
celebrities who have visited the monkey business 
rosewoodpaneled staterooms include elizabeth taylor jack 
nicholson lucille ball elton john julio iglesias and james caan 
zero tolerance is the reagan administrations new gettough 
policy under which any drug conveyance can be confiscated and may 
be auctioned off after a hearing the quantity of drugs does not 
matter 
for example the 25 million 133foot ark royal was 
confiscated off key west on may 7 when less than a teaspoon of 
marijuana was found aboard 
the yacht was returned last week after michael rogerson 
president of the californiabased company that owns the boat paid 
a 1600 fine 
the zero tolerance policy was announced in miami two weeks ago 
by transportation secretary james burnley it has been in effect 
since april 11

patty hearst was the center of attention 
saturday at the cannes film festival where a film directed by paul 
schrader told the story of her 1974 kidnapping by an urban 
terrorist group 
ive not completely lost the feeling of anger and i doubt if i 
ever will ms hearst said at a news conference but i dont 
carry this through my whole life

newspaper magnate william randolph hearst was kidnapped by the 
symbionese liberation army in san francisco 
she was blindfolded held prisoner in a cupboard for 57 days and 
subjected to revolutionary reeducation renamed tania she took 
part in an armed bank robbery and stayed with the sla for 18 months 
before the fbi arrested her in 1975 
the film covers the five years from the kidnapping to february 
1979 when president carter granted her a pardon from her 
sevenyear prison sentence 
ms hearst said she felt no personal responsibility for the 
criminal act she committed 
nothing would have happened if the kidnapping had not taken 
place she said 
ms hearst said she had read the screenplay that was based on 
her own account of the affair my voyage in hell published in 
1978 
she said she been asked for her comments while the film was 
being made but she stayed away from the production because it 
may have been uncomfortable for personal reasons

wasnt she said

gigolo said he saw the events from ms hearsts point of view 
the film portrays the visions and sentiments of patty he 
said it was never intended to be a sociological film or a

had led a sheltered life 
her character was played by british actress natasha richardson 
the daughter of actress vanessa redgrave 
miss hearst was never acting of her own volition she was a 
person acted on schrader said it was difficult dramatically

ten major railroads are suing minnesota 
to challenge a new state law requiring an occupied caboose on 
freight trains of a certain length carrying hazardous materials 
the suit filed friday in federal court contends that the law 
which goes into effect aug 1 is preempted by federal railroad 
administration regulations that allow freight trains to operate in 
interstate commerce without occupied cabooses 
the railroads also say federal law governing the efficient 
interstate transportation of hazardous materials preempts the 
caboose law 
they say the new law discriminates against interstate 
transportation because it exempts certain local runs carrying such 
commodities as grain 
among the railroads seeking to have the federal court void the 
state law are burlington northern the soo line chicago amp north 
western and the duluth missabe amp iron range railway 
minnesotas new law states that trains more than 2000 feet long 
that have cars marked as carrying hazardous materials must have a 
caboose at the end of the train and it must be occupied by at least 
one train crew member 
violations of the law would permit the state attorney generals 
office or a county sheriff to seek a civil penalty against the 
offending railroad 
the stated purpose of the law which was pushed by railroad 
labor unions was to promote rail safety by helping to spot 
equipment failure or problems with track beds but opponents said 
it was merely an attempt by the railroad unions to preserve jobs no 
longer needed 
a caboose is just no longer needed al wiegold spokesman 
for burlington northern railroad said saturday he said there are 
computerized trackside monitors that indicate problems 
money also is a factor in dropping the caboose wiegold said 
its costly to keep those cabooses on there

thousands of tankled syrian troops 
rolled down from lebanons central mountains saturday and prepared 
to enter the slums of south beirut where western hostages are 
believed held by proiranian extremists 
by nightfall more than 4000 soldiers and 250 tanks and armored 
personnel carriers were deployed at the edge of the 16squaremile 
slum area buttressing 7500 syrian troops already in west beirut 
military sources said 
the buildup is expected to be completed sometime sunday 
perhaps at daybreak or a little later after which the forces will 
move in one source said on condition of anonymity 
the guns fell silent in the embattled slums when the syrians 
arrived police said 
the move followed the conquest of the slums by fundamentalist 
fighters of the iranianallied hezbollah or party of god in nine 
days of savage fighting with the prosyrian amal shiite moslem 
militia police said 211 people were killed 
police estimate hezbollah has 3000 combatants fighting amal 
which has thrown about 6500 militiamen into the battle 
the vanguard of the incoming syrian forces saturday rumbled 
across south beiruts ouzai coastal highway at 5 pm in 48 t55 
sovietmade tanks with gunners atop their swinging turrets 
they were led by brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military 
intelligence chief in lebanon and maj gen saeed beirakdar 
commander in chief of the syrian forces in lebanon 
they headed the battalion in a chauffeured bulletproof dark 
blue mercedes truckloads of infantrymen and ammunition and jeeps 
mounted with 106mm recoilless guns streamed in afterwards 
hundreds of plainclothes syrian secret servicemen at all 
gateways to the slums blocked reporters and photographers from 
entering 
kenaan and beirakdar flanked by senior aides met for an hour 
with amals chieftain nabih berri who is also lebanons justice 
minister at his heavily fortified house in west beirut saturday 
night 
they have agreed that the syrians will go into the slums but 
not into the nearby palestinian refugee camps where rival 
factions also have been fighting a berri spokesman said later on 
condition of anonymity 
a highranking lebanese military source also speaking 
privately said the syrian reinforcements were going to move in 
peacefully under an agreement being worked out by the presidents of 
iran and syria 
the reinforcements were coming from the bekaa valley where 
syria maintains the bulk of 25000 troops stationed in eastern and 
northern lebanon the source said 
the move came on the heels of a syrian threat of immediate and 
drastic treatment after hezbollahs forces stormed through the 
last amal stronghold 
after advancing across half of shiyah hezbollah now controls 
90 percent of south beirut reported a police spokesman who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
police said 20 people were killed and 41 injured saturday in the 
housetohouse intershiite moslem combat and other factional 
clashes in south beirut the latest casualties raised the toll in 
area fighting to 211 killed and 586 wounded since may 6 
the thud of exploding shells echoed across west beirut as 
hezbollah militiamen advanced across shiyah and amal fighters 
withdrew toward syrian lines in west beirut 
as hezbollah and amal dueled in shiyah rival palestinian 
guerrilla factions battled with howitzers and mortars for control 
of the nearby bourj elbarajneh refugee camp 
at the refugee shantytown seven people were killed and 16 
wounded in clashes that broke out early saturday between guerrillas 
of palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafats fatah 
faction and col saeed mousas syrianbacked fatahuprising police 
said 
the south beirut slums are where most of the 18 foreign 
hostages including nine americans are believed held by kidnappers 
affiliated with hezbollah 
the beirutbased magazine ashshiraa said friday the hostages 
had been moved from an exposed hezbollah barracks to the home of 
hezbollahs spokesman sheik ibrahim amin to prevent their 
liberation 
ashshiraa broke the story of secret us arms sales to iran in 
november 1986 
hezbollah said in a statement saturday it had also occupied 
amals military headquarters on the beirut airport highway in a 
fierce overnight assault 
helmeted syrian troops manned checkpoints along all roads 
connecting south beirut with the citys western sector police 
said the syrian move was aimed at preventing the amalhezbollah 
confrontation from spreading to syrias sphere of influence in west 
beirut they said 
south beirut remains outside the jurisdiction of the syrian 
contingent that deployed in west beirut in february 1987 after a 
month of bloody clashes between amal and druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 25000 troops 
in the bekaa and in north lebanon under a 1976 arab league

attracted by the slogan well provide 
the diamond if you provide the bride 13 couples married saturday 
at home plate before a minor league baseball game 
the couples came from neighboring illinois to avoid the expense 
or bother of an aids test which has been mandatory in their home 
state since jan 1 
players from the kenosha twins and the rockford ill expos 
lined paths at simmons field that led the brides and grooms to a 
portable chapel at home plate 
this is to be entered into seriously honorably advisably 
and in this case with good sportsmanship kenosha county court 
commissioner jon mason said to open the ceremony 
some brides wore traditional wedding gowns while others were 
dressed in more casual attire one groom wore a black top hat and 
tuxedo and next to him stood another prospective husband wearing 
an open collar shirt and slacks 
we did not want to spend 200 or 300 to get a marriage 
license jane smith of park forest ill said after she married 
floyd claiborne jr of richton park ill 
we looked at indiana and wisconsin before and then this came 
up and it was just perfect she said 
smiths bridesmaid gwendlyn kirkland said the ceremony was 
perfect for nontraditional and economic minded couples 
kenosha charges 50 for a wedding license but does not require 
any test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome illinois charges 
15 for a license but it also requires a blood test for aids and 
syphilis which can cost between 20 and 120 a person depending 
on the laboratory 
bob lee general manager of the kenosha twins said he thought 
of the mass wedding after watching county clerk nancy principe 
discuss on a news show the sudden rush of illinois couples applying 
for wisconsin marriage licenses 
if you look at baseball its a tradition and marriage well 
its a tradition also so it makes sense to have it here lee 
said im sure these wedding couples will remember this for a 
long time to come 
andy harter an infielder for the twins said the ceremony was 
enjoyable but i think were all wondering who would get married 
on a baseball diamond maybe the real question isnt whether i 
do but why here 
team officials said 14 couples registered for the wedding and 
all but one showed up the missing couple was from wisconsin 
the couples ranged in age from early 20s to late 50s 
corinne kozak 47 and norman dennis 56 both of arlington 
heights ill said the wedding ceremony was the first time they 
had ever been on a baseball field

ousted arizona gov evan mecham was 
elected saturday as a gop national delegate as the state republican 
party held its first convention since his removal from office 
mecham won on his second attempt to win a seat to the partys 
national convention trying first without success to be picked from 
his own congressional district and then as a delegate at large he 
was not claimed by any presidential candidate 
his stormy 15month governorship tore the state gop and former 
sen barry goldwater in a keynote address greeted by several 
standing ovations urged republicans to try to heal the wounds 
if we keep picking away at each other the states going to 
become a oneparty state again goldwater added 
he urged members to settle their differences at election time 
and let bygones be bygones or at least be patient and wait until 
election time to make corrections that you feel may be needed 
i have done very little work mecham said when asked to 
assess his chances before the balloting if i win itll be 
because people decide i should go its not a big thing 
mecham who was removed as governor by a senate court of 
impeachment last month is facing criminal charges in maricopa 
county superior court next thursday 
the thought of mecham going to the republican national 
convention as one of arizonas 33 delegates drew open disdain from 
other politicians in the state 
sen john mccain rariz had said he would be inclined not 
to attend the national convention if mecham were a delegate 
on saturday however mccain said he was certain he would attend 
whether or not mecham was a delegate 
i am sure we will want to do that i never changed my mind i 
said that i was thinking long and hard about it i never said that 
i wasnt going mccain said 
vice president george bush has won enough delegates nationwide 
to be clinch the nomination in new orleans and was expected to 
control the state convention as well after receiving majorities in 
24 of 37 preconvention caucuses and tying with former television 
evangelist pat robertson in one 
mecham one of the 717 delegates to saturdays convention said 
before the voting started that he believed he had strong 
support from rankandfile party workers 
he said saturday he would support bush and would concentrate on 
who bushs running mate would be 
officials of the bush and robertson campaigns said mecham would 
not be on their list of recommended delegates but robertsons 
campaign said its recommended slate would stop at 32 to enable 
mecham backers to fill in his name as the 33rd delegate if they 
wished 
mecham who faces criminal trial next thursday on charges he 
failed to report properly a 350000 campaign loan was removed 
from office last month after the republicancontrolled senate 
convicted him in a civil proceeding of misusing state money and 
obstructing an investigation into allegations that a campaign aide 
threatened the life of a former aide

the united states should give laos 
humanitarian aid if it wants the country to account for americans 
missing in the indochina war a senior government official said 
saturday 
we have fulfilled our obligation with the excavation said 
vice foreign minister soubanh srithirath we are awaiting the 
humanitarian gesture from the usa 
soubanh was referring to a joint excavation in southern 
savannakhet province for the remnants of a us aircraft shot down 
in 1966 with two crewmen aboard us and laotian soldiers 
completed the dig wednesday but found no remains 
soubanh spoke in an interview with a group of western reporters 
taken on a rare tour of laos a largely isolated nation ruled by a 
communist government since december 1975 
the united states is trying to account for 555 americans missing 
in action in laos many of them airmen downed during missions 
against laotian and vietnamese communist positions 
under an agreement in august last year laos ended a long period 
of inactivity on the mia issue while the united states said it will 
consider vientianes calls for humanitarian aid 
that was virtually identical to an agreement with vietnam laos 
close ally where nearly 1800 americans are reported missing 
vietnamese officials recently have been demanding that america 
honor its pledge of humanitarian assistance 
the united states has given laos some food aid in recent years 
after the savannakhet dig the us team donated medicine and 
equipment worth about 13000 to a local hospital as an expression 
of americas concern said ross petzing spokesman for the us 
embassy in bangkok 
soubanh suggested the united states give more medical aid 
including construction of a hospital in savannakhet 
in another development soubanh said vietnam has withdrawn a 
significant number of its troops from laos where he says they have 
been helping with national security and economic development for 
more than a decade 
soubanh declined to give numbers but said the pullout began in 
mid1987 the troops returned home because laos relations with 
china have improved and the laotian governments own military 
forces were adequate he said 
we feel that our security is less threatened he said 
some western diplomatic sources in vientiane speculate that less 
than half the estimated 50000 vietnamese troops have left others 
say they believe more than 40000 have pulled out 
vietnam formally stations troops in laos under a 25year 
friendship treaty signed in 1977 but most western sources believe 
some of the vietnamese forces that helped the laotian communists 
battle the usbacked regime in vientiane remained in laos after 
the communists took power in 1975

a former chinese air force pilot who 
defected to taiwan in a jet bomber in 1965 said saturday the 
government should have given him a bigger gold reward 
in a petition to the legislative yuan taiwans highest 
lawmaking body col lee hsienpin said he was living in hardship 
and asked the government to give him the shares of the gold rewards 
that were given to two technicians who flew to taiwan with lee 
technicians lee tsaiwang and lien paosheng did not deserve any 
share of the reward of 330 pounds of gold col lee said claiming 
the two technicians were merely his captives 
the reward was paid in cash and col lee received about 70000 
or 50 percent of the reward while lee tsaiwang and lien split the 
other half 
the government said the reward for lien who died of severe 
injuries when the ilyushin28 bomber crashlanded at taoyuan air 
base in northern taiwan would be handed to liens relatives in 
china when the nationalists regain the chinese mainland 
lee tsaiwang went to the united states after he retired from 
taiwans air force in 1975 
vice defense minister chou hsuehtsun on saturday told lawmakers 
the rewards also went to lee tsaiwang and lien because they helped 
lee hsienpin in flying to taiwan 
chou also argued the government has taken good care of lee who 
chou says owns three houses and earns a monthly salary of 1700 
taiwan has a sliding scale of rewards paid in gold for defecting 
chinese servicemen that depends on the type of military aircraft or 
ships brought out of china a jet bomber is worth 330 pounds of

voters here may become the first in 
the nation to shut down an operating nuclear power plant when they 
consider rival ballot measures to decide the fate of the 
problemplagued rancho seco plant 
a measure sponsored by a group called safe or sacramentans for 
safe energy would order the permanent closure of the 14yearold 
plant one of the few publicly owned nuclear power plants in the 
country 
an alternative plan put on the june 7 ballot by the sacramento 
municipal utility district which owns rancho seco in effect asks 
the districts voters to give the the plant 25 miles southeast of 
here another chance 
the utility district which comprises sacramento and surrounding 
areas with a combined population of more than 420000 has 
struggled with operating problems at the plant for years 
in addition district consumers have struggled with electricity 
rates that have gone up nearly 85 percent in three years and 
critics blame rancho seco for that too 
the thing has such a history of running so poorly and being 
unsafe that no one would believe it wont do the same thing in the 
future said bob mulholland political director of campaign 
california an environmental and consumers group working on the 
shutdown effort 
we figure that the odds of rancho seco operating above the 
industry average are about the same as winning the california 
lottery said karl ory of campaign california 
rancho seco managers say the plant deserves another chance 
were champing at the bit to show the public we can do it 
said steve redeker deputy operations manager for the first 
time we have an attitude of do it right 
ed smeloff the only one of the five utility district board 
members who wants to shut down rancho seco said passage of the 
measure could indirectly influence the private utilities that own 
the vast majority of the nations nuclear plants even though those 
utilities are not under the control of the voters as the 
sacramento utility is they are sensitive to public opinion he 
said 
it certainly does i think set a tone if a local electorate 
doesnt want a nuclear plant he said it would worry other 
utilities across the country even if the electorate doesnt have 
the final say 
the plant built for 375 million by babcock and wilcox inc 
has a reactor design like that of three mile island reactor no 2 
the site of the nations worst commercial nuclear power plant 
accident in march 1979 
from the day of its dedication in october 1974 the plant has 
been plagued by malfunctioning equipment and operator errors that 
forced more than 100 outages including a shutdown that lasted from 
december 1985 to last month 
the nuclear regulatory commission called the overcooling 
accident that led to that shutdown one of the dozen worst problems 
suffered by us plants in 1985 
the agency gives the plant one of the worst efficiency ratings 
of any in the nation federal investigations have concluded that 
the plant had a history of mismanagement poor or nonexistent 
maintenance poor operator training inattention to detail and 
failure to learn from past mistakes 
a federal investigation of a 1985 overcooling accident also 
found that an important monitor was set at a level that would 
underestimate escaping radiation 
proponents of the shutdown dubbed measure b on the ballot 
include mayor anne rudin and a majority of the sacramento city 
council they argue that the plant will never be adequate or 
reliable and will require an endless stream of money for scheduled 
modifications and unforeseen repairs 
proponents of the alternate measure measure c argue that the 
utility has spent 400 million to overhaul the plant is hiring an 
outside company to manage it and deserves a chance to prove rancho 
secos viability but the proposed hiring of another manager has 
provoked another dispute because the company duke power co of 
north carolina contributed 100000 to the measure c campaign 
measure c includes a provision that would call for the district 
to shut down rancho seco any time after dec 31 if the plant fails 
to operate at more than 50 percent of capacity for four consecutive 
months 
in the past the plant has managed to operate at an average of 
just 40 percent of capacity the 50 percent requirement however 
could be overridden by four of the utilitys five directors 
opponents of the plant question how legally binding measure c 
would be 
its my legal opinion that measure c in no way restricts the 
board from doing anything they want said attorney michael remy 
safe chairman whatever voters decide on june 7 the issue will 
almost certainly end up in court remy said

springfield laid claim saturday to the 
breakfast crown of america after serving pancakes to more than 
31000 people at a table that stretched seven blocks down main 
street 
the event was part of this western massachusetts citys 352nd 
birthday celebration and continued a 12year contest with battle 
creek mich which touts itself as the cereal capital of the world 
spokeswoman amy barron said a total of breakfast guests reached 
31279 exceeding by more than 800 the number served at battle 
creeks annual breakfast last summer 
we had a perfect day for a perfect event barron said the 
first pancake hit the grill at 725 am edt and they didnt 
stop serving until 1145 
city workers and residents pitched in for kitchen detail and 
area businesses donated most of the food she said 
the recipe for 64000 pancakes 3000 pounds of flour 660 
pounds of egg yolk 225 pounds of butter and 400 gallons of water 
the pancakes were topped with a ton of butter and 200 gallons of 
maple syrup and served with 600 gallons of coffee and 600 gallons 
of orange juice 
a radio station dished out blueberries for topping 
the theme went beyond food about 100 volunteers unfurled an 
85by45foot american flag that flew over mt rushmore for the 
landmarks 50th anniversary the flag was mounted on top of a crane 
in front of city hall 
the breakfast bowl was launched in 1956 to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the kellogg co plant in battle creek when that city 
set a world record for the longest breakfast table 
in 1976 springfield bested battle creek for the longest table 
with a pancake breakfast as part of its celebration of the nations 
bicentennial but the michigan city quickly regained the crown and 
continues to hold it with the exception of brief interruptions by 
springfield in 1986 and 1987 
last may springfield fed 27067 people at a 3600foot table 
confident that battle creek couldnt do better because its main 
street isnt long enough 
but one month later battle creek bent a 3700footlong table 
for 30413 around a street corner to reclaim the title 
this year former springfield mayor william c sullivan gave up 
on table length and focused on numbers served the strategy worked 
although this years table stretched a mere 2000 feet 
springfield may not hold the title for long battle creek has 
its annual cereal breakfast june 4

democrat michael dukakis was heckled saturday by gay political 
activists over his stand on their rights to be foster parents 
while republican george bush fended off a corporate executives 
criticism of reagan administration policies on taxes and trade 
both parties presidential frontrunners were spending the 
weekend campaigning in the west where the the bulk of the final 
round of primaries will be held in the next two weeks 
dukakis speaking to several dozen homosexual activists at a 
political action committee meeting in los angeles promised 
youre going to be deeply involved in what we do 
but the massachusetts governor was challenged over a policy in 
his state giving low priority to homosexual couples who want to be 
foster parents 
dukakis said he favored the massachusetts policy because i 
think its best all things being equal for a child to grow up in 
a household with a mother and father and other children 
his defense of that policy was met with some hisses from the 
crowd and occasional shouts of protest one man shouted bigot 
and another yelled youre antigay why dont you admit it 
dukakis later shrugged off the hostile reception saying it 
was lively thats what democracy is all about 
his aides nevertheless were pleased with the way the meeting 
went i thought it was very good very open said alice travis 
national political coordinator for the campaign 
meanwhile bush toured an intel microchip plant in oregon where 
the companys board chairman robert noyce told the vice president 
of a need for higher taxes and for president reagan to sign the 
trade bill 
i dont think that there is any chance of a balanced budget 
without new taxes said noyce 
reagan on saturday repeated his vow to veto a trade bill passed 
by congress because of a provision requiring large companies to 
notify employees in advance of plant closings 
the plantclosing aspect of the trade bill does not seem 
onerous to us noyce said it is no less than we would do in 
any case 
bush said he was not swayed by noyces arguments 
the vice president also sought to take the high ground on the 
issue of the environment saying for too long we have given away 
the playing field to the democrats on the environment i want to 
make the environment a republican issue 
jesse jackson campaigning in california took the environment 
as his theme saying he would seek a ban of exploratory offshore 
oil drilling along the states north coast forever 
jackson addressed an enthusiastic crowd in mendocino using a 
solarpowered loudspeaker 
this plan to drill for oil pollute the ocean and dirty the 
air is environmental violence its economic violence jackson 
said 
new york gov mario cuomo speaking in portland ore on 
saturday said he believes dukakis will win the democratic 
presidential nomination but will need jacksons help to win in 
november 
a jesse jackson who is an impassioned part of the effort to 
support mike dukakis if mike wins and thats the way it looks 
that would be helpful absolutely cuomo said 
the next two weeks mark the close to the primary season with 
oregons primary on tuesday followed a week later with primaries 
in california new jersey new mexico and montana 
meanwhile other states were wrapping up the final rounds of 
their delegate selection with state and district conventions over 
the weekend 
in arizona ousted gov evan mecham who was removed from office 
by a state senate impeachment trial and faces still another trial 
on criminal charges was selected as an atlarge delegate to the 
republican national convention no presidential candidate was 
claiming him and other state politicians were openly hostile 
toward his candidacy 
mecham who earlier lost in his bid to be one of the three 
delegates from a congressional district said he would support bush 
and would concentrate on the republicans choice for vice president 
delaware republicans picked 17 national convention delegates on 
saturday including former gov pete du pont who withdrew from the 
race for the gop presidential nomination 
dukakis and jackson each made slight gains in maine and 
michigan where democrats wrapped up their delegate selections on

an art school apologized in newspaper 
advertisements sunday for exhibiting a students portrait of late 
mayor harold washington in lingerie but criticized the way it was 
removed by black aldermen 
all educational institutions encourage students freedom of 
expression the school of the art institute said in fullpage ads 
in the chicago suntimes and chicago tribune 
regrettably in the use of his freedom this student created a 
work that had the effect of insulting the memory of an important 
leader mayor harold washington 
the student david nelson depicted washington in a frilly white 
bra panties garter and stockings holding a pencil and frowning 
washington died of a heart attack last november 
the painting was hung in a students exhibition at the school 
but was confiscated by police wednesday when black aldermen stormed 
in and said it disgraced the citys first black mayor and 
threatened public order 
we do not approve of the method used by members of the city 
council who entered a private space within the school and forcibly 
removed the painting from the wall even though we recognize the 
intensity of feeling on the part of those aldermen in this 
situation the ad said 
the ad was addressed to the chicago community and carried 
the names of marshall field president of the art institute of 
chicagos board of trustees and tony jones president of the 
school of the art institute 
nelson has not given interviews since the dispute began and did 
not attend his class graduation ceremonies at the school saturday 
eileen harakal a spokeswoman for the art institute said his 
diploma would be mailed to him 
the painting has been returned to him but the american civil 
liberties union has said it would file a civil rights lawsuit 
challenging the police departments authority to remove the piece 
the portrait has been a rallying point for blacks all week 
washington supporters scheduled and then canceled a march 
saturday from city hall to the art school 
we thought it best to let things cool off for awhile said 
chuck kelly a former aide to the late mayor we are going to 
continue to monitor the situation but i think the art institute 
has seen the error of its ways 
reporters who arrived at a plaza opposite city hall to cover the 
scheduled march instead found art students who also canceled a 
planned rally of their own 
joe medosch a student at the school said students wanted to 
avoid a confrontation with blacks 
we didnt want to see anyone hurt medosch said were not 
backing david nelson were backing our rights

republican nomineetobe george bush intent 
on discussing high technology saturday at the intel microchip 
plant instead heard about the need for higher taxes and president 
reagans signature on the trade bill 
bush was quick to disagree with intel board chairman robert 
noyce who said the semiconductor industry needs the trade bill and 
higher taxes can help balance the budget noyce had shown the vice 
president the companys semiconductor manufacturing facility 
outside of portland 
high technology and the environment were the topics for the 
third day of bushs western swing in advance of the oregon primary 
on tuesday and the california primary three weeks hence 
the republican heirapparent donned a full fab bunny suit 
in which he was garbed from head to toe in special overalls that 
keep dust at a minimum as he viewed the sophisticated intel 
facility 
later when noyce briefed the vice president on the companys 
situation taxes and a provision of the trade bill the 60day 
notification of a plant closing came up 
i dont think that there is any chance of a balanced budget 
without new taxes noyce told bush saying he is worried about 
the supply of capital for investment in america thats not a 
popular subject this year we need to promote savings 
bush said his mind has not been changed 
it didnt at all i dont think the next president has to 
provided we get a grip on spending i disagree with him on 
that he told reporters after a speech to intel employees 
noyce also said the semiconductor industry needs the proposed 
trade bill brushing aside reagans criticism of the measure the 
president in his weekly radio address repeated his vow to veto 
the bill citing the plantclosing provision 
the plantclosing aspect of the trade bill does not seem 
onerous to us noyce said it is no less than we would do in 
any case 
bush again disagreed backing reagan on the issue 
i was very interested in his position it doesnt change my 
mind he said 
but the vice president praised the massachusetts plantclosing 
law which his likely democratic opponent michael dukakis uses as 
an example to support the call for a federal law 
its not a big problem for companies like this but what you 
dont want to see is disincentives to start new businesses bush 
told reporters in massachusetts they have a plantclosing law 
its voluntary its not like the federal government imposing it 
at his last event of the day bush criticized the furlough 
program in massachusetts backed by dukakis that allowed some 
criminals weekend breaks from jail 
believe you will never see from me a program like the one in 
massachusetts to let these murderers out of jail ahead their 
sentence running out so they can go out and kill again like one 
of them did in that state bush told a crowd at a rally in 
medford 
the state legislature recently eliminated that furlough program 
on the subject of the environment bush said the republican 
party needs to take the issue back after years of allowing the 
democrats the right to lay claim to it 
for too long we have given away the playing field to the 
democrats on the environment i want to make the environment a 
republican issue he told the cheering crowd of about 800 
republicans late friday night in portland 
i would like to be remembered the same way as teddy roosevelt 
next to the national security its the condition of the earth 
that you will leave to generations to come we can do better he 
said 
bush was scheduled to visit a tree nursery near medford ore 
on saturday take a raft trip sunday and visit a tree research lab 
in washington on monday

the aids virus will reach epidemic proportions 
among young people educators were told saturday unless a 
comprehensive prevention program on the disease is implemented in 
every school at every grade level 
health officials at the national centers for disease control 
believe adolescents experimenting with sex and drugs seriously risk 
contracting the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus said 
dennis tolsman the cdcs director of health promotion and 
education 
we cant think aids prevention can be carried out through a 
pamphlet or a 15minute lecture tolsman told an audience of more 
than 100 educators attending a conference on aids and education 
we need a comprehensive program taught in health education 
classes by trained health education personnel to fight this 
problem he said we need your help to make sure adolescents 
understand what aids is and how it is prevented 
cdc officials teamed with the national education association to 
sponsor the threeday conference which concludes sunday 
educators received guidelines for educating students about aids 
and discussed aids infection among teenagers 
the guidelines propose efforts at all grade levels including 
early elementary school programs that reduce fears of an epidemic 
and teach students that the disease is not spread through casual 
contact 
late elementary and middle school programs should inform 
students about the disease itself and junior and senior high 
school students should be told of the risks of contracting aids 
through sex or intravenous drug use say the guidelines 
some educators expressed reservations about the plan 
school health officials cannot do this alone said jennifer 
jo hugstadvaa a biology teacher from burnsville minn aids is 
an epidemic and it covers every thing from biology home economics 
and social studies to economics 
its not just a health problem she said 
james williams director of the nea health information network 
added that the entire school staff should receive aids training 
because children often receive advice from their bus drivers 
janitors and cafeteria workers 
in the united states aids has affected 973 children under age 
13 260 teenagers and more than 61000 adults according to the 
cdc the disease has killed more than 34000 people 
the numbers in these groups children and teenagers are tiny 
when compared to adults but still the numbers are staggering 
said dr peter droutman medical epidemiologist for the cdc

michael dukakis didnt win iowas 
firstinthenation caucuses last february didnt even come in 
second but now that hes the likely nominee slightly embarrassed 
iowa democrats are falling in line behind the massachusetts 
governor 
not the least on their minds is 1992 and the prospect of losing 
the status of putting the first mark on the primary season 
thats a key factor said iowa party chairwoman bonnie 
campbell who admits her endorsement of dukakis last week was 
partly designed to curry favor with him in hopes hell look kindly 
on iowa in 1992 naturally i give great thought to that 
dukakis came in third in the feb 8 caucuses behind winner 
richard gephardt and runnerup paul simon but missouri rep 
gephardt dropped out of the presidential race march 28 and simon 
the senator from illinois suspended his campaign on april 7 
leaving dukakis and jesse jackson to battle for the nomination 
about 3000 democratic activists were trooping to congressional 
district conventions saturday to begin picking a slate of delegates 
that will bear only a passing resemblance to the muchballyhooed 
outcome of the precinct caucuses 
at those meetinngs dukakis claimed 12 of the delegates elected 
while gephardt forces won nine technically uncommitted delegates 
most of whom are expected to endorse dukakis during the next month 
jackson claimed seven delegates while simon was awarded six 
gephardts backers had hoped to maintain their status as a group 
in hopes of electing their leaders to delegate slots but most are 
epxected to turn to dukakis 
that isnt surprising party leaders say because a certain 
amount of flexibility has always been a trademark of iowa democrats 
we have to realign probably more than any other group of 
democrats said campbell it requires us to be quite facile and 
most iowa democrats are in fact pretty flexible 
our delegations makeup follows the idiosyncrasies of whats 
happening on the campaign trail and matches whats happening 
said democratic party spokesman phil roeder part of the good 
thing about the fourstep system we have is there are points along 
the road where people can step back change their allegiances and 
in a way go with the flow 
iowa was the launching pad for the democratic presidential race 
three months ago but the rest of the nation wasnt buying the 
direction the state wanted to head 
ms campbell said iowa democrats dont have to be told twice 
that its time to switch gears and they were moving to do that 
saturday she traveled to conventions in all six of the states 
congressional districts urging activists to elect national 
convention delegates loyal to dukakis 
i think it sends a pretty strong message that its a good time 
to start thinking about november said jerry crawford a des 
moines lawyer and dukakis backer 
party rules call for iowans to pick 34 of the states 61 
delegates to the democratic national convention at those district 
conventions 
the only suspense was whether gephardts loyalists could hang 
together long enough to elect their leaders to cherished delegate 
slots technically uncommitted but dukakis backers in reality 
most of them are gephardt people but i think youll see a lot 
of them commit to dukakis even before the state convention 
roeder said 
iowas delegate selection process is a complex affair and only 
the first stage is shoved into the nations political limelight 
the precinct caucuses were essentially a straw poll of whom was 
favored among the 100000 or so activists who showed up and elected 
delegates to the next step conventions in all 99 counties 
delegates arent actually elected until the district 
conventions and the race routinely has changed by that point the

ousted president ferdinand e marcos 
pledged his support to president corazon aquino on saturday and 
promised that if she let him come home for his mothers funeral he 
would not try a coup 
about 5000 people rallied to demand that marcos be allowed to 
attend the funeral of his mother josefa edralinmarcos who died 
may 4 she was 95 no date for the funeral has been set family 
members have been hoping mrs aquino would change her mind about 
marcos attending 
mrs aquino ruled out allowing marcos to return the government 
also said saturday that marcos must repay the billions he allegedly 
stole during his 20 years in power before he can come home from 
exile in hawaii and ordered its consulate in hawaii to block his 
return 
marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad read marcos statement by 
telephone from hawaii where marcos lives in exile in the 
statement broadcast by manila radio stations marcos promised he 
would not exploit his return to undermine her government 
i reiterate that i oppose violence that i have no intention 
of mounting a coup detat or causing a civil war the marcos 
statement said i therefore advise my supporters and those who 
are fighting for the very same democratic principles that i stand 
for not to engage in any disruptive and more violent activities 
but in a telegram to the philippine consulate in honolulu the 
presidential palace said mrs aquino remained convinced marcos 
return would undermine national security 
marcos supporters have been linked to several attempts to topple 
the aquino government 
the telegram released by the palace to news organizations also 
said mrs aquino would allow him to come back if he returns all 
the wealth he stole from the country 
mrs aquinos government claims marcos and his associates 
siphoned off up to 10 billion during his 20year administration 
before he fled after a february 1986 popular uprising 
marcos statement also urged his supporters to join forces 
with madame aquino to oppose communist rebels and others who 
challenge the stability of the current government 
the ousted president said that allowing him to return would 
not only adhere to the noble principle of humanitarianism but 
also would unite various political forces into an overpowering 
force which would prevent bloodshed and at the same time solve 
the present economic sufferings of our people 
on friday marcos claimed he was negotiating with manila and 
washington to return for the funeral 
mrs aquinos spokesman teodoro benigno said fridays 
statement was meaningless and us ambassador nicholas platt told 
reporters that american officials just havent been involved at 
all in negotiations regarding marcos return 
marcos loyalists gathered in 100degree weather saturday and 
marched to the mendiola bridge about 300 yards from the 
presidential palace march leader salvador panelo said they would 
remain there until mrs aquino reversed her decision or marcos 
appeared before them but by sundown the crowd had largely 
dispersed 
protesters carried banners reading give us marcos or give us 
death others claimed marcos was the only one who could stop the 
communist insurgency which erupted and spread nationwide during 
his administration 
also saturday a bomb exploded at military headquarters killing 
one soldier officials said the building has been vacant since 
being set ablaze during an august coup attempt 
navy lt anselmo cabingan a military spokesman said the victim 
was believed to be a member of a roving guard force and apparently 
picked up an explosive device left after the coup plot failed 
its an accident cabingan said its not connected with 
anything political or whatever its just a simple accident as we 
see it

despite months of us sanctions and 
a crumbling economy gen manuel noriega is hardening his position 
and preparing for months or possibly years more of confrontation 
with the united states 
a confident noriega on friday sallied into the provinces where 
he was cheered by peasants and hailed by smalltown officials 
accompanied by several colonels in a show of military unity 
panamas defiant leader accused in the united states of drug 
trafficking dismissed prospects for a negotiated settlement with 
the united states 
noriegas comments to journalists indicated he considers himself 
and panama a test case of historical proportions and that he is 
determined to rise to the occasion and challenge us might 
everything fell apart he said in la negrita 90 miles west 
of the capital when asked about recent uspanamanian talks aimed 
at resolving panamas political crisis over noriegas leadership 
the washington post citing unidentified sources reported in 
its sunday editions that negotiations were at a delicate stage and 
that administration officials believed a deal would be struck 
within a few days or the talks would collapse 
the administration is offering to drop drugtrafficking charges 
against noriega if he relinquished office aug 12 and left the 
country the newspaper said in addition the administration would 
continue to recognize ousted president eric arturo delvalle but 
also would allow solis palma noriegas handpicked chief of state 
to continue as panamas acting president through the may 1989 
elections the newspaper said 
the post said there were conflicting reports on when noriega 
could return to panama under the deal but one source said it would 
be after the elections 
on wednesday us media also reported that a washingtonnoriega 
deal was nearly complete they said it involved noriega stepping 
down and accepting temporary exile in exchange for dismissal of the 
drug charges 
his lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal of the 
drug charges in about a month they contend the charges are 
politically motivated 
the general isnt going anywhere his spokesman maj 
edgardo lopez told the associated press in rio hato where 
smalltown mayors met with noriega a document signed by 505 mayors 
called noriega the incarnation of panamas struggle against 
imperialism and praised him for walking among the humble and 
speaking their language 
noriega a mestizo of lower middleclass origins has tried to 
present the crisis as a conflict pitting a domineering washington 
allied with local rich white sellouts against panamas 
darkerskinned and poorer majority 
the military commander whose fortune is estimated at up to 1 
billion and his propaganda machine have succeeded to some degree 
in selling that version locally and in latin america 
a divided opposition has been hamstrung by carefully applied 
repression that gets the job done without deaths all opposition 
media have been closed 
panamas dignity is not negotiable while there are foreign 
troops on our territory humiliating our soil while there is 
economic aggression as long as there are threats as long as there 
is psychological war noriega told reporters in rio hato adding 
and as long as us ambassador arthur davis doesnt get out 
about 10000 american soldiers are stationed in panama as part 
of the us southern command 
the month of august when noriega completes 25 years of military 
service has been mentioned as a possible retirement date but he 
said friday the date of his retirement is none of washingtons 
business 
lopez said nothing prevents the general from commanding the 
defense forces for several more years if he and the high command 
see fit 
michael kozak the us state department envoy who has been 
talking with noriegas representatives in recent weeks was still 
in panama on saturday 
lopez who described the talks as stalled said kozak might go 
home this weekend but he also said it was in the reagan 
administrations interest to make it appear that negotiations were 
continuing even if they offered scant hope of progress 
in the middle of an election campaign president reagan who 
is backing vice president george bush 100 percent has to save 
face because of the big bungle theyve made he said 
lopezs assessment of prospects for the talks was bleak 
kozak comes each time with the same plan the original plan a 
little more elastic it is a deadline for noriega resigning his 
post a deadline for leaving the country he said it is a plan 
that the general and the panamanian republic cannot accept 
noriega told reporters the experiment of us aggression 
that exists in panama is a testing ground that later could be 
applied to honduras guatemala costa rica or any country 
the general faces other pressures however beyond those from 
washington the countrys economy is collapsing under the strain of 
the crisis 
a team of five respected economists published a study this week 
saying production was half of normal because of us sanctions and 
banking restrictions they said more than a quarter of the work 
force will be unemployed within months even if the political 
crisis were resolved tomorrow 
they raised the specter of hunger and said it would take at 
least two years of intensive recovery measures and massive 
international aid to get the economy back to a semblance of what it 
was a year ago 
they said recovery cannot even begin until the political crisis 
stemming from noriegas hold on power is settled 
but that appears further off with each passing day 
ricardo arias calderon president of the christian democratic 
party is one of the few opposition leaders who has not gone 
underground or into exile 
he said thursday that though there are no more antigovernment 
street demonstrations and other protest has been quashed the 
crisis has deepened in that society simply refuses to function 
he said he believes noriega realizes he cannot hold on 
indefinitely

impeached former gov evan mecham facing 
trial this week on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
proclaimed faith in his innocence but uncertainty about whether he 
will be acquitted 
mecham remained in the spotlight saturday attending his state 
party convention and narrowly winning a seat at the republican 
national convention 
mecham who was removed from office april 4 by the legislature 
could be sentenced to up to 22 years in prison if found guilty on 
all six felony counts of perjury willful concealment and filing 
false documents 
his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer willard mecham will be 
tried on three similar counts 
the legal woes did not stop delegates to the state republican 
convention saturday from picking mecham to be one of the states 33 
delegates when the party convenes this summer in new orleans 
mecham finished 17th in the balloting for 18 atlarge delegates 
after losing a bid for one of the delegate seats allocated by 
congressional district 
mecham one of the 717 delegates to his state party convention 
said before voting that he believed he had strong support from 
rankandfile party workers mecham supports vice president george 
bush but bush campaign officials said mecham was not on their list 
of recommended delegates 
told the results by reporters mecham said hurrah and thrust 
his right fist upward well for not being on a slate thats not 
too bad he said adding this was not a referendum on me 
sen john mccain rariz placed 10th in the atlarge balloting 
with 296 votes to mechams 271 and said he would attend the 
convention despite earlier reluctance to serve in a delagation with 
mecham 
amazing mccain said of the vote i respect the decision 
of the convention i have no other comment about it 
in the criminal case mecham and his brother are accused of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan from tempe developer barry 
wolfson by failing to report it on evan mechams personal or 
campaign financial statements 
i have committed no crime mecham 64 said in a telephone 
interview last week i should be found innocent because i dont 
feel myself guilty as far as i can see 
however mecham shied away from predicting he will be exonerated 
by a maricopa county superior court jury and indicated he still may 
be open to a plea agreement if it didnt involve pleading guilty to 
a felony a condition that prosecutors have rejected previously 
mechams 15month governorship was a stormy one beginning with 
his cancellation of a martin luther king holiday for state workers 
and ending with his repeated claims that his political and legal 
problems were the result of a massive conspiracy 
he was removed from office when the senate convicted him of 
trying to thwart an investigation into an alleged death threat and 
misusing 80000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership 
the senate dismissed a charge stemming from the campaign loan 
after some senators argued that voting on it would prejudice 
mechams criminal case 
on monday attorneys were set to present oral arguments before 
the state court of appeals on a defense request to throw out the 
indictment if they fail there defense attorneys plan to go to the 
state supreme court 
if there is no delay jury selection is scheduled to begin 
thursday 
in insisting that he broke no laws mecham has advanced several 
arguments 
that the october 1986 loan was actually reported properly 
because it was lumped with other funds and listed as a 465000 
loan from mecham to his campaign the funds were lumped together as 
a timesaving matter mecham said 
that the failure to report the loan was an honest mistake 
by willard mecham who filled out the financial reports the best 
he knew how 
that mecham is the victim of selective prosecution because 
other public officials have amended their reports without facing 
criminal charges 
that in any case whether the loan was properly reported or 
not there was no criminal intent to hide it 
the prosecution however is expected to point to a letter from 
mecham to wolfson in which he promised the loan would remain 
confidential another key piece of evidence is a november 1986 
receipt that showed a 350000 contribution to the campaign from 
mecham although he acknowledged he made no such contribution 
none of the attorneys involved prosecutors barnett lotstein 
and michael cudahy mecham defense lawyer michael scott and 
willards attorney joe keilp is tipping his hand on trial 
strategy 
but among the witnesses expected to be called are a number of 
key players inside and outside the mecham administration including 
former top aide donna carlson she was one of several cosigners of 
the wolfson loan and later was the object of the alleged death 
threat that became the centerpiece of mechams senate impeachment 
conviction 
the governors successor democratic gov rose mofford was 
subpoenaed by the defense to testify about her knowledge of the 
campaign finance reporting law she herself is under investigation 
for omissions from her reports which she recently corrected 
if the trial begins as scheduled jury selection will start with 
distribution of a questionnaire designed to ferret out people with 
obvious bias 
for his part defense attorney scott said im confident that 
he should be acquitted but he added im not confident that it 
will happen

it wasnt typical for postwar 
west germany steel workers staging wildcat strikes seizing a 
bridge setting up vigils storming a corporate meeting 
for six months the workers struggled to keep the rheinhausen 
krupp steel mill from closing down a victim of economic decline in 
the ruhr the longtime industrial powerhouse of germany 
in the end the workers lost their fight widely covered by 
newspapers and television but they won hearts all across an 
astonished nation 
celebrities politicians students right wingers and left 
wingers even groups in the soviet union and east germany raised 
voices of support 
donations of money came from around the country for workers 
involved in west germanys worst labor unrest in years 
during the winter wealthy women started collecting toys and 
clothes for what they called those poor krupp children said 
the rev dieter kelp a lutheran pastor 
but i said this isnt the third world and there hasnt been 
any war or bombing its just a question of jobs 
kelp had joined the workers in their vigils outside the plants 
front gate sometimes standing in front of a cross with the word 
solidaritaet solidarity on it 
solidarity became part of the local vocabulary 
our workers solidarity fund got contributions from all over 
germany said rheinhausens village manager hans kleer they 
came from flensburg in the north to passau in the south 
west germanys tiny communist party donated 260000 marks 
160000 the much larger social democrats roughly the same 
while businesses average people and a host of others brought 
the total to 13 million marks 828000 kleer said 
you have to be amazed at that much support 
the workers representatives nevetheless admitted defeat may 3 
coming away only with a promise that the plant will stay open until 
the end of 1990 and that efforts would be made to find other 
opportunities for the 5300 workers 
only a massive and unexpected reversal in the steel industrys 
fortunes could keep krupp from shutting the mill down after 1990 
company officials say the mill 18 miles northwest of 
duesseldorf has lost more than 1 billion marks 613 million 
since 1980 
the fight is over its a real defeat for us said mafred 
bruckschen chairman of the rheinhausen mills works council the 
workers representative body that agreed to the compromise 
a krupp spokesman hansjuergen berg called it a victory of 
reason 
the compromise provides for job placement at a nearby mill for 
some workers rehirings outside the steel industry newly created 
jobs and early retirements 
but bruckschen said workers now must concentrate on making sure 
the new jobs come about many people have expressed doubts about 
that he said 
during the workers struggles the word rheinhausen became 
synonymous with the economic decline of the ruhr valley 
in the last two years the area around duisburg the city that 
includes rheinhausen village has lost 20000 jobs most of them in 
the steel industry 
unemployment in duisburg stands at 176 percent compared with 
the nationwide average of 89 percent 
the work force in the steel industry centered in the ruhr has 
fallen to 150000 from a peak of 500000 in the 1960s 
the rheinhausen works was built in 1897 joining the krupp 
empire that later provided the german industrial muscle for two 
world wars and helped rebuilt the country over the past four 
decades 
like other ruhr steel plants rheinhausen has been hurt by 
declining demand and competition from countries with low labor 
costs 
people have now realized how powerless politicians are said 
herbert leimkuehler a member of the krupp works council and a 
communist party member theyve seen how just a handful of 
managers can pass judgment on an entire region 
mehmet aslan one of about 700 turks working at rheinhausen 
also talked of the politicians 
the politicians say go south and get work in bavaria he 
said but i know young people whove done that and couldnt 
find apartments 
some of them wound up sleeping in cabins in the woods

in oregon which relies more than almost 
any state on local property taxes to pay for schools theres more 
than money at stake in the acrimonious fight over one countys tax 
vote tuesday 
residents of southern oregons josephine county are debating the 
future of public education itself 
one group people united for responsible education has 
suggested leasing public schools to a private corporation saying 
the schools are too costly and inefficient 
supporters of the proposed multimilliondollar propertytax 
measures for the grants pass and josephine county school districts 
say the local economy is suffering because of uncertainty about 
school funding they believe children will suffer if the tax 
measures are rejected 
public education is not the only means of achieving 
education argues signe carlson president of the josephine 
county taxpayers association we have a lot of private schools in 
the county a lot of parents who are involved in home schooling 
a political consultant enlisted to help pass the measures c 
montgomery johnson says the tax fight is the most divisive hes 
seen in oregon 
i dont think the system of public education in josephine 
county is going to survive without constant support on the part of 
folks many of whom have given up he says 
oregons schoolfinancing woes long have been blamed on the 
states dependence on the local property tax the national 
education association ranks oregon third nationally in its reliance 
on local revenue 666 percent of its school financing comes from 
property taxes oregon has no sales tax 
the great progressive state of oregon ought to stick its head 
under the pillow johnson says it ought to be ashamed of the 
way it funds public schools 
josephine county voters are known for their strong antitax 
sentiment born of the 1970s tax revolt and maintained by the 
wellorganized and vocal taxpayers association many residents 
moved to the county to escape high land values and taxes in other 
states 
but many too consider public education the foundation of 
democracy 
weve had some professional people refuse to move here because 
of the situation says susan allen a leader of a proschools 
group formed several months ago in response to the antitax forces 
weve had people putting their houses on the market because if 
the tax bases do fail they wont be able to sell them 
carlson dismisses johnsons claim that her association is out to 
destroy public education a teacher who left the profession in 
1960 she insists the schools could be run more efficiently 
we have the lowest percapita income of any county in the 
state and yet the public employees the teachers and 
administrators want the same salaries and benefits of everywhere 
else carlson says 
state figures however show the josephine county district will 
spend 3335 per student this year while grants pass will spend 
3627 well below the state average of 4007 
theyre not on the bottom but theyre close to the bottom 
says walter koscher a statistician for the oregon education 
department in salem 
oregon used to force schools to close when voters repeatedly 
rejected tax measures last year oregon voters approved the 
socalled safety net law which allows districts to levy the 
previous years property tax if voters wont approve more money 
the safety net has its holes however if other revenue sources 
decline and expenses rise the previous tax levy quickly becomes 
inadequate 
josephine countys school districts and their 9800 students 
face major staff and program cuts next fall if they fall into the 
safety net again 
the districts in recent years already cut staff closed schools 
increased class sizes and postponed equipment purchases some 
school buses in grants pass have been on the road since 1959 
superintendent dale smith says 
smith says his school board will begin work on a 15 million 
budget cut wednesday if voters reject the city districts proposed 
122 million tax base 
john mayfield county schools superintendent says his district 
faces a 25 million cut if its 143 million tax base is turned 
down that could mean 25 teacher layoffs and elimination of 
extracurricular activities and field trips among other cuts he 
says 
im embarrassed that the state would allow a district to do 
the things were looking at doing the cuts in staff and 
programs mayfield says im embarrassed to live in a state 
that would let that happen

when indiana jones sought the temple 
of doom in india he was really doing it in sri lanka likewise 
when tarzan romped through the jungle he was not in africa but near 
the sri lankan hill town of kandy 
the late filmmaker sir carol reed once referred to sri lanka as 
the most natural and complete outdoor set and this island 
nation despite its long war by tamil militants for a separate 
homeland continues to lure american and british moviemakers 
the fight by tamil guerrillas for an independent nation for 
their minority people broke out in 1983 the tamils who are 18 
percent of the islands 16 million people claim they are 
discriminated against by the majority sinhalese 
since 1980 at least seven major films have been produced around 
the lush mountains dense jungles rivers and waterfalls near 
kandy barely a threehour drive into the hills from the capital of 
colombo 
villages near kandy once the capital of a buddhist kingdom 
have been villages everywhere from vietnam to africa in various 
movies 
sri lanka has managed to cheat as countries like india 
malaysia thailand and the philippines said asoka perera 
managing director of sri lanka film locations limited 
pereras company helps scout locations for movies and he said 
sri lankas success in drawing filmmakers is due to a lack of red 
tape involved in shooting here 
one of the first major movies made in sri lanka was in 1956 when 
director david lean filmed his hit movie bridge on the river 
kwai on the island then known as ceylon the film about british 
pows in burma who are forced to build a bridge for the japanese 
during world war ii won six academy awards 
the movie was set partly here so when william holden escaped a 
japanese prison on burma and made his way through fierce jungle and 
across sunbaked seas to a british base on ceylon he was really 
just around the corner from where he started 
paramounts the purple plain with gregory peck also about 
the burma campaign during world war ii and elephant walk 
starring elizabeth taylor in a movie about a ceylon tea plantation 
were both made in 1954 
but sri lanka lost out as a location for foreign movies from 
197077 when the prosocialist government led by the sri lankan 
freedom party viewed anything coming from the west as decadent 
it was not until 1980 that the trend was reversed when john 
dereks tarzan the apeman was filmed starring his wife bo 
derek and richard harris 
since then movies shot in sri lanka have included the george 
lucassteven spielberg indiana jones and the temple of doom 
mountbatten the last viceroy light over the water which 
was set partly in australia further adventures of tennessee 
buck in which sri lanka masquerades as africa and jungle 
heat in which the country plays itself 
iron triangle about an american troop operation in vietnam 
completed production here in february and is to be released later 
this year it stars beau bridges and haing s ngor who won an 
academy award for supporting actor in roland joffes critically 
acclaimed the killing fields 
jayantha jayatillaka of sri lanka film locations limited said 
films made here earn the country needed foreign exchange and give a 
boost to the tourist industry expenditures on filming in sri lanka 
were reported to be 8 million for indiana jones 5 million 
for tarzan the apeman and 3 million for iron triangle 
sri lankas mix of cultures also helps producers find extras 
for their projects thus reducing their costs jayatillaka said 
for the making of iron triangle sri lankans of chinese 
descent and those who were descendants of traders from malaysia 
were recruited to play vietnamese he said 
but sri lankas ethnic conflict born from that same cultural 
mix has blocked filming on some parts of the island perera said 
some of the scenes of tarzan the apeman were filmed at the 
beaches in eastern trincomalee district in 1980 before the violence 
broke out he said since 1983 we have to stay clear of the 
north and east despite the fact there are some beautiful locations 
there 
but perera said spectacular scenery and miles of palmlined 
beaches exist elsewhere on the island 
the island is being considered for a movie about a journalist in 
the philippines during the overthrow of president ferdinand marcos 
the movies star rebecca gilling of the australian tv series 
return to eden was recently in colombo with producer bob 
markowitz keeping with the international spirit of moviemaking 
here the production is being handled by an australian company

boasting experienced and cheap 
crews and what it says are the biggest film studios in europe 
czechoslovakia lures western producers to make movies they say they 
could barely afford to film at home 
the latest foreign films being made in czechoslovakia are an 
americanwest german coproduction starring faye dunaway and 
klausmaria brandauer and a british family fantasy the wolves of 
willoughy featuring american soap opera queen stephanie beacham 
according to mark forstater producer of wolves he saved 
about 28 million or 40 percent of total production costs by 
making the film in czechoslovakia and not in britain 
other advantages were guaranteed snow not often seen in 
southern england in march and a manor house near the bohemian 
town of hradec kralove that forstater said was a perfect 1850 copy 
of an english manor house 
he also had the good cheap craftsmanship of the setmakers at 
pragues barrandov studios billed as the largest in europe 
in march the second tract of the studios was transformed into a 
huge and gloomy victorian laundry with an enormous cauldron in one 
corner ragged orphans played by some of the 100 czech children 
chosen to take part in the movie washed clothes on a set that gave 
the feeling of stepping into a charles dickens novel 
beacham said in an interview that she was embarrassed by the 
disparity of wages between herself and the czech crews 
we work long hours but we get paid for it she sighed 
there are five categories for remuneration of local actors a 
senior czech actor can get up to 90 a day but most crew members 
would get much less overtime is not paid 
what beacham did enjoy was not being known or recognized in 
prague streets its lovely its great freedom she said 
when i get a wolf whistle its for me and not for my tv role 
the biggest complaint on the set was the scarcity of vegetables 
forstater said the crew sent a bus to west germany once a week 
to get produce usually when i ask people what im to bring when 
they are on location they ask for chocolates here they want 
carrots and cauliflower said food consultant sara keen 
the language barrier also sometimes posed a problem czech 
handlers for the 16 alsatian dogs dressed up to look like wolves 
had to get their commands translated from english and then 
instruct the dogs 
but the czechs are used to coping with such difficulties 
pragues stateowned film company first made a film for the west in 
1958 when walt disney productions hired them to produce popeye 
the sailor man and tom and jerry 
in 1964 the west germans made the first fulllength feature 
film shot by westerners in czechoslovakia business slowly built 
up until czechoslovakia had a 34 million turnover in 
coproductions and foreign orders by the end of the 1960s 
now five or six fulllength foreign features mostly west 
german about 30 short films and 1015 tv films are made each year 
the most famous films made in czechoslovakia in recent years 
include slaughterhouse five the film version of kurt 
vonneguts antiwar fantasy novel made in 1971 all quiet on the 
western front a remake of the 1930 classic shot in derelict 
miners houses and open cast mines in 1979 barbra streisands 
yentl in 1982 and the academy awardwinning amadeus in 
1983

six months after desperate cuban detainees took 
138 hostages and seized control of federal prisons in atlanta and 
oakdale la the government is paroling them in unprecedented 
numbers 
but the government program baffles some of the inmates and their 
lawyers they complain that the parole policy is incoherent and 
inconsistent quickly releasing scores of men yet keeping hundreds 
with sometimes minor criminal records behind bars without apparent 
reason 
according to the immigration and naturalization service 1093 
detainees have been freed since the uprisings compared with 92 
released in the six months preceding the riots ins officials deny 
the uprisings prompted the accelerated release policy 
in all since the riots ended in early december 2224 cubans 
have been recommended for release and 1208 have been deemed unfit 
for the streets said duke austin spokesman for the ins in 
washington twentyfour detainees have been marked for deportation 
and 300 more will have their fates decided in panel reviews by may 
31 
us attorney general edwin meese iii promised the full reviews 
as part of an agreement that ended the riots in which one atlanta 
detainee was killed and several others were injured none of the 
hostages was injured 
the 2400 men in detention at atlanta and oakdale last fall had 
committed crimes after arriving in this country from the cuban port 
of mariel in 1980 when fidel castro allowed 125000 cubans to 
leave 
at the time of the riots however the detainees had served 
their sentences and were being held indefinitely at the behest of 
the ins 
some had been held in this legal limbo for more than four years 
when they learned that the state department and cuba had 
reactivated a 1984 agreement for deportation of excludable 
immigrants 
the oakdale center erupted in flames on nov 21 the atlanta 
prison fell to the cubans two days later the justice department 
would later lay partial blame for the riots on the scant fourhour 
notice given prison officials by the state department 
the louisiana siege ended after eight days but atlantas 
uprising went on until dec 4 becoming one of the longest in 
federal prison history damage at the two prisons was estimated at 
64 million 
the prisons were shut down and the detainees some of whom 
insisted they would rather die than return to cuba were scattered 
to prisons across the country since then most of have been held 
in lockdown status confined to special seclusion areas 23 
hours a day 
they just sit in those cells waiting and getting depressed 
said linda serrano of atlanta whose commonlaw husband manuel 
casalis noy was approved for parole in november but has yet to be 
released 
despite the release statistics some advocates for the detainees 
including bishop augustin roman of miami who helped end the 
sieges maintain the government has not completely lived up to its 
promise 
the detainees arent being given full reviews theyre just 
being interviewed whats more the government doesnt even make an 
official record of these panel reviews something you must have if 
there is to be an effective appeal process said karen ellingson 
a legal aid attorney in minneapolis who has sat in on more than 70 
interviews conducted by the 20 twoperson ins review teams 
the pace of the reviews has stepped up since the riots detainee 
advocates say 
late last month us justice department spokesman patrick 
korten said the accelerated postriot releases reflected a more 
liberal parole policy however craig raynsford associate counsel 
at ins said i assure you these people are not being more 
favorably treated because they rioted 
he said the number of parolees has risen sharply because the 
review procedure implemented last june was slow and laborious and 
only recently began to bring about large numbers of releases 
theres a cumulative effect at work here he said our 
parole approval rate remains slightly above 60 percent the same as 
it was before the riots 
gary leshaw an attorney who works with the atlantabased 
coalition to support cuban detainees said his office is still 
swamped with calls for help more than 1100 men approved for 
release remain in prison for one reason or another such as a 
shortage of halfway houses or lack of sponsors he said 
supporters of the detainees note that prior to the riots all 
but about 20 of the releases were to halfway houses since 
december hundreds of detainees have been freed directly to their 
families and sponsors 
some detainees are being released right away almost pushed 
out onto the street while others including some who have good 
prison records and committed far less serious crimes remain behind 
bars for months said leshaw nobody seems to know whats going 
on 
although the 20 review teams might differ in style and approach 
raynsford said all look for the same thing in making 
recommendations whether the detainee is presently nonviolent 
and likely to stay that way whether he is likely to present a 
threat to the community and whether he is likely to violate his 
parole 
he also noted that a special appeals tier had been created for 
detainees who are turned down for parole even those who have been 
scheduled for repatriation to cuba can appeal 
but these are just paper appeals said ms ellingson you 
dont get to face your accusers besides its just another case of 
the ins which has been responsible for the incarceration of the 
detainees acting as their judge and jury 
she gave a recent experience as an example of why the process is 
so frustrating 
officials of dismas house a nonprofit facility in kansas 
city recently interviewed 45 detainees who had been approved for 
parole the halfway house took 18 of them and left the others 
stranded in prison not even knowing why they werent selected 
much less when they would be released 
asked why the director of dismas house the rev everett 
thornton said he had room for only 18 detainees we try and look 
for motivation thats the most important thing he said 
but ms ellingson said other factors are involved such as a 
detainees appearance and his ability to speak english things 
that really shouldnt matter that much 
even some detainees who have been released question the fairness 
of the ins process one of them is mario ochoa of brooklyn who was 
released in march just three weeks after his panel hearing 
i think i was released so quick because my wife went to 
washington several times and talked to congressmen and reporters 
about my case she really worked hard for me said ochoa who 
finished serving 26 months in 1986 for possession of a deadly 
weapon with intent to use it 
but he added im one of the lucky ones there are others 
still in lockdown who have good records and committed lesser crimes 
than i did i really cant figure out whats going on

the resurrection of the oakdale federal 
detention center is under way six months after it was nearly 
destroyed by rioting cubans and none too soon for many allen parish 
residents 
if it reopened tomorrow it would be six months too late 
said sandy strother a 25yearold resident of this south central 
louisiana town of 7200 
im ready for it to reopen she said in fact ive 
applied for a job there 
last nov 21 the 1000 cubans held here pending federal 
decision on their future went on a rampage at the news that some 
would be deported to their native land they burned 10 of the 14 
buildings at the 17 million center and took 28 guards hostage 
two days later cubans at the federal penitentiary in atlanta 
followed suit that uprising lasted until dec 4 while the siege 
at oakdale ended after eight days 
assistant warden art espinoza a 25year veteran of the us 
bureau of prisons arrived at the oakdale center the night before 
the cubans rioted 
ive been through riots but ive never been to a place before 
where they burned the place down espinoza said 
a pair of dormitories which escaped with only broken windows 
and some minor damage serve as temporary administration offices 
and housing for about 45 inmates maintaining the site 
inside bright white orange and yellow paint makes the 
dormitories nicer than those on some college campuses there are no 
steelgray cells with bars and wire mesh here 
if you would have walked in the first day after it was over 
you would never have believed people who lived here would have 
destroyed it as nice as it was espinoza said 
despite the destruction espinoza said he had no animosity 
toward the cubans inmates are inmates just because they burned 
the place down we cant say we dont want those types here he 
said 
a justice department report released earlier this month placed 
some of the blame for the oakdale and atlanta riots on prison 
officials it said they failed to recognize signs of impending 
trouble 
the report also said placing cubans at the oakdale facility a 
low to mediumsecurity alien processing center was a calculated 
risk 
espinoza said rebuilding the center will cost more than 13 
million and should be finished by oct 1 the prison should being 
taking new inmates by november 
oakdale mayor george mowad said hed been assured by federal 
officials that the prison would not again be home to a large group 
of a single type of illegals such as the cubans from the 1980 
mariel boatlift 
any concentration of cubans our people would be upset with 
mowad said the people of oakdale were very proud of that 
facility and then to go out and see it destroyed it was hard 
mowad says those worries arent enough to keep the town from 
eagerly anticipating the prisons reopening we had 100 percent 
support for it before it burned after the riot it dropped to about 
90 percent but weve got most of those people back 
after the oakdale center is rebuilt a second phase called 
oakdale ii is tentatively scheduled to open in november 1989 mowad 
said with both facilities operating the 500 federal jobs would 
make the detention center the citys no 1 employer 
each month since the riot oakdale has lost 6000 in water 
sewer and sales tax revenue mowad said 
a few reminders of the uprising remain the once landscaped 
grounds and paths at the prison now have patches of bare earth 
glaring in the sun 
in some areas not yet scrubbed and repainted slogans remain 
such as muertos no cuba death not cuba

these days a visitor can drive directly through 
wideopen iron gates and park within 20 yards of the us 
penitentiarys front steps 
those are the same steps descended by 89 hostages when they 
poured out of the prison last dec 4 ending an 11day uprising by 
more than 1100 cuban inmates 
the penitentiary then was less a prison than a badly damaged 
fortress under siege the front steps patrolled constantly by 
armed federal officers led to a building only partly controlled by 
authorities the rest was in the hands of cuban detainees who 
rioted at word of a deportation agreement with fidel castro 
when it was all over the prison was emptied of all inmates for 
the first time since it opened in 1902 and officials began cleaning 
up the damage officials estimated the damage here and in oakdale 
la where cuban inmates staged a similar uprising at 64 million 
now 600 inmates all americans are housed at the prison 
compared with about 200 americans and 1400 cuban inmates at the 
time of the takeover in two years the number is to reach 800 to 
850 so far there are no plans to bring cuban detainees to 
atlanta said mike caltabiano executive assistant to warden joseph 
petrovsky 
the riot interrupted a 63 million fiveyear renovation 
project but many of the areas damaged were to be razed in the 
renovation anyway caltabiano said 
the only real loss he said was the burnedout prison 
industries building 
a temporary industries unit has been set up in a former 
gymnasium there inmates repairing mailbags and making mattresses 
and meteorological parachutes earned 500000 for the prison in 
april caltabiano said 
a 20foothigh chain link fence is being erected to cut the 
prison almost in half behind it most of the construction will go 
on the first phase of the renovation project is to be completed 
next year 
elsewhere vandalism in the dining hall and chapel has been 
repaired 
its been the positive attitude of the staff thats made it 
by putting this kind of thing behind them and saying ok were 
going to see how we can rebuild atlanta caltabiano said 
the prison is atlanta or usp us penitentiary atlanta 
to its employees it was known as the big a to decades of 
inmates including the famous and the infamous 
at the dawn of the 1920s the big a was home to socialist 
presidential candidate eugene v debs who was imprisoned for a 
speech condemning war in world war i it held al capone in the 
1930s soviet spy rudolph able in the 1950s and mafia informant joe 
valachi in the 1960s 
in the late 1970s there were 16 slayings at the prison many 
described as professional hits related to drug sales by 1978 
a report by the us bureau of prisons suggested closing the 
penitentiary because its old design and deteriorating structures 
made security impossible 
the prison was to have been closed by the fall of 1984 
but the number of cuban inmates detained during the mariel 
boatlift because of their records in cuba or imprisoned later for 
offenses in the united states mounted 
violence again was a problem the bureau of prisons reported the 
atlanta pen had less than 10 percent of all federal prisoners but 
almost 20 percent of all assaults on inmates or guards 
the cubans frequently protested prison conditions but more often 
complained that they were being detained at all the final uprising 
was triggered by word that deportations to cuba would resume

scott sutterfield spends his nights at the federal detention 
center in oakdale la trying to forget the nightmare he lived 
through last fall when he felt like a pawn in an eightday 
stalemate between rioting cuban inmates and federal officials 
sutterfield was one of 28 hostages taken nov 21 by cubans who 
rioted at oakdale after a state department announcement of a pact 
with cuba to return some of the detainees to their homeland 
twentysix of the hostages were held until the siege ended nov 
29 sutterfield was among them 
thats a feeling you never forget sutterfield said you 
just try to forget and get back to work 
dentist jack belchinsky chief medical officer of the federal 
penitentiary in atlanta was among 108 people taken hostage there 
two days after the oakdale uprising his freedom came 11 days later 
he said he decided to jump right back into work as his way of 
dealing with the ordeal but in a recent interview he lashed out 
at the state department for illadvised stupid remarks 
regarding the deal with cuba and for giving prison officials so 
little notice of the pact 
of the 108 guards and other prison workers taken hostage in 
atlanta 91 have returned to work with the bureau of prisons 
although not all of them in atlanta mike caltabiano executive 
assistant to the warden said 16 had yet to return to work and one 
had resigned 
authorities declined to say how many of the oakdale captives 
have returned to work 
after the riot sutterfield went to a temporary duty post at a 
federal prison in denver he is now back at oakdale supervising 
inmates on the graveyard shift 
although hes eager for reconstruction to be completed at the 
prison so it can start receiving inmates and he can get back to 
being a guard he says he still remembers fearing for his life 
during the riot 
every time the helicopters would come up the inmates would 
handcuff us to chairs and stand ready to kill us he recalled 
even today hearing a helicopter thats one thing that brings 
it back 
having to deal with dying so many times over you got to the 
point where you thought if its going to happen lets get it 
over with he said 
a lot of people still have a problem with it they still have 
nightmares 
lt douglas howington who as captain of the guard at the time 
of the atlanta riot was the highestranking hostage said he was 
more frightened after the episode after hearing that there were 
socalled death squads out to get him that even bothers me 
now 
in that 1600 cuban group there were 300 or 400 
incorrigibles no doubt about that belchinsky said but thank 
goodness the other 1200s opinion kind of pervaded and kept those 
guys down 
sutterfield 22 said counseling with others whod been held 
hostage had helped him 
i dont have any bad feelings towards the cubans 
sutterfield said i sympathize with their cause but the way they 
went about achieving their goals i hold against them 
its hard to say whether i could work with cuban inmates 
again id have to give it a try 
us bureau of prison officials say they have not decided what 
the mission of the oakdale center will be after renovation is 
finished 
belchinsky and others held hostage in atlanta say government 
officials must stand by pledges made or implied to the cubans 
hopefully theyll come through with them he said because 
there are other cubans in the system and if they see that uncle sam 
doesnt keep his word it could be maybe a problem for other staff 
in other institutions saying hey they lied to us the first time 
if we get control again we might kill people

the letters pour in 30 to 50 a day from federal 
prisons in colorado michigan kansas virginia 
some of the letters to roman catholic bishop agustin roman begin 
with a cheery hello agustin but they quickly turn into 
desperate pleas for help 
six months after he helped end riots by cubans detained at 
federal facilities in oakdale la and atlanta roman cannot 
understand why hundreds of them even those with jobs and families 
waiting outside sit in federal prisons throughout the country 
fearful they will be deported to their communistgoverned island 
i dont think the government has broken the agreement they 
signed roman said in a recent interview but they have not 
kept the spirit of the agreement 
the softspoken 60yearold roman who was expelled from cuba 
after fidel castros takeover and became the highestranking 
cubanborn priest in the miami archdiocese was the key guarantor 
of the pact that helped end the fiery uprisings in atlanta and 
oakdale 
roman already wellknown in miamis cuban community was called 
to the oakdale negotiations by prison rioters when he arrived he 
told the inmates may of whom wept at the sight of him to lay down 
their arms they obeyed 
inmates in atlanta and their supporters in miami then demanded 
roman negotiate at the penitentiary as well but nervous government 
officials said they were reluctant to bring him in fearing that if 
he failed the riot would turn uglier 
instead they negotiated an agreement with the inmates by 
promising to have roman monitor the agreement roman attended the 
signing ceremony that ended the siege 
the agreement promised that prisoners would have their cases 
reviewed in exchange for releasing their hostages the inmates were 
dispersed and the prisons closed 
roman helped set up a task force to monitor the pact he meets 
each monday with its members for the latest news for the most 
part it hasnt been good 
roman points to the file of a prisoner officially given his 
release in november but still waiting inside a federal prison 
these are people who have completed their sentences sometimes 
as much as three years ago he said they have families they 
have jobs waiting but still they are not free 
he shows a computer printout containing more than 1000 names of 
prisoners he says could be released immediately yet are hung up in 
red tape 
the riots followed news of an agreement between the united 
states and cuba for the deportation of excludable immigrants 
what started all this is the terror of deportation roman 
said terror of deportation to a country that we know does not 
respect human rights and that terror continues 
he and members of his committee feel the promises made during 
the uprising are fading even though cubans are gradually being 
released under a review program roman says his committee doesnt 
understand why some people without families are being released to 
the streets while those with families are not 
the situation is especially frustrating to families who must 
painstakingly look for jobs for their loved ones before the inmates 
can be released sometimes the jobs are gone before the government 
has acted 
those who do get out are a good bet to stay out the bishop 
says he runs a special 15week counseling session for released 
prisoners and their families they recently had a mass meeting of 
members of the program and roman says every exprisoner had a job 
despite the publicity that dogged him during the riots roman 
said his life remains the same 
for a clergyman for a bishop when one problem ends another 
one begins he said we know clearly that we are on a trail of 
troubles our whole life a very narrow trail

linda serrano is philosophical when she talks 
about the bureaucracy of the us immigration and naturalization 
service but theres an underlying current of anger in her voice 
ive tried and tried to find out why they wont let manuel 
come home but so far nobody has explained it in a way that makes 
sense she said in an interview 
her commonlaw husband 46yearold manuel casalis noy an 
inmate at the federal prison in lompoc calif is one of some 
1100 cubans in federal detention who have been approved for parole 
but are still awaiting release 
jorge figueiras has been paroled but his wife reyna ordonez 
still fears he might be deported because of the damage done by the 
cubans during the uprisings last fall at prisons in atlanta and 
oakdale la 
the united states is not going to let this go by said 
ordonez some way i think theyll make them pay 
casalis noy arrived in this country in the 1980 mariel boatlift 
and later served eight months in a california prison for possession 
of cocaine when his time was up however the ins sent him to the 
federal penitentiary in atlanta where some 1400 other cubans with 
criminal records waited to learn what lay in store for them 
manuel was brought to atlanta in december 1985 and we came 
here from california three months later said serrano who lives 
with her two children from a previous relationship and works as a 
nannyhousekeeper for an atlanta family 
while trying to get paroled she said her husband worked in 
prison industries and kept out of trouble 
he was sending us money up to 100 a month there for a 
while she said and we could see him every week then last 
november he finally was approved for parole everything looked 
great i even had a job lined up for him 
then came the riots the cubans detained in atlanta and oakdale 
were moved to prisons throughout the country 
that messed everything up serrano said but when i 
finally tracked manuel down in late december i was told he was 
going to have to go to a halfway house somewhere 
serrano said she began trying to get her man sent home instead 
after numerous deadends she said she reached a bureau of prisons 
official working with the ins in washington dc 
she told me manuel couldnt come home because he was on the 
list to go a halfway house serrano said but i told her i had 
made a good home here and that i know a lot of detainees are being 
sent home and they did crimes a lot worse than manuel did besides 
theres a long wait to get into the halfway houses 
in the six months since the riots the ins has sent hundreds of 
detainees home some like mario ochoa were paroled within a few 
weeks of their interviews by a twoperson ins panel 
ochoa who served 26 months for possession of a dangerous weapon 
with intent to use it said he was released and sent home to 
brooklyn ny just three weeks after his interview 
he credited his quick release to his wifes contacts with 
congressmen and reporters 
he said he was puzzled that some cubans convicted of lesser 
crimes remain behind bars ins officials refuse to discuss the 
cases of individual detainees with reporters 
figueiras was transferred to a federal facility in kansas city 
kan after the riot he has since been released to a halfway house 
and now has his own apartment in a kansas city suburb his wife 
says 
figueiras must serve his eightmonth parole in the area ordonez 
has sent two of her children to be with him and says she will make 
the trip with her remaining two children when she saves enough 
money 
its good news that hes out but right now were going 
through hard times she said 
ordonez is the only one who remains of a small group of cuban 
women who had moved to oakdale to be near their husbands and 
relatives inside the prison 
the people here in oakdale they still dont like us she 
said my older kids they were always crying we want to leave 
here 
for me im still afraid she said the small children 
play together but i stay inside by myself 
if i had the money in my hand id be gone right now

washington was talking last week about two 
things what donald regan said and whether he should have said it 
beyond the spate of jokes produced by his revelations about mrs 
reagans fascination with astrology and the presidents passive 
management style there arose a debate over the ethics of 
kissandtell books 
if you want to contribute to history it wont hurt to wait 
until the administration is over said sheila tate mrs reagans 
former spokeswoman 
but george e reedy former press secretary to president lyndon 
b johnson said administration figures should be able to tell 
their stories whenever they wish 
speech in this country is free says reedy who teaches 
journalism ethics at marquette university unless those people 
had agreed that they would not do anything like this i cant see 
it as being unethical 
regans book for the record from wall street to 
washington is a biting account that some feel weakens an already 
lameduck presidency he portrays a choeographed president 
manipulated by aides and by a wife who depends on an astrologist 
for guidance in fixing the presidents schedule 
president reagan has denounced the book as a bunch of 
falsehoods and a breach of confidence but not given a 
detailed rebuttal 
being kissed by the heady power of the white house and then 
publicly telling the story especially when the president still 
sits in the oval office is to some dishonorable to others a 
valuable contribution to history 
the presidents former chief of staff ousted from the white 
house last year in a move widely believed engineered by mrs 
reagan says he never considered delaying his tale 
i didnt set the time of my leaving this administration and i 
dont know why i should hold up many people have left this 
administration and told their stories why not my book he said 
in an interview 
his is one of several negative accounts by former reagan 
officials 
former white house spokesman larry speakes offered damaging 
characterizations of former colleagues in his book speaking 
out he says he may have overstepped the bounds of propriety in 
some instances but addes i apologize not for the truth in my 
book nor the telling of it 
david stockman reagans former budget director caused a furor 
two years ago with the triumph of politics why the reagan 
revolution failed which lays out errors in judgment and 
miscalculations stockman says were responsible for adding 1 
trillion to the national debt 
i wrote the book because i have an ax to grind he said 
then and to correct a gigantic mishap of governance 
ironically one of those who warned stockman against being too 
candid was regan then treasury secretary 
just why the reaganera books have been so angry and revealing 
is a provocative question 
reedy says he has never encountered books as violent as 
those spawned by the reagan presidency and adds there is 
obviously something in that white house that is filling people with 
a sense of rage 
mrs tate the first ladys former spokeswoman dismisses that 
theory 
this is not a problem peculiar to the reagan administration 
she says theres big money being offered and staff have become 
more powerful its the cult of the personality a lot of people 
who worked in the white house in the 50s were nameless and 
faceless in the 80s they have highprofile jobs that bring a lot 
of personal attention to them 
james david barber a duke university political science 
professor who studies presidential character notes that the reagan 
books have a remarkable consistency in the picture they convey of 
this white house 
where is the book that overwhelmingly corrects these 
supposedly false and unjust smear jobs that straightens it all 
out that shows that the president was really in charge he asks 
he believes such books help citizens learn how policymakers do 
their jobs and whether their values are right 
that thought is echoed by historian arthur schlesinger jr who 
says these memoirs are a venerable genre in american political 
literature that should not be withheld 
how else can history be written if those who make it take vows 
of silence he said 
samuel kernell a political science professor at the university 
of california at san diego who is studying the white house staff 
says the proliferation of such books reflects the growth of the 
white house and the centralization of power in unknown people 
making vital decisions 
he notes that the white house staff has grown from about 40 
people in 1939 to nearly 500 today those people have tremendous 
influence on american policy so were naturally curious about 
them thats why they get on the cover of time magazine and why 
their books are marketable 
on the other hand telling how an administration operates while 
it is still operating can put a damper on administration programs 
the proposition that there even are going to be kissandtell 
books does erode the sense of collegiality within government 
says stephen hess a brookings institution scholar who served on 
the eisenhower and nixon staffs and has studied the presidency and 
the press 
if you sit there at a table and you know that everybody is 
going to run back and write in their diary it will affect what you 
can say and how you say it hess says it becomes simply an 
ethical consideration based on each persons moral code whether 
theyre going to tell tales out of school it tells you something 
about those people 
some have suggested presidents ask incoming aides to sign a 
promise not to write until later 
what ever happened to the first amendment regan says in 
response dont we have as much right to write i could see if 
that applied to state secrets but i dont describe how to make an 
atomic bomb 
jody powell president carters press secretary who wrote a book 
targeting the washington press corps says he promised his 
administration colleagues they werent ever going to have to see 
their topofthehead statements and analyses tossed back at them 
years later in one of his books 
powell says the promise was his idea and was not put into any 
formal agreement many feel such agreements probably unforceable 
in any case would only underscore an atmosphere of distrust 
there may always be people who put loyalty to the president 
behind the prospect of financial gain celebrity status or avenging 
some real or imagined slight 
presidents get what they deserve they either generate a sense 
of loyalty among the members of their staff or they dont says 
reedy 
regan bristles at the notion that he has been disloyal and 
recalls how he was hounded out of my office loyalty he says 
is a twoway proposition 
in the end says regan i could either write this book and 
tell the whole truth or not write the book at all i chose to write 
the book

eric roberts says he first saw the vietnam 
veterans memorial at daybreak as he recreated the story of how the 
wall became a reality in the nbc movie to heal a nation 
id never seen it before and i got there just as the sun came 
up said roberts i was the first person that day to walk its 
length halfway i saw my reflection i narrowed my focus to just 
one name 
the wall became very dear to me it has the names of 
50000plus boys who died serving our country for better or worse 
i was devastated and very proud to portray the man responsible for 
the fact that it was standing there 
roberts plays jan scruggs the former army infantryman who led 
the effort to build a memorial to his fellow veterans in hopes of 
healing the nations wounds working with scruggs were robert 
doubek and john wheeler 
the memorial 493 feet of black granite set into the ground in a 
giant v polished to a mirrorlike finish and inscribed with 58156 
names was designed by maya ying lin a new york architect who was 
a 21yearold yale architectural student when her dramatic vision 
was selected from among 1421 entries it attracts up to 20000 
visitors a day making it the mostvisited memorial in washington 
dc 
the twohour movie a special ge theater presentation based on a 
book by scruggs and joel l swerdlow will be televised sunday it 
also stars glynnis oconnor marshall colt scott paulin lee 
purcell laurence luckinbill linden chiles brock peters and 
gloria carlin lionel chetwynd wrote the screenplay and michael 
pressman directed 
roberts said when he started the film he looked into scruggs 
military record and talked to people who knew him 
i held off meeting him until i was halfway through the 
picture he said he is an incredibly decent man my belief is 
he pursued the vietnam memorial for all the right reasons i admire 
him and im proud to portray him 
he had no illusions of grandeur one of my favorite lines from 
the film is this is not a monument its a memorial its not a 
memorial to the war in vietnam its a memorial to the 50000 young 
men who died there 
roberts said he sees scruggs who is now attending law school 
as a living definition of the american dream come true 
he wanted to get something done and he pursued it it got done 
and it will live forever its wonderful for everyone in this 
country to pursue his own vision its worth it i think 
this is a rare television appearance for roberts who was 
nominated for an oscar for his role in runaway train he was 
also in such movies as star 80 the pope of greenwich 
village raggedy man nobodys fool and the upcoming 
blood red he made his tv debut in the soap opera another 
world and has been in several pbs dramas 
i dont go by the media he said what attracts me is the 
script i liked this and i came running limiting myself to one 
medium is like limiting myself to redheads i took this part 
because of the script because of my friendship with three vietnam

bond prices showed resilience in the face of a 
stormy week when fears of higher interest rates swept through 
financial markets like a hurricane 
and the bond market which also had to contend with three major 
treasury auctions this past week is bracing itself for more 
turbulence ahead interest rates which move inversely to bond 
prices are widely expected to continue climbing 
in the short run we still think rates are headed higher 
said mitchell held chief financial economist for smith barney 
harris upham amp co 
anxiety about inflation which erodes the value of fixedincome 
investments like bonds had been building for some time it was 
heightened by a may 6 government report on the nations 
unemployment in april which registered a 14year low and was 
viewed as showing underlying strength in the economy 
in the aftermath of that report the federal reserve nudged 
shortterm interest rates higher and on wednesday major us 
banks raised their prime lending rates by half a percentage point 
to 9 percent 
the hike in the prime rate the first since octobers stock 
market collapse proved anticlimactic though since it had 
already been foreshadowed by a rise in bondmarket rates spurred by 
the feds tightening 
the prime rate increase really was old history said maria 
ramirez a managing director of drexel burnham lambert inc 
a far more exciting event for the bond market was the treasurys 
series of three quarterly refunding auctions the sales of 26 
billion in treasuries on tuesday wednesday and thursday aimed at 
helping the government finance the 25 trillion national debt 
were fairly well received by investors 
there had been concern recently that the growing inflationary 
fears by keeping bond prices depressed could jeopardize the 
auctions the bond market had been worried that investors 
especially the japanese could shy away from the treasury sales if 
they detected a trend toward higher interest rates 
as it turned out foreign investors did jump in to the auctions 
they accounted for about 40 percent of the bond purchases over the 
three days ms ramirez estimated 
the bond market rode out the interestrate tempest and the 
auctions fairly calmly some market analysts suggested the credit 
markets may have been cushioned by a flight to safety on 
wednesday as skittish investors pulled their funds out of the 
tumbling stock market and plowed them into bonds the anxiety over 
interest rates and the hike in the prime sent the dow jones average 
of 30 industrials down 3780 points that day to 196585 a 
threemonth low 
many observers expect the rate on the key 30year bond to rise 
to around 950 percent by the end of june as inflationary 
pressures continue to mount 
fridays labor department report on wholesale prices in april 
showing only a moderate rise of 04 percent was encouraging news 
for bond traders at the end of an unnerving week but the market is 
looking forward with trepidation to a string of economic statistics 
for april due to be published this coming week industrial 
production on monday factory capacity in use on tuesday housing 
starts on wednesday and consumer prices and real earnings on 
friday 
the nations trade deficit for march is also scheduled to be 
reported on tuesday the trade figures have been a powerful 
influence on the bond market in recent months as disappointing 
trade performances have pushed the dollar lower and weakened bond 
prices in turn 
if the reports provide further evidence of economic strength 
the inflation fears could accelerate

lawrence weiss was about to book an order for 
100 shares of chrysler corp and 100 shares of black amp decker corp 
this past wednesday when his customer happened to ask how the 
market was doing 
weiss mentioned that the dow jones average of 30 industrials was 
off 35 points and the customer promptly canceled his order 
that is the kind of experience that drives brokers crazy retail 
business in stocks is off 30 percent or more on wall street because 
the october crash and the subsequent gyrations have shaken the 
confidence of individual investors 
theyre frightened said weiss president of odd lot 
securities ltd who said his own discount brokerages business is 
off 50 percent 
to many americans wall street is just another roll of the dice 
especially in light of the 508point drop in the dow jones 
industrials on oct 19 that came across in a sampling of opinion 
around the country this past week 
i think it depends on your personality more than anything 
else some people like to gamble said thomas h egan traffic 
and purchasing manager for general latex amp chemical corp in 
cambridge mass 
its a little bit like the race track influence controls 
it as much as anything said marshall webb who manages the tool 
and die shop at lacy tool co in novi mich 
i favor other investments that are more dependent on my own 
ability to judge investment potential like real estate said 
gary studdard general manager of john b lagarde a concrete 
company in anniston ala 
small investors accounted for only 23 percent of shares traded 
on the new york stock exchange in january and february down from 
29 percent just before the crash according to the securities 
industry association 
many investors are turning to safer havens such as certificates 
of deposit and treasury bonds whose value is up sharply since the 
crash in spite of some recent weakness 
people are starting to invest based on their nocturnal habits 
will this investment keep me staring at the ceiling at night 
said philip waxelbaum national sales manager for prudentialbache 
securities inc 
computerized program trading has emerged as a villain in the 
publics mind and even brokerage firms that say program trading is 
not to blame for upsetting the markets are curbing the practice 
anyway 
this past week five major brokerage houses said they would stop 
conducting a form of program trading known as index arbitrage for 
their own accounts they were bear stearns amp co morgan stanley amp 
co salomon brothers inc painewebber inc and kidder peabody inc 
merrill lynch amp co among others had curbed the practice 
earlier to the relief of many of its brokers 
im frankly thankful it took me off the hook with clients 
said gene foster a broker in the rochester ny office of 
merrill lynch 
scott bowles a 78yearold retiree from procter amp gamble co 
who lives in wyoming ohio said he is keeping half his net worth 
in stocks even though like everybody i got whacked on meltdown 
monday 
but he said his confidence is being sapped by inexplicable moves 
in the market the standard perceptions of value are way the hell 
off its unnerving 
alice tarailo a secretary in watsonville calif said she was 
ready to buy stock in hampr block inc in january but was worried the 
market had not stabilized she is glad she held off after a brief 
runup the stock is off about 4 from its january level 
i think the stock market boom is over she said 
to some americans trouble in the stock market is part of a 
broader crisis 
i have seen the time when i felt safe anywhere i was said 
webb the michigan tool and die man who is a 60yearold 
exmarine its not that way anymore whether youre talking 
money or safety of anything 
but there are still optimists in places such as spanish fork 
utah vaughn erickson said program trading and the possibility of a 
bear market do not greatly concern him because he has more than 20 
years before retirement and is holding for the long term 
theres a lot of room for growth in the united states and the 
stock market is the best place to take advantage of it said 
erickson vice president for finance at natures sunshine products 
inc

if you apply an old wall street principle known 
as contrary opinion the outlook for the stock market would seem to 
be pretty healthy 
hardly anybody these days is able to work up much enthusiasm 
either for stocks or for the business outlook over the next year or 
two 
and from long experience students of the investment scene will 
testify whenever a large majority of people agree on what the 
financial markets are likely to do they are probably wrong 
the extent of the pessimism now holding sway among investment 
managers analysts and economists shows up in the results of the 
latest poll of more than 300 decision makers conducted by 
richard hoey at drexel burnham lambert inc 
for the stock market hoey reports the bears outnumbered the 
bulls by 2to1 on bonds the ratio was an even more lopsided 
3to1 in favor of the pessimists 
anecdotal evidence abounds to support that heavy negative bias 
the talk on wall street these days is that interest rates have 
nowhere to go but up 
and the slow and halting recovery in stock prices since the 
crash last year is just about universally labeled a bear market 
rally that will soon run its course 
the most comforting thing about todays experience is that 
many analysts believe the stock market rally cannot be sustained 
observed vincent agnew at ctt investment management group a firm 
that manages more than 25 billion 
the reason this is comforting is because whenever the crowd is 
anticipating one set of events the market has been known to 
perversely confound everyone by doing exactly the opposite 
as simple as contrary opinion sounds though it can be very 
difficult to practice for one thing in trying to determine what 
the real consensus is in order to go against it you sometimes have 
to try to separate what people say from what they really feel 
lately for example some standard statistical measures of 
investor sentiment suggest stocks have not been beaten down to 
bargainbasement extremes like those seen on some past occasions 
priceearnings ratios of several leading market indicators 
lately have hovered between 14to1 and 15to1 the multiple is 
down from better than 20 last year but still nowhere near the 
singledigit levels it reached at times in the 1970s and early 
1980s 
the market did not do much for optimistic contrarians in the 
past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
199055 down 1691 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 58 to 14530 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 694 to 
37248 and the american stock exchange market value index 387 to 
29794 
volume on the big board averaged 15307 million shares a day 
against 15113 million the week before 
the markets weakest moments in the past week did not exactly 
occur in a vacuum major banks raised their prime lending rates 
from 85 percent to 9 percent 
whats more a good many traders might have been reluctant to 
bid aggressively for stocks before the governments monthly report 
on international trade scheduled to be released this tuesday 
so we go on to the next number the dreaded trade statistic 
observed michael sherman at shearson lehman hutton in his latest 
market commentary 
is this the way we were supposed to invest hanging from week 
to week on every flick of data cant we find some more stable 
criteria on which to judge the direction of the markets 
we think that if you step back a little bit you can to our 
mind the market today is dominated by fear and that fear will 
ultimately prove overdrawn upon such realization will come an 
improvement in stock and bond prices

oil futures prices settled slightly higher to 
end the week with another slow trading day 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for june delivery 
of west texas intermediate the benchmark us grade of crude oil 
closed friday at 1749 per 42gallon barrel up 1 cent from 
thursdays close 
among refined products for june delivery contracts for 
wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 42 cent higher at 5234 cents 
per gallon while wholesale heating oil rose 24 cent to 4747 
cents per gallon 
john azarow an analyst at the shearson lehman hutton inc 
securities firm said the session amounted to a total nonevent 
volume was down he said mainly because of a lack of any 
news able to move prices one way or the other 
also restricting volume azarow said was a reluctance by some 
traders to trade too heavily before the upcoming meeting of oil 
ministers from the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
beginning june 8 in vienna austria 
at the meeting the opec ministers are expected to try to find a 
way to restrict production in order to drive prices higher

a moderate rise in wholesale prices during april despite a big 
jump in energy prices has prompted economists to conclude that 
inflation worries may have been overstated 
the producer price index rose a moderate 04 percent in april 
down from a 06 percent advance in march the labor department said 
friday 
analysts noted that if the volatile energy and food sectors were 
removed the april price advance was a minuscule 01 percent 
it is hard to make a real scare story that inflation is taking 
off based on these kinds of numbers said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc 
for the first four months of the year wholesale prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 29 percent not much changed from the 
22 percent increase for all of 1987 
the report sparked a rally in the bond markets as investors 
concluded there will be no additional pressure on the federal 
reserve to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand 
prices of longterm government bonds rose as much as 5 for each 
1000 in face value to yield 917 percent on thursday the 
bellwether 30year issues yield jumped to its highest point this 
year at 922 percent 
other economists however insisted that the april price report 
contained some troubling signs that price increases will be 
accelerating in the months ahead 
it would be a mistake to look at this report and say 
inflationary pressures have abated said michael evans head of a 
washington forecasting firm i dont think this relief is going 
to last 
energy prices which had posted sharp declines from september 
through february accounted for half of the increase in the overall 
index in april rising 31 percent 
gasoline costs advanced 07 percent while home heating oil shot 
up 52 percent natural gas which had declined in price in five of 
the last six months rose 43 percent 
food costs rose 04 percent in april as a sharp 163 percent 
drop in the price of eggs and smaller declines in the price of 
fruit fish and beef offset price increases for pork chicken 
vegetables and coffee 
the financial markets took the economic news in stride on wall 
street the dow jones industrial average climbed 2255 points to 
close at 199055 
brokers noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in the 
producer price index and instead drew inspiration from falling 
interest rates and a steady dollar 
in another economic report friday the government said total 
business sales surged 19 percent in march the biggest advance in 
more than a year while business inventories were up a modest 03 
percent 
analysts said the combination of rising sales and small declines 
in inventories should translate into continued strong industrial 
production in the months ahead
