a 10man team of british and american 
explorers has begun a search for the lost city of ubar which is 
believed to have been swallowed by shifting arabian sands 2000 
years ago 
the team headed by sir ranulph fiennes arrived sunday and will 
explore the southern reaches of the vast rub alkhali or empty 
quarter desert 
ubar is described in the koran islams holy book as a 
manycolumned city whose like has never been built in the whole 
land 
the city is also mentioned in the arabian nights as famous 
for its lavish royal court lush palm groves and fine camels and 
horses 
other references in ancient texts place it close to the 
frankincense groves of southern arabia and describe it as a great 
caravan trade center 
it is believed to have disappeared during a severe sandstorm in 
30 bc 
the sixday reconnaissance for the ancient city was to begin 
today 
fiennes said he first reconnoitered the desert 22 years ago when 
he was a british army captain attached to the omani army 
researchers have pinpointed eight likely locations for the lost 
city these are based on space technology data supplied by nasa as 
well as on medieval arabic texts and travelers tales from the 
early 20th century 
remote sensing by sandpenetrating radar aboard the us space 
shuttle challenger in 1984 indicated the existence of a buried 
roadway stretching for 60 miles in the desert north of omans 
westernmost dhofar province 
geologists at the us jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
calif also observed features they believe may be caused by a 
buried site 
guided by light aircraft fiennes exploration team will use 
desert vehicles to traverse the rub alkhali dunes which rise more 
than 600 feet 
the ruler of oman sultan qaboos has ordered his deserttrained 
police to assist and if the lost city is located it will be 
excavated under the auspices of omans antiquities department

apparently all fatlip the capybara could take 
on a dark and stormy friday night the 130pound amazon rodent 
slipped back inside the fence around palm beach countys dreher 
park zoo using the very hole from which she fled 
its not surprising general curator sally lieb said 
saturday capybaras at the zoo are secure and wellfed 
fatlip who resembles an overgrown guinea pig got the nickname 
from an accident that gave it a swollen lip 
the animal escaped may 10 getting out of the capybara pen by 
swimming under a fence in a canal bodering the enclosure then 
finding a hole left by vandals in the parks north fence 
she was spotted many times while roaming free but zoo officials 
soon stopped trying to capture her saying a capybaras watery 
lifestyle made it difficult 
park officials didnt mend the outside fence in hopes fatlip 
would return and footprints indicate shed been casing the zoo for 
a month 
and although fatlip is back in the zoo shes still not back in 
her pen 
its real hard to sneak up on her ms lieb said

thousands of weary but jubilant 
albanian refugees savored freedom saturday and set about their new 
lives 
albanians who had sought refugee at the west german embassy in 
the albanian capital tirana were sent to 14 destinations across 
west germany about 125 arrived in heidelberg a city of 130000 
about 60 miles south of frankfurt on the neckar river 
the refugees mostly young men and a few women and children 
looked happy but exhausted after the 26hour trip they waved their 
hands in victory 
we are leaving our country because we dont want the 
communists said enkeo halili a 24yearold mechanic as he 
stepped from the train we are young we are poor weve never 
even seen a discotheque 
those sentiments were echoed by albanians who arrived early 
sunday in turkey aboard a turkish airlines dc9 sent to albania by 
the turkish government 
we want to live in a free society we want to have our 
political and legal rights said arben shanja 28 a physics 
teacher from shkoder who fled albania with his wife and 2weekold 
daughter 
they were among a group of 76 albanians who arrived at ankaras 
esenboga airport carrying a few belongings in plastic bags the 
refugees looked tired but waved and made victory signs as they 
waited to go through passport control 
about 4500 albanians were evacuated in a boatlift across the 
adriatic sea to brindisi italy on friday three trains picked up 
the 3000 albanians who had sought refuge in the west german 
embassy in basel switzerland they were sent on smaller trains to 
14 different west german cities 
it was still unclear how many wanted to stay in west germany and 
how many wished eventually to go to third countries many have said 
they hope to go to the united states 
other refugees brought from albania in the boatlift chose to 
remain in italy and 544 were shipped on to marseille france 
the frenchchartered yugoslav ferry orient star had been 
scheduled to dock saturday but it was delayed until sunday because 
a 21yearold pregnant woman had to be evacuated from the ship to 
an italian hospital her condition was not immediately known 
also saturday an albanian couple was married on board 
afterward other refugees joined together to sing an albanian 
wedding song 
saturday was bastille day frances national holiday it was 
marked aboard the orient star by a member of the french delegation 
which told the albanians of its meaning and explained the 
independence they would have in their new country 
also saturday the 56 albanians sheltered in the polish embassy 
in tirana were flown to warsaw another 39 who sought refuge in the 
hungarian embassy were flown to budapest and on the same plane were 
five who took refuge at the bulgarian embassy they traveled on to 
the bulgarian capital of sofia 
a turkish airlines plane on saturday was to pick up the 57 
refugees at the turkish embassy in tirana the anatolia news agency 
reported in ankara 
there was no way to live said avni azizi a 23yearold 
albanian tailor of his communist homeland we all think that at 
the most in one year the whole albanian people will be free 
the refugees began crowding into foreign embassies in tirana two 
weeks ago seeking to flee albania which has resisted the kinds of 
sweeping democratic reforms that have radically altered other east 
european countries 
the albanian government has introduced only limited reforms 
including some religious freedom and travel abroad which albanians 
were not permitted for 45 years 
one 29yearold refugee who asked that only his first name be 
used said westerners could not understand what life was like in 
albania europes last hardline stalinist state 
to understand this regime you have to live there they want to 
systematically destroy spiritual life turn us into robots 
gijon said 
he said albanians began rushing foreign embassies after they 
learned a family that had lived for years in the italian embassy 
had been allowed to leave the country 
news of the familys may 16 release was broadcast on italian 
television which many albanians receive he said 
many other refugees also referred to the popa family which 
sought refuge in the italian embassy in december 1985 
in heidelberg the refugees were given food and clothing most 
were taken to a former clinic that until recently housed east 
german refugees 
but the german red cross said 10 of the 125 were sick and would 
be taken to hospitals carl bauer a red cross spokesman in bonn 
said they were suffering from fever diarrhea and weakness

changes in how the government reports on the 
health of the savings and loan industry amount to spin control 
designed to minimize the frequency with which bad news is delivered 
to the public economists say 
office of thrift supervision officials say they plan to begin 
reporting financial data only for solvent privately owned savings 
institutions information on failed but stilloperating thrifts 
controlled by the government will be reported later by a separate 
agency the resolution trust corp 
also statistics on deposits and withdrawals at thrift 
institutions which previously had been released monthly will be 
put out quarterly they will be released at the same time as 
information on sampl profits and losses which has always come out 
quarterly 
economists complain that the changes will make it more difficult 
for financial analysts journalists and the public to interpret the 
condition of the industry as a whole in a timely manner 
theyre making it more difficult for the markets to get and 
disseminate vital information said economist martin regalia of 
the national council of savings institutions that doesnt make 
sense 
data is best when its reported as fully as possible as 
accurately as possible and as timely as possible regalia said 
last week what theyre doing here is making information less 
timely and i think theres no excuse for that 
even though the thrift office collects financial information 
from both solvent and insolvent sampls it will relay the information 
on the failed thrifts to the resolution trust corp which manages 
those institutions until it can sell or close them 
financial analysts said it is valid for some purposes to look at 
solvent and governmentcontrolled sampls separately however they 
point out that the governmentcontrolled thrifts remain open and 
compete against the rest of the industry to attract deposits 
looking at them together is important because they are all 
doing the same thing they are both making mortgages and taking 
deposits said robert litan of the brookings institution a 
washington think tank 
by just reporting data on the healthy part of the industry 
regulators can report a number that says the thrift industry is 
earning money when it isnt its spin control he said 
thrift office director timothy ryan defended the reporting 
changes 
its more appropriate for the rtc to put out information on 
conservatorship institutions because they are the conservator 
ryan said 
thrift office officials also said the switch to quarterly 
reporting of deposit flows will save money and reduce errors 
some of the monthly numbers are subject to so many 
restatements that theyre just not reliable and its better to 
put them out quarterly ryan said 
although the reports will be issued less frequently the 
information will still be available monthly to those who ask he 
said 
but bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria 
va said theyre trying to be the good news boys theyre 
treating the insolvent thrifts as if they had leprosy and pushing 
them out of sight 
although regulators did not list worry over deposit runs as a 
reason for the new reporting procedures litan said he suspects 
that is a factor 
maybe theres an implicit hope that if they dont remind 
people constantly people wont take their money out of thrifts 
he said they prefer to have as little bad news as they can 
manage 
the policy shift follows a long lapse in reporting by the thrift 
office at this point in past years the agency normally would have 
issued monthly deposit flow reports current through may and it 
would have issued a profit or loss statement for the januarymarch 
quarter 
however no information for 1990 has been released although the 
agency plans to issue deposit information for january and february 
later this week 
thrift office officials said the delay occurred because many 
sampls were confused by new reporting forms which were changed to 
conform with new capital regulations passed as part of last years 
sampl bailout law 
snafus with a new computer program for analyzing the data also 
contributed to the delay they said

sixtyfour percent of major us companies are 
not happy with the reading writing and reasoning abilities of high 
school graduates entering the work force a poll of business 
executives said 
the national alliance of business survey found that 72 percent 
of executives polled also thought new employees math skills had 
worsened in the last five years sixtyfive percent said reading 
skills decreased over the same period 
alliance president william kolberg said the poll results should 
worry everyone parents students educators and employers 
we are on a collision course with the reality that america is 
developing a secondclass work force whose best feature in the 
future compared with other nations will be low pay kolberg said 
last week in an interview to discuss the survey results low 
skill means low pay 
kolberg said new attitudes and approaches were needed to prepare 
americans for work who do not attend college 
we have abandoned the millions of kids who dont plan to 
attend college he said somewhere along the way we lost 
respect for the skills we now so desperately need in our factories 
and on the front lines of our service industries 
kolberg said about 82 million us jobs dont require a college 
degree and filling those jobs may become impossible unless the 
educational system is changed 
the entire school enterprise needs to be restructured 
rethought and taken much more seriously he said pointing to the 
national education goals established by president bush and the 
nations governors 
kolberg was an assistant secretary of labor and administrator of 
the employment and training administration from 197377 
the poll described by the alliance as the first to survey 
officers either directly or indirectly responsible for the 
recruitment of workers at the 1200 largest us corporations said 
only 36 percent of the officers were satisfied with the competency 
of new employees entering the work force 
kolberg defined competency as being able to read beyond the 
seventh grade level and compute math at higher than a fifth grade 
level 
the survey indicated companies many of which have more 
challenging blue collar and secretarial work than in the past 
have to interview seven to eight applicants on average to find just 
one acceptable employee 
personnel officers also said many of those who are hired require 
too much training to become effective in their jobs fortyeight 
percent were satisfied with the ability of new hires to be 
retrained only 16 percent were satisfied with the educational 
training of new employees 
kolberg said the survey documents much of the anecdotal evidence 
discussed over the last few years 
most american companies particularly smaller companies have 
not been able to adopt new forms of work organization because they 
cant afford to spend money upgrading worker skills kolberg 
said our competitors in europe and asia have increased 
productivity by using these new methods of work our only response 
to this competitive situation has been to lower wages 
the business alliance predicts that by the year 2000 an 
estimated 5 million to 15 million manufacturing jobs will require 
skills other than those being used today and that an equal number 
of service jobs will be obsolete 
kolberg said parents must make sure their children attend school 
and are prepared physically and emotionally to learn parents and 
teachers must raise their expectations of student achievement 
the weekly wages of high school graduates dropped from 38724 
in 1969 to 33520 in 1989 the alliance attributes the 12 percent 
drop to a loss in productivity by socalled frontline workers it 
compares with a wage gain of about 8 percent for a college graduate 
the research was conducted in late april by north coast 
behavioral research group of cleveland involving 500 of the 
largest manufacturing firms in america the largest 500 service 
firms and the largest 200 privately owned companies the poll had a 
margin of error of 6 percentage points 
the nab was founded in 1968 under the direction of president 
lyndon johnson and henry ford ii to link businesses in a 
partnership with education labor government and communitybased 
groups to help build a quality work force for the future

the third world can reduce the number of its 
poor to 800 million from todays 11 billion if the right policies 
are followed over the next decade according to world bank 
president barber conable 
about one person in four among third world countries can be 
considered poor but the ranks of the poor could be cut by nearly a 
third by means of strict economic and social reforms conable said 
developed nations also should increase aid to their poorer 
neighbors he added 
strategy to reduce poverty should be one of the international 
communitys fundamental objectives in the 1990s he told 
reporters in advance of the release sunday of the banks annual 
world development report 
the 1990 issue is devoted to the problem of easing poverty 
which conable said is the banks main purpose owned by 151 
countries the bank is the biggest source of aid to the third 
world lending more than 20 billion a year 
the world bank says anyone is poor if he or she earns less than 
370 a year by that standard the average person in 25 countries is 
poor including mozambique where 100 a year is the average 
earnings and kenya and togo where it is 370 yearly 
africa contains most of the areas where the average income falls 
that low but average income also is low in the worlds two most 
populous countries china at 330 a year and india 340 figures 
are for 1988 
in the united states the official poverty level for a single 
person was 6024 a year in 1988 and nearly 32 million people fell 
below it 
conable said third world governments should encourage private 
business he also wants them to contain inflation get rid of 
unnecessary public spending and allow realistic prices for farm 
products foreign currency imports and exports he wants them to 
hold down deficits in their budgets and their balance of 
international payments 
some third world leaders are reluctant to follow such policies 
on the ground that they make life more difficult for poor people in 
the short run 
michel camdessus head of the international monetary fund the 
banks sister organization said in a recent speech how do the 
poor who have little or no assets fare when runaway inflation is 
set loose by easy money policies when factories close down because 
of overvalued exchange rates when there is no incentive to produce 
crops because state monopolies pay prices that do not cover the 
cost of production 
camdessus said the poor are the first hit the worst hit the 
least able to protect themselves 
both conable and camdessus also urge the importance of safety 
nets to protect the poorest people from the rising prices that may 
result from the new policies 
conable proposed a twopronged strategy against poverty 
emphasis on the use of labor the third worlds most abundant 
asset to be mobilized by the incentives of the market and 
emphasis on providing health care and education 
he said parts of the strategy had been tried successfully in 
countries as different as colombia and indonesia chile and 
botswana 
according to the banks report 58 of every 100 indonesians had 
incomes below the poverty line in 1970 by 1987 the number had 
dropped to 17 
conable said it was inexcusable that rich countries were not 
furnishing more aid 
if developed countries cut their military spending by a mere 
10 percent they could double their aid he said 
conable said third world nations also could cut military 
spending

maybe the safest thing is for a president to 
be an only child an orphan unwed and celibate then he wont have 
a family to get him in trouble 
presidential kin as george bush is discovering sometimes put 
the man in the white house on the spot 
ask richard nixon who was taunted for years by democrats 
asking what about the howard hughes loan a reference to 
business mogul hughes 205000 loan to nixons kid brother donald 
nixon wanted the money to open a chain of restaurants selling 
nixonburgers 
ask jimmy carter whose goodolboy beerswilling brother 
billy used to issue profanitylaced observations from his bully 
pulpit the gas station in plains ga 
billy also put his name on a brand of beer that flopped made 
remarks that were denounced as racist or antisemitic accepted 
money from libya and underpaid the internal revenue service 
it was billy who in a quote he admitted having swiped from his 
mother celebrated how a family can embarrass a president 
ive got a mother who joined the peace corps at 68 a brother 
who wants to be president a sister who is a holyroller preacher 
and another sister who rides around on motorcycles im the only 
sane one in the family 
and of course ask bush 
just as the democrats were despairing of ever finding an issue 
to use against bush along came son neil bush and his links to the 
silverado banking savings and loan association of denver 
for democrats silverado is el dorado a chance to hang the sampl 
scandal on a republican person 
neil 34 was a director of silverado which collapsed at a cost 
to taxpayers of 1 billion he has been accused by federal 
regulators of failing to disclose adequately his past business 
relationship with major silverado borrowers 
the subject came up wednesday bush affirmed his confidence his 
sons integrity but added if the system finds hes done 
something wrong he will be the first to step up and do whats 
right 
the president draws praise from historians for handling the 
situation about as well as it can be handled 
obviously george bush isnt trying to cover up he is a very 
honorable man and i say that as a democrat said frank freidel 
biographer of franklin d roosevelt 
i think bush handled it all right added arthur schlesinger 
jr biographer of john f kennedy 
schlesinger recalls that jimmy roosevelt oldest of fdrs five 
children got in trouble with joseph kennedy father of jfk 
when prohibition was repealed jimmy accompanied the elder 
kennedy to england where he got distribution rights to haig amp haig 
scotch it looked fishy it was thought said schlesinger 
that kennedy used jimmy as an entree 
in the early days of the republic people didnt pay much 
attention to presidents families schlesinger added john 
quincy adams had a son who was an alcoholic but i dont think the 
press made much of those things then 
nixon biographer stephen e ambrose said the democrats used the 
hughes loan effectively in the presidential election of 1960 and 
again in the california gubernatorial race in 1962 
donald nixon thinking he had cost his brother the presidency in 
1960 was in tears on election night ambrose said 
of the hughes loan he said we still dont know what the 
truth of the matter is 
sam houston johnson lyndons brother had a drinking problem 
he would go on a toot recalled lbj confidant horace busby 
they might last days or months or years 
but basically said busby sam and his three sisters strove 
mightily to avoid embarrassing their brother 
sam he said was a sweet guy he was shy extremely so 
he recalls that during the 1948 campaign a restaurant hostess 
seeking to tell sam there was a phone call for him came up and 
said mr johnson 
no interrupted sam im his brother 
freidel said most presidential relatives have been circumspect 
he thinks it is remarkable how few cause embarrassment considering 
that children brothers inlaws are always being sought after 
because they have the white house aura 
whats a president to do when a relative transgresses 
grin and bear it and not condone it if it involves serious

israels chief sephardic rabbi has taken away 
the job of one of the countrys youngest rabbis saying the 
20yearold bachelor must gain the experience of marital 
relations before taking up his post 
chief rabbi mordechai eliahu froze the credentials of rabbi 
yaacov avitan who recently was chosen spiritual leader of beit 
shikma a farming community of about 1000 in southern israel 
rabbinate spokesman shmuel zaafrani said sunday 
avitans lack of experience with marital relations was a 
main factor in the decision said zaafrani he explained that 
giving married couples advice about sexual matters was one of a 
rabbis duties 
to do this he has to know these matters from up close a 
doctor who hasnt done an internship would never be allowed to 
treat any patients zaafrani said 
he added that the ruling was more a matter of custom than jewish 
law it is simply desirable for a rabbi to be married he said 
avitan is one of the youngest men approved as a rabbi in israel 
and believed to be the youngest appointed to the post of community 
rabbi a community rabbi customarily has to be older than 24 and 
married 
avitan said he agreed with the chief rabbis decision 
hes right there has to be a certain order to things its 
like a fresh recruit in the army doesnt become chief of staff in a 
day avitan said in an interview 
i will wait patiently until my match comes from heaven he 
said 
eliahu is chief rabbi to israels sephardic community jews of 
north african and middle eastern origin 
sephardic jews make up about 60 percent of israels 35 million 
jews beit shikmas residents are mainly jews of moroccan and 
libyan origin

a suit against a british rock band goes to 
trial monday alleging that a record contained subliminal messages 
to do it and caused two troubled young fans to shoot themselves 
in a deserted playground 
raymond belknap 18 held a sawedoff shotgun to his chin and 
died instantly from a single blast that afternoon two days before 
christmas 1985 
james vance 20 managed only to blow away the lower portion of 
his face horribly mutilated he lived three more years underwent 
repeated operations and fathered a child before his death on 
thanksgiving day 1988 of complications from his injuries and a 
reaction to medication 
in one song by the popular heavy metal rock band beyond the 
realms of death the band sings yeah i have left the world 
behind i am safe now in my mind im free to speak with my own 
mind this is my life this is my life and ill decide not you 
but the trial beginning this week will focus not on what such 
lyrics may have suggested but whether there was a second 
allbutinaudible set of lyrics whispered in the background as a 
subliminal message 
attorneys for the vance and belknaps families say the two 
formed a suicide pact after drinking beer smoking marijuana and 
listening to the stained class album over and over again 
they will try to convince washoe district judge jerry carr 
whitehead that subliminal messages on the album touting the devil 
and encouraging listeners to do it do it convinced the two 
friends that as vance allegedly told an investigator the answer 
to life is death 
lawyers for judas priest and cbs records will argue it was the 
young mens troubled lives including a history of drug and alcohol 
abuse psychiatric disorders and physical abuse that pushed them 
over the edge they deny any subliminal messages exist or that the 
band promotes satan and suicide 
i dont believe that wed have had the support and following 
that weve had for the past 17 years had we deliberately attempted 
to contrive to create songs where people did harm to themselves 
lead singer robert halford said in a 1988 deposition 
whitehead has already denied a defense motion to dismiss the 
case on grounds the record was protected by the first amendment 
saying that such protection exists for regular music and lyrics but 
not secret hidden messages that the recipient does not know 
exist 
the judge stressed that he has no knowledge of whether such 
subliminal messages exist on stained class but ruled attorneys 
should be allowed to present their case to the court 
the lawsuit is proceeding as a products liability case accusing 
the band and cbs records of negligence and intentional and reckless 
misconduct it seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages 
more than 100 witnesses are expected to testify during the 
nonjury trial which is expected to last four weeks 
band members will attend the trial but attorneys said they have 
been unable to locate the original multitrack recording of the 
album that could have made it easier to determine whether there 
were subliminal messages 
attorneys for the families do not dispute that the two young men 
were troubled but they argue in court filings that because of 
their faults the two were susceptible influenced and vulnerable 
to the ideas suggestions and emotions allegedly hidden in the 
music 
voluminous court documents paint the youths lives as 
troublesome from early adolescence 
in 1978 a school psychologist from livermore valley unified 
school district in california visited vances mother phyllis 
vance to discuss concerns about his behavior 
the psychologists report concluded that a high possibility 
existed for james to respond violently to stressful situations and 
that this probability might increase as james is subjected to the 
additional stresses of adolescence 
vance was in the fifth grade at the time 
both he and belknap dropped out of school in the 10th grade 
records indicate they drifted between menial jobs had several 
brushes with the law carried guns and dreamed of becoming 
mercenaries 
in 1984 vance allegedly made phone calls threatening to kill 
the mother and younger sister of his former girlfriend 
and a week before his suicide a complaint was filed against 
belknap charging him with animal torture for shooting a neighbors 
cat with darts from a blowgun

poland once again is at the vanguard of 
reform in eastern europe this time on the economic front 
last weeks passage of a law to privatize all stateowned 
businesses and industries may mean more dislocation for workers 
but it was being hailed as a key step on the road to capitalism 
this is a historic event equal to taking power away from the 
communists last year said the progovernment gazeta wyborcza 
newspaper no neighboring country has reached this stage of 
dismantling communism 
the 3282 vote friday showed parliaments conviction that most 
people still want to move toward a market system even though the 
road has been bumpy 
farmers and workers have called on the solidarityled government 
to soften its economic program solidarity leader lech walesa has 
been pressing for speedier reforms consumers have been grumbling 
about high prices and workers have been laid off by the thousands 
the surprisingly lopsided approval of the privatization measure 
should bolster the embattled government of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki it also marks a turning point in the radical economic 
reform program begun jan 1 
the plans first phase focused on fighting inflation 
strengthening the currency and stabilizing the market by getting 
goods back into stores 
like home builders polands economic planners reasoned it was 
necessary first to clear the ground no one would open a business 
in conditions of hyperinflation shortages and worthless money 
using tight fiscal and monetary policies the program got 
results at a high social cost 
real average incomes fell nearly 40 percent industrial output 
fell by 30 percent and unemployment zoomed from virtually zero to 
42 percent more than half a million workers 
now with inflation tamped down to a manageable level the 
polish zloty stable and empty shelves a fading memory construction 
of the new economic system begins 
mazowiecki and his economic chief deputy prime minister leszek 
balcerowicz spelled out their commitment to privatization from the 
moment the solidarityled government was created in september 
rejecting a third path between capitalism and communism 
mazowiecki said he would seek an economy based on tried and 
proven western methods 
under the old communist government polish industry in theory 
was owned by the state in practice there were no owners no one 
to fire idlers no one to invest for greater efficiency no one 
impassioned to make profits 
restoring ownership was seen as the key to economic renaissance 
common interests and mutual care for businesses taken over by 
citizens will favor democracy balcerowicz told a television 
audience saturday 
finding a palatable privatization plan took some doing 
opinion surveys showed the average citizen feared foreign 
capitalists would snap up factories and land at bargain prices and 
poles would be secondclass citizens in their own country 
in the parts of poland that used to be germany poles were 
worried that germans would buy in and resettle 
even if the investors were polish it was assumed that only 
those who lined their pockets as supporters of the old system could 
afford to buy so honest poles would be toiling for the same old 
communist overlords 
finally workers expected longer hours more unemployment and 
less of a say in how their workplaces were run 
the law hammered out by the government and parliament during 
three months of committee work addressed all those concerns 
workers were promised the right to buy up to 20 percent of their 
factories at discount prices the general public is to be issued 
privatization bonds which can be used to buy shares and can also 
buy on installment 
the government retains an option to limit foreign investments of 
more than 10 percent in a company officials say they will use that 
option sparingly 
each of more than 7600 state enterprises in every sector of 
the polish economy is to be privatized as quickly as possible 
starting with a dozen or so companies this year 
the process will take years because each must be evaluated 
before sale with the healthiest ones up for sale first 
moneylosers will be dissolved and sold for their assets 
balcerowicz told poles the task is a huge one but it can be 
accomplished 
to a large extent he said the future of every one of us 
depends on it

while israel welcomes tens of thousands of 
immigrants from the soviet union with hope and fanfare thousands 
of jews are leaving their zionist dreams faded or gone 
officials expect more than 150000 soviet jews this year but 
about 40000 israelis will emigrate roughly 1 percent of the 
jewish population of 38 million 
about 14000 israelis left last year the increase in emigration 
can be blamed in part on the soviets entry into already tight 
housing and job markets 
but emigration especially to the united states is a 
longstanding problem 
by conservative estimates 400000 jews have left in the four 
decades since israel was founded population experts say the number 
could be 800000 if it included israelis who say they are leaving 
temporarily but never return 
the exodus is a serious blow to a country that was founded to 
gather jewish exiles and worries about a burgeoning arab population 
in israel and the occupied territories 
many of the emigrants are young and educated some are offspring 
of pioneer zionist families 
most head for america new york and los angeles are estimated to 
have attracted 200000 israelis each 
when you walk around new york city you rarely pass one or two 
blocks without hearing hebrew said mordechai heiblum a 
physicist who has spent 17 years in the united states and works for 
ibm research laboratories 
i left because the possibilities in israel were 
nonexistent heiblum said he plans to return but said that was 
because he had a job directing a new program to encourage the 
return of israeli scientists 
michael kleiner head of the immigrant absorption committee in 
parliament said the government must act quickly to create jobs and 
housing 
the immigration from the soviet union has sharpened the 
problems for young israelis said kleiner a senior legislator of 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
the warnings of growing emigration are echoed in the tent cities 
set up by homeless protesters outside the parliament building in 
jerusalem and at city halls across the country 
one protester tal yakov said her brother plans to leave when 
he is discharged from the army because he has no hope of finding an 
apartment 
there are many people today who are leaving the best and the 
brightest who gave their souls to this country she told israel 
television 
some accuse the government of indifference 
the whole country is excited that in the next few years 
300000 soviet jews will arrive but when you say at least that 
many people have left this does not shock anyone said boaz 
shviger of the jewish agency which helps settle arriving jews 
avi pazner an aide to shamir said if we have 100000 
immigrants and 10000 who leave we are still ahead by 90 percent 
it disturbs us but its not something vital there is not much we 
can do 
increasing emigration also has changed the attitude that 
emigrants are deserters who betray the zionist dream people now 
talk freely about plans to leave and those with us residency 
permits are envied not criticized 
half the respondents in a recent survey said emigration was an 
acceptable option for people who could not find housing or jobs up 
from about 30 percent five years ago said pollster hanoch smith 
shviger said the new attitude resulted from a deep ideological 
crisis among young israelis who no longer see the jewish state as 
the center of their lives the young generation is running away 
from politics and ideology he said 
this alienation is apparent from the growing number of emigrants 
among kibbutzniks members of the communal farms that were the core 
of early zionism 
the daily yediot ahronot said about 8000 former kibbutzniks 
were among the 200000 israelis living in los angeles 
one is 36yearold shraga agam who left kibbutz haogen in 
northern israel 11 years ago and owns a successful home improvement 
company 
i believe everyone has to do whats good for him agam told 
the newspaper for me its business success and money 
another category of emigrants is westerners who came with bright 
dreams but found life difficult in israel heavily taxed salaries 
often barely cover rent and other necessities and men face one 
month a year of army reserve duty 
of about 2000 north americans who arrive each year 35 to 40 
percent return home said yoav peg director of the association of 
americans and canadians in israel 
more often than not its economics he said people are 
just not used to living in the red and find it too hard to make 
ends meet 
emigrants include a disproportionate number of the young and 
highly educated according to kleiner twothirds of the 14000 
emigrants last year were 21 to 34 years old and 17 percent held 
university degrees 
each year 60 to 70 students from the weizmann institute of 
science go to the united states for postdoctoral studies 
institute spokesman nechemia meyers said many do not return because 
there are no jobs for them in israel 
he noted that the influx of soviet jews 60 percent of whom have 
university degrees was making the scientific and professional job 
markets even tighter 
there are 200 doctors a month coming from the soviet union 
about the same as the number of graduates from israel medical 
schools every year meyers said and there isnt exactly a 
shortage of doctors in israel

far from the russian republic that he 
governs boris yeltsin is a favorite among coal miners in the 
ukraine who hope his antiestablishment crusade will help improve 
their lives 
boris nikolayevich yeltsin is the most decent person in the 
country said nikolai timoshenko a 55yearold veteran of the 
gorky mine in donetsk the heart of the ukraines coal country i 
support him because he fights for true democracy speaks honestly 
and openly 
the reformminded president of the russian republic who quit 
the communist party last thursday during its congress in moscow 
has nationwide support even though he is an ethnic russian and 
holds no national office 
railing against kremlin policy and privilege yeltsin wins 
points from the working class the communist party has alienated 
miners tired of promises that their living and working 
conditions will improve are an especially receptive audience 
at a miners rally during a oneday strike last week little was 
said about yeltsin at the rostrum but the men who spend their 
workdays 1000 yards underground were more than eager to talk when 
asked about him 
timoshenko said he sees a potential spillover of yeltsins 
policies from russia the soviet unions largest republic to the 
ukraine the second largest if a reformer is elected ukrainian 
president 
vladimir ivashko resigned as president of the ukraine last week 
to be mikhail s gorbachevs deputy in the communist party and the 
post has not yet been filled 
many donetsk miners feel left out of the political process 
they didnt ask us who to nominate for president timoshenko 
said 
miners other members of the soviet working class and 
intellectuals who followed yeltsin out of the communist party are 
uniting around him into a formal opposition 
leaders of democratic platform a coalition of radical reformers 
who are mainly intellectuals and skilled workers quit the party 
with yeltsin but do not expect him to join them in forming a new 
opposition party this fall 
boris yeltsin remains the leader of the entire democratic 
movement said stepan sulakhin of the siberian city tomsk 
the miners have adopted an anticommunist tone in line with 
yeltsins harsh criticism of the party they have boldly thrown 
communists out of the mines and plan to organize a government and 
partyfree trade union next month 
both yeltsin and gorbachev had pleaded with the miners not to 
strike but have parted views there gorbachev rejected the miners 
demands for the government to resign and end party cells in the kgb 
and army yeltsin supported them 
that was not lost on some miners who say yeltsin is better 
qualified than gorbachev to lead the country 
hes more flexible than gorbachev and more decisive in 
achieving his goals said vladislav lushakov 30 as he waited 
for an elevator to take him into the zasyadko mine in donetsk

the trial of a 35 million wrongful death 
suit filed after the 1986 suicide of sen john east is winding down 
with closing arguments set to begin this week 
the 55yearold firstterm republican killed himself by filling 
his garage in greenville with carbon monixide 11 months after he 
was cured of a thyroid disorder 
his widow priscilla east contends in the wrongful death 
lawsuit that navy doctors who provide medical care for members of 
congress were slow to detect her husbands thyroid condition she 
charges that the delay triggered a severe depression that led to 
the senators suicide 
he left a suicide note blaming the doctors saying they ruined 
my health 
government lawyers argued in the nonjury trial in us district 
court in baltimore that east was fully capable of making important 
decisions including the one to kill himself closing arguments 
are set to begin tuesday 
not every death is someone elses responsibility said 
assistant us attorney susan ringler in her opening statement in 
march 
while the suit against the government has attracted attention 
because of the victims prominence experts say mrs easts claim 
wont set any legal precedent 
i think the case is more likely to obtain notoriety because of 
the identity of the plaintiff as opposed to the substance of her 
claim it doesnt present any major legal precedental issues 
michael roth a health care attorney in los angeles said thursday 
east a onetime college professor ran for the senate in 1980 
under the wing of the national congressional club the political 
organization of sen jesse helms rnc he defeated democratic 
incumbent robert morgan 
he had decided not to run for reelection in 1986 and planned to 
return to east carolina university where he had taught political 
science 
court papers filed by mrs east paint a picture of a man who 
during his years in the senate changed from someone known for his 
quick wit to one who tried on six suits each morning before 
deciding what to wear 
and when she testified in march mrs east spoke of an 
intelligent vigorous man a former marine who relentlessly pursued 
his professional and political goals even though he used a 
wheelchair since a bout with polio in the 1950s that changed after 
he fell ill in 1983 she said 
mrs east claims in the civil suit that the navy doctors could 
have diagnosed the thyroid disease hypothyroidism much earlier 
with a simple blood test the disorder occurs when the thyroid 
gland fails to produce the hormones needed to maintain the bodys 
metabolism 
she testified that navy doctors insisted her husbands problem 
was pyschological and referred him to a psychiatrist it wasnt 
until 1985 that the thyroid disorder was diagnosed after he 
collapsed into a nearfatal coma 
not long after he regained consciousness east tried to kill 
himself by ramming a chair leg down his throat according to the 
court papers his hypothyroidism was cured with a synthetic 
hormone but he became convinced that his intelligence and powers 
of reason had been permanently damaged mrs easts attorneys say 
in his suicide note east wrote by failing to diagnose the 
hypothyroidism condition as they should have the attending 
physician dr cary and the bethesda physicians ruined my health 
i cant go on 
he referred to a navy doctor rear adm freeman cary who had 
treated him at the capitol and referred him to a psychiatrist cary 
is not a target of the lawsuit because survivors in such cases can 
file claims against the government but cannot sue individual 
doctors 
government attorneys blamed easts suicide on the internal 
conflict he felt about his unhappiness with the senate and the 
prospect of running again 
he delineated that staying another term and leaving both 
those options made him depressed his psychiatrist ralph 
gemelli testified in april he thought people would think he 
failed in some ways

the failure of the hubble space telescope and 
grounding of the space shuttle fleet are shaking congressional 
confidence in the space program just as lawmakers search for ways 
to redirect defense spending to civilian science 
the hubble and shuttle troubles also have prompted top bush 
administration officials to begin searching for ways to 
reinvigorate the us space program an administration source said 
sunday 
the white house may enlist a team of space experts from outside 
government to aid that review said the official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
theres still widespread support for space exploration in 
congress and until its recent problems the national aeronautics 
and space administration seemed to be recovering from the black eye 
it received from the 1986 challenger explosion that killed seven 
astronauts 
rep mike andrews dtexas whose congressional district is home 
to thousands of nasa workers said we were right on the edge of 
what all of us thought would be a new chapter at nasa 
now andrews said last week cost overruns and defects in the 
hubble and shuttle programs make the space agency look like just 
one more big bureaucracy 
and its the butt of jokes 
sen al gore dtenn who conducted hearings on the hubble 
earlier this month quipped you know theres new information 
about the hubble jay leno has disclosed that it is actually 
working perfectly but the universe is all blurry 
leno is a popular comedian who substitutes for johnny carson as 
host of the tonight show on nbctv 
the administration source sunday said vice president dan quayle 
as chairman of the national space council and admiral richard 
truly the former astronaut who heads nasa are leading the 
internal effort to find ways to get the space program back on track 
the decision has not yet been made to convene a blueribbon 
panel of experts the source said but if something is done it 
will be done with a combination of outside and inside advice 
cbs news reported saturday that the administration likely will 
name a panel of outside experts this week 
from the white house perspective the problems go beyond the 
hubble and shuttle leaks to broader difficulties with diminished 
public support for the space program and congress refusal to fund 
the full 25 percent nasa budget increase that bush asked for 
but two days after nasa revealed that the hubble was crippled by 
a defective mirror the house approved 143 billion for the agency 
in fiscal 1991 2 billion more than the current fiscal year 
theres little talk of any immediate cutbacks 
however the agencys big projects for the future are being 
looked at with much more skepticism than before those include a 
50 billion system of weather satellites the 37 billion permanent 
space station and bushs proposal to land a man on mars within 30 
years 
the worst kept secret in washington is that defense 
contractors who are out of work are now pushing space spending as a 
national priority said rep richard durbin dill a member of 
the house budget committee where else can they spend billions of 
taxpayers dollars on theory and dreams 
more than 300 billion in new space projects have been proposed 
for the next three decades but among ardent supporters in 
congress there is widespread reluctance to expand nasas role 
before an accounting is made for the problems in the current 
programs 
their plate is quite full and its a very stressful time for 
nasa whatever can go wrong is going wrong said rep bob 
traxler dmich chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the 
space and science budget 
rep bill green of new york the senior republican on that 
panel said a decision on pulling the plug on the space station 
project must be made soon or it could be too far along to kill 
traxler says its too early to tell whether the program already 
far over budget and undercapable should be scrapped for something 
more simple but he said congress is increasingly skeptical of big 
science projects and especially of the promises made by their 
backers 
the usual gambit for getting a big project approved is to come 
in with a low estimate get congress to sink money into it and 
then expect congress to keep spending as the estimates go up 
because so much money already is invested 
those days are gone traxler said 
andrews says nasas problems run too deeply for congress to 
solve without presidential leadership and hes critical of quayle 
for not doing more to straighten out nasa from his post as chairman 
of the national space council 
i hope george bush doesnt just leave it up to dan quayle to 
lead us through this difficult time he said 
in addition to quayle and truly the national space council 
includes white house chief of staff john sununu budget director 
richard darman commerce secretary robert mosbacher and other 
officials

president mikhail s gorbachev said he and west 
german chancellor helmut kohl drew a little bit closer sunday on 
the key issue of a united germanys membership in nato 
moscows refusal to accept a united german presence in the 
western alliance has become a major obstacle to the swift merger of 
the two german states 
kohl arrived in moscow late saturday on a twoday visit seeking 
to remove soviet obstacles to german unification other issues 
discussed were the size of a united german army and west german 
economic aid to the soviet union 
late sunday gorbachev and kohl traveled 1000 miles south of 
moscow to stavropol gorbachevs native region and the place where 
he was communist party leader before coming to moscow gorbachev 
said he thought the fresh air of the northern caucasus would 
help both leaders formulate their thoughts clearly the tass news 
agency reported 
asked whether the two sides had managed to come a little bit 
closer on the issue of nato membership the tass news agency quoted 
gorbachev as saying 
in the last month or two many important changes have occurred 
and the new context opens possibilities for the way to a new 
understanding in other words that very little bit is 
appearing 
it is kohls second visit to moscow since february he told 
reporters he was optimistic that the foreign and security 
aspects of german unity could be solved this year 
gorbachev said he and kohl also discussed a comprehensive new 
treaty to govern relations between the soviet union and a united 
germany we have come quite close on very big questions he 
said without elaborating 
kohl said both he and gorbachev were aware of the historic 
hour at hand but were looking forward without forgetting 
history 
the accord would replace the moscow treaty a nonaggression 
pact ratified by the west german and soviet parliaments in 1972 
the pact has formed the basis of relations between the two 
countries 
the new treaty would cover security issues as well as economic 
financial and cultural cooperation it would bind both sides to 
mutual renunciation of force 
fighting between nazi germany and the red army in world war ii 
cost at least 20 million soviet lives many soviet families still 
bear the scars of the war 
for decades the german threat was a favorite subject of soviet 
propaganda war movies are still popular on soviet television 
this weekend primetime television featured two films on the nazi 
ss forces 
moscow stands to lose east germany its most important partner 
in the warsaw pact alliance once the two germanys merge sometime 
after allgerman elections in december 
the soviet union has objected to allowing a united germany 
immediately to become a nato member and instead has suggested a 
transitional membership in both alliances western nations want 
germany immediately to join nato 
but soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has indicated 
at talks among the two germanys and the four victorious world war 
ii allies france great britain the united states and the soviet 
union that there is room for compromise 
nato secretary general manfred woerner kohls defense minister 
from 19821988 who is also visiting the soviet union said saturday 
the inclusion of a united germany in nato would contribute to 
stability in europe 
on the size of a united german army the soviets have suggested 
the force number less than 400000 they have also argued that 
their troops should stay in what is now east german territory and 
bonn has pledged 780 million for the upkeep of soviet soldiers in 
the second half of this year 
west german economic aid to the soviet union is also an issue 
between the leaders the west german government has backed a 31 
billion loan to support the kremlins efforts to lead the soviet 
unions centralized economy to a marketoriented system 
but western leaders rejected a proposal strongly supported by 
west germany and france for a 15 billion aid plan to shore up the 
soviet economy and demonstrate western support for gorbachev 
the soviet union is already suffering from the drop in imports 
from east germany its largest trading partner in the east bloc

a federal plan recommends continued production 
of nuclear weapons at a revitalized complex of factories and 
reactors despite the appearance of a reduced soviet military 
threat according to a published report sunday 
the washington post said the department of energy wants the 
military to be able to make new bombs through at least the middle 
of the next century the newspaper quoted an unidentified energy 
department official as saying the departments research and 
spending plans were based on a requirement for nuclear weapons as 
far a we can see 
energy department officials say they foresee a continued need to 
manufacture new varieties of nuclear weapons to replace those being 
retired or withdrawn as obsolete even though the size of the us 
nuclear arms cache is expected to decline from 21000 weapons over 
the next 60 years the post said 
the newspaper said energy secretary james d watkins told the 
senate armed services committee in a letter that under one option 
being considered complex 21 nuclear weapons construction 
activities now spread across 12 states would be consolidated at one 
or two sites 
complex 21 my vision of a fully modernized nuclear weapons 
complex is planned to be in operation about 2015 and to support 
the nations strategic deterrent until the middle of the century 
watkins wrote 
the letter provided the most detailed explanation yet of the 
departments longterm goal the post said 
some officials have suggested that such a complex which 
antinuclear activists have dubbed a nuclear weapons theme 
park could be operated in a state such as south carolina where 
public support remains high for such a bomb building enterprise and 
the federal dollars it would bring

developing a flyresistant wheat in morocco 
teaching tunisia about banking and bringing down bangladeshs 
fertility rate are among the tasks us experts have taken on as 
part of americas global effort to help needy nations help 
themselves 
since the aid program was started in the wake of world war ii 
the united states has spent more than 212 billion helping about 
half the worlds countries 
now the program is being extended on a limited basis to the 
soviet union 
socalled technical assistant advisers who have been sharing 
american knowhow with less fortunate countries for years now will 
be available to help the soviets reeling economy 
a lot of people think theyre going to pass atom bomb secrets 
but its really rather mundane things like how to dry wheat before 
you store it so it doesnt rot curtis jackson of the agency for 
international development said in an interview last week 
the soviet union which has not received us foreign aid since 
america gave it a small sum of postwar relief in the 1940s is the 
latest country to be added to the list of more than 80 nations that 
receive american help 
the bush administration while balking at providing the soviet 
union with cash grants or loans agreed at the economic summit of 
industrial nations in houston this past week to provide the 
technical assistance the international monetary fund also will 
study the soviet economy 
under the us aid program experts oftentimes college 
professors or consultants from private industry travel to 
developing and middleincome countries to help with problems 
ranging from farming to family planning to nutrition and health 
american endeavors have included helping panama set up a new 
police force assisting el salvador on upgrading its deficient 
judicial system and instructing afghanistan on overhauling its 
irrigation system 
the us program includes both technical assistance the 
limited type of help the soviet union will get and also direct 
economic aid for housing agriculture and health projects this 
years budget is 7 billion 
the only aid the soviet union has received since the program 
started except for earthquake relief to soviet armenia was the 
186 million it was handed from 194648 for postwar relief 
some emergency aid has gone to red bloc countries but not 
longterm development aid like the technical assistants that will 
now go to the soviet union said john matelsky a spokesman for aid 
as evolving democracies in eastern europe such as poland and 
hungary try to transfer stateowned industries to private hands 
us experts are helping them cope with questions americans find 
basic but which newcomers to a free market find mindboggling 
they are used to being told how many units to deliver where 
to deliver them and what time to deliver them said dean jansma 
associate dean for international programs in agriculture at 
pennsylvania state university who recently returned from poland 
how do you handle employees in a free enterprise system can 
you fire someone those kind of questions are second nature to 
us but theyve never done them there jansma said 
as in africa and southeast asia us experts are trying to help 
european countries improve harvesting and storage methods so more 
of what the country produces eventually end up on the dinner table 
sometimes a third of whats grown deteriorates before anyone 
eats it jackson said 
john nicholaides director of international agriculture at the 
university of illinois was heading to poland this weekend as part 
of an illinois state trade mission 
nicholaides has developed a model small farm for groups of 
polish families to help them get their products to market and so 
they will have more leverage to obtain a better price for their 
products he said 
us officials can help poland most by teaching them how to 
improve their food processing such as turning corn into vegetable 
oil or snacks rather than just selling the raw product nicholaides 
said 
theyre importing a lot of things they used to export thats 
the big area where poland really feels like they need input from 
the united states he said 
that country also is seeking assistance for telecommunications 
and education he said 
vernon larson assistant provost for international programs at 
kansas state university in the past has worked in nigeria and 
india helping those countries develop agriculture schools 
improving a countrys agriculture base is the key to improving 
the rest of its economy because it frees up more people to work in 
industrial sectors larson said 
kansas state has taken an active part because a wheat state 
like we are our future market is in the underdeveloped 
countries 
its a humanitarian thing its the right thing to do and it 
helps us the world needs these crops

tv reporter charles kuralt has turned down a 
request by a group of archaeologists to dig up the front lawn of 
his vacation house 
in a letter to wesleyan university archaeology professor john 
pfeiffer the television newsman told the scholars he is not 
interested in what might lie beneath the lush green turf pfeiffer 
said saturday 
pfeiffer is leading a crew of wesleyan university graduate 
students who are excavating sections of an 18th and 19thcentury 
industrial complex at the mouth of falls river in essex they 
believe kuralts lawn several hundred yards upstream from the 
site could hold clues to the development of the area as a 
19thcentury ivory processing center 
the professor said kuralt believed his property had held nothing 
more than a bicycle factory 
he felt that archaeology wouldnt tell him anything that he 
didnt already know pfeiffer said 
a woman who answered the phone sunday at cbs news in new york 
said kuralt had left for the day and there was no answer sunday 
afternoon at kuralts home telephone in essex 
the archaeologists had written kuralt in may asking for 
permission to dig a few small test pits in the lawn which they 
believe could conceal a trove of ivory notions such as eyelets 
combs and perhaps even fragments of billiard balls

klerks plans to dismantle the apartheid system of racial 
segregation and share power with the 30million black majority

prime minister margaret thatcher secretly gathered 
leading academics to discuss the germans and explore traits 
traditionally attributed to them such as angst aggressive 
bullying and egotism it was revealed sunday 
mrs thatchers think tank concluded that while the germans have 
changed the future was uncertain meanwhile they decided we 
should be nice to the germans 
a summary of the march 24 meeting at mrs thatchers country 
house chequers was written by her private secretary charles 
powell it was published in full in the independent on sunday 
it was not clear how the paper obtained a copy of the report 
but foreign secretary douglas hurd who attended the meeting 
confirmed the texts accuracy 
we started by talking about the germans and their 
characteristics powell wrote listing angst aggressiveness 
bullying egotism inferiority complex sentimentality 
but there was a strong school of thought among those present 
that todays germans were very different and that after world 
war ii militarism and thirst for conquests disappeared 
education and the writing of history had changed we should 
have no real worries about them he reportedly wrote 
not everyone agreed however 
it still had to be asked how a cultured and cultivated nation 
had allowed itself to be brainwashed into barbarism if it had 
happened once could it not happen again the summary said 
even today it said the way the germans threw their weight 
about in the european community suggested that a lot had still not 
changed german behavior in the ec we pay so we must have our 
way was seen by some as a harbinger of germanys economic 
dominance over western europe 
the new germany has never been tested by calamity the document 
said no one at the meeting had serious misgivings about the 
present leaders or political elite of germany but what about 10 
15 or 20 years from now 
no formal conclusions were drawn the summary said but 
the weight of the evidence and the argument favored those who 
were optimistic about life in a united germany when it came to 
failings and unhelpful characteristics the germans had their share 
and perhaps more but in contrast to the past they were much 
readier to recognize and admit this themselves 
the overall message was unmistakable we should be nice to the 
germans but even the optimists had some unease not for the 
present and the immediate future but for what might lie further 
down the road than we can yet see 
the participants according to the newspaper included mrs 
thatcher historian hugh trevorroper oxford universitys norman 
stone american professors fritz stern of columbia university and 
gordon craig of harvard journalist timothy garton ash and george 
urban former research director at radio free europe 
the summary was published amid political upheaval over the 
resignation of trade secretary nicholas ridley for comments made 
about germany and opposition politicians were quick to accuse mrs 
thatcher of insulting a friendly ally 
the labor partys gerald kaufman said it was an offensive 
farce for senior cabinet ministers to sit around pulling the 
germans to pieces 
but hurd saw nothing wrong with a brainstorming session about 
the implications of a momentous event such as the unification of 
germany 
the first step toward unification came with economic union of 
the german states on july 1 and a full merger will come after 
allgerman elections expected in december 
what mattered hurd told bbctv was that the experts verdict 
on germany was positive 
it was virtually a fantasy to suppose that were going to be 
faced with a new hitler or a new gestapo he said we can 
really dismiss that as a possibility 
mrs thatchers views did not appear in the summary but she has 
voiced misgivings about the economic might of a united germany

the bolshoi ballet proves that sets and props 
arent needed to tell the story of romeo and juliet 
dramatically and beautifully in dance 
the company dancing at the new york state theater presented 
its second fullevening ballet here the first stop on a sevencity 
us tour on saturday night yuri posokhov and lyudmila semenyaka 
danced romeo and juliet with youthful passion 
posokhov enters dances a solo then mikhail sharkov as mercutio 
enters and dances sharkov is dressed in white and has the build 
and dash of a hero one wonders for a moment whether hes romeo 
but posokhovs slim build and darting intensity make him look 
appropriately very young semenyaka dances a slightly more mature 
juliet when she runs to her nurse after she has fallen in love at 
first sight with romeo she doesnt throw herself into the nurses 
arms like a confused child but grabs her arms one woman is telling 
another the news 
semenyakas dancing looks very young and fresh she danced with 
the bolshoi here in 1979 and 1987 
each duet is different in mood the balcony scene young 
passionate love the wedding scene chaste the wedding morning 
scene tender the reunion in the tomb scene joyful on her part 
physical exertion after taking poison on his part 
yuri grigorovich artistic director of the bolshoi 
choreographed romeo and juliet to prokofievs music for the 
paris opera ballet in 1978 that version transferred to the bolshoi 
a year later it changes a few plot details from the ballet 
versions usually seen the newly married romeo doesnt hold back 
mercutio in his duel with juliets brother tybalt here he grabs 
tybalts shoulder but tybalt is able to stab mercutio in the back 
a nicer touch 
theres more than the usual amount of dancing by corps de ballet 
in this version the bolshois male dancers are strong and virile 
grigorovichs ballet steps and patterns arent as varied and 
nuanced as some choreographers one gets more of a sense of 
repetition with him but the overall architecture of the ballet is 
admirable and he is excellent at choreographing for many couples 
who fill the stage 
the backdrop has sweeps of draped cloth with different 
lighting a projection of a doorway indicates friar laurences 
premises yuri vetrov danced the friar who lifts and carries 
juliet in this production 
theres no balcony and no bed in juliets bedroom oddly they 
arent needed dancers get up from their knees or lie on the floor 
juliet changes costumes but wears her juliet cap all the time even 
in bed 
aleksei dovgopoly danced paris with flair not making him a 
wimp aleksandr vetrov was excellently haughty and audacious as 
tybalt

conservative baptists who established 
control over the nations largest protestant denomination began 
flexing their authority and promptly sparked a clash over press 
freedom 
the fundamentalistmoderate power struggle over the past decade 
for control of the southern baptist convention reached a watershed 
last month when moderates failed in what was viewed as a lastditch 
effort to balance leadership 
and only about 24 hours after a fundamentalist texas minister 
was installed as convention president two editors of the baptist 
press were asked to resign 
they refused setting up a meeting tuesday at baptist 
headquarters here that some ministers say will tell a lot about how 
conservatives plan to lead the denominations flock of nearly 15 
million members 
we all are waiting to see whos next said the rev roy 
honeycutt president of southern baptist theological seminary in 
louisville ky for all practical purposes i assume theyve now 
won the battle theyve set out to win in 1979 
ordered to quit were editors alvin c shackleford 58 and dan 
martin 51 critics say that under them the news service has 
become biased in favor of moderates both have asked for time to be 
heard at tuesdays hearing of the 77member executive committee 
martin said his refusal to quit has put southern baptist 
conservatives in a tough spot their coup cant be bloodless 
they dont want to fire anybody that leaves this situation a 
little ambivalent he said 
executive committee president harold c bennett who called the 
meeting was at a conference in north carolina and couldnt be 
reached for comment a secretary in his office said friday he did 
not return a phone message left at his nashville home sunday 
newly elected southern baptist convention president morris 
chapman of wichita falls texas also was out of town a staff 
member said 
in the past baptist debate has centered on religious subjects 
like whether the bible should be considered to be literally true in 
all respects but lately is has fallen on secular topics such as 
the amount of coverge baptist press has given moderate ministers 
vs conservatives 
television journalist bill moyers a lifelong southern baptist 
has leaped to the aid of the editors 
in a letter to state baptist news editors moyers attacked 
houston judge paul pressler a fundamentalist leader who has 
spearheaded the fight against the two editors 
moyers described pressler vice chairman of the 77member 
executive committee as a petty tyrant 
he rules the southern baptist convention like a swaggering 
caesar breaking good men when it pleases him said moyers who 
defended the editors as unwilling to slant their reporting 
pressler was out of the country and unavailable for comment 
before the meeting 
the rev fred wolfe a pastor at cottage hill baptist church in 
mobile ala and executive committee treasurer said he and five 
others suggested to bennett that the editors be ousted 
real or perceived theres strong feeling among conservatives 
that baptist press has been promoderate in the last 12 years 
wolfe said i can assure you that mr shackleford and mr martin 
knew there was a real problem with baptist press for a long period 
of time 
moderates say the problem is that southern baptists are being 
required to share a single viewpoint of their faith 
its like you used to have in factories that stamped out 
records same speeds same size same song honeycutt said 
the 44yearold news service considered one of the nations 
most open and objective denominational news agencies serves 400 
outlets including 38 independent baptist state weeklies it 
maintains bureaus in dallas washington dc atlanta and 
richmond va 
the rev rick cagle an executive committee member from gadsden 
ala said the resignation order came because some baptist 
journalists were letting their politics show 
youve got a lot of churches who dont even send the baptist 
publications out to their members because they feel theyre so 
biased cagle said 
the rev jb fowler who heads the southern baptist press 
association disagreed he accused conservatives of trying to 
neutralize ideological opponents 
in any takeover attempt regardless of what it is or who it 
is one of the things taken over is the press that it might be 
silenced said fowler editor of the baptist new mexican one of 
the 38 state baptist papers 
shackleford said the struggle is as simple and important as 
free speech 
we are basically asking for a right to focus on the real 
issue and that is the baptist right to know he said

am jet on a flight from west germany in the next 10 days 
in washington faa spokesman fred farrar refused to comment 
sunday in new york pan am spokesman jeff kreindler also declined 
comment and referred all queries to the faa 
the sunday correspondent quoted a confidential federal aviation 
adminstration bulletin as saying a female student with a 
canadian passport may be duped into carrying a suitcase containing 
a bomb on to a pan am flight from either frankfurt or berlin 
the faa issues hundreds of bomb threat warnings to airlines each 
year and the newspaper quoted the bulletin as saying there are 
doubts about the reliability of the individual that originated the 
threat information 
it said the bulletin was issued tuesday to all us airlines and 
selected airports 
it quoted the bulletin as saying the student was reportedly 
studying at the sorbonne in paris and is now touring europe her 
destination and date of departure are unknown it said 
the student allegedly has a middle eastern boyfriend who 
will give her a suitcase containing a bomb made of the semtex 
plastic explosive the newspaper was quoted as saying

jet over lockerbie scotland in december 1988 killing all 259

originated in frankfurt and changed aircraft in london 
after the crash it emerged that the faa had issued a bomb 
warning to airlines and diplomats 
the sunday correspondent said american intelligence experts 
believe the source of the latest warning could have been the 
israeli intelligence agency the mossad it said they suspect the 
mossad is attempting to disrupt the release of irish teacher brian 
keenan who has been a captive in lebanon since april 1986 
the paper said the mossad was also the source of a warning that 
preceded the lockerbie bomb plot it said that warning was 
dismissed as an israeli attempt to interfere with plo leader yasser 
arafats overtures to washington

prime minister vp singh withdrew his 
resignation offer sunday but the dispute within the coalition 
government that caused the crisis remained unresolved and four more 
ministers reportedly quit 
for the sake of the nation its unity and sovereignty we 
asked singh to withdraw his resignation which he agreed to do 
said nt rama rao the chairman of the governing national front 
alliance 
meanwhile foreign minister inder kumar gujral and three other 
ministers resigned sunday united news of india said the latest 
resignations brought to 13 the number of ministers who have quit 
the government in the dispute 
rao made the announcement about singh after a 90minute meeting 
between national front leaders and the prime minister 
the front is composed of singhs janata dal party and four 
smaller groups however janata dal president somappa rayappa 
bommai said the twodayold crisis gripping the minority government 
continues 
the crisis is not over yet i am in the process of getting to 
a solution bommai told a news conference he refused to 
elaborate 
singhs offer of resignation was prompted by a power struggle 
with deputy prime minister devi lal who has been promoting his 
sons political career despite growing protests and outrage from 
senior janata dal members 
rao said singh was persuaded to remain in office because the 
prime minister does not belong to one party he belongs to the 
national front he has a commitment to the national front and to 
the nation 
rao and other national leaders of the front arrived in new delhi 
sunday after local leaders failed a day earlier to force singh to 
retract his resignation 
singh submitted his resignation saturday to bommai bommai 
rejected the offer but singh had remained adamant until the front 
leaders met with him 
the 7monthold government was pushed into disarray friday when 
three cabinet ministers resigned to protest the restoration of devi 
lals son to the top government job in haryana state six more 
ministers resigned saturday 
bommai said the nine ministers resignations were still in 
effect and the issue was not discussed at sundays meeting with 
singh 
the partys efforts to retain singh as prime minister reinforced 
the view that the prime minister was not serious about resigning 
and was trying to force a showdown with devi lal the biggest 
irritant in singhs control of the government the government had 
bogged down while singh tried to cope with devi lals pressure 
tactics and tackle the business of running the country 
the crisis was precipitated when devi lal the 75yearold 
political patriarch of haryana state reinstated his son om 
prakash chautala as head of the state government chautala was 
forced from the chief ministers office in may after 12 people died 
in repeated election violence in his constituency 
chautala took his oath of office thursday and the next day 
three members of the national cabinet resigned in protest on 
saturday singh himself offered to resign and six more junior 
ministers followed suit 
bommai and rao evaded questions about chautalas fate rao 
leader of the telegu desam party said it was up to the janata dal 
to resolve the crisis 
singh led his party in ousting rajiv gandhis congress party in 
last novembers national elections 
neither party got a majority of the seats in parliament but the 
national front formed the government on the strength of outside 
support by a rightwing hindu fundamentalist party and leftwing 
parties the common ground of the three groups was their antipathy 
to the congress party

twentythree gray whale carcasses have 
washed up on two remote islands south of kodiak and scientists 
planned a study to determine why the mammals died 
the concern is that we have a bunch of dead whales and we 
dont know the cause said steve zimmerman chief of the 
protected resources management division of the national marine 
fisheries service in juneau 
national marine fisheries service officials in a us coast 
guard helicopter flew to the beaches in the gulf of alaska on 
saturday and planned to examine the dead whales for two days 
they circled tugidak and sitkinak islands in the air to 
determine how many carcasses were there and spotted 14 whales on 
tugidak and nine on sitkinak 
the 23 are the largest number of dead grays ever discovered in 
the gulf said zimmerman whose agency is mandated by congress to 
protect the whales and monitor their population 
effects of last years exxon valdez oil spill in prince william 
sound were among possible reasons for the deaths but zimmerman 
said that was unlikely 
the gulf is on the migration path of the whales which travel 
from baja california to the bering sea every march 
the gray whale population is booming more than 20000 of the 
mammals were estimated to have migrated this year from their warm 
mexican lagoons to feeding grounds in icy alaska waters 
twentythree carcasses is a large number of dead whales 
certainly said don calkins a wildlife biologist with the alaska 
department of fish and game but the way the gray whale 
population is going it may not be that significant 
in fact the burgeoning population may play a part in the 
deaths authorities said 
it appears to be an indication of population stress said 
jim brooks a fisheries service deputy director in juneau 
brooks said the whales behavior lately has been odd for 
instance theyve been seen in places far off their migration path 
including in the waters near juneau hundreds of miles east 
if you get enough people or animals of any sorts youre going 
to get misfits brooks said 
the gray whales range from 36 to 50 feet long and are relatively 
thin when they arrive at alaska waters 
they are known to eat very little for the six months they remain 
at baja california the bering sea the vast body of water 
separating alaskas west coast from the soviet union provides the 
whales with an oceanbottom food supply of crustaceans 
authorities said carcasses found near kodiak may be the remains 
of weak animals unable to continue the journey north strong 
currents in the region could have washed the whales ashore 
scientist speculated

authorities but only for the purposes of selfdefense

joint venture in china is expected to be signed within two months

restaurants in the soviet union but the planned flax textile firm 
in inner mongolia would be the first in china the englishlanguage 
business weekly said 
the flax mill in baotou 155 miles south of the soviet border 
is expected to be completed in 1992 according to ji jun of the 
textile ministry

handle capital construction while four soviet firms are to supply 
spinning machines and materials

the ownership will be divided 
in the 1950s the soviet union sent thousands of technical 
advisers to help develop china that cooperation ended when the two 
communist powers split over ideological and other differences at 
the end of the decade 
relations have warmed in recent years and diplomatic ties were 
normalized last year when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev visited 
beijing for the first summit in 30 years

declaring the country a 
kingdom of lies a leading roman catholic clergyman sunday 
accused the military of hindering an inquiry into the massacre of 
six jesuit priests 
we hope all those involved will be prosecuted said 
monsignor ricardo urioste the sad thing is that in this case it 
seems there is a truth we already know but there are those who 
have an interest in preventing that truth from being demonstrated 
 
we live in a kingdom of lies and such a kingdom will destroy 
itself urioste said in remarks to journalists 
earlier urioste delivered the nationally broadcast weekly 
sermon in place of archbishop arturo rivera damas who is out of 
the country urioste is vicar of the capitals archdiocese 
he told journalists he believed military officers questioned in 
connection with last years massacre had lied to judge ricardo 
zamora 
army troops killed the priests their housekeeper and her 
daughter before dawn on nov 16 a colonel three lieutenants and 
five other soldiers have been charged with the murders 
the farright had long considered the priests to be subversives 
it accused them of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas waging a 
decadeold insurgency 
at least 70000 people mostly civilians have died in that civil 
war 
the military has repeatedly pledged complete cooperation with 
the investigation but despite the promises military authorities 
have not handed over to zamora a lieutenant colonel accused of 
ordering the destruction of possibly key evidence 
on june 26 zamora ordered the arrest of lt col camilo 
hernandez on charges of covering up the murder 
the joint chiefs of staff said hernandez was placed under arrest 
july 5 however he has yet to be taken before a judge 
this is another demonstration that there are those who seem to 
be above the law urioste said 
the massacre had prompted calls in the us congress for cuts in 
aid to el salvador

hundreds of albanian refugees sang the 
french national anthem to celebrate their newfound freedom as they 
arrived at this port city sunday after a threeday journey from 
their communist homeland 
long live france long live the albanian people the 
refugees chanted as they left the ferry orient star on marseilles 
docks 
the new arrivals are the last of thousands who boarded five 
ferries last week for western europe the albanians had sought 
refuge from the hardline communist regime in their homeland by 
fleeing to western embassies in tirana the albanian capital 
president ramiz alias regime the last bastion of orthodox 
communism in eastern europe allowed the refugees to leave 
hundreds of ethnic albanians living in france and belgium lined 
the docks of marseille sunday to welcome the refugees singing the 
traditional albanian national anthem around the flag as the 
ferry pulled into port 
for me this is a new birth said albert aziri an ethnic 
albanian from yugoslavia who came to france in 1953 im going to 
see my people people who have the same blood as me 
about 100 red cross doctors nurses and other workers took 
charge of the 544 refugees including 63 children after they left 
the ferry to begin a new life 
asked what was wrong with his homeland one of the refugees 
arian cipa replied simply no freedom no money no future 
i know it wont be easy for me in france but i hope to 
succeed i wont go back to albania until the communists are 
gone said cipa a geological engineer 
cipa was among those who took refuge in the french embassy in 
tirana the albanian capital for eight days before a unmediated 
settlement allowed thousands of albanians in foreign embassies to 
leave for the west 
few of the refugees carried substantial luggage many wore only 
plain tshirts poorly fitting trousers and sandals 
bernard kouchner secretary of state for humanitarian action 
escorted the albanians to special trains bound for three reception 
centers near paris and one in southwestern france at the centers 
fresh clothes soap and toothpaste await the refugees 
they will be given medical examinations french lessons and 
instruction in the basics of the french social security system 
the refugees also will be given temporary residence permits and 
have the right to apply for political asylum 
a 25yearold refugee who identified himself only as afrim said 
albanian authorities had prevented his wife and young son from 
boarding the orient star 
i hope there wont be any reprisals against them he said 
expressing hope they would be allowed to join him in france 
the ferry had originally been scheduled to arrive on saturday 
coinciding with celebrations of bastille day the national holiday 
marking the start of the french revolution against tyranny 
the arrival was delayed after a 21yearold pregnant woman had 
to be taken off the ship in italy with an unspecified ailment 
many of the expatriate albanians on the docks sunday back the 
pretender to albanias throne leka i red flags bearing the 
doubleheaded eagle of the monarchy deposed in 1939 by an italian 
invasion fluttered under blazing summer skies until a french 
official ordered them taken down 
francois filliatre the ports assistant prefect told the 
monarchists to take down the flags half an hour before the ship 
arrived his assistants distributed french flags 
its france who welcomes them and only the french flag should 
be present filliatre told an aide to leka hylle spahija 
the monarchists grumbled but complied 
riot police prevented the ethnic albanians from embracing the 
new arrivals only a few expatriates who spoke good french were 
able to talk their way past the police cordon to greet the refugees 
earlier sunday another 76 albanians flashed the v for 
victory sign when they arrived in turkey on a governmentsponsored 
flight from tirana 
some of the refugees arriving in turkey said they had heard 
reports that about 6000 people staged a prodemocracy 
demonstration in the northern albanian city of shkoder on friday 
and seven protesters were killed in a clash with soldiers the 
report could not be independently confirmed 
about 4500 albanians were evacuated in a boatlift across the 
adriatic sea to brindisi italy on friday some remained in italy 
and 544 traveled on the frenchchartered yugoslav ferry orient star 
to marseille 
more than 3000 of the albanians who had sought refuge in the 
west german embassy traveled by train to west germany it was 
unclear how many wanted to stay in west germany or eventually go to 
the united states or other countries 
also saturday 56 albanians from the polish embassy in tirana 
were flown to warsaw another 39 who sought refuge in the hungarian 
embassy were flown to budapest five others from the bulgarian 
embassy traveled to sofia 
on saturday night two albanians fled to yugoslavia raising to 
15 the number of albanians who have illegally crossed the yugoslav 
border in the past week the state tanjug news agency reported 
the refugees began crowding into the embassies in tirana two 
weeks ago seeking to flee albania which has resisted the kinds of 
sweeping democratic reforms that have radically altered other east 
european countries 
refugees said albanians rushed the embassies after hearing that 
a family that had been in the italian embassy since 1985 was 
leaving the country

after weeks of testimony about how she and her 
late husband stole millions to buy skyscrapers and jewelry imelda 
marcos thought the jurors who acquitted her deserved to be shown 
some appreciation 
drawing on her experience as the first lady in manila she threw 
a party 
it featured filipino food and entertainment including mrs 
marcos own soprano rendering of god bless america 
ten of the 12 jurors who on july 2 acquitted mrs marcos and her 
codefendant saudi arabian financier adnan khashoggi attended the 
saturday afternoon affair at mrs marcos penthouse on manhattans 
east side 
the 100plus guests also included court personnel and friends 
and relatives who had sat every day in the courtroom lending moral 
support to mrs marcos as the government tried to prove her and 
khashoggi guilty of fraud and obstructing justice 
khashoggi stayed only briefly he said he was flying later to 
saudi arabia to make a long delayed visit to islams holy shrines 
in mecca 
since the trial several jurors have said they felt the 
governments case was confused and failed to show that mrs marcos 
had direct knowledge of the financial dealings of her late husband 
former president ferdinand marcos 
they also have said they doubted some key witnesses who claimed 
khashoggi had falsified documents to help the marcoses conceal 
their ownership of four new york buildings and artwork bought with 
the allegedly stolen money 
some of the jurors brought family members to the party 
its just a gathering of friends said exjuror luellen 
white a subway worker who left carrying a decorated cake 
others departed with bouquets of flowers 
mrs marcos said during the party that she has been ordered by 
the us justice department to face grand jury questioning in 
another criminal proceeding one involving a lawsuit by the current

seven bombs exploded in this 
ethnically troubled city sunday killing at least 43 people and 
injuring scores officials said 
six of the blasts occurred within 10 minutes of each other in 
different areas of the city police said those bombs killed 33 
people and injured 110 hospital officials said 
the explosives were placed at residential areas a market and a 
bus stop hospital officials said they feared the death toll would 
rise pakistans staterun news agency however said only 12 
people died in the six bombings 
the discrepancy in the casualties was not immediately explained 
but the staterun news agency associated press of pakistan 
usually reports a lower death toll than hospital and police sources 
meanwhile about an hour later a seventh bomb ripped through 
the secondclass coach of a southbound train minutes after it left 
hyderabad the news agency said it reported 10 dead and 15 injured 
in that bombing 
no one claimed responsibility for the bombings but police said 
they suspected sindh nationalists demanding greater autonomy from 
pakistan 
the sindh nationalists who control most of the countryside 
regularly clash with members of the mohajir qami movement which 
represents indian immigrants who came to pakistan following 
partition of the subcontinent in 1947 
the mohajirs want to be recognized as a fifth ethnic nationality 
sindh nationalists had called a oneday strike sunday to protest 
the arrest several weeks ago of qada magsi a sindhi activist 
charged with inciting violence 
most rival mohajirs who control hyderabad a bitterly divided 
city of 3 million refused to honor the strike call police 
speculated the refusal prompted the bombings 
meanwhile witnesses in hyderabad said troops opened fire on 
mourners who had gathered outside a local hospital where many of 
the dead were taken 
three people were killed in the firing according to several 
witness accounts other witnesses reported snipers in vehicles 
opened fire on panicked crowds fleeing the bomb sites 
in the past two months hundreds of people have been killed in 
hyderabad and pakistans southern port city of karachi 100 miles 
south the deaths have been blamed on bitter ethnic rivalry between 
sindh nationalists and the indian immigrants 
prime minister benazir bhutto earlier acknowledged the sindh 
state government headed by her pakistans peoples party has not 
done enough to stop the rising violence in her home province 
the mohajir movement broke ranks with ms bhutto in november 
claiming her populist pakistan peoples party backed off promises 
the movement which controls 14 seats in the national assembly 
aligned itself with ms bhuttos opposition the move prompted a 
noconfidence vote which she narrowly survived 
on may 27 after weeks of killings ms bhutto deployed the army 
in both hyderabad and karachi thousands of police and soldiers now 
patrol the cities 
but the army has also become openly critical of ms bhutto 
claiming she has done little to defuse tensions and open talks 
some quarters of the military reportedly want greater powers in 
sindh something ms bhutto has resisted

about 125000 people 
attended an air show billed as a reenactment of the invasion of 
panama but the military stung by criticism of insensitivity 
downplayed the event 
the early press release for the bases 50th anniversary 
celebration promised a reenactment of the invasion of panama 
with the actual aircraft air crews and soldiers who were there 
participating 
but capt john litton denied saturdays event was a 
reenactment that was just something that got overemphasized in 
a news release he said 
still many of those who oohed and aahed the air show aerobatics 
at the oldest air force base in the pacific northwest said they 
were drawn by word they would get some of the sound and fury of the 
dec 20 invasion 
i think its appropriate for them to recreate the panama 
invasion said jean smith a tacoma grandmother joined by three 
of her 18 grandchildren this way you get a chance to find out 
exactly what goes on to see it for yourself 
war is war and thats a fact of life said henry stahl who 
brought his son a member of the air force rotc to the show if 
the military does a good job i think they should let the people 
see 
fighter planes roared overhead at 600 mph and bombers and 
helicopters swooped low on mock strafing runs paratroopers bailed 
out of a c141 
the show did include some troops who participated in the panama 
invasion said bob rosenburgh a civilian fort lewis spokesman 
officials said they received some criticism and accusations of 
an insensitivity to the loss of life in the invasion and overthrow 
of gen manuel noriega 
somebody on base overhyped the event insisted col mike 
mccarthy base commander as soon as i heard about it i said 
its a mistake were not doing panama ii 
we got a lot of flak about it said sgt randy mitchell 
it doesnt make sense to me the public was overwhelmingly behind 
the panama operation but now its a sensitive subject like 
vietnam 
thousands of us combat troops raided panama in december to 
oust and arrest noriega and install as president guillermo endara 
who had lost may elections that were widely described as fraudulent 
the invasion ultimately cost the lives of 220 civilians and at 
least 300 soldiers 23 of whom were american according to the 
pentagon

tens of thousands of people marched to the kremlin 
walls on sunday to protest communist party control of the 
government the army and the kgb and to demand greater democracy in 
the soviet union 
the protest came just two days after the party concluded a 
historic congress in which president mikhail s gorbachev 
consolidated his control of the center but lost some of the partys 
bestknown radical reformers who quit 
the march took place despite a nearly constant rain the slogans 
were graphic communist worms this corpse wont feed you 
anymore said one poster a woman hoisted a pair of shoes worn 
into tatters and labeled slave of the party another banner 
said communist party onto the trash heap of history 
every communist to his own mausoleum read one poster a 
reference to the mausoleum of soviet founder vladimir lenin just a 
few hundred yards away many soviet citizens still treat lenin as a 
veritable god and thousands file through his crypt every day to 
pay homage to his mummified body 
the protesters huddled under a sea of umbrellas hoisted sodden 
redwhiteandblue flags of prerevolutionary russia and the black 
flag of anarchist groups 
police used trucks to block entrances to red square and the 
protesters ended their march in adjacent manezh square along one 
wall of the kremlin fortress 
a police officer and local television station estimated the 
crowd at 50000 while an organizer announced that 400000 people 
marched western correspondents estimated the crowd at between 
40000 and 100000 
the rain apparently kept the size of the crowd down although 
the rally had been advertised in moscow newspapers and on radio 
stations 
in an announcement saturday the evening moscow newspaper said 
the rally was expected to be the largest joint action of 
democratic forces of moscow since feb 25 
on that date a crowd estimated at between 100000 and 500000 
marched to demand democratic reform on feb 4 about 200000 
demonstrators demanded an end to the communist partys monopoly on 
power 
but sundays protest marked the first time a large crowd had 
demonstrated such clear sentiments denouncing the entire communist 
system 
the crowd cheered and waved their banners when a speaker 
mentioned the names of reformers who quit the party last week 
russian federation president boris yeltsin moscow mayor gavriil 
popov and leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak 
the protesters raised their hands at the end of the rally to 
show their approval of a resolution calling for all aware 
communists to quit the party which now claims 19 million members 
people poured in from side streets as the marchers passed along 
the rainswept krimsky bridge over the moscow river and through the 
garden ring road closed to traffic by police 
one woman wore a wooden toilet seat around her neck and labeled 
it polozkov after ivan polozkov the hardline leader of the 
communist party in the russian republic 
organizers of the march included the moscow voters club the 
radical reform groups democratic platform and democratic russia 
and an organization of reformminded police and military officers 
named shield 
in leaflets announcing the rally they had called for the 
communists to disband their party cells in the army and kgb and to 
accept a coalition government 
that echoes the calls of reformers who thursday announced at the 
congress they were quitting the communist party yeltsin has wide 
support among the nations working class especially the restive 
miners 
democratic platform leader vladimir lysenko said soviet coal 
miners who staged a oneday strike last week to demand the 
resignation of prime minister nikolai ryzhkov called for a second 
strike in september that strike would continue until the prime 
minister steps down he said 
the crowd broke into shouts of resign resign and shook 
their fists 
at the end of the congress the party announced a new structure 
for its ruling politburo that will no longer include such 
government officials as the prime minister the foreign minister 
the kgb chief and the defense minister 
but radical reformers say that does not touch the foundation of 
communist party power in the soviet union 
several proyeltsin banners were visible in the crowd 
one marcher advised gorbachev to give up on his comrades in the 
party and expressed her support for yeltsin 
gorbachev has done all he could do with the party said anna 
balykova a woman in her 40s who came to the protest with her son 
he has no more possibilities 
of yeltsin she said i pin all my hopes on him

a faction of the social democratic party a 
centrist group whose dissolution was announced last month said 
sunday they wont let their party die 
members who are seeking to keep the 9yearold party alive said 
they had overturned last months decision by founder david owen and 
other party leaders to dissolve the social democrats 
members of the partys national committee who refused to accept 
the dissolution said they took legal advice and decided that the 
disbandment violated the partys constitution 
we have formally rescinded the decision and the party again 
exists said john martin a member of the national committee 
however it was not clear how much support his faction could 
muster to keep the party alive 
the partys national committee had voted 175 on june 3 to 
suspend its constitution and disband 
at the time owen cited the partys declining membership which 
had collapsed to 6200 from a peak of 68000 soon after the social 
democrats were founded in january 1981 
owen is one of only three legislators the party has in the 
650member house of commons the three will continue to hold their 
seats as independent social democrats 
owens decision to pull out was seen as the end of the party 
but martin said he would ask the partys parliamentary candidates 
to remain on board to prepare for the next election which must be 
held by mid1992 
owen and three other former cabinet ministers broke with the 
labor party in 1981 to offer voters a centrist alternative to the 
conservative party and thenincreasingly leftist laborites 
the social democrats had hoped to supplant labor as the main 
challenger to the conservatives who are led by prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
but labor led by neil kinnock has abandoned its support for 
unilateral nuclear disarmament and unveiled a more centrist 
platform this year recent polls show it leads the conservatives 
 
the social democrats enjoyed their biggest electoral success 
when they joined with the longerestablished liberals under the 
name alliance that group polled 26 percent of the national vote in 
the 1983 general election and 226 percent in 1987 
but because of britains winnertakeall electoral system it 
never won more than a handful of parliamentary seats 
after winning only 22 of the 650 parliamentary districts in 
1987 a majority of the membership of the two parties agreed to 
merge as the social and liberal democrats 
owen and loyal supporters opposed to the merger remaining 
social democrats 
last month owen said he had no plans for now to rejoin the 
labor party he served as foreign minister from 197779 under a 
labor government and was once seen as a potential prime minister

a 9yearold who strayed from his father 
drowned in a pond 50 feet from a hospital where his mother was 
comforting a sick baby sister police said 
the body of darren shiwcharan was pulled from the pond in front 
of centurion hospitals of carrollwood by hillsborough county 
sheriffs divers saturday morning said sheriffs spokesman jack 
espinosa 
the boy apparently drowned in the 5footdeep pond while his 
father and another sister dozed inside the familys station wagon 
in a parking lot espinosa said 
my eyes just closed a second and the next thing i know he was 
gone said the father sewdat shiwcharan 39 i thought he had 
fallen asleep i ran to the emergency room but he wasnt there 
the shiwcharans brought their 6monthold daughter to the 
hospital friday night because she had a high fever 
we had to wait for 45 minutes and there wasnt anybody else 
there they were working on he said finally they took her and 
my wife into the emergency room 
darren was crying because he wanted to be with his mother i 
told them that they got a security guard and kicked us out 
but hospital officials said the father was asked to stay in a 
waiting room only after he verbally abused the emergency staff a 
security guard was called to the waiting room to watch the father 
who then went to his car with his son and 8yearold daughter said 
hospital administrator bill chambers 
chambers said shiwcharan was very upset about something foul 
language was being used by him in the emergency room 
the three went to the car about 1 am darren apparently got out 
at about about 20 minutes later chambers said a couple leaving 
the hospital at the time said later that they saw the boy heading 
toward nearby dale mabry highway 
a search of the hospital and its grounds began when the father 
discovered the boy missing it ended just before daybreak when 
divers found the boys body 
the parents are natives of guyana and moved to tampa two years 
ago so the husband could take a job as a mechanic 
if they had allowed the kids to go in the hospital and stay 
with me this would not have happened said the mother sabitree 
shiwcharan 29 
chambers disagreed 
we were taking care of who we were supposed to be taking care 
of the baby girl he said 
the infant was treated and released

thousands of people flocked to downtown 
milwaukee sunday to enjoy the annual great circus parade despite 
threats by a radical alderman who had planned a demonstration to 
protest innercity problems 
alderman michael mcgee who has organized a black militia and 
threatened violence in coming years if better jobs and housing are 
not provided for his constitutents told parade sponsors last week 
that children should stay away from the parade because matters 
could get ugly 
but faced with a court restraining order mcgee called off the 
threat and there were no protests at the parade which took place 
under overcast skies and occasional drizzle 
still you couldnt help but be nervous and think about it 
said jeff evans of waukesha its too bad that people were 
stirring up all this trouble 
the parade included elephants and other circus animals actor 
ernest borgnine was one of the costumed clowns it also featured 
about 75 brightly painted carved wooden wagons from the state 
historical societys museum collection 
the wagons are hauled annually by train to milwaukee from the 
societys circus world museum in baraboo where the ringling 
brothers organized their original road show at the family farm in 
the 19th century 
police traditionally say 500000 watch the parade but 
acknowledge it is mathematically unlikely that many people could be 
accommodated along a fourmile route no other attendance figure is 
officially issued

the 15 billion hubble space telescope is not a 
total loss despite the blurring of its giant eye by a misshapen 
mirror a scientist told a convention of astronomers on sunday 
eric chaisson an adjunct professor of physics at johns hopkins 
university said the troubled telescope still can provide 
scientists with information 
we can view bright objects with decent resolution but we 
wont be able to see the faintest objects in the universe 
chaisson said that frankly is what the hubble had made its 
name on that is compromised 
hubbles biggest mission was to peer into the universes distant 
corners 
the telescope launched april 25 has a focusing flaw that has 
sharply reduced its usefulness because of an error in the grinding 
and polishing of the hubbles main mirrors it cannot capture 
crisp clean pictures of distant stars 
an investigation into the problem is continuing the head of the 
nasa probe dr lew allen told congress last week that it may take 
more than six months to pinpoint the error in the telescope 
production 
chaisson is a senior scientist at the space telescope science 
institute in baltimore the group charged with overseeing hubbles 
scientific explorations 
when the convention of the astronomical society of the pacific 
was organized chaisson was slated to speak about hubbles early 
findings instead he found himself focusing on the hubbles woes 
in his presentation before several hundred astronomers 
youre going to have to stretch your imagination a little 
bit chaisson said there is a problem clearly we cant get 
around that but hubble is not broken there is still a lot of 
exciting science to come out of it 
chaisson showed a slide of the constellation orion taken by 
hubble that had slightly greater clarity than one taken from 
groudbased telescope 
hubble already shows starfields better than any groundbased 
telescope he said 
hubble had been expected to far surpass the capabilities of 
observatory telescopes which must peer up at the stars through 
earths atmosphere 
with its focusing problem hubble will be unable to pick out 
distant stars to determine the size of the universe chaisson said 
nor will it be able to search the heavens for objects invisible 
to groundbased telescopes like planets in other solar systems or 
extremely distant stellar objects he said 
chaisson held out hope that when replacement instruments are 
finally installed in 1993 hubble will be able to complete much of 
its mission over its planned 15year lifetime

indians locked in a land dispute with 
authorities reversed themselves sunday and kept up their blockade 
of a bridge into montreal 
the mohawks said they decided not to lift the blockade as 
promised because authorities had reneged on a promise to reduce a 
police contingent in oka about 20 miles west of montreal 
the town was the scene of a shootout wednesday between 
authorities and mohawks manning barricades to block the expansion 
of a golf course the indians say the expansion would occur on 
their ancestral land 
one police officer was killed in the confrontation but it is 
not clear if he was shot by mohawks or fellow officers 
talks aimed at ending the oka standoff between armed mohawks and 
police continued sunday quebec province was represented by native 
affairs minister john ciaccia 
he said sunday he believed that the two sides were close to 
patching up their agreement of the night before 
we have obtained the cooperation of quebec police said 
ciaccia 
they have reduced the number of personnel however not in 
such a way as to affect our own security he said he refused to 
say how many of the estimated 1000 police officers at oka have 
pulled out 
the mohawks of the kahnawake reserve blocked the mercier bridge 
on wednesday in sympathy with the oka indians the bridge blockade 
enraged some residents who faced massive traffic jams trying to 
get into montreal from the south shore of the st lawrence river by 
alternate routes 
on saturday evening a mob of about 2000 residents gathered at 
the boundary of the kahnawake reserve and shouted racist slurs at 
the natives at one point they burned a dummy bearing the words 
non aux warriors or no to the warriors they also chanted 
war whoops danced and waved quebec flags 
the crowd dispersed only after ciaccia emerged from six hours of 
talks with native negotiators in oka and promised the bridge 
blockage would be lifted he said provincial authorities would make 
a significant reduction in their oka police contingent in 
exchange 
but in a statement released sunday the mohawk council of 
kahnawake said the deal was off because police forces had been 
boosted both at oka and near the mercier bridge 
on sunday a crowd of about 500 people gathered again at the 
bridge the afternoon started quietly as people carrying binoculars 
and potato chips installed their folding lawn chairs near police 
barricades to watch developments 
later the crowd became restive and cheered as an effigy of a 
mohawk carrying a bow and arrow was hung from a lamppost 
one nearby resident irene obrienneil was scratched and 
punched by two women when she arrived wearing an indian beadwork 
collar 
im all for the indians she said clutching a tuft of hair 
she pulled from one of her attackers its their land im 
inconvenienced like everybody else at this barricade but they have 
rights 
alain lauzier a truck driver had other views what i want to 
know is what happens the day after the bridge is opened and we 
drive through kahnawake are my wife and kids going to be faced 
with guns from these guys 
meanwhile in oka a town of 3000 police and the indians from 
the reservation there stared at each other across their own sets of 
barricades 
about 1000 police officers blocked access to the town police 
also prevented anyone from taking food into the mohawkoccupied 
area 
also sunday gilles landreville acting mayor of oka said we 
dont think its normal that a minister goes over there and 
negotiates with people who have committed criminal acts he said 
he was referring to the negotiations between ciaccia and mohawk 
representatives 
we are asking that they give up their arms and then we can 
start negotiating 
in calgary on saturday don mazankowski the national 
governments deputy prime minister said ottawa is ready to 
establish a committee to try to settle the dispute if blockades are 
lifted and guns laid down

cuban police violated the grounds of 
spains embassy in havana by chasing an asylumseeker into the 
compound and hauling him away the foreign ministry said sunday 
also sunday the official mexican news agency reported that a 
group of 30 czechoslovak diplomats and dependents had left havana 
apparently as a result of tensions over cuban refugees at the 
czechoslovak embassy 
three other cubans have taken refuge in the spains embassy and 
12 cubans are at the czechoslovak embassy 
the spanish ambassador to havana antonio serrano lodged a 
protest with cuban foreign minister isidoro malmierca after cuban 
police jumped over the iron gate to the spanish embassy on friday 
while pursuing a young cuban the police detained the man 
in his reply malmierca said there had been no intention of 
violating the embassy and offered assurances that there would be no 
repeat of such actions said the spanish foreign ministry 
spokesman juan lena 
malmierca said the chase had begun outside the embassy grounds 
lena said the spanish government had asked cuban authorities not 
to take reprisals against the young man detained on the embassy 
grounds 
he said an undetermined number of spanish policemen would be 
sent to havana to protect the embassy 
lena reiterated that spain would not hand over the three cubans 
who sought refuge at the spanish embassy last week he said his 
country was seeking to arrange their departure for spain or a third 
country 
the spanish news agency efe said cubas communist leader fidel 
castro had guaranteed the security of foreign embassies in cuba 
during a talk with foreign reporters at a bastille day reception 
saturday at the french embassy 
however castro was quoted by efe as saying the refugees in the 
spanish and czechoslovak embassies were antisocial elements 
without any patriotic motivation 
on saturday the czechoslovak foreign ministry in prague said 
two of the 14 cubans who sought refuge at its embassy in havana had 
left the mission one cuban left without notifying the embassy 
staff and the other asked to leave without giving any explanation 
the influx of asylumseekers has heightened tensions between 
cuba and czechoslovakia which were close allies before last falls 
democratic upheaval toppled pragues hardline communist leaders 
castro has resisted the reforms sweeping eastern europe and the 
soviet union sticking to his orthodox marxist policies 
the mexican news agency notimex did not say when the 30 
czechoslovak diplomats and dependents left the country it quoted 
unidentified european diplomatic sources as saying they were among 
a group of about 70 czechoslovak embassy personnel and family 
members who had been warned to leave the country 
the notimex dispatch from havana monitored in mexico did not 
give details about the warning other than to say the czechoslovaks 
had received a recommendation to leave the country

richard nixon doesnt expect the news media 
ever to love him but the man who resigned the presidency in 
disgrace thinks the public will judge him more kindly once people 
tour his new library 
the richard m nixon presidential library and birthplace will be 
dedicated thursday in yorba linda in a ceremony to be attended by 
president bush and former presidents reagan ford and nixon himself 
the gathering is also expected to include the largest reunion of 
nixon administration officials since the expresidents second 
inauguration in 1972 
on the eve of the celebration nixon told the los angeles times 
he believes the library will help remove much of the taint of the 
watergate scancal that resulted in his resigning in disgrace 
over time as their interest fades and if the public 
continues to visit the nixon museum i would think that all the 
events covered will be seen in a more objective perspective 
nixon commented 
the presidents written remarks in answer to questions 
submitted by the times were published sunday 
nixon said the news media area are still obsessed with finding a 
sinister purpose in his activities historians are too liberal ever 
to be sympathetic to his cause he said 
but he doesnt waste time worrying about his political 
legacy nixon said nor does he give any thought to my socalled 
political rehabilitation 
nixon 77 resigned office in 1974 amid allegations he helped 
cover up a botched political burglary of democratic party 
headquarters in the watergate apartment complex in washington a 
pardon from ford kept nixon from facing any possible charges 
library officials say the 21 million complex will have an 
extensive watergate section along with many other exhibits showing 
the more positive aspects of nixons career 
the exhibits will showcase nixons foreign policy triumphs and 
the adoption of the clean air act and creation of the environmental 
protection agency during his administration

a letter from a secret police captain 
convicted in the 1984 murder of a prosolidarity priest has hinted 
that the slaying was not a renegade act but officially sanctioned 
by senior government officials 
the former secret police officer grzegorz piotrowski is 
serving a lengthy prison sentence for his role in the october 1984 
murder of the rev jerzy popieluszko the priest was an outspoken 
supporter of the thenoutlawed solidarity labor union and his 
slaying shocked the country 
the text of a letter from piotrowski to former interior minister 
gen czeslaw kiszczak was published friday in the prosolidarity 
newspaper gazeta wyborcza it bore no date but was apparently 
written several years ago 
piotrowski and three other secret police officers were quickly 
arrested tried and sentenced for the killing but many poles 
viewed the proceedings as a coverup to prevent the implication of 
more senior officials in his letter piotrowski implicates senior 
officials in the interior ministry 
gazeta wyborcza cautioned its readers that piotrowskis 
allegations had not been independently verified and should be 
treated with caution because piotrowski might not be credible 
piotrowski was quoted as saying he was not sure if his letter 
ever reached kiszczak who headed the interior ministry at the time 
of the slaying kiszczak played a major role in the 1989 
negotiations that led to the establishment of a solidarityled 
government he was dismissed as interior minister earlier this 
month 
during his trial prosecutors maintained that piotrowski was the 
ringleader in the priests killing and had committed the crime at 
the instigation of his direct superior officer interior ministry 
col adam pietruszka 
in his letter piotrowski wrote general our actions were not 
an act of lawlessness but an act of devotion and subordination to 
the service and you know this 
in the letter in which he appears to be pleading for better 
treatment in prison piotrowski added that he kept silent during 
his trial out of a feeling of loyalty to the security service and 
not because of persuasion and promises made by a deputy to 
kiszczak 
piotrowski was originally sentenced in february 1985 to 25 years 
in prison but his sentence was reduced to 15 years in december 
1987 
convicted with piotrowski were his subordinates two secret 
police lieutenants and his supervisor pietruszka who did not 
take part in the actual killing but was convicted of instigating 
the crime 
in his letter piotrowski wrote before the court i took on 
myself the entire weight a silence which could have cost me my 
life 
he wrote that the court was not informed that the security 
service had routinely violated the law and constitution by 
harassing and eavesdropping on church figures 
the force carried out similar tasks very often getting awards 
and praise for them even from the leadership of the interior 
ministry piotrowski said

plo chairman yasser arafat on sunday 
rejected us demands to discipline a guerrilla leader responsible 
for an attempted seaborne raid on isrel 
arafat made his remarks during a meeting at the arab leagues 
tunis headquarters of foreign ministers and delegates from the 21 
member countries the meeting was called to consider the fallout 
from the recent break in the dialogue between the united states and 
the palestine liberation organization 
washington said it would not resume the dialogue with the plo 
unless the organization renounced the seaborne raid and took action 
against abul abbas his palestinian guerrilla group a plo faction 
claimed responsibility for the may 30 assault foiled by israeli 
forces 
its out of the question for the plo to bend itself to these 
conditions arafat told the closeddoor session according to 
participants in the meeting 
the plo chairman also accused the united states of supporting 
israel without limit participants said 
arafat spoke after the plos chief delegate to the arab league 
mahmoud abbas urged concrete and efficient measures to protect 
arab interests following the suspension of the dialogue mahmoud 
abbas is not related to abul abbas 
the delegate did not define what form such measures to protect 
arab interests would take but he urged arab countries to prepare a 
response if israel attacks either iraq or libya 
the meeting started late sunday and was likely to stretch into 
monday observers said the arab league representatives were also 
considering problems caused by the massive immigration of soviet 
jews to israel 
league sources said the plo wants the arab countries to condemn 
president bushs decision to break off the us dialogue with the 
plo 
the plo wants the united states to resume the dialogue begun in 
december 1988 after arafat renounced terrorism and backed the right 
of israel to exist 
earlier sunday the plo indefinitely postponed a meeting of its 
central council scheduled for wednesday in baghdad iraq the 
meeting had been called to discuss the suspended dialogue with the 
united states 
the meeting would also have discussed how to respond to the new 
rightwing israeli government headed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
the plos representative to iraq azzam ahmed said the meeting 
was called off to allow for more consultations he said no new 
date had been set for the meeting 
bush severed the dialogue with the plo following the foiled 
seaborne raid on a civilianfilled beach that was carried out by 
abul abbas palestine liberation front one of nine factions under 
the umbrella of the plo 
in the raid four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured there 
were no israeli casualties 
washington has demanded that abul abbas be dismissed from the 
plos executive committee for his role in the attack 
the plo serves as an umbrella organization for guerrilla 
factions that sometimes fight among themselves and launch 
independent attacks on israeli targets the largest group is 
arafats mainstream fatah

associated press correspondent nate thayer spent 
five weeks with cambodian guerrillas deep inside cambodia the 
first western journalist to make such a trip during the 11yearold 
war this is his report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
national highway 6 cambodia ap guerrillas have seized 
hundreds of villages and military positions in northern cambodia 
forcing the army to fall back and defend besieged provincial 
capitals 
evidence of the most significant guerrilla gains in more than 11 
years of fighting was clear during a fiveweek trip with the 
insurgents that covered 450 miles 
the threeparty guerrilla coalition which includes the 
communist khmer rouge controls large areas of the north and 
northwest the insurgents are shelling and launching commando raids 
on key provincial capitals 
senior guerrilla commanders say the attacks are in preparation 
for fullscale assaults on the cities of kompong thom and siem 
reap and the ancient temples of angkor near siem reap 
during the trip hundreds of government artillery shells and 
rockets landed daily shaking the paddies of a beautiful 
ricegrowing region engulfed by war 
debris from bridges blown up by guerrillas littered highways 
the jungle fighters set up ambushes to attack convoys trying to 
resupply forward government outposts defending the major urban 
areas 
guerrilla medics trained in china ran field hospitals dressing 
wounds and amputating limbs 
as the guerrillas advance the world seeks a political solution 
and worries that the khmer rouge whose bloody regime was 
overthrown by a vietnamese invasion in december 1978 may regain 
power more than a million cambodians were killed or died of 
starvation during 3 years of khmer rouge rule 
khmer rouge commanders expressed confidence they would capture 
phnom penh the cambodian capital they used maps to illustrate 
encirclement from the north south and west similar to the 
strategy in 1975 when the khmer rouge defeated the usbacked 
government of president lon nol 
the trip with an escort of guerrillas loyal to prince norodom 
sihanouk leader of the coalition began on the thai border and 
covered three northern provinces included was a 30mile stretch of 
national highway 6 a government lifeline to outlying provinces 
now in guerrilla hands 
it provided the first independent confirmation of the guerillas 
claims that they have advanced deep inside the country 
thousands of sihanouks guerrillas were seen lounging in 
villages shopping in bustling markets and manning lines around 
kompong thom which they said was their next target 
kompong thom a strategic crossroads city is 90 miles north of 
phnom penh 
in separate attacks the khmer rouge was advancing toward siem 
reap 200 miles northwest of phnom penh and was within reach of 
the angkor temples 
we have taken all the positions around siem reap isolating 
the town said ta pok a khmer rouge brigade commander 
interviewed at his jungle base north of the city 
we are winning everywhere we are fighting said col khan 
savoeun a commander of forces loyal to sihanouk cambodias former 
ruler at headquarters in stoeung the de facto capital of what the 
sihanoukists call their liberated zone 
in the wars early stages most guerrillas were in bases along 
the thai border and obtaining weapons from china was easy given 
thailands support for the insurgents 
now the lines have shifted far from the frontier the sihanouk 
forces and the khmer rouge have forged a network of thousands of 
miles of secret roads and trails into the interior 
convoys of trucks oxcarts and thousands of civilian supporters 
were seen daily moving supplies from jungle caches to forward areas 
convoys of chinesesupplied trucks and captured government 
vehicles moved freely along sections of provincial highways that 
were under government control less than a year ago 
more than 50000 insurgents are fighting an army that has 
superior firepower but is mostly conscripts reported to be poorly 
trained the guerrilla groups led by sihanouk and son sann are 
noncommunist but the khmer rouge is by far the strongest 
the war took a favorable turn for the guerrillas last fall when 
vietnam withdrew most of its soldiers leaving the forces of 
premier hun sen to face the battletested guerrillas alone 
sometimes i think hun sen is stupid you know we dont need to 
negotiate with him now said mit lot khmer rouge deputy division 
commander at a base 12 miles from the angkor wat ruins 
if they dont compromise they will lose everything at this 
rate the war will be over by the end of the year 
although the khmer rouge is the most powerful force in the 
coalition it seemed clear during the trip that the noncommunists 
had gained considerable support and scored significant military 
victories 
the khmer rouge has little public support because of its 
history and that hampers its effectiveness in more heavily 
populated areas 
sihanouks commanders described a raid by 400 commandos who 
briefly seized kompong thom in late june they destroyed military 
positions and tested the waters for what guerrilla field commanders 
said would be a fullscale attack on the provincial capital 
heavy weapons could be seen in place less than five miles from 
the city and rockets were being fired at kompong thom 
the sihanouk forces claim to control more than 700 towns and 
villages a major source of their strength appears to be wide 
public support for sihanouk revered by many as a godking during 
his reign 
around stoeng on highway 6 less than a 30minute drive from 
kompong thom noncommunists control the largest area of indochina 
since the americans left 15 years ago 
followers of sihanouk have trained hundreds of civilian 
administrators teachers and medical personnel and begun an 
aggressive effort to reestablish buddhism 
thousands of children were seen attending primary schools 
dozens of buddhist temples were being refurbished and others built 
while the sihanoukists and khmer rouge are in a loose coalition 
tension between the groups was evident 
for the time being we share common military goals with the 
khmer rouge but we are in full control here said col khan 
savoeun commander of the kompong thom area the khmer rouge 
understand strength and we are very strong in kompong thom

hunters bagged nearly 3000 prairie dogs in 
a weekend shootout and the gleeful organizers of the event said 
howls of protest from animal rights activists had done nothing but 
attract more business 
when the shoot was announced in april it drew criticism from 
gov roy romer and democratic rep ben nighthorse campbell but 
mayor john vanderpool and shoot organizer mike mehew told the pols 
to buzz off 
on sunday mehew said he was grateful for their attentions 
which drew additional hunters and news media to the event he said 
he planned to write thankyou notes to romer campbell and robin 
duxbury of the rocky mountain humane society 
shoot participants werent put off by the smattering of protest 
either 
all their noise does is bring the prairie dogs out of their 
holes to see whats doing on said terrye logan 32 of clyde 
texas one of three women competing in the event my brothers 
yesterday ended up laughing so hard they had to put their guns 
down 
the 106 shooters at the first top dog world championship prairie 
dog shoot slew a total of 2956 prairie dogs in the twoday event 
the top killers were local rancher earl reams and his partner 
randy calhoun who dispatched 112 prairie dogs to win two 
topofthe line kimber rifles 
more important to local merchants the event brought an economic 
boost to the neighboring western colorado towns of nucla and 
naturita which have been devastated by range droughts and a bust 
in uranium mining 
we did enough in four days to double what we do in an entire 
big game hunting season said beulah colcord owner of the 
yellow rock cafe in naturita and we couldnt be happier with the 
protesters they made the publicity that brought all these people 
in here 
among the popular kitschy items on sale were critter 
coffins sold at 2035 each by joe hale and rod gerken of hale 
amp gerken funeral home in naturita 
ive got this little office just fill of prairie dog caskets 
and we have about 150 orders hale said proceeds were going to 
needy families he said 
the hunters resting their rifles on car hoods or shooting from 
benches popped their shots off into a desolate plain scarred by 
the sixinch mounds and burrows of the prairie dogs 
more than 7000 in prizes was taken home by hunters who came 
from north carolina to california for the competition 
it was billed as a way of reducing the population of the 
foottall grayish brown rodents relatives of the squirrel 
ranchers say the prairie dogs carry bubonic plague and ruin fields 
that might be planted in oats cattle break their legs stumbling 
into the holes 
only about two dozen protesters were on hand saturday morning 
and the number dwindled over the weekend not surpisingly none of 
the picketers stuck around for the celebratory picnic sunday 
evening 
three protesters in their early 20s appeared sunday morning 
blowing whistles and holding signs 
if nothing else were bothering the mighty hunters said 
jon ellenbogen 24 i dont take their arguments about damage 
from prairie dogs if the prairie dogs are ruining it for the cows 
dont raise cows shooting them is not much of a philosophy 
shoot winner reams president of the west end cattlemens 
association said the contest had boosted local pride 
this is a rural community where we have guns and do a lot of 
shooting some places have theaters we have turkey shoots this is 
good for the town and now were on the map

a daredevil who went over niagara 
falls in a barrel in 1985 tried again sunday but low water stranded 
his barrel at the brink of the falls police said 
the barrel carrying dave munday 53 stopped a foot before the 
brink of the 176foot horseshoe falls on the canadian side of the 
niagara river police used a crane to fish the daredevil and his 
barrel out of the river rapids 
niagara parks police who patrol the park along the canadian 
side of the twin waterfalls said mundays barrel was dropped into 
the river about 660 feet upstream of the horseshoe falls about 440 
am 
the ontario hydro electric utility had been diverting half the 
rivers flow overnight to power its hydroelectric plant said 
police spokesman george bailey the low river level helped snag the 
barrel on the falls rocky ledge he said 
munday really doesnt know the river like a lot of people 
thought he did bailey said there was very little water going 
over the falls and he probably could have guessed that he would 
get stuck 
ive never been a religious man but something stopped it 
munday told the associated press sunday night from his home in 
caistor center ontario probably i would have been dead if it 
went over 
mundy said he was lying on his side inside the 650pound 
7footlong barrel when it became stuck he said part of the barrel 
actually hung over the edge of the falls 
if you tried it a thousand times you wouldnt be able to get 
it to do that again he said 
munday was the seventh person to successfully go over the falls 
in a vessel three others before him died 
after his 1985 trip munday told reporters anyone who would 
go over the falls twice would have to be crazy but since then 
he had boasted that he would do it again one day 
had he been successful sunday munday would have become the 
first person to survive two trips over the falls 
during sundays attempt the steel and foam barrel lodged on the 
riverbed a foot from the table rock tourist area at the brink of 
the falls police said 
two park constables were able to bring the barrel to a wall at 
the edge of the falls and secure it there while a crane was brought 
to the site the constables fashioned a sling and using long 
poles positioned the barrel so it could be lifted up and away from 
the brink 
the rescue took two hours and put two peoples lives in 
jeopardy bailey said 
when the barrel was lowered into the tourist area munday 
emerged and was charged with violating laws that prohibit river 
stunts he faces a fine of up to 10000 about 8500 in us 
dollars police kept mundays barrel 
after his first ride munday was fined the maximum 1000 for 
trespassing and 500 for the stunt itself in march the maximum 
fine was raised to 10000 to discourage such stunts bailey said 
last month a man who attempted to go over the falls in a kayak 
apparently lost his life in the stunt the battered kayak belonging 
to jessie sharp of ocoee tenn was found below the falls but 
his body has not been recovered

firefighters had nearly contained a 2075acre fire in central 
oregon sunday just as the battle began to intensify against a blaze 
in the eastern part of the state 
the second fire 20 miles southeast of john day in eastern 
oregon had consumed 300 acres by sunday said jim payne fire 
staff officer for the malheur national forest he said it was 
burning in subalpine fir and lodgepole pine 
temperatures in the 90s low humidity and light winds were

the failure of the hubble space telescope and 
grounding of the space shuttle fleet are shaking congressional 
confidence in the space program just as lawmakers search for ways 
to redirect defense spending to civilian science 
we were right on the edge of what all of us thought would be a 
new chapter at nasa said rep mike andrews dtexas now he 
says cost overruns and defects in the hubble telescope and shuttle 
program make the space agency look like just one more big 
bureaucracy 
and now the hubble you know theres new information about the 
hubble jay leno has disclosed that it is actually working 
perfectly but the universe is all blurry quipped sen al gore 
dtenn who conducted hearings on the telescope 
leno is a popular comedian who substitutes for johnny carson as 
host of the tonight show on nbctv 
reports indicate that the white house is preparing to name a 
panel of experts to review nasa operations in the wake of the 
embarrassing problems with the hubble and the shuttle program 
white house spokesman sean walsh said the bush administration is 
conducting a broad review of the space program 
many ideas are being tossed around he said in response to a 
saturday cbs news report that the panel of experts probably will be 
named this week 
walsh added however that the administration will probably 
steer away from a major shakeup at nasa and the new york times 
quoted unidentified administration officials in mondays editions 
as saying no decision has been made on naming an outside review 
panel and that such reports were premature and overblown 
andrews whose congressional district is home to thousands of 
nasa workers and other boosters say theres still widespread 
support in congress for space exploration 
two days after nasa revealed that the hubble was crippled by a 
defective mirror the house approved 143 billion for the agency 
in fiscal 1991 2 billion more than the current fiscal year 
theres little talk of any immediate cutbacks 
but the agencys big projects for the future are being looked at 
with much more skepticism than before those include a 50 billion 
system of weather satellites the 37 billion permanent space 
station and president bushs proposal to land a man on mars within 
30 years 
the worse kept secret in washington is that defense 
contractors who are out of work are now pushing space spending as a 
national priority said rep richard durbin dill a member of 
the house budget committee where else can they spend billions of 
taxpayers dollars on theory and dreams 
more than 300 billion in new space projects have been proposed 
for the next three decades but among ardent supporters in 
congress there is widespread reluctance to expand nasas role 
before an accounting is made for the problems in the current 
programs 
their plate is quite full and its a very stressful time for 
nasa whatever can go wrong is going wrong said rep bob 
traxler dmich chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the 
space and science budget 
rep bill green of new york the senior republican on that 
panel said a decision on pulling the plug on the space station 
project must be made soon or it could be too far along to kill 
traxler says its too early to tell whether the program already 
far over budget and undercapable should be scrapped for something 
more simple but he said congress is increasingly skeptical of big 
science projects and especially of the promises made by their 
backers 
the usual gambit for getting a big project approved is to come 
in with a low estimate get congress to sink money into it and 
then expect congress to keep spending as the estimates go up 
because so much money already is invested 
those days are gone traxler said 
andrews says nasas problems run too deeply for congress to 
solve without presidential leadership and hes critical of vice 
president quayle for not doing more to straighten out nasa from his 
post as chairman of the national space council 
i hope george bush doesnt just leave it up to dan quayle to 
lead us through this difficult time he said 
for supporters of the defense establishment one answer to 
nasas problems can be found by leaving a little of the peace 
dividend under pentagon control 
youre already getting a huge amount of that said sen sam 
nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
rep durbin in a speech friday seemed to be skeptical either 
way 
if the american taxpayers thought peace in the world meant an 
end to budgetary excesses of pentagon contractors the had their 
head in the clouds he said

for decades the sales tax in most states simply 
meant consumers had to pay a bit more money when they bought a car 
or a couch 
but the shift toward a servicebased economy has also brought 
changes in tax policy now when states are in a financial crunch 
they increasingly look to collect money each time a janitor mops a 
floor or even when an executive phones a lawyer for advice 
in massachusetts the state legislature recently passed a tax 
package that extends the sales tax to a broad range of services 
including accounting fees for businesses and athletic club 
memberships 
the move was a response to fiscal woes that over the last fiscal 
saw the state run up a deficit over 1 billion as its bond rating 
plummeted to the lowest ranking in the country 
while massachusetts is the latest state to consider taxing 
services some experts do not expect a rush to follow although a 
services tax may be tempting it also can be fraught with 
administrative headaches that means states probably will not take 
the step unless pushed by financial necessity 
talking about it is easier than implementing it said elaine 
leon director of taxpayer services for the department of revenue 
services in connecticut which last year widely expanded its 
services tax 
a handful of states tax some level of services but many others 
have attempted the move and failed 
florida enacted a wide range of service taxes in 1987 but 
repealed them before the end of the year observers however blame 
the repeal on a political firestorm that accompanied the tax 
package rather than administrative difficulties 
the sales tax generally dates to the great depression when many 
states looking for money applied a levy on the purchase of tangible 
property 
for most states the sales tax was set up at a time when the 
country was more of a manufacturingbased economy said stephen 
kidder the massachusetts commissioner of revenue thats what 
has shifted over time 
in fact some tax experts argue that many of the economic forces 
that prompted growth in the sales tax in the 1930s also exist in 
the 1990s making the taxation of services a stronger possibility 
nonetheless most states have been hesitant to move into the 
services tax reasons often cited include a fear that the tax will 
add costs to businesses which then will pass them along to 
consumers also critics say the tax can hurt competitiveness in 
individual states prompting some firms to locate elsewhere 
unlike cars or washing machines which are defined easily by 
their physical presence services have fuzzy boundaries and can be 
far less tangible 
for example connecticut taxes computer services a potentially 
broad sector and thus tried to tax hotel reservations since they 
rely on computers but the states supreme court decided last year 
that the tax should not apply because customers were paying for 
the reservations not the computer service leon said 
when asked how the state defines computer service leon said 
were still grasping with that 
also administering the tax becomes highly complex when levying 
transactions a multistate business has with another multistate 
firm 
roger feldman chairman of gaston amp snow a major boston law 
firm with offices around the country predicted massachusetts 
businesses would take their legal work outside the state to skirt 
the sales tax firms are likely to shift some of tasks to 
outofstate offices 
well try every legal means to avoid paying the tax feldman 
said 
tax experts say political inertia is a major factor working 
against service taxes 
for most politicians and taxpayers an old tax is a good 
tax said a report delivered last month to the federation of tax 
administrators a national group of state tax officials 
in substance this position argues that known evils are better 
than unknown evils the report said 
new mexico is one state without such worries its original sales 
tax from the depression included a tax on services said carolyn 
lindberg economic analyst with the new mexico taxation and revenue 
department 
as a result new mexico taxes most services excluding sales 
made by nonprofit institutions its accepted lindberg said 
though she added it comes as a shock to newcomers 
states that have tried more recently to adopt service taxes have 
used more of a laundry list approach identifying various services 
to be included but omitting others for example massachusetts 
plan exempts management consulting services even though accounting 
is included 
business and tax experts criticize this process saying it may 
meet political expediency but does not make economic sense 
everyone believes the future will have a different combination 
of taxes said james howell former chief economist at bank of 
boston but you cant draw it up in an arbitrary and pernicious 
way

an employee signs a waiver promising not 
to sue for age discrimination in return for a better severance 
package then turns around and sues anyway 
a sinking retailer tells a federal bankruptcy judge it needs to 
close a third of its stores and lay off 18000 employees to 
survive the judge rules that the retailer must negotiate with the 
workers on a severance package 
faced with increasingly complex labor laws and the need to trim 
work forces in a souring economy many companies are seeking legal 
advice on how to lay off workers lawyers say 
the advice is simple be careful said felix springer an 
attorney at day berry amp howard a hartford law firm that developed 
a seminar on how to lay off employees to satisfy a flood of 
corporate inquiries on the subject 
more than 120 corporate executives attended the seminar this 
spring in hartford and boston citing attorneyclient 
confidentiality the law firm wouldnt disclose the names of 
companies that sent representatives 
other law firms say they too are spending more time counseling 
corporate clients on steps they can take to reduce their work 
forces without opening themselves to wrongful termination or 
discrimination lawsuits 
its a big issue as the economy has turned sour its getting 
to be more and more of our practice said henry stewart a labor 
and employment lawyer at the boston firm palmer amp dodge 
new england is a focus of the trend because of its sagging 
economic fortunes and connecicut is a prime example its 
unemployment rate rose to 57 percent in april surpassing the 
national rate for the first time in 13 years 
nearly 30 percent of 480 companies that answered a recent survey 
by the connecticut business and industry association said they 
expect to reduce their work forces within the next three months 
springer said his firm advises managers to choose workers to be 
laid off based on objective criteria including job performance the 
value of their work to the company length of service and education 
level 
companies also are urged to offer employees assistance in 
finding new jobs as well as generous severance packages when 
possible he said 
workers who feel theyve been treated unfairly most commonly 
invoke two laws the federal age discrimination in employment act 
which covers those 40 and older and title 7 of the civil rights 
act of 1964 which prohibits employers from discriminating because 
of race religion sex or national origin 
but workers also are finding new and innovative ways to protect 
themselves 
more and more companies are asking employees to sign waivers 
promising not to sue for age discrimination in exchange for extra 
benefits usually an enhanced severance package 
that didnt stop two former employees from suing the cocacola 
bottling co of new york for age discrimination they claimed they 
were told they wouldnt receive an enhanced severance package after 
being let go unless they waived their right to sue under the age 
discrimination act 
the federal equal employment opportunity commission already 
concerned about such waivers joined the suit filed in us 
district court in bridgeport last year 
congress is considering legislation that would limit employers 
ability to offer extra benefits in exchange for an employee signing 
a waiver said paul brenner an eeoc attorney who specializes in 
age discrimination cases 
it has become a very serious problem that is that its 
cheaper to buy someone out with a waiver and then not have to worry 
about a lawsuit brenner said 
an estimated 18000 employees expected to lose their jobs when 
ames department stores inc closes 221 stores this summer recently 
won the right from a federal bankruptcy judge to negotiate with 
ames management on a severance package 
the move could have lasting impact analysts said bankruptcy 
proceedings could change dramatically if employees are made a party 
to such negotiations

the nations big three automakers open labor 
contract talks this week with the companies worried about 
declining profits and japanese competition and the union stressing 
job security 
the united auto workers union begins talks wednesday at general 
motors corp thursday at ford motor co and friday at chrysler 
corp the three national contracts covering more than 450000 auto 
workers expire at midnight sept 14 the first time in 11 years 
that all three expire at the same time 
each of the big three is cutting costs and its likely the 
union will be asked to pay a greater share of rising health and 
retirement benefits before benefits an average uaw assembler is 
paid nearly 15 an hour 
anthony st john chryslers chief negotiator has said that 
just maintaining the benefits in the current contract would boost 
chryslers labor costs 16 percent chrysler is in the worst 
financial shape of the big three 
the union will tell management that protecting existing jobs is 
its top priority health and safety on the job wages time off and 
pension improvements also are on the list 
the union has not had a strike since 1985 but the prospect this 
year has union members edgy families are paying off debts holding 
off on bigticket purchases and socking away whatever money they 
can 
i try to expect the worst and hope for the best said gary 
sorrell president of uaw local 977 at general motors corps 
marion ind metal fabricating plant he said he and his wife 
joyce canceled this years vacation 
the uaw left the signing ceremonies of the last contracts 
bragging it had won job security because the companies were allowed 
to close plants only when sales of the product made there fell 
since 1988 however gm and chrysler have used that clause to 
close six assembly plants putting 17000 workers on the street 
the japanese in the same period have opened three us assembly 
plants and announced plans for expansion of another 
in june 1988 the big threes combined share of the nations car 
and truck market was 744 percent the japanese companies held 192 
percent during the next two years the big three lost nearly 3 
percentage points the japanese gained almost 5 points 
you have to treat plant closings as you do a national 
disaster said franklin sherman of uaw local 1005 in parma ohio 
youre talking about 3000 or 4000 people losing their jobs 
the uaw set its bargaining agenda at a convention in may 
president owen bieber pleaded with delegates to give bargaining 
committees broad flexibility 
yet there was militant talk at the convention its widely 
believed gm will be targeted for a strike this year 
auto analyst ron glantz of dean witter reynolds inc in san 
francisco calls a strike against gm likely john kirnan an analyst 
with kidder peabody amp co of new york said chances for a 
widespread strike are better this year than in the past 20 years 
the last nationwide strike by the uaw against an automaker was 
in 1985 when about 70000 chrysler workers walked out for 12 days 
negotiations usually start slowly bargainers meet through july 
and august in subcommittees focusing on contract clauses dealing 
with specific issues 
sometime around labor day the uaw chooses one of the companies 
as a target talks at the other two companies are suspended until 
settlement with the target is reached that contract then is taken 
to the others modified slightly and brought to the rankandfile 
for a vote 
but socalled pattern bargaining may disappear this year 
chrysler which reported an 80 percent decline in firstquarter 
earnings is seen as most likely to break the pattern during its 
financial crisis in the early 1980s chrysler extracted concession 
contracts from the uaw 
finances are better at gm and ford but gms firstquarter 
profits this year were 54 percent below last year fords were down 
69 percent 
another factor in this years talks is the aging work force and 
the increasing number of retirees the average age of the big three 
auto workers is 42 compared with under 30 in the japanese plants 
demands for retiree costofliving protection has led to 
numerous protests by older union members another such 
demonstration is planned for wednesday morning outside gm 
headquarters 
wally kijek a member of local 1005 in parma said that cost of 
living adjustments or colas for retirees could be the ultimate 
end to that job security issue the guy who is growing into 
retirement right now can rest assured that he will have an 
equitable wage when he gets out there

allegheny international inc has taken a major 
step toward emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a 
judge approved a 50 million settlement of a creditor lawsuit 
the 13 billion suit was filed against allegheny 
internationals bank lenders by the companys unsecured creditors 
us bankruptcy judge joseph l cosetti late last week called 
the proposed settlement fair reasonable and essential to the 
smallappliance manufacturers chances of emerging from bankruptcy 
the banks will make no cash payments but they agreed to give up 
their right to receive 39 million of the 57 million in interest 
their loans to allegheny international accrued from the companys 
feb 20 1988 bankruptcy filing through feb 29 of this year plus 
all interest accrued after that date 
interest has accrued at the rate of about 2 million a month 
allegheny international which makes sunbeam and oster 
appliances has paid no interest because such payments are not 
permitted while under bankruptcy protection it is to make the 
payments once it emerges from bankruptcy 
the interest being forfeited by the banks will be given to 
unsecured creditors and shareholders in the forms of stock and 
warrants the banks also agreed to absorb their legal fees for 
which they usually could receive reimbursement from allegheny 
international 
allegheny international meanwhile agreed to provide legal 
indemnity of up to 3 million to the banks arising out of other 
claims that could arise from deals that prompted the suit 
the creditors who later were joined by shareholders claimed in 
their may 1988 complaint that institutions led by mellon bank 
doomed the company to bankruptcy at the expense of other 
creditors when they forced the company in 1986 to accept a harsh 
new loan agreement

attorney general dick thornburgh said sunday 
he has no information that neil bush president bushs son 
participated in criminal activity in his role as director of a 
failed savings and loan in colorado 
but thornburgh insisted the justice department would pursue any 
case against the 34yearold bush if it receives credible 
allegations of criminal misconduct 
in the meantime the attorney general added it would be unfair 
to appoint an independent counsel to investigate bush as some 
house democrats have suggested 
i dont think it would be fair to anyone any citizen of the 
united states to appoint an independent counsel where there is 
not allegations of criminal misconduct he said on abctvs 
this week with david brinkley program 
ron brown chairman of the democratic national committee said 
there wouldnt be any talk of independent counsels if thornburgh 
and justice department officials were doing their jobs on the sampl 
debacle 
we need presidential leadership we need leadership from the 
donothing justice department weve got to clean up this 
mess he said on nbctvs meet the press 
following the nbc broadcast thornburgh retaliated in a 
statement issued by his office 
mr brown is either sadly misinformed or purposefully 
distorting the record thornburgh said the bush administration 
he said has more than doubled the number of investigators or 
prosecutors set up 27 task forces and in the last 21 months 
indicted 329 people in the sampl crisis 
elsewhere sunday republicans and democrats traded charges over 
whos to blame for the sampl cleanup which may cost taxpayers as 
much as 500 billion 
while attention has focused on neil bush because of his father 
leaders of both political parties said he is simply a symbol of a 
greater systemic failure 
in general republicans have accused the democraticcontrolled 
congress of thwarting previous efforts to clean up the sampls 
democrats have accused the republican presidential administrations 
of lax supervision 
neil bush is really not the issue brown said on nbc 
ed rollins cochairman of the national republican congressional 
committee agreed 
neil bush was a passenger on the titanic when it went down 
rollins said on the nbc program adding i think he was a little 
naive obviously but he didnt cause the savings and loan 
crisis 
but thornburgh said information turned up in other 
investigations of neil bushs role as a director of the 
denverbased silverado banking savings and loan association might 
be turned over to the justice department 
so far nothing has been brought to our attention that 
indicates criminal activity he said let me assure you 
however that in this case as in any other that if there are 
credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing we will pursue them 
bush has been charged by thrift regulators with violating 
conflictofinterest rules for in one case accepting a loan from 
a businessmen who later received a 900000 line of credit from 
silverado bush has denied doing anything wrong and will appear at 
an administrative hearing in september to defend himself 
in addition the federal deposit insurance corp is 
investigating the 1 billion failure of silverado to determine 
whether neil bush and other directors acted in a diligent manner 
charges could be filed against bush if the fdic determines there 
was negligence 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo said she will not abandon her 
push to force thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel to 
investigate silverado however she is one person short of the 12 
members of the house judiciary committee needed to request an 
attorney general to appoint a special counsel 
but rep newt gingrich rga said if an independent counsel 
were assigned to the silverado case there would be a need for 
similar investigations into for instance democratic sen alan 
cranstons acceptance of hundreds of thousands of dollars from 
charles keating head of a failed sampl in california 
william seidman chairman of the fdic said on cbs the silverado 
case was being handled like every other case of a failed 
institution 
the fdic which insures the commercial banking system is 
under stress seidman warned 
its at a low point in history as a percentage of what its 
insuring he said and we can handle anything we can foresee 
right now but if things come along major failures that were not 
able to foresee at this time that would be another story
