soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev could use the weekend summit to try to nudge president 
bush toward accords on the shape of eastern europe and on banning 
nuclear weapons in the mediterranean a top kremlin official hinted 
today 
the importance of achieving preliminary agreements on a host 
of issues including the mediterranean and europe is of course 
great and that is precisely the reason for our meeting said 
valentin falin the head of the international department of the 
soviet communist party 
however falin a former soviet ambassador to west germany 
197178 said it was unlikely that any accords would issue from the 
malta summit even though the superpower session could speed the 
timetable for ussoviet accords on reducing nuclear conventional 
and weaponry 
i think president bush is right when he says there will be no 
concrete agreement signed during the actual meeting said falin 
bush has stressed that the summit will not focus on arms control 
and that he was not going to surprise the soviets with any 
flashy proposals the president also has said he will not discuss 
eastern eurpopean boundaries with gorbachev 
gorbachev however is known for doing the unexpected and he 
may try to pressure bush into talks on naval power by proposing a 
ban on nuclear weapons in the mediterranean 
us officials have rejected gorbachevs proposal to ban nuclear 
weapons from the baltic sea and other regions and have balked at 
repeated soviet efforts to open talks on naval arms control 
nevertheless arms control is always on the summit table and 
analysts believe the malta meeting may speed negotiations on 
nuclear chemical and conventional arms 
it would seem like all the signs are pointing to quick 
resolution said james rubin assistant director of the arms 
control association of washington but a summit resolution to 
move to completion to all three is the best we should hope for 
gorbachev in a joint statement thursday with italian leaders 
expressed hope for agreements by the end of 1990 to cut 
conventional and chemical weapons and a third deal to sharply 
reduce strategic arms stockpiles 
bush and gorbachev have said that the next summit to be held in 
the united states next spring or summer might be used to sign a 
proposed strategic arms reduction treaty start this would slash 
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent to 6000 warheads 
per side 
for the first time since gorbachev sat down with thenpresident 
reagan in geneva in 1985 the arms control agenda is not dominated 
by the us spacebased missile shield proposal otherwise known as 
star wars and thats a good omen for start 
the soviets said in september they were removing a major start 
obstacle by dropping their precondition that the united states 
agree not to violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which 
restricts strategic defenses 
instead the soviets have reserved the right to rearm if the 
united states violates abm by deploying star wars defenses 
the soviets also agreed to include submarinelaunched cruise 
missiles in a separate agreement rather than in start the united 
states has balked at curbing that class of weapons 
in september the united states also removed a major obstacle to 
start dropping its demand to ban mobile missiles the soviet union 
has deployed two such systems the 10warhead ss24 and the 
singlewarhead ss24 
congress has approved funding for two comparable us weapons 
and the us air force announced wednesday that it was designating 
sites to deploy 50 mobile versions of its 10warhead mx missiles 
which have been housed in silos up to this point 
on conventional arms the western and eastern military alliances 
have made steady progress in multilateral talks to sharply reduce 
forces in europe with only one major issue dividing them the 
definition of an offensive aircraft 
the north atlantic treaty organization wants the warsaw pact to 
cut 7000 planes versus a reduction of 1000 for the west but the 
kremlin says many of its planes such as trainers should not be 
counted and that nato has an advantage of up to 3600 aircraft 
the two sides also have proposed different methods of counting 
troops with nato seeking a limit of 275000 deployed by either 
superpower in central europe the warsaw pact wants its proposed 
ceiling of 300000 to cover british and french troops in west 
germany that would mean a reduction of about 30000 us troops in 
central europe and 325000 for the soviets 
eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles may prove more 
complicated since 40 nations are involved in negotiations on a 
global ban but a bilateral deal to cut us and soviet chemical 
arms may be easier

the east german parliament today voted 
overwhelmingly to change the constitution and eliminate the 
communist partys guaranteed monopoly on power a major reform 
demanded by the mass movement for democratic change 
while at least five lawmakers voted to abstain the rest in the 
500member peoples chamber appeared in a show of hands to approve 
the change 
it is the latest in a series of reforms announced since the 
hardline communist government was ousted by mass protests on oct 
18 
the new communist leadership bowed to continued pressure and an 
exodus of citizens to the west on nov 9 when it opened its borders 
and the berlin wall to allow free travel to the west 
the vote on the constitutional change came as a surprise 
parliament speaker guenther maleuda opened the session 40 
minutes late and announced that the party leaders had met to change 
the agenda and put the issue of communist domination as their first 
order of business 
there was no debate on the issue the lawmakers broke into 
applause after the vote 
the christian democratic union one of the smaller parties that 
had been allied with the communists during the past 40 years 
proposed striking the constitutions designation of east germany as 
a socialist nation but that motion failed to win the needed 
twothirds majority of votes 
only 112 deputies from among the 420 present voted in favor and 
20 others abstained 
many communists as well as opposition activists have called for 
maintaining the socialist nature of east germany and rejected west 
german calls for reunification of the countries divided after the 
nazi defeat in world war ii 
the leader of another small party guenter hartmann of the 
national democrats told east german television that all of the 
party leaders agreed on the need to consider a constitutional 
change involving the communists monopoly on power 
east german politicians had been considering striking article 1 
from the constitution which guarantees the communists a leading 
role 
todays vote may have been spurred by the swift decision in 
neighboring czechoslovakia this week to also change the 
constitutional provision guaranteeing the communists a monopoly on 
power 
the czechoslovak parliament voted unanimously wednesday to 
repeal the constitutional designation of the communists as the 
leading force 
maleuda said at the start of the east german parliamentary 
session that a simple twothirds majority of the members votes was 
needed to change the constitution 
opposition groups had demanded such a revision and even the 
communists have conceded they should give up the unfair advantage 
this kind of change would be a good beginning hartmann told 
east german television 
the next step in advancing political pluralism will come 
thursday when the communists sit down with opposition groups to 
determine the nations future course 
the parliament later debated a proposed law that would guarantee 
all citizens the right to travel and provide for a way to supply 
them with hard currency for trips to the west 
but finance minister uta nickel told the chamber that the 
exchange system was being delayed by considerable problems she 
said the government was not prepared to discuss a guaranteed 
minimum exchange for private trips for at least another three weeks 
the constitutional change temporarily took attention away from a 
criminal investigation into alleged abuse of power by former east 
german leader erich honecker and other ousted officials 
the party must completely and decisively reject such misuse of 
office to earn the trust of the people communist party leader 
egon krenz said on national television after the investigation was 
announced thursday 
honecker also was stripped of immunity from prosecution and the 
official news agency adn reported that the country estates of 
honecker and his top associates were under tight security to 
prevent removal of valuable or evidence 
krenz who was considered a follower of honeckers and a 
hardliner before he replaced his old mentor faces widespread 
opposition among prodemocracy activists as well as within the 
party hierarchy which is to meet in a special congress dec 1517 
krenz said he hoped the disgraced officials could be brought to 
justice before the party congress 
he also contended he had never kept quarters at exclusive 
hunting lodges set aside for the party elite 
an internal party inquiry was announced a week ago into reported 
wrongdoing by honecker his deputy guenter mittag and other top 
communists 
mittag was thrown out of the party nov 23 in the first punitive 
action against any ousted official 
opposition activists accuse party leaders during honeckers 
18year regime of lining their pockets while the national economy 
faltered 
honecker 77 has not been seen in public since his ouster six 
weeks ago he is reported to be seriously ill

president bush today ordered us 
fighters into action to provide air cover for two philippine air 
bases and help defend the aquino government against a coup attempt 
we are hopeful the matter will be contained bush told 
reporters soon after arriving in malta for his weekend summit with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
it is fair to say that the situation is serious secretary 
of state james a baker iii said we have provided some air 
support air cover 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said no us 
planes have fired any shots or intercepted any rebel aircraft 
he also said a contingent of 100 marines had been sent from the 
base in the philippines to defend the us embassy in manila 
were cautiously optimistic based upon reports we have from 
the philippine government that the government forces seem to be 
prevailing rear adm edward d scheafer of the defense 
intelligence agency said in washington 
the air assistance came at the request of philippine president 
corazon aquino who spoke by telephone to vice president dan quayle 
she was very grateful for the call and very grateful for the 
assistance and seemed to be confident but that was several hours 
ago bush said 
his national security adviser brent scowcroft said us forces 
were not in the thick of anything they are simply providing air 
cover thats all we have been requested to do 
williams was asked at a pentagon briefing how far the united 
states would go in providing military help to keep mrs aquino in 
power he replied thats awful speculative williams said that 
bushs order authorizes assistance without force if possible 
with force if required 
he declined to say whether any consideration was being given to 
evacuating some 20000 american dependents of military personnel 
stationed in the philippines principally subic bay and clark air 
force base there are some 15000 us military personnel stationed 
to the philippines 
in a statement issued from air force one as bush flew to this 
island nation white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
this assistance is intended to allow the democratically elected 
government of the philippines to restore order the president also 
is determined to protect the lives of americans in the 
philippines 
fitzwater said today that he was not aware of any requests for 
us assistance beyond the air cover asked if bush would telephone 
mrs aquino he said it is not clear he will call her today 
because of the nature of her situation 
mrs aquino in manila said even now us fighters are 
joining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops once 
more two pacific democracies stand shouldertoshoulder in the 
defense of freedom 
a bush administration official said the us fighters were 
authorized to fire only if rebel planes are attempting to take 
off from these two bases but that would be only after repeated 
warnings 
the f4s from clark air base were flying combat air patrols and 
there were no reports of engagements with rebel aircraft oborn 
said this morning 
the bush administration official confirmed that the us planes 
began flying over the two rebelheld philippine air bases shortly 
after the presidential authorization came at 1232 am est today 
the goal in this authorization has been to discourage any 
hostile attempt on the part of the rebels in the philippines 
president aquinos request was very specific and that was to 
conduct an aggressive cap over two philippine air bases villamor 
and sangley point the official said 
the official said the us aid involved solely those flights 
over the bases and added that ground military personnel were not 
involved it was not immediately known how many planes were being 
used 
the coup attempt has left at least 10 dead and 64 wounded and 
was the most serious since a civilianmilitary uprising swept mrs 
aquino to power in february 1986 and forced the late president 
ferdinand e marcos into exile 
on thursday the white house condemned the coup attempt and 
threatened to cut off us aid if the aquino government is ousted 
meanwhile the state department warned americans not to travel in 
the philippines 
fitzwater said thursday we reiterate the unequivocal support 
of the us government for philippine democracy and the government 
of president corazon aquino we strongly condemn the effort to 
destabilize the elected philippine government 
he added that according to us law all us foreign 
assistance to the philippines would be suspended if the elected 
government of the philippines were removed by a military coup 
rep steven j solarz dny chairman of the asiapacific 
subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee said a 
successful coup would be a colossal disaster that would play 
right into the hands of the communistled rebels 
late thursday the state department issued a warning against 
travel in the philippines 
the department established a monitoring group to track 
developments in the philippines around the clock its second such 
group to be activated another task force is monitoring 
developments in el salvador 
mrs aquino visited the white house nov 8 and received bushs 
promise of continued us aid for her government established four 
years ago after dictator ferdinand marcos was driven from power 
the united states and the philippines are scheduled to open 
negotiations in december on the future of the lease agreements for 
two major us military installations clark air base and subic bay 
naval station as well as smaller facilities in the philippines 
the current leases expire in september 1991

terrorists meticulously planned 
for weeks the bomb attack that killed one of the worlds most 
powerful financiers the chief federal prosecutor said today 
police searched nationwide for a 31yearold terrorist suspect 
wanted in the killing of alfred herrhausen the head of deutsche 
bank he was slain when a bomb ripped through his car thursday in 
the frankfurt suburb of bad homburg 
in frankfurt 5000 people took part in a silent march past 
deutsche bank headquarters in memory of herrhausen 
authorities have offered a 22 million reward for the capture 
of herrhausens killers 
herrhausen 59 headed the countrys largest bank and had been 
one of the worlds most influential financial figures 
the red army faction which had been relatively dormant for 
three years claimed responsibility for the sophisticated bomb 
attack that wrecked herrhausens armored car as he was being driven 
through this affluent suburb to work in nearby frankfurt 
herrhausens driver survived the attack with serious injuries 
the perpetrators began preparing for the attack at least four 
or five weeks ago said chief federal prosecutor kurt rebmann 
near the area of the attack wires had been buried in the 
asphalt the asphalt had been chiseled out up to nearby bushes and 
after the wires were laid filled in again he said 
rebmann said the terrorists took care to tint new asphalt poured 
over the wires the same as the rest of the 4footwide sidewalk to 
make the work unnoticable 
his office said one of two men seen running from the scene 
matched the description of 31yearold christoph seidler 
a hamburg court in 1981 convicted seidler of supporting the 
leftist red army faction which claimed responsibility for the bomb 
attack 
seidler has been a fugitive for several years his name 
routinely appears on a wanted poster of two dozen leftist 
terrorists that is displayed in west german post offices and other 
public places said prosecutors spokesman hansjuergen foerster 
seidler has been involved with the red army faction for at least 
a decade said a statement issued by rebmanns office 
it said seidler also was sought in a bank robbery in 1985 
a controversy developed over whether herrhausen had been given 
enough protection media reports said authorities had received 
indications he might have been singled out as the target of a 
possible attack 
imprisoned red army faction members went on a hunger strike 
earlier this year to back demands to be housed together in one 
prison 
they broke off their hunger strike without gaining the 
concession but issued a statement warning about new steps in their 
antiimperialist struggle 
the red army faction has a long history of attacks against west 
german business and political figures as well as against us 
military targets 
the group had been little heard of since the 1986 murders of 
karl heinz beckurts chairman of the giant siemens industrial 
concern and diplomat gerold von braunmuehl however the group was 
believed to be involved in an unsuccessful attempt on the life of 
finance ministry official hans tietmeyer in september 1988 
rebmann said authorities would have to review security measures 
because of the sophistication of the device that killed herrhausen 
foerster said the explosive appeared to have been attached to a 
bicycle placed on the street 
he said the bomb was detonated by a sophisticated lightbeam 
device that had never been used before in a terrorist attack in 
west germany herrhausens car triggered the explosion by passing 
through the light beam he said 
for a long time the deutsche bank and herrhausen in 
particular have been targeted by the red army faction foerster 
said 
the spokesman noted that leftist terrorists for years had 
accused deutsche bank of repression and of fueling the 
militaryindustrial complex with the banks worldwide 
investments 
herrhausen had been a friend and an adviser of chancellor helmut 
kohl often accompanying the chancellor on major foreign trips 
the tall striking bank chief had been leading the deutsche bank 
on an aggressive expansion course aimed at making the institution 
one of the top 10 or 15 banks in the world 
herrhausen also urged greater investment in the soviet union and 
other parts of eastern europe

your holiness gentlemen 
i thank you for your kind attention and for the interest you 
have shown toward my country our policies and our views about the 
world 
a truly extraordinary event has taken place it has become 
possible due to the profound changes that are sweeping many 
countries and nations what is more we can expect it to help 
assure their positive continuation 
we had much to discuss i feel that my thoughts and concerns 
have been duly appreciated as well as my explanations of the 
problem that now exist in our country including problems between 
the state and various churches which we are addressing in a spirit 
of democracy and humanism and within the framework of perestroika 
the soviet union and the holy see participate in the helsinki 
process to the extent of their abilities and with due regard for 
their special roles both are helping it to proceed at a normal 
pace promote solutions to common european problems and create a 
favorable external environment enabling nations to make their own 
independent choice 
respect for the peoples national state spiritual and cultural 
identity is an indispensable condition for a steady international 
environment which europe and the world now need to cross the 
historic watershed and attain a new period of peace 
we proceded from these positions in initiating our dialogue with 
the holy see the dialogue which has now been consecrated by this 
summit meeting i am pleased to note the high degree of mutual 
understanding and readiness to fill this dialogue with specific 
actions 
we have reached agreement in principle to give official status 
to our interstate relations as for the modalities they will be 
determined by our diplomatic officials 
people of many confessions including christians moslems jews 
buddhists and others live in the soviet union all of them have a 
right to satisfy their spiritual needs shortly a law on the 
freedom of conscience will be adopted in our country within the 
mainstream of perestroika we are learning the difficult and 
indispensable art of comprehensive cooperation and consolidation of 
society on the groundwork of renewal 
i greet you and join in the good wishes that we have just heard 
from his holiness

the visit which you are making to the successor of peter is an 
important event in the history of relations between the soviet 
union and the apostolic see as such it is being followed with 
great interest by catholics throughout the world and by all people 
of good will it is well known that the popes house has always 
been a home for the representatives of all the peoples of the 
earth you are therefore cordially welcome here mr president 
through you i also wish to greet all the peoples of the republics 
of the soviet union my esteem and affection goes out to all of 
them 
last year we celebrated the millennium of the baptism of the 
rus an event which left such a profound mark on the history of 
the peoples who on that occasion received the message of christ in 
this way the riches contained in revelation concerning the dignity 
and value of the human person which derive from the persons 
relationship to god the creator and father of all admirably merged 
with the original heritage of those peoples a heritage which in 
the course of centuries has been enhanced by so many other 
religious and cultural values 
i am pleased to consider your visit mr president against the 
backdrop of the millennial celebration and at the same time to 
look upon it as a promisefilled sign for the future your visit 
in fact enables us to look with greater confidence to the future 
of the communities of believers in the soviet union 
the events of past decades and the painful trial to which so 
many citizens were subjected because of their faith are widely 
known 
in particular it is wellknown that many catholic communities 
are today eagerly awaiting the opportunity of reestablishing 
themselves and of being able to rejoice in the leadership of their 
pastors 
recent developments and the new perspectives which have opened 
up lead us to the hope that the situation will change thanks to 
the repeatedly affirmed decision of your government to proceed with 
a renewal of internal legislation in order to bring it into full 
harmony with the solemn international commitments to which the 
soviet union has also subscribed

on this occasion i make my own the expectation of millions of 
your fellow citizens and with them of millions of others 
throughout the world namely that the law on freedom of 
conscience soon to be discussed by the supreme soviet will help to 
guarantee to all believers the full exercise of the right to 
religious freedom which as i have said many times is the 
foundation of the other freedoms my thoughts turn in particular to 
those christians living in the soviet union who are in full 
communion with this apostolic see on their behalf whether they 
be of latin byzantine or armenian rite i express the fervent 
hope that they be able to practice freely their religious life 
in a climate of restored freedom catholics will thus be able to 
work together with their brethren of the orthodox church who are 
so dear to us indeed we share with them a common patrimony and 
wish to cooperate with them in a renewed ecumenical commitment to 
preach the gospel of christ to new generations and to work together 
with them in the vast field of human development as we await the 
rebuilding of that unity which christ willed for his church 
with you mr president we have had the opportunity to dwell on 
the international situation and on some specific and more urgent 
problems we have also discussed the development of contacts 
between us for resolving the problems of the catholic church in the 
ussr as well as for fostering a shared commitment on behalf of 
peace and cooperation in the world 
at the end of the second millennium of the christian era the 
church appeals to all those who have the future of mankind at 
heart to unite in the service of its material and spiritual 
betterment such concern for man cannot only pave the way for 
overcoming international tensions and ending the confrontation 
between blocs it can also favor the birth of a universal 
solidarity especially with regard to the developing countries 
solidarity as i have had occasion to affirm helps us to see the 
other whether person people or nation not just as some kind 
of instrumentbut as our neighbor a helper to be made a sharer 
on a par with ourselves in the banquet of life to which all are 
equally invited by god 
this is particularly true for the richer and more powerful 
nations with respect to them i have noted that surmounting every 
type of imperialism and determination to preserve their own 
hegemony those nations must have a sense of moral 
responsibility for the other nations so that an effective 
international system may be established which will rest on the 
foundation of equality of all peoples and on the necessary respect 
for their legitimate differences 
to be sure mankind today awaits new forms of cooperation and 
mutual assistance the tragedy of the second world war has taught 
us however that if fundamental ethical values are forgotten 
fearful consequences for the fate of peoples can result and even 
the greatest of enterprises can end in failure hence in my 
apostolic letter commemorating the outbreak of the second world 
war i felt the need to remind all peoples that there can be no 
peace if man and law are held in contempt and if the rights of 
all peoples particularly the most vulnerable are not 
respected what is more i expressed to statesmen and the leaders 
of nations my profound conviction that respect for god and 
respect for man go hand in hand they make up the absolute 
principle which allow states and political blocs to overcome their 
hostilities 
mr president our meeting today will hardly fail to have a 
powerful impact on world opinion not only is it something new and 
unusual it will also be interpreted as singularly meaningful a 
sign of the times that have slowly matured a sign that is rich in 
promise 
the holy see follows with great interest the process of renewal 
which you have set in motion in the soviet union it wishes you 
success and declares itself ready to support every initiative that 
will better protect and integrate the rights and duties of 
individuals and peoples so that peace may be ensured in europe and 
in the world 
tomorrow you will meet with the president of the united states 
of america mr george bush for my part i express cordial good 
wishes and pray that the forthcoming talks may lead to a new 
understanding one based upon a careful heeding of the needs and 
aspirations of peoples 
with these sentiments mr president i renew my best wishes for 
you and for your mission for your family and for your country 
invoking upon all of you the blessing of almighty god

a police officer accused of manslaughter in a 
killing that reignited the citys racial tensions testified that he 
shot a black motorcyclist in selfdefense 
but prosecutors asserted that officer william lozano and his 
partner concocted the story 
is it an unwritten rule among partners that they cover for 
themselves even in court assistant state attorney john hogan 
asked thursday theres not a brotherhood in blue where you lie 
to protect your partner 
the colombianborn lozano speaking with a soft spanish accent 
denied that he and partner dawn campbell made up the selfdefense 
story so it wouldnt appear he had fired his weapon unnecessarily 
there could be a lot of brotherhood its true but i would 
not cover for anyone the officer responded 
lozano 31 faces two counts of manslaughter in the jan 16 
deaths of 23yearold clement lloyd and lloyds 24yearold 
passenger allan blanchard lozano shot lloyd in the head killing 
him instantly blanchard also black died the next day of head 
injuries suffered in the subsequent crash 
lloyds death promptly triggered racial violence in miami 
twice before in the 1980s innocent verdicts favoring police 
officers accused of killing blacks have led to rioting and the 
miami and metrodade police forces are on alert for renewed 
violence 
the defense had been expected to finish its presentation today 
but the morning session was canceled because of an illness court 
officers did not specify who was ill the case was tentatively 
scheduled to resume in the afternoon and should go to the jury next 
week 
television and radio in miami are broadcasting the trial live 
cable news network carried lozanos testimony live nationally 
lozano testified that lloyds motorcycle headed straight at him 
in the wrong lane and he fired instinctively 
lozanos lawyer roy black asked how close the motorcycle came 
so close that i thought i might die that i was going to be 
run over and i was going to die the officer said i feared for 
my life 
but hogan said lozano and ms campbell had talked the night of 
the shooting to invent an alibi 
earlier in the trial prosecutors showed photos of lozano and 
ms campbell together just after the incident and suggested they 
had invented the story that the motorcycle almost hit him lozano 
testified the photos were taken at the scene of a minor accident 
that occurred at the same place and said he and ms campbell had 
never discussed the shooting 
you asked dawn campbell to lie for you that night didnt 
you hogan asked 
no i never spoke to dawn campbell that night lozano said 
adding not about lying 
lozano who has been on the miami police force for five years 
began his testimony by reciting a litany of commendations then he 
recounted events the night of the shooting which occurred as he 
and ms campbell were speaking to an overtown man about a lost 
license plate 
lozano said he never saw the motorcycle only the pursuing 
squad car and its lights until he had already walked out into the 
roadway 
hogan later challenged him on differences between that account 
and the first verisons he gave investigators which indicated he 
knew the motorcycle was approaching lozano said he could not 
explain the discrepancies he suggested the investigators had made 
mistakes

soviet leader met with pope john paul ii at the vatican and pledged 
religious liberty throughout his communist homeland 
bush arrived at the blustery summit site after ordering american 
warplanes to support philippines president corazon aquinos 
struggle against a military coup attempt 
while gorbachev promised to establish diplomatic ties with the 
vatican and guarantee religious freedom for all soviet citizens 
one of his major european allies east germany took another 
major step toward democratic reform 
touring the us aircraft carrier forrestal in the mediterranean 
after his arrival for the weekend summit bush said he yearned for 
a future free of both tyranny and fear and urged the soviet 
union to join us in building that kind of future 
a new freedom is sweeping the globe the president told 
officers and crew members aboard the carrier before arriving at the 
uss belknap his home for the next two days our meeting here off 
malta will last a few days but the freedom we seek will last for 
generations 
bush presented the forrestals crew with a piece of the 
crumbling berlin wall as a symbol of the peace we seek he 
thanked them for making the malta summit possible because you and 
sailors like you around the world have kept us strong 
he said the twoday summit starting saturday aboard us and 
soviet warships anchored in the harbor off maltas shore presented 
a historic opportunity to foster the peace 
bush saluted gorbachev as a dynamic new soviet leader willing 
as lincoln said to think anew the president added that we 
want him to succeed in bring economic and political reforms to 
the soviet union 
on the carrier bush watched as warplanes were catapulated off 
the deck screeching into the sky on maneuvers ive got a banana 
in my ear he joked to reporters referring to yellow earplugs he 
wore during the noisy demonstration 
a f14 surprised the president with a thunderous sonic boom and 
bush ducked partially down behind a railing as did other visitors 
quickly recovering the president grinned and screwed up his face 
in mock horror for the cameras 
bush also joined enlisted men in the mess for a lunch of lasagna 
and a glass of milk 
after the 70minute vatican meeting gorbachev said the soviet 
union would soon adopt a law guaranteeing religious freedom within 
its borders and would establish diplomatic ties with the vatican

said all of them have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs 
the pope called the meeting the first between a soviet leader 
and the head of the roman catholic church a promisefilled sign 
for the future and pledged support for gorbachevs attempt to 
reform soviet society 
a top soviet official meanwhile said he doubted any formal 
agreements would be signed during the summit 
i think president bush is right when he says there will be no 
concrete agreement signed during the actual meeting said 
valentin falin the head of the international department of the 
soviet communist party 
but falin an architect of soviet policy toward europe hinted 
that gorbachev will try to nudge bush toward accords on banning 
nuclear weapons from the mediterranean sea and coping with 
political changes sweeping eastern europe 
after his arrival bush spent the day visiting officers and crew 
members aboard the us aircraft carrier forrestal in the 
mediterranean and dealing with a violent military insurrection 
against the aquino government in manila 
en route to malta bush ordered us warplanes to provide air 
support for the aquino government against military insurgents who 
bombed the presidential palace in manila 
it is fair to say that the situation is serious secretary 
of state james a baker iii said we are hopeful the matter will 
be contained the president said 
us officials said american warplanes were circling two air 
bases controlled by rebel forces at villamor and sangley point and 
100 american marines were shifted to manila to protect the us 
embassy a soviet spokesman in malta denounced the us move as 
interference in internal developments 
at the vatican gorbachev broke into a smile as the polishborn 
pontiff offered his hand and guided the soviet president into the 
papal library for private talks at an oaken desk beneath a 
religious painting 
in a major gesture to the vatican soviet officials cleared the 
way for legalizing the ukrainian catholic church which has been 
banned since the days of dictator josef stalin an official of the 
soviet republic said today the churchs estimated 4 million members 
will be allowed to register with ukrainian authorities like members 
of other faiths 
at the same time the east german parliament voted 
overwhelmingly to change the constitution and eliminate the 
communist partys guaranteed monopoly on political power a major 
reform demanded by the mass movement for democratic change 
gorbachev flies to malta tonight after meeting with italian 
premier giulio andreotti and business leaders in milan italy 
preceding gorbachev to malta soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov 
said it was unlikely the summit leaders could do anything to 
resolve the conflict in central america where the united states 
says soviet arms are continuing to flow to leftist guerrillas 
we are not helping anybody there gerasimov said during a 
cbs this morning interview its very dangerous to infuse 
greatpower rivalry into this conflict which we think must be 
settled by political means 
before boarding air force one on thursday for the summit site 
bush said the people of europe can see that mr gorbachev and i 
east and west are not in some kind of competition rather were 
both working to make the world a more peaceful one 
gorbachev declared thursday there was no turning back from the 
democratic reforms sweeping through the eastern bloc 
the soviet leader said the united states canada and european 
nations should hold a helsinki 2 meeting earlier than the 1992 
date set under the 1975 helsinki accords on human rights and 
security in europe 
bush asked by reporters aboard air force one about gorbachevs 
proposal said ill talk to him any ideas hes got ill 
discuss them with him then well let you know 
maltas entire 1200man army was mobilized to assist in 
ensuring security for the superpower leaders soviet american and 
maltese flags fluttered side by side throughout the capital city 
the us and soviet warships where two days of summit talks will 
begin saturday the uss belknap and the slava were anchored 
offshore visible from the cliffs overlooking the bay

vishwanath pratap singh today was 
appointed indias new prime minister to succeed rajiv gandhi his 
onetime ally who was defeated in bitter national elections last 
month 
president ramaswamy venkataraman named singh prime minister an 
hour after singh was unanimously elected parliamentary leader of 
his centrist coalition 
the united news of india news agency said singh would be sworn 
in by venkataraman on saturday and given 30 days to prove his 
coalition has the support of a majority in parliament 
singh 58 a former gandhi cabinet minister campaigned in the 
parliamentary elections against what he called the widespread 
corruption and ineptitude of gandhis congress party 
singhs election today to lead the national front coalition did 
not come easily there were lastminute conferences a fistfight 
and allegations of skullduggery within the front which is united 
by little more than antipathy toward gandhi and his party 
the national front formed the most cohesive opposition force in 
indias 42 years of independence to defeat gandhi in national 
elections held nov 2226 
gandhi whose congress party had held power for nearly all of 
indias independence lost his bid to remain prime minister when 
his party failed to win a parliamentary majority 
the elections were marked by widespread allegations of fraud 
which led to revoting in several districts and violence that 
killed more than 100 people 
after his election as coalition leader singh told fellow janata 
dal members parliament i wish to thank you for the confidence 
you have given me this is a difficult time and there are 
difficult problems before the nation 
we should make an india of which every indian will be proud 
singh said 
on thursday members of the coalition said singh a former 
defense minister was the only candidate for prime minister but 
singhs professed reluctance to take the job spurred two other 
candidates chndra shekhar and devi lal to enter the fray 
singh and other leaders drove from house to house and office to 
office for a series of consultations today 
the fistfights occurred outside the home of chandra shekhar and 
riot police were called to break them up 
ram jethmalani a senior member of the national front was 
punched and kicked by supporters of chandra shekhar when he got out 
of his car to begin a hunger strike aimed at persuading chandra 
shekhar to step aside in favor of singh 
the 78yearold jethmalani one of indias top criminal lawyers 
fell to the ground as reporters watched 
by the time the janata dal legislators entered parliament to 
choose their leader the deal had been made but chandra shekhar 
said he had been duped 
when the proceedings started singh stood up and proposed devi 
lal for party leader chandra shekhar seconded the proposal 
then devi lal stood up said he didnt want the job and proposed 
singh a singh supporter immediately seconded the proposal and 
singh was declared unanimously accepted 
chandra shekhar later told reporters that singh was elected 
without my knowledge and without my consent he refused to 
elaborate but said he would support singh 
gandhi resigned wednesday after his party failed to win a 
majority but he was asked by venkataraman to continue until a new 
government is formed 
gandhi grandson of the late prime minister jawaharlal nehru and 
son of the late prime minister indira gandhi will become leader of 
the opposition in the new parliament 
singh was also chosen today as leader of the janata dal party 
the major component of the fiveparty national front coalition it 
holds 141 of the fronts 144 seats in parliament the other three 
seats are held by smaller parties in the coalition 
the congress emerged as the single largest party with 191 seats 
out of the 525 at stake its smallparty allies got another 17 
seats 
but the national front also has been promised support by the 
rightwing bharatiya janata party which has 88 seats and by 
several leftwing groups which won a total of 51 constituencies 
that would give the front and its tacit allies a total of 283 
seats enough to carry a vote if there are no defections 
under the constitution the president decides who will be asked 
to form a government in past elections one party always emerged 
with a comfortable majority in the absence of such a majority the 
president is free to choose the party he considers the most capable 
of forming a government

president mikhail s gorbachev said in a message 
delivered today that lithuanian communists risk damaging his reform 
movement if they persist in their fight for independence a 
lithuanian journalist and political activist said 
eduardas potashinskas said the communist party ideology chief 
read the statement during a meeting of the lithuanian communist 
party central committee on the baltic republics drive for 
independence 
lithuanian leader algirdas brazauskas rebuffed the ideology 
chief vadim a medvedev as he read the appeal said potashinskas 
a lithuanian tv editor and a member of the sajudis political 
movement 
medvedev told lithuanian communists any movement toward 
secession will deal a most severe blow to perestroika and it will 
come at its hardest period its turning point 
he quoted brazauskas as responding lithuania without 
sovereignty is lithuania without a future 
rimintas kanapenas sajudis spokesman said most lithuanian 
central committee members supported brazauskas 
about 2000 protesters gathered outside the central committee 
building in the lithuanian capital vilnius and some stayed all 
day kanapenas said 
the meeting was being broadcast on radio and was taped for later 
presentation on television 
gorbachev and the moscow party leadership summoned brazauskas 
and the lithuanian party leaders to the kremlin two weeks ago to 
discuss lithuanias plans to split its communist party from the 
national party that move could be taken at a congress of the 
lithuanian party beginning dec 19 
gorbachev who was visiting the vatican today has spoken out 
against such a move several times and he emphasized the point in 
the message medvedev delivered today 
it must not be allowed it is inadmissible now to follow the 
way of splitting communists on the basis of national or social 
background this contradicts the very essence of internationalist 
socialism this would contradict the interests of the people the 
message said 
such a move would question the issue of the popular foundation 
of the postwar european home that has been born out with such 
difficulty which is not firm enough yet and even fragile in some 
ways peaceful but living through a difficult transformation 
now the tv editor quoted the statement as saying 
the three baltic republics lithuania latvia and estonia were 
absorbed into the soviet union by josef stalin in 1940 under a 
secret agreement with adolf hitlers germany they had been 
independent since the fall of the czarist empire 
on monday they won approval from the national parliament for 
broad economic independence beginning jan 1 baltic leaders say 
the plan allows them to get a share of the earnings of factories 
run by moscowbased ministries and to print their own money for 
internal use 
thirtynine communists in neighboring latvia including eight 
members of the local partys central committee also have called 
for an independent party the tass news agency said thursday 
in estonia the local partys ideology chief mikk titma said 
in an interview with his partys daily that he is certain the legal 
guarantee of the partys leading role in political life will be 
eliminated from estonias constitution

that it expelled a renegade cia agent who has been sought by the 
united states since his defection to the soviet union in 1985 
the los angeles times quoted a us government source as saying 
hungary revoked edward lee howards asylum status at least a month 
ago despite protests from the kgb the soviet intelligence service 
but col karoly nagy head of the hungarian interior ministrys 
department for the supervision of foreign nationals told the 
associated press today that howard had not been expelled from 
hungary 
as far as i know he is still here but he has indicated that 
he plans to leave hungary said nagy he cited personal family 
reasons nothing political when he leaves it will be of his own 
free will 
when asked about howards travel documents nagy said i think 
he has his american passport if he has a multipleentry visa he 
can come and go 
the us embassy said today it had no immediate information on 
howards reported expulsion 
nagy said he did not know where howard would go if he left 
hungary 
howard who reportedly provided the soviets with cia 
information has spent significant periods of time in hungary since

democratic reforms sweeping hungary poland east germany and 
czechoslovakia 
webster cited the case of a prominent defector from the united 
states who was permanently expelled from a bloc country which had 
provided him comfort and sanctuary in the past and that would have 
been contrary to the wishes of the kgb

after the vatican meeting gorbachev flew to milan to meet with 
business leaders before heading to malta and summit talks with 
president bush 
the beaming pope welcomed todays visit the first between a 
kremlin chief and roman catholic pontiff as a promisefilled 
sign for the future and pledged support for gorbachevs attempt 
to reform soviet society 
in his address after about 70 minutes of private talks john 
paul referred to the painful trials that soviet believers 
suffered in past decades 
he issued a strong call for religious freedom for all believers 
that included a reference to the ukrainian catholic church which 
had been suppressed by soviet dictator josef stalin 
on their behalf whether they be of the latin byzantine or 
armenian rite i express the fervent hope that they be able to 
practice freely their religious life the pope said 
the vatican said the pope in his private talks also raised the 
issue of the ukrainians in the soviet union officials said they 
had cleared the way for the eventual legalization of the ukrainian 
church 
in a cautious response to the vatican meeting romebased 
ukrainian catholic leader cardinal myroslav lubachivsky restated 
the churchs demands for full freedom and offered to cooperate with 
the rival russian orthodox church 
the pope also said the holy see was following with interest 
gorbachevs efforts to renew society and promised support for 
every initiative to protect the rights of people and help 
ensure peace 
john paul spoke first at the news conference beginning in 
russian and switching to italian and gorbachev responded to the 
popes concerns in his brief remarks 
people of many confessions including christians moslems 
jews buddhists and others live in the soviet union all of them 
have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs gorbachev said 
speaking in russian 
he said a freedom of conscience law would soon be adopted 
the soviet leader also said the vatican and moscow had reached 
agreement in principle to give official status to our interstate 
relations with the details to be worked out by diplomats the 
pope has long sought to reestablish relations with the soviets 
broken since the russian revolution 
departing from his prepared text gorbachev said we discussed 
a future papal visit john paul has frequently express the wish 
to visit the soviet union provided he can meet with his flock all 
over the country including lithuania and the ukraine 
the pope has disclosed on two occasions that he had been barred 
from visiting lithuania the roman catholic stronghold in the 
soviet union 
navarro did not provide a date for such a trip i dont know 
when but certainly the pope will be going some day navarro told 
reporters 
the polishborn pontiff smiling and touching his pectoral 
cross welcomed gorbachev to the first meeting ever between a 
kremlin chief and pope 
gorbachev the leader of a system that has reviled religion for 
most of this century appeared serious as he walked through the 
marble and frescoed halls of the apostolic palace but smiled when 
the pope offered his hand 
the two men chatted and posed for photographers before the 
whiterobed john paul led gorbachev wearing a pinstriped suit 
into the papal library guiding him to an oak desk beneath a 
religious painting to begin the closeddoor talks 
in their private meeting the two men spoke alone in russian for 
five minutes then their interpreters joined them for the rest of 
the session and john paul switched to polish 
as gorbachev and his wife raisa entered the apostolic palace 
they were greeted by bemedaled vatican dignitaries and received a 
salute from a detachment of swiss guards the popes ceremonial 
army 
mrs gorbachevs red dress raised eyebrows at the vatican where 
protocol normally calls for women to wear dark dresses but she 
seemed at ease as she toured the palace and asked questions about 
its art works 
the pope and gorbachev smiled as mrs gorbachev and the soviet 
entourage were ushered into the library after the talks 
earlier in the clear but chilly morning thousands of romans 
lined the broad avenue leading to st peters basilica the largest 
church in christendom and cheered as gorbachevs black limousine 
headed into st peters square and he entered the vatican 
in announcing that the ukrainian church will be legalized 
nikolai kolesnik of the soviet republics council on religious 
affairs said from kiev that regional officials have decided that 
societies of greek rite catholics can be registered like other 
religious groups as now required by soviet law 
the church was forcibly merged under dictator josef stalin with 
the russian orthodox church in 1946 and went underground according 
to western sources it has up to 4 million members 
kolesnik said in a telephone interview from kiev to the 
associated press in moscow that it was possible the ukrainian 
catholic churchs hierarchy could also be restored 
gorbachev would like vatican support for his reform policies 
and was believed to be seeking a pledge from john paul that he 
would use his influence to keep the church from becoming a vehicle 
for nationalism in the baltic republics and the ukraine 
john paul a strong anticommunist indicated from the outset of 
his papacy 11 years ago that he intended to battle for the rights 
of his fellow eastern europeans his return to poland in 1979 
sparked calls for democratic reforms that led to the birth of the 
solidarity labor movement 
the turkish gunman who shot john paul in may 1981 claimed he had 
bulgarian and soviet support although the allegations were never 
proved

for nine years for a failed rocket attack on an el al jet at 
nairobi airport in 1976 abc said thursday on its primetime 
live program the network cited terrorist sources 
abc reported that jibril a former syrian army captain who heads 
the syrianbacked popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command has bragged privately that he was behind 
the bombing and was paid by iran

organization to avenge a us warships downing in july 1988 of an 
iran air jet with 290 people aboard iran has denied any

explosion of flight 103 over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 
all 259 people aboard the boeing 747 and 11 on the ground were 
killed 
authorities asked a court in sweden today to approve the seizure 
of 15 bags of clothing by scottish detectives from the apartment of 
a palestinian suspected of complicity in the bombing 
the lawyer for mohammed abo talb who is awaiting a verdict on 
separate charges related to terrorist bombings in scandinavia and 
holland asked the court to have the clothing returned the judge 
said he would decide by monday 
abo talb a former activist in the palestine popular struggle 
front was linked to flight 103 when it was established he was in 
malta two months before the plane explosion

of capital rape two counts of sexual battery possession of a 
firearm by a felon and 22 counts of kidnapping in the incident 
thursday at northside primary school said natchez police chief 
eddie jones 
adria bates 40 a teachers aide at the school suffered 
gunshot wounds to the scalp and back she was in good condition 
today at jefferson davis memorial hospital a nursing supervisor 
said 
mrs bates said she recently had filed for divorce and that 
bates had been hearing a lot of untrue rumors she did not 
elaborate 
it was humiliating to the children and to the other staff 
she said from her hospital bed 
the two teachers who were raped and beaten were treated at the 
hospital and released 
police and sheriffs deputies stormed the kindergarten classroom 
to end the hourlong standoff after a teacher grabbed a 38caliber 
revolver from bates assistant police chief george rutherford said 
a tragic situation was prevented with only one injury due 
to the quick wits of the teachers involved said adams county 
sheriff tommy ferrell these were pretty gutsy women that could 
do something of that sort 
rutherford said police received a report of a man on the campus 
about 130 pm 
officials quoted witnesses as saying bates shot at his wifes 
head 
two shots were fired in the classroom police said but it was 
not certain whether both struck her or whether her injures were 
caused by a ricocheting bullet 
rutherford said bates lined the 5 and 6yearold children in 
front of windows between himself and police and had the 
teachers cover the glass with paper 
there were four teachers and aides in the classroom when the 
incident began rutherford said but bates sent one for aspirin and 
had his wounded wife removed from the room 
officers said the man ordered the children to look away while he 
sexually assaulted the two teachers 
rutherford said jones talked to bates on the schools intercom 
system and distracted him long enough for one of the teachers to 
grab the weapon 
bates who had previously been convicted of burglary and 
assault was taken to the adams county jail

the state can still regulate who can own 
guns despite an amendment to nebraskas constitution that allows 
residents to bear arms in almost all circumstances the state 
supreme court ruled today 
the ruling came in the case of two men whose cases were 
dismissed by district judges who cited the amendment approved by 
voters in the nov 8 1988 general election 
defendants charles a comeau and larry rush of lincoln county 
contended that the amendments language must be read literally and 
that the language prevents any regulation by the legislature of the 
right to possess arms 
the state argued that the right to keep and bear arms is limited 
to lawful purposes 
there are very few rights which are absolute judge leslie 
boslaugh wrote in the state high courts opinion in every phase 
of everyday experience there are extremes beyond which some 
restraint or regulation is necessary for the common good 
most states regulate handgun ownership in some form boslaugh 
said prohibiting convicted felons for instance from possessing 
guns is widely accepted he said 
four states prohibit carrying a handgun without a license or 
permit and several states do not allow handguns to be concealed 
without a license boslaugh said 
we conclude that the right to keep and bear arms is not 
unlimited boslaugh wrote he added the state had the power to 
make reasonable regulations for the purpose of protecting the 
health safety and welfare of its citizens 
the controversial amendment to the nebraska constitution 
includes a part that reads the right to keep and bear arms for 
security or defense of self family home and others and for 
lawful common defense hunting recreational use and all other 
lawful purposes and such rights shall not be denied or infringed 
by the state or any subdivision thereof

two years after being proposed several major 
legislative recommendations from congressional irancontra 
investigators are being enacted into law over the grumblings of 
president bush 
bush on thursday signed the toughest of the provisions a 
requirement for an independent inspector general to monitor the 
activities of the central intelligence agency 
creation of the office similar to oversight posts at other 
government agencies that review federal programs and ferret out 
abuses was part of a broader bill authorizing a reported 25 
billion to 30 billion for us intelligence activities for the 
coming year 
bush last week approved a foreign aid bill containing a ban on 
use of us money to entice foreign governments into carrying out 
policies banned by us law the provision is a reaction to 
president reagans apparent use of aid money as a reward to 
honduras for harboring the contras in its territory along the 
nicaraguan border 
bush also is expected to sign a measure providing criminal 
penalties for sales of weapons to terrorist countries such as the 
armsforhostages deal with iran 
rep lee hamilton dind who chaired the house irancontra 
investigating panel said its primary finding was that the affair 
stemmed not from a failure of the law but a failure of individuals 
to obey it 
congress could not legislate fidelity to the law he said 
nonetheless the committees suggested a series of changes that 
would make it less likely that abuses could occur 
meanwhile irancontra prosecutor lawrence e walsh was quoted 
in todays washington post as saying the bush administration 
decided to adopt a stricter policy on releasing classified 
information for irancontra trials after former reagan white house 
aide oliver north was convicted in may for his role in the affair 
walsh said one consequence of the new policy was the 
administrations decision to block disclosure of classified 
documents in the trial of former cia official joseph f fernandez 
the post said that move led to the dismissal of the fernandez case 
last week 
leaders of the senate intelligence committee wrote attorney 
general dick thornburgh today asking for an explanation on why he 
blocked disclosure in the fernandez case 
specifically the committee would like to know the 
intelligence information of concern the probability it would have 
been disclosed and the possible consequences of its disclosures 
said sen david l boren dokla chairman of the committee and 
sen william s cohen of maine its senior republican 
the changes passed in the waning hours of this years 
congressional session were not unimportant provisions hamilton 
said other recommendations mostly dealing with how the president 
notifies congress of covert operations overseas will be hammered 
out next year and may be more difficult to enact he said 
bush accepted the changes despite protests that they 
unnecessarily tie his hands in carrying out foreign policy and amid 
cautionary statements that he will resist any effort by congress to 
use the new authority to micromanage the administrations 
activities 
bush said the new inspector general post could impair the 
ability of the cia to collect vitally needed intelligence 
information by creating a perception that confidentiality cannot be 
guaranteed 
the cia must be able to assure foreign individuals and 
organizations that their identities the fact of their association 
with the united states and the information they provide are not 
subject to exposure said bush himself a former cia director 
cia director william webster has said that while the provision 
could damage confidence of foreign intelligence services in us 
ability to keep secrets he would seek to rebuild safeguards 
against compromising intelligence sources and methods 
bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision that 
would let the cia director quash any inspector generals 
investigation he believed might compromise national security 
the inspector general would be appointed by the president and 
confirmed by the senate and the auditors reports would be 
available to the house and senate committees that oversee us 
intelligence 
currently the agencys inspector general is appointed by the 
cia director and reports only to him that arrangement has caused 
friction with the house ntelligence committee which has been 
denied access to some reports 
the congressional irancontra investigators said the agencys 
inspector general lacked independence and didnt have the 
manpower resources or tenacity to uncover armsforhostages 
transactions or the diversion of profits to nicaraguas contra 
rebels 
the implication was that as an underling of former cia director 
william casey who was deeply involved in the affair the inspector 
general lacked the muscle to detect or report irancontra abuses

rebel soldiers today abandoned their 
last strongholds in manila after bombing the presidential palace 
compound and seizing three military bases in the strongest bid yet 
to topple president corazon aquino 
us warplanes joined the battle to save the government as the 
attack began before dawn by sundown the philippine government had 
declared the coup a failure 
late tonight mutineers left the government television station 
and villamor air base the air force headquarters which they had 
seized in the early hours of the assault 
hundreds of mutinous marines also marched out of fort bonifacio 
their home garrison and members of all three groups marched 
together down a major thoroughfare toward camp aguinaldo 
headquarters of the armed forces general staff 
it was unclear what they intended to do when they got there but 
progovernment troops did not try to stop them occasionally 
rebels fired weapons in the air and pointed rifles at journalists 
trying to follow them 
earlier manila radio stations broadcast a statement from mrs 
aquino in which she said the enemy is routed but is not yet 
vanquished she was not seen on national television 
at sundown the military chief of staff gen renato de villa 
declared that the sixth coup attempt against mrs aquino was 
crushed and that loyal troops had recaptured armed forces 
headquarters at camp aquinaldo and the sangley point naval base 
at least 22 people were killed and 87 wounded during the coup 
attempt most of them civilians officials in the phillipines said 
estimates of the number of rebels ranged from 800 to 2000 
as their vintage planes fired on targets crowds of civilian 
onlookers cheered 
wow that was a great shot said cigarette vendor julio 
torres pointing toward the presidential palace but it would 
really be better if there could be a dog fight later on just like 
in the movies 
us f4 fighter jets flying combat air patrol roared over 
the capital from clark air base 50 miles from the capital said a 
us defense department spokesman air force lt col rick oborn 
he did not report any firing by the american planes 
rebel soldiers would not say who led the fighting when it began 
just after midnight thursday de villa said it was believed the 
mutineers were followers of lt col gregorio gringo honasan 
who led an august 1987 coup attempt in which at least 53 people 
died 
honasan has been at large since his escape from prison in april 
1988 honasan supported mrs aquino when she came to power four 
years ago in an uprising that ousted ferdinand marcos he then 
turned against her accusing her of failing to deal effectively 
with communist insurgents and not fighting corruption or improving 
the economy 
early today two t28 aircraft bombed and rocketed the 
presidential malacanang palace compound witnesses said two 
presidential guards and three other people were killed 
theyre bombing us a palace staff member cried over the 
telephone were going down 
when mutineers at the rebelheld government tv station saw the 
attack they cheered and shouted cory is dead 
but philippines ambassador emmanuel pelaez interviewed in 
washington today on nbcs today show said the palace was not 
hit 
mrs aquino was reported safe her latest comments were made at 
a cabinet dinner about 12 hours after the attack at malacanang 
palace according to private radio stations that broadcast them 
a bush administration official said us planes began flying 
over the sangley point and villamor bases shortly after the 
presidential authorization came at 1232 am est today 
david andresen a spokesman at the us embassy in manila said 
at 810 am est that he had not heard any planes flying overhead 
for an hour 
the bush administration official said us ground troops were 
not involved 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
american planes were intended to prevent rebel planes from taking 
off this allowed the philippine government to consolidate its 
forces 
a spokesman for the rebels speaking on condition he not be 
named said his forces had declared themselves a provisional 
revolutionary government he said the us move was an affront to 
filipino sovereignty 
the us military has 40000 troops military dependents and 
defense department civilians stationed at six bases in the 
philippines the us military presence here is strongly opposed in 
the philippines senate 
mrs aquino has not said where she stands on renewal of the 
lease for the bases which runs out in 1991 
the rebels appeared to be mainly from the army and marines 
as the assault began they were transporting large amounts of 
ammunition to villamor from nearby fort bonifacio in addition to 
villamor they seized parts of manilas main airport and bombed 
government installations through the day 
local reporters said rebels also seized the airport near 
legazpi 220 miles southeast of manila retired brig gen jesus 
hermosa a security adviser in cebu province said a boatload of 
mutineers landed near cebu citys mactan international airport 350 
miles southeast of manila mactan is the countrys second major 
airport 
a rebel bomb knocked out the governments rpn television and 
rebel forces held a private television station witnesses reported 
two progovernment soldiers and three civilians were killed during 
clashes near rpn 
rebel helicopters and propellerdriven planes repeatedly bombed 
the philippine constabulary headquarters at manilas camp crame 
setting the main building ablaze 
other bombs landed across the street at camp aguinaldo the 
armed forces headquarters one heavily damaged de villas home 
thousands of civilians fled neighborhoods around the suburban 
military garrisons 
de villa estimated rebel strength at 800 a mutinous captain put 
the figure at 2000 de villa claimed troops remained loyal in 
northern luzon mindanao and in the southern luzon command 
but gov rudolfo aguinaldo of cagayan province said in a radio 
interview later that soldiers in his northern luzon area supported 
the mutiny 
unlike the august 1987 coup attempt when civilians poured into 
the streets to back mrs aquino and cheer government forces this 
time they watched in silence as planes pounded the garrison 
besides dissatisfaction within the military public discontent 
with the aquino government has been growing because of rising 
prices a shortage of electricity and allegations of corruption

sporadic fighting between 
leftist rebels and government forces was reported outside the 
capital today but san salvador was calm and some residents used 
the lull to repair their damaged homes 
others in the capital fearing more battles in coming weeks 
closed up their homes and headed for refuge with relatives or 
abroad 
todays calm followed two days of combat that forced the 
evacuation of many people from the citys wealthy neighborhoods 
including nearly 300 americans 
elsewhere assault rifle fire was heard outside zacatecoluca a 
provincial capital 25 miles southeast of san salvador residents 
reported two o2 observation planes fired several rockets at 
suspected guerrilla positions outside the city of 75000 people 
for the first time in the 10yearold civil war the guerrillas 
reportedly fired a surfacetoair missile on wednesday in 
zacatecoluca 
the sam7 fired at a a37 jet fighter missed its mark but air 
force pilots obviously were worried about the missiles 
zacatecoloca residents contacted by telephone said the o2s were 
flying very low which makes them harder to hit with the missiles 
but easier to hit with rifle fire 
a total of 282 americans many living in two san salvador 
neighborhoods under attack this week fled the country thursday 
when the guerrillas declared a sixhour truce us embassy 
personnel and dependents were among those who departed in two 
chartered planes 
the neighborhoods on the west and southwest side of the city 
were the scene of a surprise rebel incursion late tuesday and early 
wednesday that turned their stately treelined streets and 
carefully tended lawns into battle zones 
leaders of the farabundo marti national liberation front rebel 
organization said the invasion was part of the rebels biggest 
offensive in the decadeold war which was launched nov 11 
infiltrating in small groups under cover of darkness the 
guerrillas had seized and entrenched themselves in about 40 homes 
in the neighborhoods 
there were no reports of civilian casualties from the fierce 
fighting the number of combatants killed was not known although 
reporters at the time counted 11 bodies in battle gear lying in the 
area 
by nightfall thursday when a dusktodawn curfew went into 
effect the rebels vanished as silently as they had come and no 
more shooting could be heard 
but the neighborhoods remained littered with spent cartridges 
burnedout luxury cars downed power lines and some damaged homes 
and mansions and a few rebel dead 
one of the bodies in escalon had been burned by soldiers and 
dumped headfirst into a mesh trash can outside a mansion a crude 
cardboard sign scrawled with a skull and crossbones jammed beside 
the charred remains 
written on the piece of cardboard was a sign in spanish saying 
the soldiers take no prisoners there is no man no law that 
holds us back the sign added 
one infantryman with a shoulderlength mop of hair lounged by 
the trash can he thought hed scare us the soldier explained 
laughing we burned him 
before departing the rebels set the national information center 
ablaze 
the center was set up nov 12 when the government suspended 
constitutional guarantees declared a stateofsiege imposed 
censorship on salvadoran news media and forced the networks to 
broadcast its news programs several hours every day 
president alfredo cristianis rightist government sunday accused 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government of smuggling the missiles 
and other military supplies to the rebels and suspended diplomatic 
relations with the neighboring country 
cristani denounced the sandinistas a day after a two small 
planes were caught reportedly ferrying the military hardware 
he said both planes had taken off from nicaragua nicaraguas 
president daniel ortega did not deny the charge 
the united states which has been supporting a succession of 
salvadoran governments with military and economic aid protested to 
the soviet union which had been supplying the sandinistas 
regularly with weapons over the years 
president bush said he would also bring up the issue during a 
summit meeting he is holding off the coast of malta with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev 
more than 71000 people have been killed most of them 
civilians since the civil war began oct 15 1979 according to 
human rights groups 
on thursday the military searched the homes of two us 
freelance journalists and that of ricardo chacon the salvadoran 
bureau chief of the spanish news agency acanefe and warned news 
agencies to be objective in their reporting

ten tibetan members of a proindependence group 
including at least eight buddhist monks were sentenced to prison 
terms in the tibetan capital of lhasa official reports said friday 
the 10 received sentences thursday ranging from five to 19 years 
for forming a counterrevolutionary organization in january the 
xinhua news agency said 
at least eight of those convicted were monks from the drepung 
monastery a community of more than 400 monks on the outskirts of 
lhasa and one of the centers of buddhistled proindependence 
unrest in lhasa in the past two years 
the reports said the organization collected information and 
mimeographed reactionary leaflets for their foreign boss an 
apparent reference to tibets exiled spiritual leader the dalai 
lama 
the dalai lama who has lived in exile in india since fleeing 
tibet after a failed uprising against the chinese military in 1959 
on dec 10 will receive the nobel peace prize for his efforts to 
achieve indpendence for his homeland through peaceful means 
china has strongly objected to the decision to award the dalai 
lama the prize saying he has incited reactionary forces trying to 
split the nation 
the beijing government imposed martial law in lhasa on march 8 
after three days of violent riots the fourth major outbreak of 
antichinese disturbances in the city since the fall of 1987 
in september tibetan courts sentenced 10 men including at

former president jimmy carter and 
delegations from sudans government and rebel groups began talks 
friday aimed at ending the north african nations nearly 7yearold 
war 
immediately after a brief opening session however both sides 
recessed for the day out of respect for the moslem friday sabbath 
and were scheduled to reopen their discussions saturday 
carter said he would chair only the first day of talks after 
which the negotiations will proceed without a mediator at the 
delegations request 
he traveled to sudan and ethiopia this month for meetings with 
sudanese rebel and government leaders that resulted in bringing the 
warring parties together he was expected to leave kenya on sunday 
but said he would remain available should his help be needed 
carter has been in nairobi since nov 19 when he arrived to 
chair 10 days of preliminary peace talks between warring ethiopian 
factions those negotiations ended wednesday with both sides 
agreeing to begin substantive talks next year 
like the ethiopian talks the sudanese negotiations are 
openended and will take place in secret at a private nairobi 
residence provided by the kenyan government 
it is the second time the highlevel delegations have met to 
discuss an end to the war in sudan that has displaced millions of 
people and killed hundreds of thousands they met in ethiopias 
capital addis ababa in august but broke off after two days 
without making any progress 
three main issues are set to be discussed the stickiest being 
the application of sharia law the harsh islamic penal code 
employed by sudans government which the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army wants lifted the other measures the rebels seek 
before considering a ceasefire are the abrogation of sudans 
military pacts with libya and egypt and the lifting of the 
nations state of emergency 
i have no doubt that after dealing with the first issue the 
other two questions can be resolved said carter 
however the talks also are seeking agreements that would allow 
for the resumption of southern sudan relief flights which the 
government suspended in early november after renewed fighting with 
the rebels 
both sides had observed a de facto ceasefire begun in april when 
a unorganized relief operation began moving large amounts of 
food and supplies into southern sudan to avert widespread famine 
but the ceasefire broke down in october in battles for a 
western border town and continued into november with the bombings 
of several rebelheld towns 
during the opening ceremony the rebels called on the 
international community to put pressure on sudans government to 
allow the flights to resume 
use of food as a weapon is a most uncivilized and deplorable 
military strategy and we call upon all governments organizations 
and people of good will to bring pressure to bear on the khartoum 
junta to lift this unfortunate relief embargo said rebel 
delegation leader lam akol 
the relief effort sought to avert a repeat of 1988s tragedy 
when an estimated 250000 southern sudanese died in a famine made 
worse by war 
the rebels took up arms against sudans moslemdominated 
government in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and economic reforms 
for the predominantly christian and animist south

the cia has reported that some senior 
philippine officials are worried that entire segments of their 
armed forces supposedly loyal to president corazon aquino will fail 
to fight effectively in fending off the rebels attempting to 
topple her government an administration source said today 
the central intelligence agency in its daily intellgence 
summary prepared for top us officials reported that the 
situation in the philippines remains quite uncertain said the 
official speaking on condition he not be identified by name 
its all very gauzy stuff said the source who added that 
the assessment was open to change given the fluid situation on the 
ground in the philippines 
the report came as rear adm edward d sheafer a defense 
intelligence agency official told reporters at a pentagon briefing 
were cautiously optimistic based upon reports we have from 
the philippine government that the government forces seem to be 
prevailing 
sheafer went asked how much support the rebel forces had 
outside manila said its difficult to judge how well its 
organized he added that recent reports indicate the npa the 
communists were not playing an active role in the rebellion 
the dual reports came just hours after president bush ordered 
us fighters into action to provide air cover for two philippine 
air bases and help defend the aquino government against a coup 
attempt 
pentagon spokesman pete williams who joined sheafer at the 
briefing said no us planes have fired any shots or 
intercepted any rebel aircraft 
the administration source said that the cia relayed an 
assessment during the early morning hours to washington that was 
based on the judgments of some senior philippine officials 
the report questioned whether the philippine military will 
fight effectively on mrs aquinos behalf because of low morale 
among the troops the source said 
the official said the assessment did not detail exactly how 
widespread the discontent might be in the philippine military but

a military policeman found with 11 homemade 
bombs in his car trunk was facing courtmartial and had concocted 
an escape plot in which he planned to lob the bombs at anyone in 
his way investigators said today 
senior airman james wilcox 22 of griffiss air force base was 
arrested at the park inn motel in rome thursday night police 
officer mike dunn said 
wilcox was arrested after police were tipped that the airman had 
homemade bombs in his car trunk investigator james masucci said 
the bombs were made from carbon dioxide cartridges and were 
very dangerous masucci said he would not be more specific 
wilcox was scheduled to be courtmartialed saturday on larceny 
and housebreaking charges said griffiss spokesman carl sahre the 
airman told police he had planned to escape if he was found guilty 
masucci said 
the bombs were strapped to a bandoleer that wilcox apparently 
planned to wear so he could throw the explosives at patrol cars 
military police civilians or anyone in his way masucci said 
he had it right down to a science the investigator said 
the bombs were stored in wilcoxs car along with a police scanner 
and survival gear that would allow him to live in the woods and 
evade searchers masucci said 
i cant imagine why he would go through all this sahre 
said i cant see why he wouldnt just go awol if he was that 
worried abut the courtmartial 
wilcox was put on limited duty as a base security officer after 
his arrest on the theft charges in may sahre said he was not 
confined to quarters and was allowed to leave the base he said 
he could have taken off any time sahre said 
the courtmartial would go ahead as planned if griffiss 
officials can arrange to have wilcox brought back to the base from 
the oneida county jail where he was being held sahre said 
if convicted in the court martial wilcox could be confined at 
griffiss or sent to the military prison in leavenworth kan he 
said 
his arraignment on charges of criminal possession of dangerous 
weapons was postponed from this morning until monday

about 70 demonstrators were arrested today 
after they sat down on pennsylvania avenue in front of the white 
house to protest what they called the governments lack of 
leadership in the aids epidemic 
those taking part in the civil disobedience were among some 200 
people who attended a rally marking world aids day 
were here because were angry at our country and our 
administrations response to this epidemic said urvashi vaid of 
the national gay and lesbian task force 
the demonstration came a day after president bush declared that 
education is the nations best weapon against aids 
our hearts go out to those afflicted as our heads work toward 
finding solutions bush said in a statement thursday before 
leaving for the malta summit in the meantime we must continue 
to educate those around us regarding the prevention of this 
terrible disease 
where are you george asked ms vaid leading the crowd in 
lafayette park in a chant of where is george where is george 
paul boneberg executive director of mobilization against aids 
a san francisco group said we do not have the resources in our 
groups to meet this challenge we see people who need treatment but 
who are denied treatmentwe see discrimination still across the 
country and theres no government response its shameful 
the groups said they would issue a report card giving bush 
failing grades for his response 
bush has failed to provide a national aids strategy has not 
pushed for adequate funding for prevention care research and 
treatment and has not responded to the growing burden aids is 
placing on the nations health care system said rene durazzo 
spokesman for more than a dozen groups including the national 
association of people with aids and the aids action council 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said world 
aids day will provide an opportunity to reinforce preventive 
measures and show compassion for those infected 
more than 112000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states and more than 66000 have died sullivan said 
this is only the tip of the iceberg because the public 
health services estimates that about 1 million americans may have 
already been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv that causes aids sullivan said 
though there is no cure new treatments that can prolong the 
lives of those infected make it more important those at risk get 
tested sullivan said 
aids and hiv will be with us for years to come sullivan 
said but each one of us can combat its further spread by making 
wise choices about personal behavior choices based on the fact 
that hiv is transmitted by having sex or sharing needles with an 
infected partner 
and secure in the knowledge that hiv is not spread by casual 
nonsexual contact each one of us can help lessen the impact of 
aids by giving practical and compassionate help to those who have 
been infected by hiv or who live with aids itself 
bush in his statement acknowledged that though the aids 
problem is great and taxing our health care system now far 
greater difficulties await us in terms of human suffering and 
provision of health care 
we have committed resources at an unprecedented rate to 
hivrelated research of all kinds he said promising we will 
continue the most vigorous research efforts 
at the same time we must also educate and prevent the 
disease is spread through known ways and it is clear that 
education on the facts is our best means of combating aids at this 
time he said

the nicaraguan foreign ministry has 
refused visas to a 20member delegation appointed by president bush 
to observe next years general election saying such a panel would 
not be impartial 
from the point of view of his credibility before us the very 
fact that mr bush has been the one to appoint this commission is 
enough for it to be totally discredited said a ministry 
communique issued late thursday 
the communique said the vote wednesday in the us congress to 
continue nonlethal aid to the antisandinista rebels known as 
contras will allow the contras to keep infiltrating their bands 
into nicaragua to assassinate our people and create confusion in 
the electoral process 
the general election is scheduled for feb 25 
the foreign ministry also complained about 9 million approved 
by congress in october to aid the campaign of presidential 
candidate violeta barrios de chamorro of the united national 
opposition 
uno as the 14party bloc is known in english is the strongest 
challenger to the ruling sandinista national liberation front 
there exists a clear incompatilibity between pretending to buy 
the election of a candidate while at the same time pretending to be 
accepted as impartial observers in our elections the communique 
said 
scores of international observers have been invited to supervise 
the elections including teams from the united nations the 
organization of american states and the european parliament 
the communique said that the organizations and individuals 
invited by the government of nicaragua are experienced honest and 
impartial 
the same unfortunately cannot be said of president bush 
nor therefore of any commission appointed by him to observe the 
elections in nicaragua the communique said 
it said there are many genuine democrats in congress and 
we trust in their capacity to understand that these declarations 
are not in any way directed at them as individuals

the philippines have a unique link to the 
united states that began in the spanishamerican war in 1898 when 
adm george dewey sailed into manila bay defeated the spanish navy 
and accepted the surrender of spains only asian colony 
this week nearly a century later the military ties were 
reinforced when the bush administration ordered f4 phantom jets to 
make a show of force to help corazon aquinos government defend 
itself against an attempted coup 
the flights over rebelheld basst evidence of a 
continuing strong american relationship with the onetime us 
colony that is now home to the two largest us foreign military 
installations 
president bush authorized the us military support early friday 
while en route to maltes were the latea for the ussoviet summit 
besides air cover from us fighter jets over the rebelheld air 
bases a contingent of about 100 marines was sent to manila to help 
guard the us embassy compound there a pentagon official said 
the attempt to oust aquino was the most serious since she was 
swept to power in a civilianmilitary uprising in february 1986 
that forced the late president ferdinand e marcos into exile 
just a few weeks ago mrs aquino visited wasuss the 
future of clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller 
installations the future of american military bases is considered 
the most important and most controversial issue facing the two 
countries 
some filipinos view a continued us military presence as an 
infringement on philippine sovereignty and an unwanted leftover 
from the former us colonial administration 
but us officials regard the bases as vital for projecting 
american military power throughout southeast asian sea lanes and 
for stability in the pacific the us bases serve as a 
counterpoint to soviet naval forces based in vietnam 
the bases are officially under philippine command but in 
effect are run by the united states the military bases agreement 
was signed in 1947 the year after the philippines became 
independent and come up for renewal every five years 
more than 60000 filipinos are employed at the bases where 
about 40000 us troops and their dependents are stationed 
the united states has been the philippine militarys main arms 
supplier in its 20yearold battle with communist rebels 
in october vice president dan quayle said the administration 
might ask congress to let the philippines use us foreign aid to 
bolster internal security against communist insurgents quayles 
comments came after two american military base workers were 
ambushed and killed by communist rebels 
two years ago three americans were killed by communist rebels 
near clark air base rebels have threatened more attacks because of 
us support for mrs aquinos counterinsurgency campaign 
during mrs aquinos recent visit us and philippine officials 
signed a 25 million aid agreement to lay the groundwork for 
transportation and other infrastructure projects 
when mrs aquino visited the united states after first taking 
office congress rushed through a 200 million aid package for the 
philippines now however some lawmakers believe economic reform 
and increased trade would do more to improve filipinos living 
standards than increased economic aid would 
the usphilippine relationship has not been without acrimony 
and even bloodshed 
the americans forged the alliance with filipino rebels led by 
emilio aguinaldo who had declared independence from spain two 
months earlier however pressure mounted in the united states on 
president william mckinley to annex the philippines as a colony and 
deny philippine independence 
on feb 6 1899 with just a vote to spare the us senate 
ratified a treaty formally ending the spanishamerican war and 
ceding the philippines to the united states 
that triggered the philippine insurrections a bloody 
threeyear conflict in which according to philippine records 
250000 us troops slaughtered 1 million filipinos 
the united states granted the philippines independence july 4 
1946

the supreme court on friday dropped a 
muchwatched illinois abortion dispute from its schedule of cases 
to be argued next week 
an outofcourt settlement was announced in chicago last week 
eliminating the case that had been viewed as the high courts most 
likely opportunity to alter its 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
as anticipated the justices granted a request from both sides 
that supreme court arguments be deferred pending a formal 
settlement the argument session had been scheduled for tuesday 
the settlement must be approved by a federal judge before it 
becomes final the case will remain on the supreme court docket in 
limbo until the judge acts and both sides then ask the justices to 
dismiss the case 
the key issue in the illinois dispute is a set of strict 
regulations imposed on abortion clinics where most earlypregnancy 
abortions are performed the regulations could have severely 
restricted the availability of abortions in that state 
a federal judge struck down many of the state regulations and 
that ruling was upheld by the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
illinois attorney general neil hartigans appeal to the supreme 
court was accepted for review last july 3 the same day the 
justices announced in a missouri case a decision giving states 
far greater authority to regulate abortions 
but hartigan a democratic candidate for governor in 1990 later 
sought a settlement in which illinois women would be guaranteed 
continued access to abortions 
the case is turnock vs ragsdale 88790

the state house began debate today after a oneday 
delay on a tax package intended to raise more than a billion 
dollars to fend off deficits resulting from the fizzling of the 
massachusetts miracle 
speaker george keverian lobbied all day thursday without getting 
enough votes to pass the package of sales capital gains and 
gasoline tax increases 
the first amendment offered today was a proposal to strip a 
capital gains tax increase worth 100 million a year from the bill 
which originally totaled 12 billion 
this debate is the unfortunate but inevitable conclusion of 
not weeks not months but years of actions and inactions that 
brought the commonwealth of massachusetts and this house to this 
point republican leader steven pierce said in urging defeat of 
the package pierce supported the amendment 
the original house ways and means committee package would have 
raised the sales tax from 5 percent to 7 percent increased the gas 
tax by 10 cents over the next two years and hiked the capital gains 
tax from 5 percent to 75 percent 
keverian said democratic legislative leaders were considering 
increasing the sales tax to 6 percent he said the compromise would 
cost 190 million in new revenue this fiscal year and about 400 
million next year 
most increases would take effect jan 1 1990 but the capital 
gains tax hike would be retroactive to last january 
keverian said the loss would be made up with additional cuts and 
possibly some additional revenue in the tax package he would not 
predict the outcome of a vote on an amendment he expects some house 
members to offer to remove the capitalgains tax hike from the bill 
the tax proposal was attached to a 45 million survival 
package that would restore funds to social service and education 
programs 
gov michael s dukakis indicated he had some reservations about 
the package but urged lawmakers to approve it 
dukakis captured the 1988 democratic presidential nomination in 
part by touting his states economic miracle after the 
election massachusetts fiscal fortunes plummeted partly because 
of the end of a boom caused by the nations military buildup 
he said thursday he realized taxes were unpopular but urged 
elected officials to take a tough stand and not make only the 
popular votes 
if theres anything weve got to have now its fiscal 
stability dukakis said and thats what this package is going 
to bring 
keverian had told several committee chairmen they should resign 
if they could not support it tax foes including the houses 
republican minority decried what they said were strongarm tactics 
several lawmakers said the changes in the tax package were 
needed to win support from a majority of the 160member house 
i think it is clear as the package stands we are short of the 
81 votes needed to pass it said rep marjorie clapprood a 
supporter of the package 
news of the package sent taxpayers to their telephones one of 
two switchboard operators at the statehouse said she was handling 
more than 100 calls every 15 minutes 
clapprood suggested shutting off the statehouse switchboard and 
locking lawmakers in the house chamber to get the tax bill passed

mobil oil corp pleaded no contest to 
misdemeanor charges stemming from two pipeline ruptures that poured 
more than 130000 gallons of crude oil into the los angeles river 
and the citys sewers 
the pleas were entered thursday in los angeles municipal court 
on two violations of a state fish and game code section prohibiting 
the release of petroleum or petroleum residue into state waters 
mobil attorney ernest j getto said the pleas just mean were 
not going to contest the charges 
its not at all tantamount to a guilty plea he said 
the maximum fine for each violation is 1000 however city 
attorney james hahn said he would ask at mobils jan 4 sentencing 
hearing that the company be ordered to pay 100000 in cleanup 
costs 
we asked for the sentencing hearing to be delayed in order 
to give the various agencies involved in the cleanup of spills the 
time to prepare presentations for restitution from mobil hahn 
said in a prepared statement 
agencies involved in the cleanup were the us coast guard 
state department of fish and game los angeles police department 
and los angeles fire department 
the first pipeline break occurred sept 10 1988 in the 
suburban encino area and sent 90000 gallons of crude oil onto city 
streets the oil eventually flowed into the sewers and the los 
angeles river 
the second occurred 17 days later as the pipeline was being 
repaired 
the line carries 26 million gallons of oil a day from kern 
county oil fields to mobils torrance refinery 
temperature changes in the oil caused the pipeline to corrode 
and rupture the first time said deputy city attorney vincent b 
sato he said there was no indication of negligence 
getto said the company has since revised its monitoring 
procedures and has begun replacing older sections of the pipeline

assurance supervisor flew to california last summer to buy 
products labeled as maple syrup upon returning to vermont the 
products were tested and found to be 98 percent corn syrup

you knew good maple you would be able to tell right away 
martell passed the information to us food and drug 
administration officials they arrested nathan pilgrim 66 of 
dekalb miss on 12 felony counts of using corn syrup and other 
ingredients in products labeled as maple syrup honey sorghum 
molasses and ribbon cane syrup

recalled 
vermont is the leading producer of maple syrup in the united 
states this year the industry will produce about 400000 gallons 
of the syrup and generate between 40 million and 50 million 
clark said 
clark said the fake maple syrup hurts both the image and 
pocketbooks of vermont syrup makers the doctored syrup probably 
contained no maple syrup and was being sold for about half the 
price of real maple syrup he said 
martell said a product must contain 100 percent maple syrup to 
be labeled as pure a smaller percentage requires the label to 
say blended flavored or sweetened and to list the 
percentage of maple syrup in its ingredients

imagine a story that begins at the end and ends 
at the beginning 
that is the tricky dramatic framework tom stoppard has devised 
for artist descending a staircase an intriguing 85minute 
entertainment that arrived thursday at broadways helen hayes 
theater 
the play is small in scale but superbly crafted down to the 
most minute production detail particularly tony straiges 
intricate rube goldberglike settings although it doesnt have 
the scope or characterizations of such major stoppard efforts as 
the real thing or rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead 
its a richly rewarding piece of theater 
the evening is divided into 11 scenes which go from the present 
to the past and then back again to the present stoppard wrote 
artist descending a staircase for the radio 17 years ago but 
it was staged last year at a pub in north london and later in the 
west end before making the trek to broadway 
artist descending a staircase is a play about perception 
how three men all of them artists look at life love and art 
and their views are just as fractured as the nude in marcel 
duchamps famous painting 
artist descending a staircase is also a mystery who did in 
one of the artists found dead at the bottom of the stairs as the 
play opens the riddle is eventually solved but not before stoppard 
examines the lives of the three men 
donner john mcmartin is a bornagain romantic a onetime 
member of the avantgarde who once carved edible sugar sculptures 
it will give cubism a new lease on life says one of the other 
artists but who now has returned to more traditional forms of 
portrait painting beauchamp harold gould is a sound artist 
tape recording the noises of everyday life martello paxton 
whitehead concentrates on completing a hideous statue of a 
longdead girlfriend using fake pearls for teeth and pears for 
breasts 
in his journey backward in time stoppard also puts the aging 
artists younger selves on stage they are all infatuated with 
sophie a blind girl who died in 1922 after falling out of a 
window she was in love with one of them but which one reality is 
quite different from belief stoppard says 
the playwright has great fun making fun of artistic pretensions 
skill without imagination is craftsmanship sniffs donner 
imagination without skill gives us modern art 
mcmartin gould and whitehead are an appealing trio of cranky 
old artists particularly whitehead who turns martellos 
moroseness into high comic art their younger counterparts are 
played by michael winther michael cumpsty and jim fyfe their 
resemblance to the older men is remarkable and stephanie roth is 
appealing as the tragic sophie the muse for most of these artists 
careers 
tim luscombe has directed the play with astonishing skill 
despite the complicated time sequence it is always clear where and 
when the characters are straiges best set is the aging artists 
studio an almost surreal room filled with old paintings bicycle 
wheels and assorted junk from creating 50 years of art 
special mention should go to tharon mussers lighting which 
makes the scene changes all the more dazzling and the music and 
sound effects by kevin malpass which are an important part of the 
story 
stoppard has called the play a love story but it is more than 
that artist descending a staircase is a memory play in which 
the playwright swirls together the peculiar and very different 
memories of three friends and fellow artists it makes for a heady 
mixture often witty and just a little bit sad 
</TEXT>

what other critics said 
frank rich the new york york times i dont have to tell you 
that mr stoppard is clever in this 85minute work that 
cleverness is not harnessed to a major play but to an often 
stimulating sporadically funny and at one uncharacteristic 
juncture genuinely moving investigation of the nature of 
perception memory and art 
howard kissel daily news artist descending a staircase 
is like a faberge egg it is very much an artifact fashioned for 
aristocratic temperaments its glittering surfaces reflect one 
another gracefully precisely giving off glints of brilliant 
color hinting at unsuspected depths

a federal appeals court ruled friday that 
first city financial corp and businessman marc belzberg violated 
securities law and must turn over 27 million in profits from the 
attempted takeover of ashland oil co 
in a 30 decision the us court of appeals upheld a lower 
court decision that the canadian company founded by the belzberg 
family deliberately evaded federal reporting requirements when 
first city purchased ashland stock 
anyone who buys more than 5 percent of a companys securities 
must disclose that fact within 10 days to the securities and 
exchange commission 
on march 4 1986 belzberg a first city vice president 
telephoned alan greenberg chief executive officer of bear stearns 
a wall street brokerage firm and discussed buying ashland stock 
the sec contended belzberg asked greenberg to make the purchase for 
first citys account belzberg said he intended for greenberg to 
buy ashland for the brokerage companys own account 
greenberg interpreted belzbergs call as an order to buy ashland 
stock for first city first city filed the required disclosure 
statement on march 26 12 days after the deadline 
during the period before it unveiled its takeover plan first 
city took pains to keep its interest in ashland secret said 
the appeals court the very last thing belzberg would do in light 
of those efforts would be to tout ashland to the bear stearns 
officer 
if belzbergs purpose had been to induce others to buy ashland 
he presumably would have contacted more than just bear stearns 
he would have openly disclosed his interest in a possible takeover 
of ashland to all of wall street said the opinion by appeals 
court judge laurence silberman 
the appeals court said first city must surrender 27 million 
representing the companys profits on the shares of ashland stock 
it purchased during the 12 days before it filed the disclosure 
statement 
the lower court reasoned that first city was able to buy its 
shares at an artificially low price because the company hadnt 
disclosed its stake in ashland oil

president bush urged mikhail s 
gorbachev on the eve of their superpower summit friday to help mold 
a future free of both tyranny and fear the soviet leader 
concluded a historic vatican visit with a pledge of new religious 
freedoms back home 
our meeting here off malta will last two days but the freedoms 
that we seek must last for generations the president said in 
anticipation of his first summit session with the soviet leader 
gorbachev addressed pope john paul ii as your holiness 
during their meeting he said people have a right to satisfy 
their spiritual needs and pledged swift adoption of a new 
religious law guaranteeing freedom of worship 
bush was the first to arrive for the two days of shipboard 
summit talks but his lastminute summit preparations were 
interrupted by an attempted coup in the philippines which he 
sought to snuff out by committing us air support to forces loyal 
to president corazon aquino 
gorbachev arranged an evening arrival for the summit taking 
place against a backdrop of stunning change in eastern europe that 
has swept hardline regimes from power the two men are also 
expected to discuss arms control trade relations and conflicts 
such as afghanistan and nicaragua as well 
gray clouds cold weather and choppy seas set the scene for the 
talks being conducted on us and soviet warships anchored in the 
harbor off the coast of this mediterranean island maltas entire 
1200man military and most of its 1000 police were out in force 
to protect the superpower leaders 
us and maltese patrol boats circled and frogmen checked the 
waters as bush landed by helicopter on the american guidedmissile 
cruiser uss belknap his command post and the meeting site sunday 
for the summit the summit will open saturday morning on the soviet 
guided missile cruiser slava 
beyond promising religious tolerance gorbachev said the kremlin 
will establish diplomatic ties with the vatican he invited the 
pope to pay a visit to the soviet union officially an atheist 
nation although no date was announced 
bush talked of the philippines as well as the summit 
i strongly support mrs aquino and she knows it he said he 
said the situation in manila sounds maybe a little better but 
hard to tell 
during a brief visit to the american aircraft carrier the uss 
forrestal 
bush called gorbachev a dynamic new soviet leader willing 
to think anew 
and we want him to succeed the president said because we 
do admire the people in the soviet union and we know that ours is 
an historic opportunity to foster the peace bush expressed hope 
that ours can be a future free of both tyranny and fear 
he presented the forrestals crew with a piece of the crumbling 
berlin wall as a symbol of the peace we seek 
he watched a demonstration of warplanes being catapulted off the 
deck and screeching into the sky a thunderous sonic boom from an 
f14 caught him by surprise and bushs knees buckled and he 
ducked he recovered quickly with a sheepish grin and a funny face 
for cameras 
gorbachev delivered his promise of religious freedom as he 
joined the pope at a news conference in the vatican 
people of many confessions including christians moslems 
jews buddhists and others live in the soviet union the kremlin 
leader said all of them have a right to satisfy their spiritual 
needs 
he said a freedom of conscience law would be adopted soon 
the pope called the meeting a promisefilled sign for the 
future and pledged support for gorbachevs efforts to overhaul 
soviet society 
the malta summit is the first superpower meeting since gorbachev 
met then president ronald reagan in new york last december bush 
attended that meeting as vice president 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii will lead a 
sixperson us delegation while gorbachev and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze will lead the eightperson soviet team 
bush who is expected to make the opening presentation saturday 
convened a meeting in the belknap wardroom of senior us advisers 
focusing on issues which will demonstrate the us desire for 
progress and improvement in eastwest relations said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater

furnished with deep blue carpeting leather furniture and a 
mahogany desk with us and soviet flags in a holder a new brass 
plaque was on the door reading president bush 
echoing statements by us officials a top soviet spokesman 
said friday he doubted that any agreements would be signed during 
the summit 
i think president bush is right when he says there will be no 
concrete agreement signed during the actual meeting said 
valentin falin head of the international department of the soviet 
communist party 
but falin an architect of soviet policy toward europe hinted 
that gorbachev would press bush toward accords on banning nuclear 
weapons from the mediterranean sea which the united states 
opposes and for coping with political changes sweeping eastern 
europe

americas nato allies are keeping a 
wary watch on this weekends summit at malta concerned it might 
produce a secret superpower agreement on europe despite president 
bushs promise of no surprises 
allies in western europe are worried the superpowers could cut a 
deal that would include a hefty reduction of us troops from 
europe say diplomats and analysts 
theres always apprehension among some allies when the big 
kids get together said jane sharp senior researcher at the 
stockholm international peace research institute in sweden 
added one senior nato official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity were in such a critical historical period that 
apprehension is running high regardless of what happens people 
just dont know whats coming 
us allies would be quite content in fact to see bush and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs shipboard summit be a quiet 
one with no dramatic agreements 
but while us officials have sought to minimize chances of a 
superpower agreement a top kremlin official in malta hinted friday 
that gorbachev might use the weekend summit to try to nudge bush 
toward accords on the shape of eastern europe and on banning 
nuclear weapons in the mediterranean 
the importance of achieving preliminary agreements on a host 
of issues including the mediterranean and europe is of course 
great and that is precisely the reason for our meeting said 
valentin falin the head of the international department of the 
soviet communist party 
bush has stressed that the summit will not focus on arms control 
and that he would not spring any suprises on us allies the 
president also has said he will not discuss eastern eurpopean 
boundaries with gorbachev 
gorbachev however is known for his unpredictability 
compounding the concern to us allies is the memory of the 1986 
summit in reykjavik when the soviet leader caught thenpresident 
reagan off guard by unveilling sweeping arms control proposals the 
talks broke down over the strategic defense initiative also known 
as star wars but not until reagan and gorbachev had flirted with a 
deal to do away with all nuclear weapons 
the allies were furious such discussions took place without 
consultations 
everything has been done to prevent that sort of horror 
scenario said a senior dutch official at nato who demanded 
anonymity 
the weekend talks in the mediterranean occur against a backdrop 
of momentous political and economic change in the soviet union and 
eastern europe the crumbling of hardline regimes in east germany 
bulgaria and czechoslovakia combined with the earlier reforms in 
poland and hungary mean the military threat from the east has been 
reduced dramatically at the same time the question of reshaping 
borders and alliances has been raised 
wanting to make sure their voices werent ignored leaders of 
the 12 nations of the european community called an emergency summit 
to discuss the changes in eastern europe 
british prime minister margaret thatcher made a quick trip to 
the united states to talk to bush afterward she said she did not 
expect great or unusual pronouncements from malta 
added french president francois mitterrand it is normal and 
desirable that they meet but i dont expect them to decide 
anything in our place 
bush will meet monday in brussels with other leaders of the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization to fill them in on his 
talks 
one nato diplomat demanding anonymity said some europeans were 
concerned that a farreaching kind of mindset or framework or 
understanding would come out of the superpower summit and lead to 
significant cuts in the number of american soldiers on the 
continent 
he said the allies were worried about trimming us forces 
beyond the levels under negotiation at conventional arms talks in 
vienna 
the united states wants to wrap up an accord on conventional 
armed forces in europe by june defense secretary dick cheney has 
raised the possibility of a second set of negotiations to reduce 
arms further 
the vienna bargaining between nato and the warsaw pact is 
designed to reduce the easts overwhelming superiority in tanks and 
other conventional or nonnuclear arms in europe both sides 
would be brought down to equal levels under proposals on the table 
as part of the talks bush suggested that the united states and 
the soviet union pare their forces in europe to 275000 on each 
side that would require the soviets to pull out 300000 troops and 
the united states 30000 
but cheney left no doubt at a meeting this week of nato defense 
ministers that the united states under heavy budget pressures 
would like to bring even more soldiers home

for sale used 12wheel truck with trailer army 
green maximum speed 25 mph weight 62000 pounds previously used 
only for hauling nuclear missiles 
that was one of the offerings friday at an unusual red tag sale 
put on by the soviet ministry of defense and several semipublic 
organizations to recoup some of the cold cash spent in the cold war 
the sale items were military support equipment for the 
mediumrange nuclear missiles destroyed under a 1987 ussoviet 
agreement and they were on the market as part of the soviet drive 
to reorient its economy from military to domestic needs 
items as small as rolls of cable for as little as 185 and as 
big as the 12wheel monster maz547b truck for 49600 were packed 
into an exhibition hall in moscows sokolniki park to be sold to 
whomever comes up with the most money the fastest 
we want to learn how this equipment can be used in the 
national economy said yuri vorontsov a spokesman for the sale 
one of the sales organizers elvin kalinin said more and 
different equipment might be offered at later sales depending on 
the success of this first one in the future the organizers might 
also offer aftersales service he said 
as many as 100 potential buyers milled around the drafty 
exhibition hall among them gennady gritsevsky a departmental 
director for the government environmental commission goskompriroda 
gritsevsky was looking for a vehicle to turn into a mobile 
environmental laboratory to take to chemical factories dumps and 
elsewhere he was facing down another green truck this one with a 
cabin built onto its flatbed 
the starting price was 21700 but thats not what was 
bothering gritsevsky it was just too big even with modifications 
that the government agency figured it could make on its own 
you cant use it on the street he said and then huddled 
with one of the organizers who said the ministry of defense might 
have something more suitable that it would be willing to sell 
another organizer who declined to give his name said they could 
get several hundred such trucks from the defense ministry if they 
could sell them 
one of the biggest headaches has been pricing the equipment 
vorontsov said although military equipment is very specific and 
expensive to manufacture many of the costs are hidden in the 
soviet economy 
they hope demand will drive up the minimum prices marked on 
white cards by each piece of equipment 
kalinin said that under the 1987 agreement with the united 
states scrapping both sides mediumrange nuclear missiles the 
soviet union is abiding by its agreement to destroy the actual 
weapons and other equipment 
trucks electrical generating equipment voltage regulators and 
a bewildering array of other equipment did not have to be 
destroyed but they are specific enough that the military could not 
find another use for it 
organizers of the sale believe collective and state farms 
government groups and even foreigners might be willing to lay down 
their cash and take it all away the equipment will be there until 
dec 10 when the organizers will decide what to do next 
money from the sale will be divided between the national 
treasury the defense ministry to improve living conditions for 
soldiers and help some of the 500000 who are being mustered out 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs military reductions a small 
portion of the money will go into a fund to help young scientists 
one of the groups in the exhibition hall was a small delegation 
from tanzania just looking they said

president bush from his shipboard 
summit headquarters kept a close watch friday on an attempted coup 
in the philippines after sending us jet fighters into action to 
help beseiged president corazon aquino 
bush ordered f4 fighters from clark air force base to provide 
air support and to prevent aircraft from taking off from two 
philippine air bases held by rebels a contingent of 100 marines 
was also sent from a us base in the philippines to help protect 
the us embassy compound in manila 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said that no 
us planes had fired any shots or intercepted any rebel 
aircraft rear adm edward sheafer of the defense intelligence 
agency said the goverment forces seem to be prevailing in the 
struggle with the rebels 
we are hopeful the situation will be contained bush told 
reporters soon after arriving here for his weekend summit with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
it is fair to say that the situation is serious secretary 
of state james a baker iii added we have provided some air 
support air cover he sa id that what the aquino government had 
asked for 
bush ordered the air support to help protect the aquino 
government during his overnight flight here from washington aboard 
air force one the quick help came in response to a request from 
aquino who spoke by telephone with vice president dan quayle in 
washington 
the president received updates on the situation from his 
national security adviser brent scowcroft bush was told 
government forces had retaken one air field and that trouble spots 
were being cleaned up but the coup attempt was still in progress 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
the presidents decision to grant us military aid came 
quickly just hours after rebels bombed the presidential palace in 
manila in the most serious effort to oust aquino since she came to 
power in 1986 bush had come under some criticism principally 
from democrats in congress for not acting more decisively in 
taking advantage of septembers failed coup attempt against 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said bushs 
decision to intervene was twofold a democratic government has 
asked for assistance we have american lives to protect he said 
aquino was in a safe place but he wouldnt say where and that 
the us planes were still flying into the early morning hours in 
the philippines 
bushs decision won strong bipartisan support from members of 
congress senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called 
it prudent and in our national interest 
the president looked tired and while he told reporters he was 
ready for the weekend summit with gorbachev the threat to the 
friendly government in manila appeared to dampen his spirits on a 
rainy day 
before a session with maltese prime minister eddie fenech adami 
bush said that mrs aquino sounded fine when she took a 
telephone call from quayle in washington 
still even limited us military intervention could damage the 
complaint bush planned to lodge with gorbachev about a continuing 
flow of soviet weapons to rebels in el salvador 
the united states charges delivery of the arms including 
antiaircraft launchers by cuba and nicaragua are only one example 
of soviet mischiefmaking in the third world 
arkady maslennikov a spokesman for the supreme soviet 
criticized bushs decision to order air support we are against 
such an interference any interference in internal developments 
especially by outside powers is destructive and leads toi 
deterioratio of the situation 
in any event the best thing is to allow the filipios 
themselves to sort it out he said 
fitzwater indirectly acknowledged that the us actions amounted 
to intervention he said if the tide is turning and the coup is 
beginning to die out there would be no need for further 
intervention 
scowcroft bushs national security adviser said us forces 
were not in the thick of anything they are simply providing air 
cover thats all we have been requested to do 
in a statement issued from air force one as bush flew to this 
island nation fitzwater said mrs aquino had requested the us 
military assistance 
this assistance is intended to allow the democratically 
elected government of the philippines to restore order the 
president also is determined to protect the lives of americans in 
the philippines his statement said 
mrs aquino in manila said even now us fighters are 
joining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops once 
more two pacific democracies stand shouldertoshoulder in the 
defense of freedom 
a bush administration official said the us fighters were 
authorized to fire only if rebel planes are attempting to take 
off from these two bases but that would be only after repeated 
warnings 
the reagan and bush administrations gradually increased us 
assistance to the philippines as a means of bolstering mrs aquino 
in a country beset by grinding poverty the united states maintains 
two bases in the philippines the vast subic bay naval base and 
clark air base 
meanwhile the cia has reported that some senior philippine 
officials are worried that entire segments of their armed forces 
supposedly loyal to aquino will fail to fight effectively in 
fending off the rebels attempting to topple her government an 
administration source reported today 
the central intelligence agency in its daily intellgence 
summary prepared for top us officials reported on friday that 
the situation in the philippines was quite uncertain said the 
official speaking on condition he not be identified by name

vishwanath pratap singh the 
mildmannered poet and painter who engineered the fall of the 
modern worlds oldest political dynasty was born to be king 
instead hell be indias next prime minister 
for more than two years singh stalked the dusty backroads of 
india fiercely campaigning against corruption he said had 
overwhelmed daily life and derailed effective government 
wherever he went he was cheered and embraced as therajah 
sahib or king sir 
and even though he said he really didnt want the job singh on 
friday was named prime minister and chosen to lead the national 
front the opposition alliance that ousted prime minister rajiv 
gandhi 
the process to choose a leader was long at times bitter and 
included serious challenges but singh said thats the way it 
should be 
when india became independent it became a democracy in name 
only singh said during the monthlong campaign that preceded the 
nov 2226 elections 
the government went to the nehrugandhi family and it has 
remained a dynasty he said referring to jawaharlal nehru 
gandhis grandfather and indias first prime minister the 
government wont belong to me i will belong to the government and 
the people 
singh 58 has been part of indian politics since the early 
1970s but political analysts say he changes his ideological color 
so often and with such deftness that it has become almost 
impossible to put him in a category 
a man who jealously guards his private life singh lives a 
simple life driving around in a chugging belching ambassador 
sedan and wearing traditional white cotton tunicpajama suits 
he does not project the commanding presence of indias former 
leaders and seems to disappear in the crowds who swarm around him 
but image isnt important he said 
i have always taken the stand that we have to shift from 
personal appeal to issues that is the way a democracy matures 
he said 
when singh was 5 his father the rajah of daiya gave him to 
the childless rajah of manda he grew up in one of the most 
palatial outposts in northern uttar pradesh state but childhood 
was lonely 
not allowed to see his real family for years the shy young boy 
turned to poetry and painting 
after his adoptive father died six years later a bitter legal 
battle ensued over the estate and singh was escorted everywhere 
even to school by armed guards he eventually inherited the 
estate becoming the king of tiny manda 
singh gave away his small kingdom to members of the lower castes 
long before royal titles were outlawed in 1971 by prime minister 
indira gandhi 
he entered politics and became a loyal member of the congress 
party handpicked and groomed by mrs gandhi for public service 
when a young idealistic and politically inexperienced rajiv 
gandhi became prime minister in december 1984 two months after his 
mothers assassination singh was his first choice for finance 
minister 
singh immediately initiated sweeping economic reforms allowing 
foreign investment into india and overseeing a new awakening of the 
indian economy his efforts have helped the countrys once stagnant 
economy grow about 5 percent a year 
he also launched a series of highly publicized tax raids against 
powerful businessmen winning a reputation as a crusading avenger 
but causing trouble for gandhi 
the prime minister removed singh as finance minister and named 
him defense minister in 1987 a step many saw as gandhis 
surrender to influential businessmen who contributed to congress 
party coffers 
the change also came at a time when some of gandhis closest and 
most trusted advisers and ministers either resigned or were forced 
out of government and out of the congress party 
when singh resigned and was expelled from the party later that 
year his departure proved to be the most damaging 
shortly afterward swedish and indian newspaper and radio 
reports disclosed the swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors paid as 
much as 50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a 14 
billion contract to supply the indian army with artillery guns 
gandhi vigorously denied wrongdoing and the charges have never 
been proved but they raised serious questions about the integrity 
of a prime minister once hailed as mr clean 
after leaving office singh continued to call gandhi his trusted 
friend and leader but gradually he became gandhis harshest 
critic his main challenger and the congress partys principle 
tormentor 
he was embraced by opposition parties as their savior and 
eventually he did what most thought impossible unite the 
fractious opposition parties into one cohesive fighting machine

compared to 111 toys and 39 childrens products in 1988 
the commission made no recommendations against purchasing any 
specific toys but advised people buying gifts for children to be 
mindful of the developmental level of the child in making their 
selections 
the agency offered theese tips for selecting and using toys 
before buying a riding toy be sure there is a safe place for 
the child to ride it 
keep games with small parts including marbles and balls 
away from young children especially youngsters who tend to put 
things in their mouths 
dont allow unsupervised children to play with uninflated or 
broken balloons which could slip down a childs throat and choke 
him 
remove crib gyms and attached mobiles from a babys crib as 
soon as the youngster is five months old or can push up on his or 
her hands and knees 
jonessmith also said that more than a million unsafe toys 
never made it to retail shelves because they had been seized in a 
joint cpsccustoms service program 
she noted the commissions nearly yearlong lack of a quorum 
for which critics have chided the bush administration and told 
reporters 
we are here today at full strength energized and ready to 
move reports of the commissions death were not premature they 
were wrong 
last week the consumer affairs committee of the americans for 
democratic action declared the cpsc officially dead because of 
the tenmonth lack of a quorum which ended when jonessmith was 
sworn in 
ending her first week on the job jonessmith said the cpsc is 
indeed alive and well and moving forward to enforce product safety 
laws 
she acknowledged however that she had not developed priority 
issues or programs for the commission to pursue 
commissioner carol dawson said the cpsc will act quickly to 
dispose of pending business before it 
that includes a staff evaluation and recommendations on a 
petition to ban crib gyms and developing methods to test the safety 
of disposable cigarette lighters around children 
the agency announced three toy recalls friday 
two bicycles the mountain jr 16inch sidewalk model 1615 
imported from taiwan by californiabased ming ta supply usa and 
the bmx sidewalk models 121 and 124 manufactured by texasbased 
sante fe trading inc were recalled several safety features 
missing from both bikes make them hazardous to young children the 
commission said 
also recalled were more than 8000 eightshot and 12shot ring 
caps manufactured by texasbased daisy manufacturing co and 
distributed through walmart stores nationwide since october the 
agency said the caps may ignite prematurely from friction or if 
dropped

maltese old and young skipped 
work and cut school friday to catch a glimpse of the american 
president they hoped would focus the worlds attention on their 
tiny island nation 
maltese security kept the crowds away from the airport hanger 
area when bush arrived during a cold rain but several thousand 
lined the streets near the auberge castile the 16th century palace 
where bush talked with prime minister edward fenech adami some 
cheered some shouted his name and a few stood singing the maltese 
national anthem as bush emerged from the palace and waved to the 
crowd 
hundreds of other people gathered along the shoreline or on 
roads along the cliffs that overlook the bay where bush will meet 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev aboard soviet and american 
warships over the weekend 
i cant believe he is coming to here to malta he is such a 
big man an important man we are so lucky said marika galea a 
22yearold maltese housewife

tabone prime minister fenech adami and a military band and honor 
guard that stood in the rain for more than an hour in their full 
dress uniform while waiting for the american leader 
after the brief ceremony bush left by helicopter for the 
meeting at the auberge castile and then to the aircraft carrier uss 
forrestal in the mediterranean 
aboard the carrier bush dined with the enlisted men in their 
mess and watched flight operations from an outdoor platform high 
above the flight deck bush had been waving to the crew and 
standing at mock attention when a jet crossed low in front of the 
carrier at supersonic speed 
the enormous sonic boom startled the president he ducked his 
knees buckled and then he turned and smiled at the tv cameras with 
a sheepish grin 
from the carrier bush flew directly to marsaxlokk bay and the 
uss belknap the guided missile cruiser where bush will host the 
kremlin leader for talks and a state dinner saturday night 
two maltese patrol boats kept small boats away from the belknap 
and the soviet missile cruiser slava which is anchored a few 
hundred yards in front of the american ship navy frogmen dove 
beneath the belknap or motored around a few hundred yards away in 
small rubber boats 
maltese soldiers armed with automatic rifles patrolled the 
shoreline and cliffs above the bay two sharpshooters stood atop a 
16th century watchtower that looks out over the bay from a cliff 
that marks the closest point of land to the warships 
this is something we may never see again said mansel 
cappell of liverpool england as the presidents helicopter landed 
on the belknap he said he and his wife spent two hours taking two 
city buses to reach a fishing village by the bay

said then when we go home we can say we were here in malta 
ill keep this in my mind ill never forget said mrs

aboard the warship 
others at marsaxlokk took a more commercial view of the summit 
one man hawked summit tshirts from the back of a van in front of 
the watch tower and others sold sandwiches cold drinks and donuts

slava or the belknap before the president arrived he sold 400 of 
the 500 plates he brought to marsaxlokk on friday 
we worked all night to get these out said itso but weve

scientists and the second affects more than 12000 technical 
employees

neither the union nor boeing released details of the offer 
the only thing i can give you is that the talks concluded 
boeing corporate spokesman paul binder said we are pleased that 
they have reached a conclusion and we look forward to a favorable 
vote by the membership 
mahoney said the union was going to try to withhold release of 
details until a dec 10 membership meeting at the seattle coliseum 
the union will vote by mail on the contract offer with ballots to 
be counted dec 18 he said 
the union has never struck boeing under its contract its 
members were required to continue working through the machinists

elias hrawi lebanons new president has 
asked the united states soviet union and france to convince gen 
michel aoun to avoid another battle with syrian forces a source 
close to hrawi said friday 
he said hrawi said he was trying to avoid a military showdown 
but at the same time he is determined to regain control of all 
government institutions in the christian area 
hrawi sent letters to president bush soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev and french president francois mitterrand asking that 
they urge aoun to leave the presidential palace the government 
source said 
the president was elected to supervise implementation of a 
peace plan not to declare war said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity aoun who opposes the peace plan wants 
war 
he was referring to a peace accord worked out by lebanese 
lawmakers in taif saudi arabia in october aoun rejected it 
because it did not include a specific timetable for withdrawal of 
the 40000 syrian soldiers stationed in lebanon 
annahar an independent newspaper said france had asked the 
united states and soviet union to exert relentless efforts to 
prevent a new military collision in lebanon france governed 
lebanon under mandate for more than 20 years until independence in 
1943 
young christians maintained a human shield friday around the 
presidential palace where aoun has his living quarters and command 
post in a bunker 
aoun led a christian government in competition with a moslem 
cabinet while lebanon was without a president for 14 months he 
refused to leave the palace in baabda a christian surburb east of 
beirut after hrawi was elected by parliament and dismissed him as 
army commander 
other christians in cars demonstrated in the ashrafiyeh district 
of east beirut to support samir geagea who has pledged the 6000 
men of his lebanese forces militia to help aoubn defend the 
310squaremile christian enclave against a syrian attack 
about 20000 christian troopers of the lebanese army followed 
the general in a sixmonth artillery war with the syrians that 
killed nearly 1000 people nearly all of them civilians 
the youths at the palace sang lebanons national anthem and 
waved placards with such slogans as syrians go home and the 
general is our only leader 
geageas supporters carried placards reading the leader of 
free lebanon 
the militia leader whose group is the largest christian 
fighting force outside the army said he was against armed conflict 
and told supporters at an east beirut school with dialogue we 
can solve any problem 
in jerusalem military and political leaders said friday a 
syrian buildup in lebanon over the past several days did not 
threaten israel and a syrian attack on christian forces was not 
likely to bring an israeli response 
lt gen dan shomron the chief of staff said israel will 
not act as long as its essential interests are not threatened at 
this stage they are not 
hrawi a christian the syrians support was elected a week ago 
and formed a national reconciliation government led by prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni moslem to implement the peace plan 
he dismissed aoun as armed forces commander tuesday and replaced 
him with adm emile lahoud 
aoun contends that hrawis election was unconstitutional and has 
refused to accept his decisions 
syria has sent thousands more soldiers into lebanon along with 
tanks and artillery apparently getting ready for a showdown with 
aoun the syrians have been in lebanon since 1976 the year after 
lebanons sectarian civil war began under a peacekeeping mandate 
from the arab league

the son of suspended navajo chairman 
peter macdonald pleaded innocent friday to two conspiracy counts in 
tribal court after failing to appear for two arraignments last 
month 
the appearance of peter rocky macdonald jr came one day 
after special prosecutors hired by the tribe asked the tribal 
district court for an arrest warrant to have young macdonald 
returned to the reservation the prosecutors were hired to 
investigate alleged wrongdoing in the 1987 navajo purchase of an 
arizona ranch and other matters 
rocky macdonalds attorney donald benally told tribal district 
judge robert yazzie that the younger macdonalds failure to appear 
before was based on a misunderstanding 
benally previously asked the court to dismiss charges against 
rocky macdonald saying that the tribe had no jurisdiction over him 
because the younger macdonald has lived in phoenix and san jose 
calif off the reservation 
special prosecutor mark donatelli called rocky macdonalds 
appearance friday too little too late and deceptive military 
tactics 
yazzie released rocky macdonald on his own personal recognizance 
but ordered him to have weekly contact with his lawyer that 
requirement was requested by donatelli 
rocky macdonald also agreed to sign an extradition waiver 
agreeing to not challenge extradition in the future by the navajo 
courts 
he declined to comment 
the conspiracy charges are related to some of the 107 counts 
filed oct 11 by special prosecutors against his father peter 
macdonald the elder macdonald was charged by special prosecutors 
with conspiracy bribery fraud extortion and electionlaw 
violations 
most of the criminal charges against peter macdonald focus on 
the tribes purchase of the big boquillas ranch from nonindian 
middlemen who made a 72 million profit on the property 
peter macdonald pleaded innocent wednesday and a jan 29 
pretrial hearing was scheduled

despite having his plays banned 
from the communist stage for 20 years vaclav havel has proved hes 
still able to bring down the house with crowds roaring for the 
author 
now he wants to go quietly back to work 
havel thundered with such passion before 300000 countrymen at 
wenceslas square on nov 23 that his voice was a harsh rasp when he 
reached his climax we will never return to the old system of 
totalitarian rule 
but a principal question facing czechoslovakia is whether the 
53yearold playwright and dissident the civic forums leading 
symbol of change will veer off into politics 
absolutely not he wants to remain in the background and 
write said ivo niederle an actor who has known havel since he 
was a young stagehand banned from higher study because of his 
bourgeois roots 
havel himself shuns interviews and public statements about his 
plans playing a role as negotiator of reform with a government 
which earlier this year put him in jail for antisocialist 
activities 
but he was lionized on his release from jail swamped with 
wellwishers a gigantic party at his posh apartment overlooking 
the vltava river marked a turning point for intellectuals who 
shaped the civic forum the nations leading opposition movement 
for those who know havel the enigmatic double role fiery 
reformer and retiring artist is only normal 
he is shy given to bowing his head when overwhelmed by 
admirers unfailingly polite he focuses attention on anyone who 
sits down with him he is short with a shaggy ginger mustache 
partial to black jeans and sober jackets 
but the chainsmoking and rumdrinking playwright can be 
flamboyant carousing in pragues lively pubs or at the modest 
country house he calls hradecek little castle havel 
recently exchanged his silver volkswagen for a white mercedes with 
civic forum emblazoned on the door 
by czechoslovakian standards havel is wealthy from foreign 
royalties largo desolato opened at the bristol old vic in 
london and played all over the world and other plays appear 
regularly 
havel has won the olof palme prize in sweden for perpetuating 
the late swedish leaders ideals hollands prestigious erasmus 
prize for his contribution to european culture and the frankfurt 
book fair award 
he is a leading contender for the nobel prize as an author but 
also as one of eastern europes most eloquent philosophers on the 
moral failings of communism 
in the 1950s havel first clashed with stalinist communists who 
were suspicious of his background engineers in his family built 
some beautiful buildings in prewar prague havels uncle owned the 
barrandov film studios

bill pinkney wants to sail the world on winds 
that carry dreams of hope back to school children in some of 
chicagos poorest neighborhoods but months after his scheduled 
departure the boat hell sail remains at dock 
the worst seas ill face are the ones im facing right now 
being this close and having it not happen said pinkney 54 who 
hopes to become the first black to sail solo roundtheworld via 
the treacherous waters off the cape of good hope 
if the boat breaks at sea thats something that can be 
calculated kids can understand that he said its hard to 
explain to a kid why something like this trip cant happen 
after three years of fundraising pinkney is 250000 short of 
an estimated 350000 needed for the 11month trip an 
instructional voyage that has the blessing of chicagos schools 
by telephone and computer linkup from sea pinkney plans to 
give lessons ranging from simple geography to trigonometry the 
instruction would include the science of why things float and 
more complicated matters how boats are built why boats sail he 
said in a recent interview 
he came to see me when he had put together his plan 
said margaret harrigan who heads the chicago board of educations 
office of instructional support i thought it would be a 
marvelous boost for our education program 
we could find relevance in all areas of the curriculum 
science geography literature subjects that could become more 
meaningful because of their association with a real live chicago 
hero 
pinkney grew up in a singleparent family in a poor neighborhood 
to become a marketing representative for johnson products co one 
of the nations largest blackowned businesses he now devotes 
himself fulltime to the sail supporting himself through a 
commercial bakery he owns with his wife 
he has managed to attract funds from among others the 
macarthur foundation and motorola inc but hes far short of the 
240000 price of the boat plus expense money for his trip he is 
presently leasing the 47foot cutter commitment a 
singlemasted sailing ship with two foresails 
im very disappointed said pinkney who has the 
commitment in storage what im talking about is so little 
money in the scheme of things a television commercial costs 
250000 
ted seymour a black american circumnavigated the globe by sail 
in 1987 pinkney who has been sailing 26 years said he would be 
the first black to accomplish the feat by way of the cape of good 
hope at africas southern tip 
for some children hes approached the delay seems unfathomable 
at a south side school in the shadow of some of the nations 
largest housing projects some students think we have our 
priorities wrong said science teacher joan preer 
the kids think we have money to spend for everything except 
for the things that would be truly important to american 
citizens said preer who teaches the seventh grade at the 
beasley academic center a public school 
the kids have asked me but i havent been able to give them 
any answers as to why he hasnt left yet 
pinkney recently attended a convention of the national black 
school educators hoping to attract districts across the nation he 
hopes that the more schools he signs up to participate in the 
shiptoshore classroom the easier it will be to attract sponsors 
he has interested some more affluent schools but basically it 
is impoverished minority children who need to see that someone 
that has a similar background to them can rise above it he 
said 
pinkney who originally hoped to sail in october now aims to 
launch commitment from new york this spring 
he admits the planned departure time for the 10000 mile trip is 
optimisitic but it was optimistic to start with zero and get 
this far

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in 
his clearest endorsement yet of the changes in eastern europe said 
friday the prague spring reform movement of 1968 was right at 
that time and is right now 
but he stopped short of an apology for the warsaw pact invasion 
of czechoslovakia that put down the reform movement in 1968 he 
said it must be viewed in the context of an accelerating arms race 
and an ideological struggle between east and west at that time 
not only myself but many people in the soviet leadership 
entirely accept that at that time it the reform movement was a 
process of democratization of renewal of society and that was 
important and right at that time and is right now 
he added that political methods were not fully used in the 
kremlins dealing with the situation and that led to a not quite 
appropriate response 
gorbachev spoke at a news conference in this business center at 
the end of his threeday state visit to italy and on the eve of his 
summit meeting off malta with president bush 
he said his call thursday for convening of another 35nation 
helsinki conference next year was prompted by the pace of change 
in europe and the world 
the time has come for all of us to sit down together to 
discuss approaches and criteria on which we should further develop 
the helsinki process for security and cooperation in europe 
premier giulio andreotti who joined gorbachev at the news 
conference at the sforzesco castle said he attributed gorbachevs 
extraordinary popularity in italy to the soviet leaders efforts to 
end what the italian called a decadeslong nightmare 
for decades we have lived in a nightmare not only a nuclear 
nightmare but of distrust and suspicion that either side might blow 
up the world 
in wishing gorbachev well in his shipboard summit with bush he 
said the whole world now is taking a deep breath 
gorbachev repeated his concern about a possible reunification of 
east and west germany 
he said the existence of two german states is recognized by the 
united nations and is based on a fundamental principle that every 
nation is sovereign in deciding its borders 
he said the present events in opening the border between the two 
germanys opens many opportunities for contact 
but he added let history decide whether the two eventually 
will become one 
let us not push or force the processes that are not yet 
mature 
the news conference ended abruptly when andreotti announced that 
one of milans airports was closed by fog and the other might be 
soon he urged gorbachevs entourage to leave quickly in order to 
be on time for the shipboard meeting with bush

dozens of aids activists shouting where is 
george were arrested friday after they sat in the street in 
front of the white house to protest what they say is president 
bushs lack of leadership 
many of the 78 arrested are directors and top officials of aids 
groups from across the country who say their organizations need 
more money for prevention efforts and to continue providing health 
and social services to a growing number of people with aids 
rhetoric is not what we need action is what we need said 
tim sweeney of the gay mens health crisis in new york told about 
200 protesters who gathered in lafayette park across from the white 
house at a rally marking world aids day 
we do not have the resources in our groups to meet this 
challenge said paul boneberg executive director of mobilization 
against aids a san francisco group we see people who need 
treatment but who are denied treatment we see discrimination 
still across the country and theres no government response its 
shameful 
speakers at the rally mocked bushs statement issued thursday 
for world aids day in which he expressed compassion for people 
with aids and said the government is committed to continuing 
virorous research efforts 
protesters shouted lies lies lies 
jean mcguire executive director of the aids action council 
graded bushs efforts to fight the aids epidemic giving him an 
f she said he failed to increase access to new treatments that 
can prolong the lives of people with aids and did not provide 
enough money for prevention and education as well as research and 
health care for people with the disease 
all you can give him is an f for a national aids strategy 
she said moving into this second decade there is no excuse not 
to have one 
more than 112000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states since the first cases were identified in 1981 and more than 
66000 have died no one is known to have recovered from the 
disease which is spread primarily through sex and needles shared 
with infected partners 
the public health service has estimated that more than 1 million 
americans may have already been infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
aids activists say the growing number of people with aids is 
already straining health care services and that this burden is 
guaranteed to get worse in the 1990s as more of those infected with 
hiv become sick with aids 
if your compassion doesnt move you let your calculator move 
you sweeney said 
after the rally demonstrators walked to pennsylvania avenue 
which had been blocked off by police where some protesters used 
chalk to draw the outlines of bodies in the street they then sat 
down joined in chanting with the rest of the crowd lining the 
street and waited to be arrested 
police who made the arrests wore rubber gloves a standard 
precaution district of columbia police have taken in any mass 
arrest since a 1987 aids demonstration as they handcuffed the 
protesters some of whom had to be dragged to waiting buses 
police said 78 people were charged with blocking a public 
roadway the maximum penalty for which is 90 days in jail and a 
250 fine

a federal appeals court is being asked again 
to strike down rules that on jan 1 will give local tv stations the 
right to stop cable tv systems from carrying some syndicated shows 
an attorney said friday 
john cole who is representing tulsa oklabased united video 
inc said he had petitioned the us appeals court for the 
district of columbia to stay the implementation of new syndicated 
exclusivity or syndex rules which opponents claim will cause 
massive headaches for cable operators and reduce the opportunities 
for viewers to watch some of their favorite tv shows 
a threejudge panel of the court in october denied an earlier 
request for a stay and then on nov 17 denied the overall 
challenge to the rules cole said he was seeking a review by the 
panel or by the full court on first amendment grounds 
he claimed the panels reasoning was unique in the annals of 
this court as well as the us supreme court and indeed 
contradicts the consistent constitutional precedent of each 
he claimed the rules which the federal communications 
commission in 1988 decided to reimpose after an eightyear lapse 
violate cable operators first amendment rights 
officials for two other parties in the original challenge 
tribune broadcasting and the community antenna television 
association said friday they were admitting defeat and were not 
appealing 
united video relays by satellite chicago superstation wgn to 
cable television systems nationwide other tv stations also are 
distributed to cable systems nationally or regionally 
in some cases that means a cable system may be showing its 
subscribers green acres for instance from both the distant 
and local tv stations the new rules would let the local stations 
claim exclusive rights to a syndicated program therefore forcing 
companies like united video or cable operators to black out 
portions of the distant signals 
opponents say many cable systems rather than incurring the 
expense of blacking out programs will drop the distant stations 
entirely 
the subscribing public is the one thats going to get hurt 
most on this cata president stephen effros said he saw no 
chance for a successful appeal given the courts 30 vote on nov 
17 
broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiences 
and their advertising revenues while giving broadcasters less 
incentive to develop syndicated programming 
the opponents claimed that the fcc does not have the authority 
to impose the new rules under the 1976 copyright and 1984 cable 
acts and that the rules violate cables first amendment rights 
but chief judge patricia m wald said the cable companies were 
claiming that they have a first amendment right to express 
themselves using the copyrighted materials of others 
cole however said the court had cited no precedent for 
government to restrict communicative transmissions whatever the 
subject matter without minimally inviting the traditional scrutiny 
of the first amendment

a federal judge said friday that a rule banning 
panhandling in the subway system is too vague and suggested it be 
rewritten 
us district judge leonard sand made the statement during a 
hearing in a lawsuit that challenges the prohibition on begging as 
a violation of the constitutional rights of homeless and needy 
people 
sand reserved decision on a request for an injunction barring 
the transit authority from enforcing the regulation 
at issue in the lawsuit is a provision that bans solicitation 
of alms but allows solicitation in certain areas of the subway 
system for charitable religious and political causes 
the judge said he was bothered by the distinction between the 
solicitation of alms and solicitation of charitable contributions 
one is a synonym of the other he said perhaps clearer 
guidelines are needed here so each transit officer doesnt have to 
be a first amendment expert 
after the judges comments susan weiner the metropolitan 
transportation authoritys deputy general counsel agreed to stop 
distribution of posters and pamphlets that say panhandling in the 
subway system is illegal 
thousands of the posters and pamphlets were distributed after 
the ta began its operation enforcement in october the program 
calls for the enforcement old and new regulations and has been 
criticized by advocates for the homeless as an effort to sweep the 
homeless out of the subways 
the judge said he wanted the mta to discuss a possible 
compromise with the legal action center for the homeless which 
brought the classaction lawsuit 
sand asked the parties to submit more written legal arguments 
no new court date was set

members of congress and senior government 
executives are getting a hefty raise from a new ethics law that 
will also bar members of the house but not senators from 
accepting fees for speeches starting in 1991 
president bush signed the ethics reform act of 1989 thursday 
evening before leaving the white house for malta and the weekend 
summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
bush said in a statement that the new law contains important 
reforms that strengthen federal ethical standards and generally 
hews to the principles he spelled out soon after his inauguration 
it also creates different pay scales and standards for senators 
and members of the house senators can keep making speeches for up 
to 2000 per appearance but they wont get the big pay raise of 
24000plus that members of the house voted for themselves in 1991 
the legislation will raise top government salaries by 35 percent 
over the next 13 months with house salaries jumping from 89500 
to 96600 in 1990 and to more than 120000 in 1991 plus a 
costofliving adjustment the 435 members of the house will be 
barred from accepting outside speaking fees starting in 1991 
senate salaries would climb in 1990 from 89500 to 98400 but 
there will be no automatic increase in 1991 
federal judges and top executive branch officials also would get 
an immediate 41 percent raise and 36 percent compounded on that 
on feb 1 1990 as a catchup for two years without a cost of 
living adjustment 
at a minimum even if there were no inflation in the next year 
house salaries would rise to 120700 on jan 1 1991 assuming a 
cola of about 3 percent house salaries would be 124400 39 
percent above current levels 
after that annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would be 
made automatically based on the governments index of 
privatesector wages and salaries 
house employees and other top federal executive and judicial 
officials would be barred from accepting speech fees beginning in 
1991 currently house members are limited to earning speech fees 
equivalent to 30 percent of their salary senators may make up to 
40 percent 
income earned outside the house by members and top staff would 
be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in 1991 
officials could not receive directors fees legal fees or other 
income for professional services book royalties would be exempt 
from the limits 
the new legislation also creates conflict of interest rules for 
congressional staff and imposes new limits on gifts that members 
and staff may receive they generally will be barred from accepting 
gifts costing more than 200 a year from anyone outside their 
family 
the legislation also abolishes in 1993 a clause that allowed 
house members in office by 1980 to keep leftover campaign 
contributions when they retire some house veterans have hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in campaign chests 
bush said the legislation goes far to carry out the ethics 
reform principles i set forth in january 
he said the federal ethics standards had to be exacting enough 
to assure that public officials act with the utmost integrity and 
warrant the publics confidence fair objective and consistent 
with common sense equitable all across the three branches of the 
federal government and not unreasonably restrictive so as to 
discourage able citizens from entering public service

raisa gorbachev on friday switched from a 
red dress that raised eyebrows at the vatican to a green one as she 
flew to milan one of europes fashion capitals 
the soviet first lady normally known for her fashionable 
clothes surprised italians with her austere look and few changes 
of clothes during a threeday state visit to italy 
contrary to the hopes of many milanese designers mrs gorbachev 
did not go shopping in via della spiga milans fashion boulevard 
shopping in the luxury downtown street of this northern city was 
not part of her official program but had been considered likely 
instead the enthusiasm of swelling crowds which slowed down an 
crowded schedule for mikhail s gorbachev and his wife in italys 
economic capital forced her to cut short her private tour 
mrs gorbachev joined her husband for his historic meeting with 
pope john paul ii at the vatican wearing a red dress and going 
against normal protocol of dressing in black she changed 
apparently on the flight to milan into a businesslike green 
outfit 
hundreds of milanese including city art superintendent rosalba 
tardito waited in vain for mrs gorbachev in chilly weather 
outside santa maria delle grazie church in whose refectory 
leonardo da vinci painted the last supper 
the visit to the fresco was canceled at the last minute because 
mrs gorbachev had been running behind the schedule after paying 
homage to the milanese home of the late soviet artist nicola benois 
about 300 people shouted raisa raisa when mrs gorbachev 
laid a bouquet of flowers below a marble plaque dedicated to 
benois who had worked for several years with milans la scala 
opera house after leaving his native country

south african president fw de 
klerk was greeted by hundreds of children singing long live 
dialogue before he met friday with president felix 
houphouetboigny 
houphouetboigny met de klerk as he stepped off the plane in the 
95 degree heat in yamoussoukro the presidents native village for 
the talks 
south africa and the ivory coast dont have formal diplomatic 
relations but they do have close trade ties south african 
airways barred from flying over most of the continent is 
permitted one flight a week to abidjan the capital of the ivory 
coast 
a frontpage editorial in fridays governmentcontrolled daily 
fraternite matin appeared to rule out closer diplomatic relations 
for now 
it said south africa would not be able to normalize relations 
with other african nations until it frees imprisoned black 
nationalist nelson mandela lifts the countrys state of emergency 
and begins talks with legitimate representatives of the black 
majority 
the newspaper said houphouetboigny would urge de klerk to 
advance resolutely on the path of reforms already undertaken and 
whose echo has already begun to shake the citadel of apartheid 
everthing depends on de klerk does he have the means to 
follow through on this policy apparently yes the newspaper said 
houphouetboigny has long advocated talks with south africa to 
dismantle that nations legal system of racial separation known as 
apartheid but he also opposes sanctions to force south africa into 
giving equal rights to blacks 
the newspaper said south africas strong economy and 
technological base can help the continent south africa already has 
supplied ivory coast with animals for a national park a project 
close to the heart of houphouetboigny 
the ivory coasts economy has been near collapse because of the 
fall in prices for its main exports cocoa and coffee and needs 
substantial aid

welcome de klerk on what was called the first official visit by a 
south african head of state since the early 1970s buses brought

leftist guerrillas took over 
the homes of two us embassy officials during their invasion of 
san salvadors affluent neighborhoods this week diplomatic sources 
said friday 
they also occupied the house of a former us defense attache 
who now works for the salvadoran military the sources said 
the us embassy believes that in the case of one of the 
diplomats and the former attache the rebels stormed and occupied 
the houses at random as they did with more than two dozen other 
homes in the wealthy districts invaded before dawn wednesday 
but they suspect the third house described as that of a 
highranking official was a specific target 
they would not identify the resident of the sprawling home in 
the san benito neighborhood a halfmile from the residence of us 
ambassador william walker the house was a charred shell after 
combat in and around it between leftist rebels and government 
forces 
diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
residents of the home retreated to a safe haven in the house 
when they realized it was under attack they said the residents 
were never in rebel hands and that government forces forced the 
guerrillas to retreat and then rescued the americans 
it was unclear if the retreating rebels set the house afire or 
if it caught fire as a result of the combat 
journalists who inspected the burned house after the fire was 
put out wednesday found mail on the floor addressed to a person 
with the surname hultslander 
embassy spokespeople refused to confirm that a person of that 
name lived in the house or even worked at the embassy 
because the resident was described as a highranking embassy 
official and because no journalist even those in el salvador for 
years knew that an embassy official lived there or knew of an 
official named hultslander the suspicion was that the house was 
that of a highranking officer of the cia or another intelligence 
branch 
in escalon an affluent neighborhood next to san benito rebels 
before dawn wednesday took over the houses of midranking political 
officer vince carver and george maynes a retired us army colonel 
and former us defense attache here 
both men left their homes shortly after 6 am thursday during a 
truce declared by the rebels to permit evacuation 
carver identified himself as a us diplomat when the rebels 
broke in he was allowed to take refuge with the maid in her room 
at the rear of the house where they stayed most of the next 26 
hours street fighting outside was fierce at times 
the burned hulk of a light tank destroyed by a rebel rocket sat 
just down the street from carvers house the facade of the 
diplomats house like most houses on the street was scarred with 
bullet holes and the door appeared to have been blown open 
guerrillas had abandoned the house by the time carver and his 
maid left thursday morning 
maynes wife rosy told the associated press on thursday that 
when she and her husband emerged from their home guerrillas 
remained in the rear of the house and were treating some wounded 
there 
diplomatic sources said the rebels apparently never knew that 
maynes a new mexico native who speaks fluent spanish and who has 
spent many years in central america was a retired us army 
officer or former attache 
maynes teaches at the salvadoran armed forces school of military 
studies

defense attorneys have filed a complaint with 
the justice department against an assistant us attorney who 
prosecuted a texas company in a scandal involving the us postal 
service 
the complaint submitted thursday to the office of professional 
responsibility accuses prosecutor joseph valder of misconduct in 
the investigation and prosecution of recognition equipment inc and 
two of its former executives sources familiar with the matter said 
friday 
if the director of the justice department office michael 
shaheen decides an inquiry is warranted it could result in a 
recommendation to the attorney general that valder be fired or 
reprimanded 
us district court judge george revercomb acquitted the 
defendants nov 20 midway through a criminal trial saying the 
government had failed to show that rei and the accused executives 
knew about a 1985 payoff scheme involving peter voss then vice 
chairman of the postal services board of governors 
based on a recommendation from voss rei hired michigan 
consultant john gnau while the dallas texas firm was competing 
for a 400 million mailsorting equipment contract gnau then made 
payoffs to voss after an investigation by postal inspectors gnau 
and voss both pleaded guilty in 1986 to participating in the scheme 
and were sent to prison 
according to the sources the complaint by lawyers for rei and 
the executives william moore and robert reedy alleges that valder 
never allowed government witnesses to inform a grand jury that they 
had not told rei executives about the payoffs to voss moore was 
the companys chief executive officer and reedy was marketing vice 
president the allegations were first contained in a motion filed 
by the defense attorneys nov 2 in us district court the motion 
sought dismissal of the indictment on grounds of prosecutorial 
misconduct 
a copy of the nov 2 motion was attached to the complaint sent 
to the justice department said the sources who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
the complaint to the justice department agency according to the 
sources also raises questions as to whether valder told his 
superiors us attorney jay stephens and criminal division 
officials at the justice department that rei executives had not 
been told of the payoffs the defense attorneys met with stephens 
and justice department officials last year in an attempt to stave 
off indictment 
justice department spokesman joseph krovisky declined to comment 
and said shaheen would neither confirm nor deny that a complaint 
had been received 
defense attorneys robert bennett charles stillman and john 
cooney alleged in their motion that valder gave witnesses in the 
case access to the grand jury testimony of other witnesses a 
violation of federal rules of criminal procedure 
the government denied the allegations calling them 
meritless and asserting that there was no unauthorized 
disclosure of grand jury material 
the judge acquitted the defendants and never ruled on the motion 
concerning prosecutorial misconduct 
although the criminal case against rei is over the firm has at 
least nine lawsuits pending against it seeking more than 100 
million in damages in connection with the scandal involving voss 
classaction civil suits filed by various shareholders allege the 
company violated securities and racketeering laws in its efforts to 
get the mailsorting equipment contract

a proposal that the tennessee valley 
authority set aside some land for nude sunbathing is getting a 
chilly reception from the federal utility 
the american sunbathing association of kissimmee fla which 
boasts about 35000 members nationwide has launched a drive to 
open up federal land for sunbathing in the buff 
the group has hired a lobbyist for 65000 and even established 
a political action committee called nudepac to carry the nudist 
case to washington dc 
we feel that federal land can easily be divided between nude 
sections and nonnude sections which it already is in practice in 
some areas said arne erikson the groups head this is 
already very common in europe 
one of the agencies the group wants to talk to is tva which has 
more than 400000 acres available for public use 
but david pack manager of operations and maintenance for tvas 
public lands said the agency isnt ready to allow nude sunbathing 
on any of it we view such activity as in violation of local 
ordinances and take the proper steps to get local authorities to 
correct it 
actually said pack weve not had any real problem with this 
and weve not ever been approached by any nudists requesting any 
areas be set aside for them 
erikson said nude sunbathing is legal at several state parks in 
oregon and texas and the national park service already allows such 
activity at several parks 
were trying to do what we can to convince these agencies to 
recognize that nude sunbathing is neither a moral nor a social 
problem and it can be properly managed said erikson 
representatives of the group plan to meet with national park 
service officials next week to ask that beach areas be reserved for 
nude sunbathers 
there are no federal laws that prohibit this activity but we 
do adhere to local ordinances said george berklacy director of 
public affairs for the park service 
the only exception to the governments handsoff policy 
berklacy said came in 1985 when the park service banned nude 
sunbathing at a cape cod beach for environmental purposes 
because people trampled the dunes trying to peek at the nudists 
the naked truth is that we dont intend to write regulations 
permitting nude sunbathing berklacy said

museums and galleries across the nation dimmed their lights 
draped sculptures in black and stripped their walls of modern art 
masterpieces friday to mourn the artists lost to aids and the 
contributions they might have made 
our aims are to honor and recognize friends and colleagues who 
have died or are dying and to seek greater support and 
understanding from an illinformed and sometimes hostile public 
said thomas sokolowski director of the grey art gallery in new 
york and a member of visual aids which organized a day without 
art to coincide with the world health organizations second aids 
awareness day 
hundreds of art institutions participated in the observance 
across the country organizers said they hoped the focus on the 
artistic contribution of aids victims would emphasize that aids is 
not just a disease of minorities and drug addicts 
in new york numerous art galleries closed for the day or 
temporarily darkened their halls at the metropolitan museum of 
art picassos portrait of gertrude stein was removed and a 
placard was put in its place to explain the loss the art community 
is experiencing because of aids 
elizabeth taylor chairwoman of the american foundation for aids 
research told reporters at the museum of modern art that the day 
draws attention to the terrible loss in the artistic world 
she said the observance however was just a small reminder of 
the plague and everybody in this world needs to be reminded time 
and time again 
the point of a day without art is to refer metaphorically to 
loss and to try to get more people as concerned with the loss from 
aids as it is often with say earthquakes and other tragedies 
that occur said philip yenawine director of education at the 
museum and cochairman of the nationwide project 
subway riders found a colorful downtown mural covered with black 
paper 
the original mural is full of life and dancing and colorful 
figures and now its covered in black paper said the murals 
artist ross lewis people have come in and affixed names of dead 
friends on index cards 
in malibu calif the j paul getty museum honored samuel 
wagstaff jr a collector and curator with close ties to the museum 
who died of aids in 1987 
the museum darkened its photo exhibit and instead set up a wall 
display featuring a photograph of wagstaff with a sign asking 
patrons to contribute your time or other resources to 
organizations in your community involved in research education and 
care for people with aids 
there was a lot of staff sentiment that we should do 
something said getty spokeswoman deborah gribbon we wanted to 
make a serious statement and one that had a special connection to 
us 
wagstaff also was mourned at the detroit institute of arts 
where he was its curator of contemporary art from 1968 to 1971 a 
sculpture obtained by wagstaff was draped in black 
in washington about 70 demonstrators were arrested friday after 
they sat down on pennsylvania avenue in front of the white house to 
protest what they called the governments lack of leadership in the 
aids epidemic 
those taking part in the civil disobedience were among some 200 
people who attended a rally marking world aids awareness day the 
demonstration came a day after president bush declared that 
education is the nations best weapon against aids 
elsewhere the aids project los angeles planned to gather with 
blue candles and lights friday evening david willers national 
director of the blue lights campaign said dec 1 marks his first 
birthday without his twin brother who died of aids 
i was always impressed with blue lights said willers at 
airports blue lights guide planes down true blue is a loyalty 
color when i was in the navy during the vietnam war the blue 
color meant that it was a safe harbor for a ship to pull into blue 
is a healing color 
similar observances were held in atlanta where the arts 
exchange gallery was closed in pittsburgh where lights were 
dimmed for 10 minutes at the carnegie museum of art in seattle 
where large black shrouds were hung over many downtown sculptures 
and in los angeles where visitors to the museum of contemporary 
art and the county museum of art found the usual admission fees 
waived and were asked instead to donate to the aids project los 
angeles 
in new orleans the noaids task force displayed childrens 
artistic conception of aids one simply had the word choose 
between the words aids and life said lisa lee a member of 
the task force 
as of the end of october 1989 the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta had recorded a total of 112241 cases of aids in 
the united states with 66493 deaths 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring

mikhail s gorbachev and pope john paul ii 
swept away decades of hostility between rome and moscow on friday 
with the soviet leader promising religious freedom at home 
agreeing to diplomatic ties with the vatican and inviting the 
pontiff to visit 
the first meeting between a kremlin chief and a pope was rich in 
both symbolism and concrete results gorbachev obtained a pledge 
from john paul to support his perestroika reform policies 
both men were beaming throughout most of the twohour visit 
clearly aware of what gorbachev called a truly extraordinary 
event and the polishborn pope a sign of the times that is 
rich in promise 
gorbachev heightened the drama of the events by departing from 
his prepared text to disclose he had invited the pope to the soviet 
union a country which historically has disparaged religion 
i want to announce that we discussed a future visit of the 
roman pontiff to the soviet union he said in russian following 
the lengthy 70 minutes of private talks at an oak desk beneath a 
religious painting in john pauls library 
the pope did not mention the trip in his public remarks but a 
vatican communique said he thanked gorbachev for the invitation and 
voiced hope that developments would allow him to go 
john paul has frequently spoken of his desire to travel to the 
soviet union but on condition he could visit his flock throughout 
the country he has disclosed on two occasions he had been barred 
from going to lithuania the roman catholic stronghold in the 
soviet union 
a soviet trip has also been linked to the popes ability to 
visit the ukraine where the ukrainian catholic church was 
suppressed by josef stalin in 1946 and forcibly merged with the 
russian orthodox church 
there are more than 4 million catholics in the ukraine who until 
recently practiced their faith clandestinely 
a major step toward legalizing the ukrainian church was 
announced friday by a top local official in the ukraine nikolai 
kolesnik of the soviet republics council on religious affairs said 
from kiev that regional officials have decided ukrainian catholics 
could register with authorities like other religious groups 
the vatican statement said the pope told gorbachev he hopes 
ukrainian catholics would be granted full religious freedom 
i dont know when but certainly the pope will be going some 
day to the soviet union said vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
the situation must evolve in such a way that the pope could go to 
the different places he wants to go the places where there are 
catholics 
the vatican estimates there are up to 10 million catholics in 
the soviet union 
gorbachev and the vatican statement said the two men agreed to 
establish official ties at a level to be worked out by diplomats 
the holy see had diplomatic relations with czarist russia but they 
were broken after the bolshevik revolution in 1917 
in his speech gorbachev said moscow is addressing church issues 
in a spirit of democracy and humanism and within the framework of 
perestroika and that all confessions have a right to satisfy 
their spiritual needs 
he pledged that a new religious law guaranteeing freedom of 
worship will be adopted shortly 
at a news conference later in milan before departing for malta 
gorbachev said religious freedom should become a fundamental part 
of perestroika 
he said he and the pope stressed the importance of moral values 
and often used the same words and expressions in talking of their 
vision of the world 
we spoke of perestroika and i heard words of support from the 
pope for what our people are doing now he said this 
understanding is obviously important 
john paul referred to the painful trials that soviet 
believers have suffered in past decades but he said gorbachevs 
visit was a promisefilled sign for the future for all 
believers in the soviet union 
on their behalf whether they be of the latin byzantine or 
armenian rite i express the fervent hope that they be able to 
practice freely their religious life he said 
once the catholics are free the pope said they could work for 
better relations with the russian orthodox 
the orthodox have opposed the legalization of the ukrainian 
catholic church partly because they stand to lose hundreds of 
churches and thousands of followers they gained after the 1946 
persecution 
in a cautious response to fridays meeting romebased ukrainian 
catholic leader myroslav lubachivsky said he hoped the churchs 
demands for full religious freedom would be met and he offered to 
cooperate with the russian orthodox 
the pope in a speech partly in russian and the rest in italian 
said he is wishing for the success of gorbachevs reforms and said 
the vatican is ready to support every initiative to protect the 
rights of people and ensure peace 
he said he was praying that gorbachevs weekend summit with 
president bush will lead to a new understanding one based upon a 
careful heeding of the needs and aspirations of peoples 
gorbachev who addressed the pope as your holiness wore a 
dark pinstriped suit for the visit that began with a greeting 
from bemedaled vatican dignitaries and a heelclicking salute from 
a detachment of swiss guards the popes ceremonial army 
in the closeddoor talks the two men were alone for the first 
five minutes speaking in russian and then were joined by 
interpreters the pope switched to polish and italian at times 
while gorbachev continued in russian vatican officials said 
as reported by navarro gorbachev told the pontiff after the 
private discussions we realize we are talking with the highest 
religious figure in the world but one who is also a slav 
the spokesman reported the pope laughed and said yes the 
first slavic pope but i think it was providence that prepared the 
way for our meeting 
gorbachevs wife raisa wore a red dress that raised eyebrows 
as vatican protocol normally calls for women to wear black but she 
appeared at ease as she viewed vatican artworks while her husband 
talked with the pope 
later the pope gave her a gold rosary and presented her husband 
with a reproduction of a mosaic of christ on the tomb of st peter 
gorbachev gave the pope two 14th century volumes of the psalms from 
kiev

who is accused of possessing 1674 ounces of marijuana and faces 
the death sentence if convicted 
kerrey lane wiley of sacramento calif is being held on the

the death penalty or another law that carries a lighter sentence 
in malaysia there is no need to prove trafficking mere 
possession of 200 grams or 705 ounces of marijuana is deemed to 
be trafficking

a cancer researcher said friday he is concerned 
about jimmy carters health now that the former presidents last 
surviving sibling is reported ill with pancreatic cancer the same 
disease that killed his father a brother and a sister 
we recommend a cat scan of the pancreas or an ultrasound for 
people who are at very high risk such as jimmy said dr henry 
p lynch a professor of medicine at creighton university school of 
medicine in omaha neb 
while only about 6 percent of pancreatic cancer victims have a 
family history of the disease those who do have it in the family 
are several times more likely to get it than the general 
population said lynch who recently completed a study of 18 
families with 47 members having pancreatic cancer 
further studies are needed for scientists to pinpoint if the 
tumors found in family members are similar and if there is a gene 
that makes those family members get cancer from a common 
environmental factor lynch said 
gloria carter spann carters sister was released friday from 
emory university hospital in atlanta where the 62yearold plains 
resident had been diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer said a 
statement from dr martin york 
lynch said he was interested in studying the carter family 
because the former presidents father and all three siblings have 
had the disease 
maybe the family differs genetically so far as the way they 
metabolize common factors in the environment they may have a 
unique susceptibility to cancer due to such common factors that 
dont affect others but may uniquely affect them 
mrs spann said in a statement friday through the carter 
presidential center that she was not feeling any symptoms from the 
disease which was diagnosed during routine testing 
she was feeling great said center spokeswoman casie hughes 
in fact she and her husband walter are planning to ride their 
motorcycles to florida for the weekend 
carters brother billy died of pancreatic cancer in september 
1988 at age 51 his evangelist sister ruth carter stapleton was 
54 when she died of the disease in september 1983 carters father 
james earl carter sr who ran a peanut warehouse died of the 
disease in 1953 
carters mother miss lillian carter had breast cancer that 
had spread to other organs including her pancreas when she died 
in october 1983 at age 85 
researchers have found that pancreatic cancer is almost always 
fatal lynch said 
in spite of advances in chemotherapy radiation therapy and 
surgery most patients with pancreatic cancer do not survive more 
than a year he said 
mrs spann was given her treatment options while at emory and 
has not yet decided which course to pursue the hospital said 
lynch said he wrote the former president about two years ago 
while brother billy carter was ill with the disease because im 
very concerned about him he said he recommended screening for 
the former president and the rest of the family 
the researcher said he would contact the carter family again in 
the wake of mrs spanns diagnosis 
lynch said research has shown that the carter family children 
could have a greater chance of developing pancreatic cancer a 
disease that has its onset after the late 40s 
part of the problem with screening for the cancer is that we 
dont know enough about the basic history of the pancreas he 
said and that when the cancer produces symptoms it may have 
been there growing more subtly for five or 10 years thats why i 
recommend screening be started earlier than the average age of 
cancer occurrence

people are dying from hunger in 
ethiopias tigre province and a famine as deadly as that of the 
mid1980s is possible a tigrean rebel relief official said friday 
information reaching khartoum indicates an average of two people 
succumb every day to hunger or malnutrition adding to a toll in 
recent weeks that at last report was 115 
the figures are minuscule compared with those of the 198485 
drought in which the united nations says up to 1 million people 
died in the rebelliontorn province of northwestern ethiopia 
but chekol kidane who heads the relief agency of the tigre 
peoples liberation front said that without food and medical 
supplies conditions for about 22 million people will get worse 
in the coming few weeks 
the health situation there is very bad indeed and is 
worsening because the provinces three hospitals have no more 
medical supplies and too few personnel kidane said in an interview 
malnutrition is rampant especially among children and chest 
diseases like tuberculosis will be spreading among the 
malnourished he said 
he said that the french relief organization medicine without 
borders has sent a team to khartoum which is to leave for tigre in 
a few days but they will not be able to remedy the situation in 
time he added 
a disaster as bad as the mid1980s famine is possible kidane 
said 
his estimate of the number of people facing starvation in tigre 
is much lower than the 4 million forecast last month by officials 
of the un world food program but higher than the ethiopian 
governments prediction of 185 million 
ethiopian officials in addis ababa sounded their own alarm about 
famine in the region friday and blamed the liberation front 
in a statement published in that citys newspapers the ministry 
of information said more fighting could lead to a mass exodus of 
civilians and increased famine 
the ministry said the root cause of hunger in northern 
ethiopia is a civil war to dismember the country it said the 
liberation front is spreading hunger and famine to neighboring 
provinces 
the worsthit areas are in eastern tigre with the drought 
causing crop failures of up to 90 percent and some people are 
selling their cattle to buy food kidane said 
the famine is causing people in eastern tigre to migrate west 
toward the border with sudan he said 
in the 198485 famine thousands died in similar treks westward 
in search of food about 200000 were thought to have crossed into 
sudan equally saddled with an antigovernment rebellion and food 
shortages in the south 
kidane estimated that 346000 tons of supplies are needed to 
prevent a repetition of the 8485 disaster in tigre 
the ethiopian governments relief and rehabilitation commission 
last week appealed to international donors for 377400 tons of 
relief food 
we are requesting logistical assistance as we have only 220 
trucks while we badly need 494 trucks and 50 trailers he said 
norway on friday approved 324000 in special food and medical 
aid to ethiopia 
david morton operations director of the un world food 
program said in nairobi kenya last week that satellite 
photographs and other evidence indicated the brunt of the famine 
would be felt next year 
northern ethiopia is a droughtprone region where the normally 
fragile agriculture has been disrupted by civil war in the 
northernmost province of eritrea and south of it in tigre and wollo 
provinces 
kidanes rebel group the tigre peoples liberation front 
controls all of tigre and is fighting in neighboring wollo

217 million tons including more than 163 million tons of corn 
and nearly 54 million tons of wheat 
in addition 198889 sales included 298700 tons of soybeans 
135 million tons of soybean meal and 102 million tons of grain 
sorghums 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 800000 tons of 
corn would be about 315 million bushels 
the new sales were made by unidentified private exporting 
companies which are required to report large sales to the 
department no selling prices or other details were released 
corn prices have been averaging about 225 per bushel at the 
farm according to usdas fiveday average meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of about 18 million 
the soybean meal at around 200 per ton at processing plants 
would have a value of about 20 million

2 hours to cheer speakers invoking the need for unity in achieving

arab nations on friday postponed a general 
assembly vote on recognizing the plo as the government of palestine 
just two hours before it was scheduled 
one western diplomat speaking privately said a rift has 
developed between plo chairman yasser arafat and farouk khaddoumi 
the plo foreign secretary who heads the palestinian un delegation 
khaddoumi has been trying to line up the votes for the 
resolution while arafat believes the effort is counterproductive 
and has ordered a halt the source said 
the state department has said it will cut off all us funds to 
the united nations if the resolution passes the united states is 
assessed 216 million annually a quarter of the un budget 
after the 22nation arab league held a private meeting its 
ambassador clovis maksoud announced the resolution would instead 
be put to a vote monday 
this is final categorical and unequivocal said maksoud 
the delay is intended to allow nonaligned nations to receive 
voting instructions he said diplomats said it would also give the 
palestine liberation organization more time to lobby its allies for 
support 
however western diplomats said the delay actually helps the 
united states 12 european community nations and nordic countries 
that are trying to derail the resolution 
as a member of the 102member nonaligned movement the plo 
theoretically has more than enough votes to prevail on a majority 
vote in the 159member general assembly 
western diplomats however say any vote will be extremely close 
and refuse to predict whether the resolution will pass 
maksoud acknowledged the united states has had some success 
fighting the resolution 
the united states has put us in a serious dilemma with 
threatening to cut the budget to stifle debate he said 
the soviet union opposes the resolution and egypt and morocco 
have not yet endorsed it 
john bolton the state department undersecretary for 
international organizations said friday we continue to oppose 
this resolution and believe it should be withdrawn 
we are maintaining intensive efforts to insure that this is 
not adopted he said he reiterated the threat to cut off all 
un funding 
a number of other countries are also working in this 
direction bolton said 
the proposed resolution says the plo has the powers and 
responsibilities of the provisional government of the state of 
palestine 
it also says the plo shall be construed within the united 
nations as the state of palestine 
that designation would elevate the plo from its current status 
as a nonvoting observer nation also holding such status are north 
and south korea switzerland monaco san marino and the vatican 
last year the plo declared the state of palestine in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip but did not define any 
borders khaddoumi says more than 80 nations have formally 
recognized palestine

vice president dan quayle convened national 
security council members telephoned corazon aquino and briefed 
members of congress as he oversaw us action in the philippines 
thursday night and friday white house officials said 
in the absence of the summitbound president bush quayle was 
the administrations point man in washington on the philippines 
developments 
the timing of the coup attempt against mrs aquino gave him a 
chance to break out of the sidekick role that generally keeps him 
in the white house background 
he canceled a florida speechmaking trip friday and spoke 
frequently by telephone to bush and other us officials as they 
flew to malta and after they arrived according to quayle aides 
bush left for his summit meeting with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev just as the coup attempt was breaking out thursday 
against the usbacked aquino regime 
quayle stayed overnight thursday in the white house situation 
room and was constantly facilitating the conversation asking 
questions and keeping the flow of information going among us 
military and policy officials who were analyzing courses of action 
said white house spokeswoman alixe glen 
the coup attempt appeared to falter as us war planes flew 
menacingly over strongholds of the mutinous military forces 
however officials at the pentagon said late friday that the 
fighting was not over 
quayle ran effective meetings asked the right questions 
pushed people for their recommendations and understood that his was 
not the role of the decision maker but rather one who 
transmitted recommendations to bush said one administration 
official involved 
the allnight discussions took place with some participants in 
the situation room and others at their own agencies via twoway 
television said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
with bush out of the country quayle believed it was important 
for him to be present said another official adding we do not 
want to see the al haig situation 
the comment was in reference to the scene at the white house 
after the 1981 assassination attempt on president reagan when 
thenvice president bush was out of town thensecretary of state 
alexander haig sternly announced that he was in charge here 
pending bushs return from texas 
the comment was seen as an attempt to usurp authority rather 
than an indication that everything was under control 
on thursday evening as the philippines mutineers gained ground 
quayle was at the vice presidential residence keeping abreast by 
telephone 
as the situation deteriorated meetings were held in the white 
house involving deputies from agencies including the pentagon 
national security council state department and cia they discussed 
possible options for us action as they monitored developments in 
manila 
quayle received a call from deputy national security adviser 
robert gates just after 10 pm informing him that mrs aquino who 
was talking frequently by telephone to us ambassador nicholas 
platt had asked for us assistance 
after consulting with gates quayle called an 1130 pm meeting 
of the nsc principals who were not traveling with bush in 
accordance with nsc procedures said david beckwith quayles press 
secretary 
by the time they met mrs aquino specifically asked for air 
support over the two bases held by the rebels 
just before the meeting started quayle and defense secretary 
dick cheney spoke by telephone with bush 
he said he would await their recommendation said beckwith 
after a 45minute discussion the group unanimously recommended 
approving mrs aquinos request and bush sent the f4 fighters 
from clark air base in manila 
quayle telephoned her to tell her of the decision he then 
called house speaker thomas s foley and senate majority leader 
george mitchell to tell them what was happening said beckwith 
quayle went home around 530 am then returned to the white 
house around 930 
he told bush in a midday telephone conversation that he would 
inform appropriate congressional leaders of the state of affairs 
he called several members his office said 
he sent his wife marilyn in his place to make the appearances in 
florida

israel radio said the head of israels shin bet security service 
told officials 500 palestinian guerrilla squads had been counted 
during the uprising 
it said the shin bet chief whose name is an official secret

groups were linked to the fatah faction of palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat and were uncovered since arafat 
publicly renounced terrorism a year ago

palestinian headscarves arrived at the entrance to the old city in

rep marvin leath a sixterm texas 
congressman and influential member of the house armed services 
committee announced friday he would not seek reelection next year 
leath 58 said he really cant explain his reasons for 
retiring after a dozen years in congress he said he would like to 
write a book and perhaps a syndicated column while pursuing a 
country music career 
though it was the most agonizing decision of my life i 
believe it is time to move along time for someone else to take up 
the mantle time for another citizen to accept that 
responsibility said leath a former smalltown banker and high 
school football coach who first won the seat in 1978 
leath of waco is one of the texas congressional delegations 
wealthiest members having listed the minimum value of his assets 
at 13 million his decision to retire in 1990 would allow him to 
convert to personal use the remaining cash in his campaign 
treasury which totaled 487535 at the end of september according 
to records at the federal election commission 
under ethics reform legislation just approved by congress 
members elected before 1980 have until 1993 to retire or lose the 
right to convert the cash to personal use leath said the new law 
however had nothing to do with his decision to retire 
norm ornstein of the american enterprise insitute said he was 
disappointed by leaths decision because there are few more 
interesting or nicer people on capitol hill 
ornstein said leath has a reputation for providing a lot of 
the glue that has kept the democratic party together serving as 
a bridge between liberal and conservative factions on defense and 
budget issues 
now leath says he wants to write continue writing country 
music and approach singer willie nelson and say willie its

a consumer advocacy organization for children 
asked the government friday to stop television stations and several 
toy manufacturers from broadcasting during childrens programs 
advertisements the group said are deceptive 
in a petition to halt commercials by six toy manufacturers 
action for childrens television asked the federal trade commission 
to initiate an inquiry and regulations regarding television 
advertising practices aimed at children 
act accused three independent new yorkarea television stations 
and six toy manufacturers of engaging in unfair and deceptive 
trade practices in their presentation of product advertisements for 
childrens toys which misrepresent the nature and performance 
of such products 
these things are so deceptive they could deceive adults 
peggy charren the president of act said in a telephone interview 
too often we do our worst advertising and direct it at kids 
she said 
charren began act in 1968 to encourage informative childrens 
television programming and to monitor advertising aimed at 
children the group is funded by its 10000 members nationwide and 
other private donations 
charren said the group had seen vast improvements in childrens 
ads during the 1970s but began to see a recurrence of earlier 
problems in the 1980s because of the deregulatory policies of the 
reagan adminstration and the rapid advancement of television 
production technology 
named in the petition were wpixtv wnywtv and new jerseybased 
wwortv 
spokesmen for the stations said they had not been contacted by 
the ftc concerning acts petition 
however ted faraone of wnyw said his station does screen 
commercials very carefully particularly those aimed at children to 
screen out anything which is deceptive 
its the kind of thing that we are very sensitive to said 
ellen morgenstern of wwortv 
it is not a problem that is unique to these stations said 
peggy charren the president of act in a telephone interview 
but charren said she was encouraged because any rules or 
policies the government applied to the stations named in the 
petition would apply to all stations 
toy commercials cited by act include ring raiders by matchbox 
toys galoob toys micro machine service city mattels food 
fighters hasbros pogo ball toy bizs flip ball and milton 
bradleys guess who game 
the ring raiders commercial shows airplanes flying free when 
in fact they stay attached to a childs hand and the galoob spot 
shows a city complete with cars and trucks when in fact the 
product includes no vehicles act said 
the group acknowledged that galoob includes a disclaimer saying 
vehicles are sold separately but said this message is totally 
ineffective with children who cannot read 
the ring raiders and micro machine service city spots also are 
critcized in a consumer reports television special on childrens 
advertising scheduled to air next week on home box office 
we do not believe the commercials are deceptive in any way 
said steve klein executive vice president and general counsel for 
galoob 
galoob has sold more than 55 million micro machine vehicles and 
playsets in the three years since they hit the market said klein 
adding that none of the toys had been returned because of consumer 
dissatisfaction due to deceptive advertising 
klein also said a survey conducted by an independent company 
using a micro machine commercial similar to the one act finds 
objectionable showed the ad was cleary understood by children 
there was no confusion the filming techniques were fully 
comprehended klein said of the group of boys aged 610 who 
participated in the survey 
michele litzky a spokeswoman for matchbox said the firms 
advertising is produced in accordance with guidelines of the 
childrens advertising review unit of the better business bureau 
glenn bozart spokesman for mattel said the company could not 
respond because officials had not seen details of the petition 
efforts to reach other manufacturers cited by act were 
unsuccessful

the united states on friday denounced 
as an insult nicaraguas refusal to grant visas to a 20member 
delegation appointed by president bush to observe the feb 25 
general elections 
the foreign ministry said in a communique thursday that such a 
delegation would not be impartial declaring 
from the point of view of his credibility before us the very 
fact that mr bush has been the one to appoint this commission is 
enough for it to be totally discredited 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher replied friday 
the denial of visas is merely one more illustration of 
what the sandinistas say and what they do refusing visas to this 
prestigious delegation cochaired by sen richard lugar rind 
and rep tony beilenson dcalif is an insult to their 
integrity 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government invited dozens of 
world observers to supervise the elections including delegations 
from the united nations the organization of american states and 
the european parliament 
the ministry said these organizations and individuals are 
experienced honest and impartial but the same unfortunately 
cannot be said of president bush nor therefore of any commission 
appointed by him to observe the elections in nicaragua 
it said a us congressional vote wednesday to continue 
nonlethal aid to nicaraguan rebels will allow the contras to 
keep infiltrating into nicaragua to assassinate our people and 
create confusion in the electoral process 
it complained about 9 million approved by congress in october 
to aid the campaign of violeta barrios de chamorro the 
presidential candidate of the 14party united national opposition 
the strongest challenger to the governing sandinista national 
liberation front 
the communique said there exists a clear incompatibility 
between pretending to buy the election of a candidate while at the 
same time pretending to be accepted as impartial observers in our 
elections 
boucher said in washington 
just two weeks ago the foreign ministry indicated to the 
administration that the government of nicaragua welcomed the 
establishment of this delegation and that it intended to issue the 
visas 
the government of nicaragua raised no question of linkage 
between their visas and other issues 
he complained that nicaragua professes to support esquipulas 
and the tela accords regional peace agreements signed by 
nicaragua and other central american nations but it provides 
arms to el salvadors fmln including advanced surfacetoair 
missiles 
a small plane carrying 25 surfacetoair missiles crashed 
saturday in el salvador el salvador said the plane and its four 
crew all of whom died were nicaraguan and broke diplomatic 
relations with managua it said the missiles were for the rebel 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
boucher said that while nicaragua promises an open and fair 
election and talks peace it suspended the ceasefire and stepped 
up the intimidation of voters in addition to denying access to some 
observers and has increased its troop buildup along the 
honduran border 
the sandinistas cant have it both ways the us continues to 
believe that the holding of free and fair elections under 
international monitoring is an important opportunity to resolve the 
conflict in nicaragua and to improve relations with the united 
states 
he said the decision to the visas certainly raises questions 
about whether nicaragua shares this belief 
moreover the united states has made it clear that if the 
elections are deemed free and fair it will recognize and respect 
the outcome

president bush from his shipboard 
summit headquarters kept a close watch friday on an attempted coup 
in the philippines after sending us jet fighters into action to 
help beseiged president corazon aquino 
bush ordered f4 fighters from clark air force base to provide 
air support and to prevent aircraft from taking off from two 
philippine air bases held by rebels a contingent of 100 marines 
was also sent from a us base in the philippines to help protect 
the us embassy compound in manila 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said that no 
us planes had fired any shots or intercepted any rebel 
aircraft rear adm edward sheafer of the defense intelligence 
agency said the goverment forces seem to be prevailing in the 
struggle with the rebels 
late friday a senior defense official said that trends 
generally favor the government but that fighting was continuing 
as daylight approached in manila 
we are hopeful the situation will be contained bush told 
reporters soon after arriving here for his weekend summit with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
it is fair to say that the situation is serious secretary 
of state james a baker iii added we have provided some air 
support air cover he sa id that what the aquino government had 
asked for 
bush ordered the air support to help protect the aquino 
government during his overnight flight here from washington aboard 
air force one the quick help came in response to a request from 
aquino who spoke by telephone with vice president dan quayle in 
washington 
the president received updates on the situation from his 
national security adviser brent scowcroft bush was told 
government forces had retaken one air field and that trouble spots 
were being cleaned up but the coup attempt was still in progress 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
the presidents decision to grant us military aid came 
quickly just hours after rebels bombed the presidential palace in 
manila in the most serious effort to oust aquino since she came to 
power in 1986 bush had come under some criticism principally 
from democrats in congress for not acting more decisively in 
taking advantage of septembers failed coup attempt against 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said bushs 
decision to intervene was twofold a democratic government has 
asked for assistance we have american lives to protect he said 
aquino was in a safe place but he wouldnt say where and that 
the us planes were still flying into the early morning hours in 
the philippines 
bushs decision won strong bipartisan support from members of 
congress senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called 
it prudent and in our national interest 
the president looked tired and while he told reporters he was 
ready for the weekend summit with gorbachev the threat to the 
friendly government in manila appeared to dampen his spirits on a 
rainy day 
before a session with maltese prime minister eddie fenech adami 
bush said that mrs aquino sounded fine when she took a 
telephone call from quayle in washington 
still even limited us military intervention could damage the 
complaint bush planned to lodge with gorbachev about a continuing 
flow of soviet weapons to rebels in el salvador 
the united states charges delivery of the arms including 
antiaircraft launchers by cuba and nicaragua are only one example 
of soviet mischiefmaking in the third world 
arkady maslennikov a spokesman for the supreme soviet 
criticized bushs decision to order air support we are against 
such an interference any interference in internal developments 
especially by outside powers is destructive and leads to 
deterioration of the situation 
in any event the best thing is to allow the filipinos 
themselves to sort it out he said 
fitzwater indirectly acknowledged that the us actions amounted 
to intervention he said if the tide is turning and the coup is 
beginning to die out there would be no need for further 
intervention 
scowcroft bushs national security adviser said us forces 
were not in the thick of anything they are simply providing air 
cover thats all we have been requested to do 
in a statement issued from air force one as bush flew to this 
island nation fitzwater said mrs aquino had requested the us 
military assistance 
this assistance is intended to allow the democratically 
elected government of the philippines to restore order the 
president also is determined to protect the lives of americans in 
the philippines his statement said 
mrs aquino in manila said even now us fighters are 
joining the fight to give air cover to our ground troops once 
more two pacific democracies stand shouldertoshoulder in the 
defense of freedom 
a bush administration official said the us fighters were 
authorized to fire only if rebel planes are attempting to take 
off from these two bases but that would be only after repeated 
warnings 
the reagan and bush administrations gradually increased us 
assistance to the philippines as a means of bolstering mrs aquino 
in a country beset by grinding poverty the united states maintains 
two bases in the philippines the vast subic bay naval base and 
clark air base 
meanwhile the cia has reported that some senior philippine 
officials are worried that entire segments of their armed forces 
supposedly loyal to aquino will fail to fight effectively in 
fending off the rebels attempting to topple her government an 
administration source reported today 
the central intelligence agency in its daily intelligence 
summary prepared for top us officials reported on friday that 
the situation in the philippines was quite uncertain said the 
official speaking on condition he not be identified by name

the communist party admitted 
friday the sovietled invasion that crushed the prague spring 
reforms of 1968 was a mistake in effect apologizing for 21 years 
of repression 
we are of the opinion that the intervention of five countries 
in 1968 was not justified and the decision to do it was wrong 
politburo member vasil mohorita said referring to a new action 
program the party has drafted 
his statement opened the way for a reassessment by the kremlin 
and the four other participants in the invasion that ended the 
reforms possibly at a warsaw pact meeting next week in moscow 
of the invading countries poland hungary and east germany have 
said the invasion was wrong the soviet union and bulgaria have not 
mohorita made concessions to an opposition demand for 
dissolution of the peoples militia the party army but did not 
agree to abolish it 
frantisek pitra a senior official met with vaclav havel 
leader of the reform movement for continuing negotiations on 
forming a new government that includes noncommunists 
party chief karel urbanek told a turbulent farmers congress he 
supported the decision to reassess the reforms instituted a 
generation ago by alexander dubcek then leader of communist party 
in scenes shown live on state tv he also was seen applauded 
conservative farmers who attacked the opposition and at one point 
rose to chant in unison long live the army 
the invasion in august 1968 by all other warsaw pact nations 
except romania was the largest military action in europe since 
world war ii and dealt a blow to hopes that communism could embrace 
democratic reform 
since mikhail s gorbachev became the soviet leader in 1985 and 
started introducing reforms similar to those dubcek pursued the 
official view of the prague spring and the invasion has been 
expected to change 
gorbachev has insisted however that a reevaluation by the 
warsaw pact could take place only if czechoslovakia requested it 
mohorita said the action program approved friday by the 
ruling politburo contains a reexamination of official policy 
which had called the 1968 reforms worthless and sets a new reform 
course for the party 
he also told a news conference the peoples militia will no 
longer be under the command of the communist party but will be 
turned over to the state as is the case in many other countries 
no decision has been made on an opposition demand that direct 
communist party control of the workplace be ended but the party 
promises it will not interfere with the media mohorita said 
a new attitude toward former leaders must develop he said 
but did not specify whether that referred to dubcek or the 
hardliners who cracked down after the invasion 
eleven days of mass protest forced the dismissal of those 
leaders last week and caused the party to change course radically 
toward the reform movement sweeping eastern europe 
mohorita said the draft program outlines the partys new 
position after parliament voted on wednesday to remove 
constitutional guarantees of its supremacy 
it now is one of many political parties that must seek 
support from the people he said and we will all have to get 
accustomed to this 
in order to become official the action program must be 
approved by the party central committee and be adopted by an 
special party congress tentatively scheduled for jan 26 mohorita 
said the central committee will meet dec 14 and might decided to 
hold the congress sooner 
rude pravo the communist party newspaper said friday the 
politburo had ordered a special commission appointed to reevaluate 
the 1968 reforms and the circumstances under which the armies of 
five socialist countries entered czechoslovakia 
at the news conference mohorita said the commission report 
would augment the decision already made by the politburo 
on thursday czechoslovakia announced two other reversals of 
previous policy removal of barriers on the border with austria and 
an end to virtually all restrictions on travel to the west 
the interior ministry said friday that work on dismantling 
barbed wire watchtowers and sensing devices probably would begin 
in the second half of december 
a separate statement on the 1968 invasion by the party 
ideological body the institute of marxismleninism said it had 
been a mistake for czechoslovak communists and warsaw pact leaders 
to say czechoslovakia was threatened by counterrevolution in 1968 
the statement was published friday in rude pravo 
on wednesday premier ladislav adamec became the first 
czechoslovak leader in 20 years to say a new official look should 
be taken at 1968 he also said he hoped to negotiate withdrawal of 
an estimated 80000 soviet soldiers who have been stationed in 
czechoslovakia since the invasion

police asked a court friday to approve 
the seizure of 15 bags of clothing by scottish detectives 
investigating the explosion of pan am flight 103 nearly a year ago 
the clothing was taken monday from the home of mohammed abo 
talb a palestinian being tried on charges related to bombings in 
scandinavia and holland in 1985 and 1986 
seven swedish policemen and three scottish investigators 
stripped the apartment of clothing emptying the closets of abo 
talbs entire family said his exwife who still lives with him 
abo talb a member of the palestine popular struggle front was 
linked to flight 103 when he was found to have been in malta two 
months before the bombing dec 21 1988 
reports say investigators traced clothing bought in malta to the 
suitcase containing the bomb that blew the jetliner apart over 
lockerbie scotland killing 270 people 
detectives searched abo talbs apartment in uppsala for clothing 
purchased in malta that could link him to the disaster 
in a 15minute hearing prosecutor ulf forsberg asked the court 
to declare confiscation of the clothing legal foreign police 
cannot seize evidence from a resident of swedish without court 
approval and must prove its value to their investigation 
the judge said he would decide by monday he asked reporters not 
to give his name because we dont want to be prey on the 
streets 
forsberg said in the hearing that abo talb was a suspect in 
another case in another country but the lockerbie crash was not 
mentioned specifically 
abo talb was brought from a stockholm jail to uppsala 40 miles 
to the north for a closed hearing that followed the open session 
jamila mograbi abo talbs former wife told reporters she was 
questioned for an hour during the search by the 10 swedish and 
scottish policemen on monday and was called to the police station 
wednesday for four hours of further interrogation 
she said the officers took away 15 large plastic bags of 
clothing and her family had to borrow clothes from friends 
although she is divorced from abo talb she is pregnant with their 
third child 
ms mograbi said abo talb had not left sweden in november or 
december of 1988 and she could prove his whereabouts on at least 
several days during those months

attorney general dick thornburgh proposed 
regulations friday to impose civil fines of up to 10000 for 
possessing small amounts of marijuana and other illegal drugs for 
personal use 
the regulations called for in the antidrug law passed last 
year by congress provide an alternative to prosecuting individuals 
in federal court for simple possession of small amounts of the 
drugs 
relatively few defendants are prosecuted under federal law for 
simple possession of small amounts of drugs said spokesman david 
runkel most of the possession cases are brought in connection with 
other federal criminal charges he said 
federal criminal law provides a oneyear sentence and a fine of 
up to 5000 for simple drug possession although a defendant 
already convicted of another crime could receive sentence of up to 
two years and be fined up to 10000 
under the civil regulations proposed by thornburgh the attorney 
general could cite individuals for drug possession and impose a 
fine of up to 10000 the citation could be challenged at a 
hearing before an administrative law judge 
an individual could also appeal the civil citation in federal 
court which would conduct a jury trial according to the 
regulations 
the civil penalties would be invoked on individuals possessing 
no more than a gram of heroin cocaine or methamphetamine or an 
ounce of marijuana and smaller amounts of pcp and lsd 
the civil penalties would not apply to individuals previously 
convicted of possessing the same drug or those who have been twice 
cited for civil violations under the regulations 
civil proceedings could not be invoked as an alternative to 
criminal prosecution if investigators found evidence of an 
intention to sell or distribute drugs 
don fiedler national director of the national organization for 
reform of marijuana laws called the regulations an end run 
around the constitution because the probablecause standard in 
criminal law would not apply in the civil proceedings 
fiedler said the regulations raised many questions about how a 
person cited for drug violations could challenge the legality of a 
search predicting they would create a tremendous amount of 
litigation 
if you go to civil proceedings there is no basis of authority 
to come in with a motion to suppress the search based on 
constitutional grounds fiedler said 
the regulations will be published in the federal register and 
put out for public comment for 30 days 
fiedler whose group advocates the decriminalization of 
marijuana said the regulations effectively accomplish that goal 
but he acknowledged that a 10000 fine is a significant deterrent 
to possessing illegal drugs even in small amounts

a new jersey company is recalling a malaria 
drug because some of the bottles contain an animal diuretic 
instead the food and drug administration said friday 
the recall by biocraft laboratories of elmwood nj applies to 
goldline brand 250 milligram chloroquine phosphate tablets packaged 
in 100tablet bottles labeled as lot number 14311 the fda said 
the fda said the recall began after a pharmacist found a 
chloroquine phosphate bottle containing the animal diuretic a drug 
that steps up production of urine but no injuries or deaths have 
been reported 
bottles containing the wrong drug have been found in california 
utah arizona and oregon 
using tablets from the erroneously labeled bottles would not 
protect against or treat malaria which can be lifethreatening 
and large amounts of diuretics can lead to irregular heartbeat low 
blood pressure and general weakness the agency said 
the chloroquine phosphate tablets are round and white embossed 
with the code bl on one side of the tablet and 38 on the 
other side the fda said 
the tablets of forosemide an animal diuretic are oval 
offwhite and embossed with the code bl on one side and 54 
on the other side 
the fda said anyone who has a bottle or prescription of the 
recalled tablets should return the bottle to the pharmacy and 
consult a physician 
the agency is also asking pharmacists that may have received the 
recalled product to search their prescription files and notify 
patients immediately 
the fda said 1000 bottles of the product may still be on 
pharmacy shelves or in home medicine cabinets

the government of the northern 
republic of slovenia said friday that serbia in the south and 
east is attempting to oust us from yugoslavia 
the statement from the slovenian presidency followed serbias 
decision tuesday to ban all political and economic contacts with 
slovenia 
liberal prosperous slovenia and the hardline communist 
leadership of serbia have been feuding for years but the serbian 
action tuesday was the gravest threat to the unity of the yugoslav 
federation since the death of the nations postworld war ii leader 
josip broz tito in 1980 
earlier friday 13 people were arrested when police dispersed a 
crowd of about 100 gathered for a proserbian rally in ljubljana 
that had been prohibited by slovenian authorities slovenia issued 
an order tuesday banning the rally and serbia reacted by severing 
relations with slovenia 
in its statement slovenias collective presidency called 
serbias action a flagrant violation of all constitutional legal 
and civilized norms 
we shall never permit anyone to drive us away or oust us from 
yugoslavia it said 
yugoslavia is our country we have the right to be citizens of 
the socialist republic of slovenia and also to be different those 
who do not acknowledge this separate themselves from the federal 
state 
it denounced the serbian communist leadership saying we do 
not accept a comprehensive control of a single truth of political 
uniformity authoritarianism and intolerance of ideologic 
monolithism 
serbia is the largest of yugoslavias six republics 
aleksandar prlja serbias secretary for foreign affairs told 
the associated press that slovenias banning of the peaceful 
rally was deeply humiliating for the serbian people 
this is irreconcilable with joint existence in a federal 
state 
slovenian officials said the rally had been organized by serbian 
politicians trying to oust the slovenian leadership 
economic decline has brought increased friction between the 
republics with their different ethnic populations and the 
slovenian serbian conflict also involves liberal vs conservative 
communist leaders slovenia advocates regional autonomy and has 
legalized opposition groups that will contest the regions first 
multiparty balloting in elections next spring serbia insists on a 
centralized federtion with the communist party the only official 
party 
the serbian news media on friday accused slovenia of 
fascistlike behavior and called for the resignation of 
yugoslav president janez drnovsek a slovene 
delo ljubljanas major newspeper said fridays rally was an 
integral part of a plan to alter by force the yugoslav federation 
it was yet another attempt to bring slovenia to its knees 
it called serbias imposition of an economic boycott a 
declaration of war and said slovenia would respond by opening 
itself to the world introducing greater democracy and by holding 
free elections

the soviet union rejects parallels 
between this weekends malta summit and the 1945 yalta conference 
that decided europes postwar fate a senior soviet policymaker 
said friday 
despite the breadth of changes sweeping europe valetin falin 
chief of the soviet communist party central committees 
international department said his country sees no possibility at 
present for german reunification 
nor does it foresee any east european countries abandoning the 
warsaw pact military alliance he said 
falins comments came as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
prepared to meet president bush in superpower summitry at a unique 
historical moment 
the soviet and us spheres of influence that have divided 
europe since 1945 are attributed to a series of allied meetings 
held toward the end of the war 
one of the key meetings including meeting of josef stalin 
franklin roosevelt and winston churchill was held at yalta a 
black sea port in the soviet crimea in february 1945 
the demands by eastern europeans for free elections and their 
rejection of monopolistic communist parties are the most widespread 
challenges to the system imposed in the region under soviet 
dominance since the war 
in their first meeting as heads of state bush and gorbachev 
must address what the breakdown of that old order would mean for 
their relations and for the future of europe 
but that does not mean drafting a new yalta agreement said 
falin 
we should refrain from drawing historical parallels between 
events that in reality have very little in common he said in an 
interview with the associated press 
yalta solved its problems for its times while bush and 
gorbachev will be looking at the problems of their times he 
said 
but unlike yalta falin said they will be looking at the 
problems within their own jurisdictions and that will be 
without any right to influence the decisions of other countries or 
third parties 
the accords reached at yalta potsdam germany and elsewhere 
carved up germany and redrew frontiers in eastern europe 
the postwar division of europe into spheres of influence 
roughly corresponding with the position of allied forces at the end 
of the war have profoundly affected millions of east europeans 
without their having a voice in the decision 
for many poles czechoslovaks yugoslavs and others it amounted 
to abandonment by the west despite wartime sacrifices on behalf of 
the allies a memory that still arouses bitterness 
falin said neither superpower wants to impose its will on the 
smaller countries of europe today 
the soviet union and we believe the united states does not 
believe it has the right to dictate hegemony on the world or in any 
form having its views accepted by third parties he said 
the policy of the right to selfdetermination to make ones 
own decisions will play a very important role in the 
bushgorbachev meeting he said 
but falin also said the soviet union does not see that 
selfdetermination translating at present into the possibility of 
one or more east bloc countries leaving the warsaw pact or of the 
two germanys reuniting 
the question of the new reunification of germany in practical 
terms does not exist at the moment he said that is a question 
that will be solved by history and how it is solved is something 
that most likely not we but our children will know about 
noting that germany was divided according to an agreement among 
the united states the soviet union britain and france he said 
that agreement remains in force 
it is a political and legal reality that no one can ignore and 
no one can pretend does not exist 
as far as the chance that hungary or poland might want to bolt 
the sovietdominated military alliance falin seemed to contradict 
a statement to reporters earlier in the day by soviet lt gen 
viktor staradodubov who said any warsaw pact country has that 
right and can exercise that right 
either the statement was not absolutely exact or the 
translation was not correct falin said 
both the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw 
pact are serious organizations the members of which have different 
duties it is questionable whether one can talk about giving up 
those duties in such a lighthanded manner he said 
besides falin added no member of the warsaw pact comprising 
the soviet union poland hungary czechoslovakia romania 
bulgaria and east germany has made any move to leave it so far 
anything about such a question is pure speculation he said

president bushs decision to commit 
us air power on behalf of corazon aquino upset the rebels 
timetable and deprived them of the advantage they had sought 
unsuccessfully in previous coup attempts 
us warplanes provided air cover for loyal forces and appeared 
friday to have turned the tide against mutinous soldiers who had 
seemed close to toppling the nearly 4yearold administration of 
president aquino 
in attempts to overthrow the government in january 1987 and 
again the following august mutineers tried to seize villamor air 
base and the naval air station at sangley point they failed this 
time they succeeded 
seizing those two installations gave the mutineers access to 
aircraft enabling them to rocket and strafe the presidential 
palace and two major military targets and to knock out the only 
government television station that was broadcasting friday 
with an airfield the rebels could also fly their own 
reinforcements quickly from areas of southeastern luzon and 
mindanao where opposition to the government is strong 
by noon the rebels had blasted malacanang palace twice and camp 
crame headquarters of the philippine constabulary and camp 
aguinaldo headquarters of the armed forces a total of six times 
the psychological impact was great presidential staff members 
contacted by telephone panicked the attacks cut mrs aquino off 
from her people one attack knocked off the air the only operating 
tv station depriving her of her conduit to the people 
rebel sources contacted at the height of the attacks said they 
were convinced of victory and were simply waiting for mrs aquino 
to resign all that changed with us intervention 
mrs aquino said the government decided to ask for us military 
support by noon when her situation appeared desperate the 
presence of us air force f4 fighterbombers put an end to rebel 
air raids 
during the lull philippine f5 jets raided sangley point and 
destroyed the planes that had attacked the palace 
the halt in air operations also gave the government time to rush 
in reinforcements from nearby regions of central and southern luzon 
island where commanders were loyal to mrs aquino 
when the coup attempt was launched early friday it appeared 
that the government could count on relatively few troops based in 
the capital 
reporters saw few progovernment checkpoints or patrols on the 
streets during the crucial early hours of the coup attempt when 
the rebels were rushing units into the capital 
at fort bonifacio headquarters of the philippine army military 
chief of staff gen renato de villa said the situation was a 
standoff with pro and antigovernment units equally matched 
philippine marines on the other hand spearheaded the rebel 
takeover of villamor ironically the marine detachment was 
reinforced after the august 1987 coup attempt because the command 
doubted the loyalty of the army it brought additional marine units 
from the southern philippines because of their supposed discipline 
but the appearance of us warplanes in the skies upset the 
mutineers timetable rebel units heading for the capital stopped 
for hours apparently confused over the implications of 
washingtons action 
by the time they resumed heading for manila the government had 
reinforced its garrison with loyal troops 
late friday a rebel spokesman condemned the american move as 
an act of aggression against the sovereign filipino people

swedish authorities observed world aids day on friday with a 
call for legal homosexual marriage and other countries introduced 
weapons against the disease that ranged from free syringes to a 
cartoon series 
in geneva the world health organization which was sponsoring 
the day to raise awareness of the epidemic displayed a patchwork 
quilt at its headquarters carrying names of victims claimed by the 
disease 
claes ortendahl director of swedens social welfare board said 
legalizing of homosexual marriage would help suppress the disease 
by discouraging promiscuity 
homosexuals and intravenous drug users are among the 
highestrisk groups for aids which destroys the bodys ability to 
fight infection 
cyprus began a weeklong series of television cartoons presenting 
information about aids and how to prevent it 
the campaign is dedicated to the islands youth because they 
are most vulnerable to the deadly disease said dr haris fessas 
of the islands national aids committee 
a gallup poll released friday found 73 percent of canadian 
teenagers interviewed and 64 percent of adults believe condom 
dispensing machines should be installed in high schools to protect 
schoolchildren 
the potential for the movement of the aids epidemic into the 
youth population is very high said robert burr the canadian 
health associations communications director 
soviet lawmaker boris yeltsin on a sixday unofficial visit to 
greece announced he would give 1 million disposable syringes to 
soviet childrens hospitals 
yeltsin said most soviet hospitals have reusable syringes 
increasing the risk of contracting aids 
fullpage newspaper advertisements in britain pointed out that 
it is impossible to say exactly how many people are infected 
because a person can carry the aids virus for years without showing 
symptoms 
we know of 11218 people in the united kingdom who have been 
infected with the virus that leads to aids its the number we 
dont know that is even more worrying said the advertisements 
paid for by the british health education authority 
many countries do not report figures of aids victims because of 
poor reporting facilities or for fear of losing face and suffering 
bad publicity that could damage tourism 
in vietnam state radio said authorities found no one carrying 
the aids virus when they tested 6500 people from highrisk groups 
in hanoi and three other cities 
vietnam china and many other nations consider aids a foreign 
threat 
in sydney australia the morning herald newspaper said the 
disease had claimed the lives of 10 great artists from australia 
and published their photographs under the headline the killer 
that is gathering in our best and our brightest 
today with the death toll well over 800 and 10000 
australians known to be infected artists and performers fear we 
are going the same way as the united states the newspaper said 
updating its aids report friday the world health organization 
said 11000 new cases were registered by last month bringing the 
total reported 198165 
the united states has reported more than 110000 of the cases 
more than 66000 people have died of aids in the united states

energy secretary james watkins said friday 
that plutonium operations will be halted indefinitely at the rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant until all safety concerns are met 
watkins also announced a major management shakeup at the plant 
and said the new management structure will make the plant more 
responsive to safety concerns 
among the questions to be addressed watkins said was whether 
stray plutonium dust at the plant has accumulated in enough 
quantity to cause a nuclear reaction 
although no major hardware problems were identified by the 
department of energy team conduct of operations standards of 
performance engineering support and management structure remain 
deficient he said at a news conference after touring the plant 
the weapons plant which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons already has scaled back plutonium operations 20 percent 
and soon will stop them altogether watkins said rocky flats 
processes plutonium to make triggers for nuclear weapons the only 
government facility to do so 
he said the plutonium operations will remain shut down until he 
and egampg inc which will operate the plant for doe starting jan 
1 are satisfied the safety concerns are met among the safety 
concerns mentioned by watkins on friday was accumulation of 
plutonium dust in ductwork at the plant 
under the new management structure there will be a waste 
management division and a production division with equal authority 
watkins said 
watkins also addressed recent reports about plutonium dust being 
found in alarming quantities in ductwork at rocky flats initial 
reports indicated there was enough plutonium present to cause 
criticality or a nuclear reaction but another study found 
there was less plutonium present in the ducts than originally 
thought both reports said there was no evidence a reaction had 
occurred 
watkins said the criticality issue is serious but does not pose 
a public safety threat 
nevertheless because it is an important safety issue i am 
asking egampg to independently review the reports findings and 
produce their own action plan he said this is an important 
enough issue that we will not resume plutonium operations until we 
have taken action to address plutonium criticality 
gov roy romer who also was present at watkins news 
conference said the decision to halt all plutonium processing 
shows a new commitment by doe to safety issues but said with the 
departments record of past safety violations he wants to see 
proof 
romer said it was a mistake to build the nuclear weapons plant 
so close to a metropolitan area 16 miles northwest of denver but 
said it will take 15 years to move it 
its obvious that the proof is in the pudding and its my job 
as governor of colorado to make sure the citizens are safe romer 
said 
watkins admitted that doe made major mistakes at rocky flats 
we did not bring our management into the modern world and 
were going to do that now he said 
he said poor management at the facility had made it difficult 
for workers to do their job properly and that would have to 
change he said it also is necessary to gain the publics respect 
of course we have a credibility problem what we are trying to 
do now is regain it he said 
watkins said the plant would shut down plutonium operations for 
inventory during the holiday period anyway 
he said the recent transfer of control from rockwell 
international to egampg provided an excellent time to change 
management and attitudes at rocky flats it could be midjanuary 
before operations resume he said 
however watkins acknowledged that any longterm shutdown could 
seriously affect americans nuclear weapons capability the plant 
is the only one of its kind in the united states that makes 
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
he said operations will resume on a buildingbybuilding basis 
with new criteria set up for resuming operations 
among the criteria are the development of system drawings 
verification that all alarm systems are operational verifying that 
required maintenance has been completed and that workers are 
properly traine

a us army helicopter on night 
maneuvers crashed in a field near here killing the pilot and 
injuring the other crewman aboard the army said friday 
the accident occurred late thursday while the oh58c helicopter 
was on a training exercise according to the 3rd infantry division 
based in wuerzburg 
rep frank mccloskey dind a member of the house armed 
services committee said in washington that the army informed him 
the crash took place during a nightvision goggles mission 
i am convinced that these tragic accidents will continue until 
army officials admit that they have a problem and totally rewrite 
their nightvision goggles program mccloskey said in a statement 
mccloskey who favors a temporary suspension of the goggles has 
called for a coordinated pentagon investigation and a review of the 
military use of the goggles which amplify low light 
critics have questioned whether the goggles work adequately when 
there is no moon or when cloudy weather obscures stars 
the army said the helicopter struck a cable attached to a

the east german parliament abolished the 
communist partys constitutional guarantee of supremacy on friday 
as prodemocracy groups had demanded reflecting a national fever 
for swift and thorough reform 
the 500member peoples chamber named a commission to 
investigate abuse of office commission chairman heinrich toeplitz 
revealed details of personal enrichment by the elite before erich 
honecker was forced out as party chief in october 
deputies gasped and shook their heads in disgust when toeplitz 
said honecker and other ousted leaders put 54 billion in swiss 
bank accounts and spent huge sums on hunting lodges luxury 
vacation homes and other indulgences 
many lawmakers shouted for justice and compensation deputy 
wolfgang reinhold called the abuses degenerate behavior that 
should be punished 
east germany became the second soviet bloc nation this week to 
abolish the communist monopoly on power czechoslovakias 
parliament did it wednesday 
earlier this year poland named its first noncommunist 
government since world war ii and hungarys communist party 
transformed itself into a social democratic party bulgaria also 
moved toward reforms 
while soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs liberalization has 
led to looser soviet control over allies there is no indication 
the communists are ready to relinquish their hold on power in the 
kremlin 
the official east german news agency adn said the 163member 
central committee would meet sunday it could decide to expel 
honecker and other members of the former leadership 
former economic chief guenter mittag already has been expelled 
in the partys effort to win public favor 
egon krenz who replaced honecker as party leader told deputies 
friday the communist party was responsible for the nations severe 
economic problems and the excesses 
gross political errors have been committed by my party 
krenz told the session which was carried live on state television 
as leader of the politburo and the central committee i take 
responsibility for this 
such behavior will never be repeated 
krenz 52 faces growing challenges from both the opposition and 
the party because of his long association with the hardline 
honecker regime 
the city council of plauen called for krenzs resignation over 
his alleged role in faking the results of municipal elections this 
summer that gave the communists an overwhelming majority 
parliament long a rubberstamp body that translated communist 
party policy into law had been scheduled to devote fridays 
session to discussion of new regulations on foreign travel 
but noncommunist parliament speaker guenther maleuda opened the 
session by saying the leaders of all parties represented in the 
peoples chamber jointly proposed a constitutional revision to 
strip the communists of their guaranteed leading role 
without debate a show of hands was called on the motion to drop 
a passage from article 1 describing east germany as under 
leadership of the working class and its marxistleninist party 
the communistdominated chamber broke out into applause after 
all but five of the 420 deputies present voted in favor of striking 
the communist power monopoly from the constitution the five 
abstained 
this is the best we could have wished for said carla kawalt 
of the leading opposition group new forum when told of the 
decision we are very happy with this action 
she said the constitutional change was necessary to give other 
political groups more influence in national affairs she declined 
however to characterize the move as a sign the communist 
leadership is committed to democratic principles 
new forum activists in karlmarxstadt called for a twohour 
strike for wednesday demanding further reforms such as a 
marketoriented economy national new forum leader baerbel bohley 
resisted the call but said she supported the demands 
members of the christian democratic union which like all of the 
parties in parliament traditionally has voted along with the 
communists suggested the designation of east germany as a 
socialist state also be stricken from the constitution but that 
proposal failed to win the twothirds majority needed for 
constitutional changes drawing only 112 yes votes and 20 
abstentions 
the amended article describes east germany as a socialist 
state of workers and farmers 
east germans repeatedly have called for an end to communist 
domination during the street protests that have swept the nation 
for two months 
but even among prodemocracy activists many voices recently 
have called for keeping the nations socialist foundation to stave 
off the reunification aims of west germany 
many east germans fear that their small nation of 165 million 
would lose its identity in a confederation or in a union with the 
wealthy west german state that has more than 61 million people and 
is one of the worlds strongest economies 
the communists retain control of the government but the change 
approved friday paves the way for a more competitive political 
system for the next national elections expected as early as next 
year 
the legislature also passed a resolution that said east germany 
regretted its participation in the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia that crushed the prague spring reforms the 
resolution apologized to the people of czechoslovakia and expressed 
solidarity with its reforms 
special committees also were named to draft a law on free 
elections and to consider further constitutional change 
deputies also heard warnings from premier hans modrow planning 
minister gerhard schuerer and others that a long road lies ahead to 
economic recovery 
trade minister manfred flegel said the hoarding of highpriced 
goods such as appliances and electronics has skyrocketed as 
citizens have become fearful about the value of their currency 
which is nonconvertible and is worth little outside east germany

romanian gymnast nadia comaneci the darling of 
the 1976 olympics with her seven perfect 10s landed flawlessly in 
the united states friday after her stunning defection three days 
earlier 
i wanted to have a free life comaneci who was guaranteed 
political asylum said in halting english at a news conference at 
john f kennedy international airport 
asked how long she had thought about defecting she replied a 
long time i had it in my mind for a few years 
the 28yearold comaneci arrived on the pan am plane liberty 
bell from vienna just before 430 pm an airline spokesman said 
comaneci wearing a blue denim jacket black shirt and jeans 
said she was not thinking about embarrassing her countrys 
government when she made her decision 
its not my business she said the olympic gold medalist 
also said she was looking forward to a change in lifestyle i 
know it will be different i was nine times in the states i know 
the life here 
comaneci was surrounded by port authority police as she walked 
through the pan am terminal about 25 feet away from a horde of 
reporters after her arrival clutching a bouquet of flowers 
comaneci kept her head down as she entered a private pan am office 
where she filled out forms 
comaneci appeared pale as she strode briskly through the 
terminal but the gymnast later smiled broadly as she walked toward 
an airport lounge for a news conference 
she was accompanied to her news conference by konstantin panit 
a frenchman who said he was a friend of comaneci 
the gymnast was to spend the night in new york at an undisclosed 
location and two people familar with her plans who spoke only on 
condition their names not be used said she intended to leave for 
miami on saturday 
her former coach bela karolyi said earlier her final 
destination was indianapolis headquarters of the us gymnastics 
federation but patti auer spokeswoman for the foundation said 
they had no word of comaneci coming there 
justice department spokesman david runkel confirmed that 
comaneci who fled her homeland for hungary on tuesday had been 
granted refugee status and was in the air on her way to this 
country 
comaneci contacted a us embassy in europe on friday morning 
and was quickly granted that status said state department deputy 
spokesman richard boucher adding we certainly welcome ms 
comaneci 
refugee status means us officials believe comaneci has a 
wellfounded fear of persecution if she returns to romania where 
the hardline marxist government has rejected the reformist tide 
sweeping other east european countries 
she would be eligible to apply for permanent resident status in 
the us in one year us officials who requested anonymity said 
comaneci has been in hiding since fleeing romania she 
reportedly told a border guard she was leaving for the sake of 
freedom 
her whereabouts and plans were unknown until word of her 
impending arrival in new york broke friday karolyi had encouraged 
comaneci earlier this week to follow his example and come to the 
united states 
karolyi defected from romania in 1981 it was initially believed 
comaneci would return to the united states with karolyi from 
stuttgart west germany 
karolyi who coached the then 14yearold comaneci during her 
perfect performances at the montreal olympics told us gymnastics 
federation spokesperson patti auer it was a big relief to know 
the gymnast was headed for the united states auer spoke friday 
with karolyi from west germany 
i was concerned when i heard she left the hungarian hotel in 
an unmarked car but i was confident that she knows the lesson 
that she needed to go to the american embassy she quoted karolyi 
as saying 
comanecis defection was a blow to the hardline government of 
romanian president nicolae ceausescu who had named the 4foot11 
gymnast a hero of socialist labor for her accomplishments she 
was held up as a role model for romanian youth 
comaneci won 21 gold medals in olympic and other international 
meets during her career which won her a life of privilege in a 
country that has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for 
most of this decade

soldiers fought rebels in two 
poor neighborhoods of san salvador on friday and in scattered 
encounters north and south of the city the army reported 
a salvadoran photographer for agence francepresse was killed 
and a red cross worker with him was wounded in soyapango one of 
the neighborhoods where the armed forces said fighting took place 
overnight 
president alfredo cristiani said the national situation remained 
critical but that his 5monthold government was not in danger 
a reporter for the french agency said the photographer eloy 
guevara the red cross worker carrying a white flag and a 
salvadoran radio reporter were at a gas station at the foot of a 
hill in an area that saw combat earlier 
journalists yards away from guevara when he was shot said he was 
crossing an intersection with three red cross workers when a burst 
from an assault rifle struck him and ricocheted off a wall 
two reporters there agreed that judging from the angle of fire 
the bullets came from the side of the street where air force 
paratroopers were in complete control 
guevara was the second journalist killed since the leftist 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln began an 
offensive in the capital three weeks ago 
the other was david blundy 44 a veteran war correspondent who 
worked for the sunday correspondent of london 
gen maxwell thurman commander of the us southern command 
based in panama visited el salvador on friday us embassy 
spokesman jeff brown said the purpose of the visit was to 
reaffirm us support and his personal commitment to the world of 
the salvadoran armed forces 
the armed forces press office reported fighting overnight in the 
ciudad delgado neighborhood where leftist rebels remained and 
soyapango it said the guerrillas had left soyapango 
both neighborhoods were major combat zones in the early days of 
the fmln offensive which has made thousands of san salvador 
residents homeless 
the offensive radically changed the decadeold guerrilla war 
against usbacked governments in which more than 71000 people 
have been killed it brought heavy combat to the capital for the 
first time and the guerrillas began using antiaircraft missiles 
pentagon officials in washington said introduction of the 
missiles meant the salvadoran military whose air power had faced 
little challenge would have to change its tactics 
military officials said friday nine soldiers and nine guerrillas 
had been killed in fighting near zacatecoluca 25 miles south of 
san salvador where rebels fired a sovietmade sam7 surfacetoair 
missile wednesday for the first time a military source said the 
missile missed an a37 jet fighter 
salvadors rightist government accused nicaragua of supplying 
the missiles and suspended relations the united states filed a 
formal protest with the soviet union which arms nicaragua and the 
issue is on the agenda for the weekend summit off malta between 
president bush and mikhail s gorbachev 
one soldier and one guerrilla were reported wounded at 
tonacatepeque 10 miles north of san salvador 
cristiani said a state of siege imposed after the start of the 
offensive would not be lifted until violence subsided the rules 
restrict freedoms including freedom of the press 
san salvadors mayor asked residents to forgo the custom of 
setting off fireworks over the christmas holiday 
residents of the exclusive escalon neighborhood began repairing 
houses that were shot up when guerrillas took over about 40 homes 
there and in another wealthy district wednesday some residents 
closed their homes and went abroad or to visit relatives 
american citizens were evacuated from the area during a 
ceasefire the rebels declared thursday more than 200 us embassy 
dependents and private citizens left el salvador on a charter 
flight 
in washington the state department said two of the damaged 
homes were occupied by americans no residents were reported hurt 
soldiers from el salvadors toughest battalions patrolled the 
streets of escalon and surrounding neighborhoods 
streets were littered with spent cartridges burnedout luxury 
cars and downed power lines guerrillas withdrew under cover of 
darkness leaving a few snipers behind 
soldiers of the atlacatl battalion burned a guerrillas body and 
dumped it headfirst into a mesh trash basket outside one of the 
fortified mansions in escalon 
a crude cardboard sign with a skull and crossbones scrawled on 
it was jammed in next to the body it said the atlacal does not 
take prisoners 
there is no man no law that holds us back the sign said 
a soldier said of the guerrilla he thought hed scare us we 
burned him

on the eve of their superpower 
summit president bush said friday he would seek a future free of 
both tyranny and fear while mikhail s gorbachev promised the two 
men would strive together toward a new world a better world 
gorbachev flew to malta after a historic visit with pope paul ii 
and said recent developments called for a more dynamic dialogue 
between the united states and soviet union 
bush who arrived at the windswept summit site earlier in the 
day said our meeting here off malta will last two days but the 
freedoms that we seek must last for generations 
the two men sit down on saturday for the first session of their 
shipboard summit taking place against a backdrop of stunning 
change in eastern europe that has swept hardline regimes from 
power in nearly 12 hours of scheduled talks gorbachev and bush 
are expected to discuss arms control trade relations and conflicts 
such as afghanistan and nicaragua as well as eastern europe 
the whole world now is taking a deep breath said italian 
premier giulio andreotti expressing the anticipation felt 
throughout europe 
gray clouds cold weather and choppy seas set the scene for the 
talks being conducted on us and soviet warships anchored in the 
harbor off the coast of this mediterranean island maltas entire 
1200man military and most of its 1000 police were out in force 
to protect the superpower leaders 
us and maltese patrol boats circled and frogmen checked the 
waters as bush landed by helicopter on the american guidedmissile 
cruiser uss belknap his command post and the meeting site sunday 
for the summit 
bushs lastminute summit preparations were interrupted by an 
attempted coup in the philippines which he sought to snuff out by 
committing us air support to forces loyal to president corazon 
aquino 
we will be speaking about peace to a new world to a 
better world for the peoples of all continents gorbachev said at 
luqa airport on his arrival just before midnight 
gorbachev flew from italy several hours after a historic meeting 
with pope paul ii at the vatican where he said russians have a 
right to satisfy their spiritual needs and pledged swift 
adoption of a new religious law guaranteeing freedom of worship 
before leaving italy gorbachev offered his clearest endorsement 
yet of the changes in eastern europe he told a news conference in 
milan that the prague spring reform movement of 1968 was 
right at that time and is right now 
but he stopped short of an apology for the warsaw pact invasion 
of czechoslovakia that put down the reform movement in 1968 he 
said it must be viewed in the context of an accelerating arms race 
and an ideological struggle between east and west at that time 
beyond promising religious tolerance gorbachev said the kremlin 
will establish diplomatic ties with the vatican he invited the 
pope to pay a visit to the soviet union officially an atheist 
nation although no date was announced 
bush talked of the philippines as well as the summit 
i strongly support mrs aquino and she knows it he said he 
said the situation in manila sounds maybe a little better but 
hard to tell 
during a brief visit to the american aircraft carrier the uss 
forrestal bush called gorbachev a dynamic new soviet leader 
willing to think anew 
and we want him to succeed the president said because we 
do admire the people in the soviet union and we know that ours is 
an historic opportunity to foster the peace bush expressed hope 
that ours can be a future free of both tyranny and fear 
he presented the forrestals crew with a piece of the crumbling 
berlin wall as a symbol of the peace we seek 
he watched a demonstration of warplanes being catapulted off the 
deck and screeching into the sky a thunderous sonic boom from an 
f14 caught him by surprise and bushs knees buckled and he 
ducked he recovered quickly with a sheepish grin and a funny face 
for cameras 
gorbachev delivered his promise of religious freedom as he 
joined the pope at a news conference in the vatican 
people of many confessions including christians moslems 
jews buddhists and others live in the soviet union the kremlin 
leader said all of them have a right to satisfy their spiritual 
needs 
he said a freedomofconscience law would be adopted soon 
the pope called the meeting a promisefilled sign for the 
future and pledged support for gorbachevs efforts to overhaul 
soviet society 
the malta summit is the first superpower meeting since gorbachev 
met then president ronald reagan in new york last december bush 
attended that meeting as vice president

sixperson us delegation while gorbachev and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze will lead the eightperson soviet team 
bush who is expected to make the opening presentation saturday 
convened a meeting in the belknap wardroom of senior us advisers 
focusing on issues which will demonstrate the us desire for 
progress and improvement in eastwest relations said white house

tens of thousands of police guarded 
polling stations saturday as voters cast ballots in taiwans first 
election with legal opposition parties 
there were long lines of voters at polling booths and state 
radio predicted a heavy turnout results were not expected until 
sometime sunday 
voting appeared to be orderly but radio reports said several 
people were injured friday night in clashes at campaignclosing 
rallies in the industrial city of kaohsiung 
there are 722 candidates running in the legislative mayoral and 
county magistrate elections which are seen as a major step in 
taiwans march toward democracy after four decades of rule by the 
nationalist party 
it is an important test of the democratic progressive party the 
main opposition the party was legalized in 1987 following the end 
of martial law under which opposition parties were banned 
more than 75000 police guarded about 10000 polling stations to 
prevent sabotage and security forces readied barbed wire and 
roadblocks in case of riots police have said they received tips 
about plans to disrupt the elections with bombs and the use of 
chemicals to destroy ballots 
about 12 million ot taiwans 20 million citizens were eligible 
to vote 
opposition candidates have called for the downfall of the 
nationalist party which has ruled this island nation since it 
lost a civil war to communist forces on the chinese mainland in 
1949 
they accused the nationalists of buying votes and other unfair 
tactics 
president lee tenghui and his wife cast their ballots in 
taipei he told reporters dont forget to vote the weather is 
nice so there will be a big turnout 
nationalist leader james soong said losses for his party could 
cause social unrest and damage the islands prosperous economy 
our party has made reforms and brought welfare to the public 
he said 
the nationalists cannot lose all power in the election the 
256seat legislature and the electoral college are dominated by 
elderly nationalists elected for life on the chinese mainland in 
the late 1940s to support the partys claim to be the legitimate 
government of all china 
the electoral college will choose a president next year 
in a lastminute move to win support from reformminded voters 
the nationalists announced that 34 of the 162 elderly legislators 
had agreed to accept handsome pensions and will file for retirement 
soon 
few legislators took advantage of the retirement program when it 
was announced in february by president lee tenghui 
opposition leader kang said his party was handicapped during the 
campaign by the nationalists domination of the islands economy 
and media 
taiwans three government tv stations initially gave almost 
exclusive coverage to nationalist candidates but yielded under 
pressure from the public 
the opposition also says the nationalists also have been helped 
by an immense party machine that mobilized village chiefs and other 
politicians to secure votes 
the nationalists also have been accused of rampant vote buying 
and violence including sabotaging campaign offices and shooting an 
independent candidate the nationalists denied the charges but 
financial officials said cash in circulation jumped by 11 billion 
the past week because of votebuying 
we have but incomplete democracy said kang ninghsiang the 
leader of the democratic progressive party 
although opposition candidates running as independents received 
22 percent of the vote in 1986 legislative elections they only won 
12 seats 
the opposition is expected to win at least 30 percent of the 
popular vote but this year it has chosen to focus on local 
elections especially the five mayorships and 17 county magistrate 
seats being contested 
the party believes that winning grassroots power can help bring 
about more local autonomy and build a stronger power base 
most opposition candidates have focused on domestic problems 
including pollution and official corruption 
the most contentious campaign issue was raised by 32 opposition 
candidates who formed an alliance to openly call for an 
independent taiwan 
in a rejection of the nationalist goal to one day rule over a 
reunified china the alliance called for a new country and new 
constitution 
such a demand is seditious under the constitution and served as 
an indication of taiwans increasingly open political debate 
many taiwanese remain skeptical of the movement because of 
communist chinas threat to invade the island if it declares 
independence

now that hes finally got his career on track 
paul carrack would like to thank a special grade school friend from 
sheffield england 
i remember when i was a little kid i used to stand next to mr 
holden one of the teachers recalled the 38yearold 
singerkeyboardist whose new album is called groove approved 
i could never understand what was going on this guy was a 
music teacher and he used to sing counterpoint to all the hymns 
and i thought whats going on here cause hes singing the wrong 
tune yet its all working 
i used to always try to get near this guy im sure he must be 
dead by now but he was an incredible guy he wrote this whole 
opera for little kids based on the barber of seville he played 
fiddle amd come to think of it i starred in one of his shows 
love of music has sustained this rock n roll journeyman a 
survivor from englands long forgotten pubrock movement of the 
mid1970s whose soulful vocals periodically have appeared on hit 
records how long by ace squeezes tempted mike and the 
mechanics silent running and his own top 10 single dont 
shed a tear 
in between the singer admits have been gray areas times spent 
between hits when carrack appeared more destined to wind up in 
a whatever happened to book rather than billboards hot 100 
ive had some ups and downs indeed some troughs suffice to 
say but during the troughs i was still hanging in there ive 
never really done anything else apart from this 
set carracks career to music and it might sound like this a 
fast start very fast maybe too fast soon the tempo breaks down 
the needle skips over parts of the record and scratches appear but 
just when the song appears over the pace picks up and steadily 
builds 
thats where he is now nearly 20 years in the music business 
and finally making records with his name on it his keyboards and 
his choice of style 
its a bit raggedy and i like that i didnt play a note on 
the previous album chris difford of squeeze is the kind of guy 
who likes everything in place you know precise im not precise 
tbone producer tbone wolk loves the way i play its slightly 
dodgy but thats fine you know what im saying 
the 12 songs on groove approved combine rock pop soul 
gospel and country because carrack prefers to write with others 
such associates as wolk longtime friend and fellow pubrock 
alumnus nick lowe and squeeze member chris difford all pitch in 
love can break your heart was cowritten by exdoobie 
brother michael mcdonald whose partnership with carrack came after 
several unsuccessful blind dates 
i was in la and my record company chrysalis was pitching 
me songs and pitching me songs and saying we think you should get 
together with other writers i had only written with people like 
nick lowe so they set up a bunch of meetings for me to meet the 
old la tunesmiths 
im not knocking these guys some of them had good 
reputations but it was very very weird this one guy bald as 
brass was sitting by the swimming pool in his hotel and hes got 
a ghetto blaster he puts on the old backing track and gives me a 
whole performance by the swimming pool 
to carracks astonishment and the record companys anchor as 
well the first single how long was a worldwide smash an 
american tour was inevitable and disastrous gold was already 
fading to gray 
we did all the wrong things he said we came over and 
opened for yes on a tour of enormous arenas for three months that 
was very much the wrong thing to do we were a very lowkey band 
we should have done some clubs 
we had three years of a gradual winding down and demise and 
went back to england but the scene had changed drastically we got 
back for the punk era and we didnt fit in at all so that was very 
weird the songs i was writing were just out of time 
he waited it out playing in local bands and making valuable 
friends like lowe and difford by the early 80s punk had burned 
out and pop and soul were welcome again 
the hits with squeeze and mike and the mechanics gave carrack 
enough commercial power to build up his solo career starting two 
years ago with one good reason and now groove approved 
to most people im a new artist for myself as a musician i 
still feel im only just scraping the tip of the iceberg in a lot 
of ways maybe im just a slow learner 
im 38 ive been drifting around doing this and that 
thirtyeight when most people are finished in this game and im 
only getting to make what feels like my first bloody record its 
weird eh

when the punk rock band old skull began 
performing at local clubs jp toulons hands were only big enough 
to play three chords on the guitar and the group got paid with 
mcdonalds happy meals 
today the three prepubescent punksters have a music video on 
mtv for their debut lp get outta school and practice in 
jps basement on hightech equipment donated by sponsors they 
even were paid 1000 for a 30minute performance in new york 
old skull guitarist jp toulon 10 his brother bass 
player jamie 9 and drummer jesse collinsdavies 10 has been 
together for three years the trio is managed by jps father 
vern get outta school which was recorded more than a year ago 
and released last spring has sold about 30000 copies 
people will buy your first album because youre young and new 
and they think oh how cute said jesse a fifthgrader but 
now they want to hear real music and thats what were trying to 
do our last record we just played anything 
on the first album the band sings and screams about such 
issues as the homeless and aids in homeless jp howls into 
the microphone amid screeching guitars and bashing drums 
i hate you ronald reagan he shouts at the end with a look 
in his eye that tells you he means it 
reagans out dude robin davies jesses father said at a 
recent afterschool practice 
i know jp responded i still hate him 
the band performs fun silly songs too 
hotdog hell gives the audience more than just music for slam 
dancing a popular form of dancing for punk rock enthusiasts 
its usually our last song said jamie a fourthgrader 
we throw hot dogs into the crowd its funny then they throw 
them back at us and we fight back we throw them back again 
but the band has gained more popularity on the east and west 
coasts than at home in madison davies said on the coasts they 
tend to get caught up in the media like la and new york in 
madison they dont get caught up in it which is good actually 
for the kids in madison theyre more grounded 
the band has received more than 400 fan letters from around the 
world including one from a boy in greece 
both fathers who also are musicians insist their children are 
treated just like other students at school and have not been 
changed by their success 
i know its crazy but things are absolutely the same 
toulon said if anything theyre sick of it media attention 
theres been no grown heads 
amid school soccer karate and skateboarding the boys practice 
weekly and travel about one weekend a month to minneapolis 
milwaukee chicago and other nearby cities they usually play in 
bars or nightclubs the band will make its first international 
appearance when the boys along with their parents go to japan to 
appear on an audienceparticipation television show dec 8 
despite some criticism for allowing their children to play in a 
punk band the fathers said they believe old skull is a 
positive aspect in their sons lives 
its really opened a lot of doors for jp toulon said 
although hes never acted before jp has auditioned for the lead 
role in motorama an action film from the producers of 
platoon 
jp and jesse also write most of the bands songs 
we write about what we see and feel jesse said we write 
about what we think is important 
were trying to be more serious than we are said jp a 
fifthgrader but its hard because were only kids 
what timely topics can we expect old skull to be shrieking 
criticism at on the next album 
i wrote a song about the stealth bomber jesse said its 
called money waste

the strange ways of wall street were put on 
exhibit again last week when a spate of reports from government and 
the private sector showed the economy was continuing to weaken 
prices rose 
or perhaps it was the strange ways of the federal reserve that 
were on display because it can be argued the fed also reacted 
somewhat strangely to the developing bad news 
that news was relentless consumer spending twothirds of the 
gross national product fell automobile sales dropped housing 
starts were off from a year earlier helping to bring down spending 
on furniture and appliances too 
the index of leading economic indicators fell 04 percent in 
october the november report from the national association of 
purchasing management also suggested contraction in manufacturing 
initial jobless claims rose 
news of that sort piling up as it does indicates impending 
recession most recessions are accompanied by strains on corporate 
profits and profit in in the final analysis is the basis of 
stock prices 
but the stock market rose on the news 
there was however no mystery to why it rose it rose because 
the big professional portfolio managers convinced themselves that 
all the negative news would force the federal reserve to let 
interest rates drop 
even though the fed sent a strong signal to the contrary by 
propping up the federal funds rate the overnight rate for loans 
between banks it wasnt believed eventually it was reasoned 
the fed had to let up on restraint 
consider some of the other evidence 
domestic auto sales since the end of the third quarter were 15 
percent below the pace for the first nine months of 1989 plants 
have been shut down and workers have been laid off 
the growth of us exports has slowed new orders for durable 
goods fell 06 percent in october the fourth decline in six 
months production of goods such as food clothing and paper are 
off from a year ago 
the weight of evidence the market said demanded action by the 
fed but so far as can be determined from published statements fed 
chairman alan greenspan hasnt changed his mind about inflation 
being his primary concern 
the market doesnt believe him 
early last week word spread through the big investment centers 
that the fed would force down shortterm rates in an effort to slow 
or reverse the slump in manufacturing in fact the fed did inject 
reserves into the banking system 
one day later it indicated differently when it jacked up the 
federal funds rate 
the fed still has reasons to be concerned the jobless rate is 
low by recent standards and that could force wages higher and the 
05 percent rise in the october consumer price index annualizes to 
more than 6 percent 
in the securities markets however they discount such data 
contending that the jobless rate will rise and the price index will 
soon fall if the fed doesnt give the economy a lift nothing does 
it they say like lower rates 
in effect the market seemed to say this is as bad as it gets 
but has the market properly assessed the fed chairman who is 
determined to end inflation once and for all

in a little valley known as griffin creek 
jane watson hopping is writing oldtime cookbooks that have as much 
to say about what has brought her happiness as how to make uncle 
buds oldfashioned vinegar pie 
she and and her husband ray have run what they call a sea preserving 
a 
way of life with which most people seem to be out of touch 
with a son and daughter grown and much of the farm sold off for 
houses hopping began a project of writing down for her children 
the old family recipes she had learned in her own mothers kitchen 
and carried in her head such things as denver biscuits golden egg 
bread and aunt ida louises chocolatey wacky cake with dusted 
powdered sugar lace 
but the recipes didnt get published until hopping mixed in some 
memories of growing up on a farm during the depression and seasoned 
them with poems and pictures gleaned from forgotten 
turnofthecentury books 
the pioneer ladys country kitchen published last year by 
villard books earned warm praise from reviewers hopping has come 
back this year with the pioneer ladys country christmas and is 
working on a third book for next year to be called country 
mothers 
she became known as the pioneer lady in the local schools 
where she taught children how to make deerfat candles churn 
butter tan hides and barter three different ways 
more than anything else her books are about memories kitchen 
memories barnyard memories family memories 
i would tell the children every day of your life you are in 
the memory business good memories and bad she said you 
look on your life and you find that i have lived such a happy and 
successful life and thats because you created every day good 
memories if you created only bad memories when you look back you 
dont have anything to feel good about 
the inspiration for the books came from an old primer from a 
school in eagle point the primer contained an etching of a young 
girl standing in a barnyard that reminded hopping of her own 
childhood 
i think it released me in a sense to tell about my family 
myself she said maybe prior to that i was trying to do some 
kind of writing but you know not revealing myself 
also in the primer were poems by james whitcomb riley the 
hoosier poet of indiana including the frost is on the pumpkin 
i thought oh thats what i need for my cookbook to make a 
setting like in a ring she said as it turned out the 
setting was equally important to the recipes 
at book signings hopping hears more about how people enjoyed 
her memories than about how they enjoyed the food 
ive had my first fan letter she said a young woman in 
california said i love your book and i bought one for my sister 
she said were going to change our life a little bit were going 
to make pomander balls and have more family picnics 
shes finding something in there that she thinks would make 
their life richer thats wonderful for a cookbook 
besides christmas goodies the pioneer ladys country 
christmas is filled with the stories that come out during family 
gatherings how grandmother nursed neighbors in southwestern 
missouri during an outbreak of scarlet fever in 1908 and was 
thanked just before christmas with an anonymous gift of a crate 
filled with toys and clothes how uncle will would tie himself to 
the barn in a blizzard so he wouldnt get lost while tending to the 
animals 
christmas means family to me said hopping when i was 
growing up we had an extended family then you didnt move around 
so much you had your friends sometimes for 30 or 40 years 
when i look back at christmas what i enjoy the most is not 
the food i enjoy fixing the food and all that thats part of life 
for christmas but i enjoy the coming together of the family 
though she was born in kansas in 1929 when her father was 
working on a gas pipeline hopping proudly traces her roots to 
pioneer stock in missouri 
during the depression the family had spread out looking for 
work leaving her grandfather alone in missouri 
none of the family could stand this because this was a very 
clannish family she said 
so they all decided to move to california where hoppings 
father eventually became foreman at a limestone quarry in the gold 
country town of auburn 
she grew up knowing the joys of sharing even in times when 
there wasnt much to share in the old days it was what you were 
going to do for your friends she said people would say i am 
going to sit here and knit collars until everybody in the family 
has a lace collar im going to go out in the barn every night 
after i worked hard in the fields and i am going to make doll 
cradles 
she married ray hopping who gave up his job on the railroad 
back in california and in 1958 they moved to the farm in griffin 
creek where they keep the old ways 
in griffin creek we still trade about ourselves she said 
its not uncommon to find some apples sitting on your shelf the 
neighbors share back and forth with the work 
i guess that one reason i continue to write about the old days 
is because i really kind of live in a time thats not changed that 
much

munir bashir is known as the emir of the 
oud 
he uses the pearshaped stringed instrument to promote arabic 
music around the world and to bridge a culture gap but he 
believes that one of his biggest tasks in life is to instill a love 
of arabic music among youngsters who have been seduced by western 
rock and disco music and preserve a rich artistic heritage 
its a shame he said in an interview we have such great 
music but the younger generations never heed it 
bashir a native of mosul in northern iraq said that for arabs 
to neglect their traditional music is to ignore an important aspect 
of their cultural identity 
music is part of the cultural identity of any people its not 
something you can borrow from others he said music is not 
just entertainment its a source of spiritual and moral 
uplifting 
bashir 59 believes arabic music is now in a state of crisis 
which he attributes to cultural backwardness 
as director of musical affairs at the culture ministry in 
baghdad he has devoted 16 years to promoting arabic music as part 
of iraqs educational system and culture 
bashire established a ballet and music school for children to 
study and learn to play instruments and the iraqi institute of 
melody studies for teenagers 
three years ago he formed the albayariq ensemble a 28member 
youth group to develop young peoples interest in authentic arabic 
music and to help preserve centuriesold songs that have begun to 
disappear because of the ugly thrust of modern music it is led 
by his youngest son omer 20 
its not just a source of pride but an investment in our 
cultural future bashir said if we dont encourage young 
people to play these instruments our traditional music will die 
and these instruments will only be found in museums 
albayariq brings together the oud qanun santur and joza all 
stringed instrumemnts as well as the tablah a small drum and the 
riqq a frame drum with jingles akin to a tambourine 
the oud is a sixstringed instrument shaped like a lute bashir 
believes the oud originated in iraq the instrument has been seen 
on stone carvings dating back 2000 years from arabia the oud 
made its way to europe possibly in the moorish conquest of spain 
and from it evolved the lute 
the qanun is a zitherlike instrument the violinlike joza has 
only one string that gives a strong high pitch it is played 
resting on the leg rather than nestling under the chin the santure 
is something like a qanun but its strings are played with sticks 
rather than a bow 
the instruments used by the ensemble are specially made for the 
group by elderly craftsmen in a workshop set up by bashir 
the ensemble has performed in several foreign countries 
including france and all over the arab world in paris the 
youngsters performed at the arab world institute to standing 
ovations 
now weve built a solid base i hope these kids will stick to 
their instruments pioneering the way for others to follow 
bashir said 
arabic music has largely been ignored in the west because of its 
complex melodies and ornamental flourishes that make it difficult 
to grasp but artists such as bashir are increasingly bridging the 
cultural gap 
critics hail him as a creative and supreme master of his 
instrument whose music springs from the authentic tradition of 
arabian music foreign critics say bashir is notable for being able 
to project the emotions of arabic music often lost to the 
occidential ear to nonarabs 
he stretches the understanding of music to the limit one 
european critic wrote to listen to him takes as much 
intellectual energy and attention as listening to the discourse of 
a sage 
his playing is rooted in classical arab forms but is largely 
improvisational some critics have found it resembles progressive 
jazz in many ways 
bashir has elevated the oud to solo instrument status after 
centuries of having been used to accompany arab singers for one 
thing he added six more strings pairing them with the others to 
produce a fuller sound and melodic flexibility 
he discovered his gift for music when he was 6 years old while 
listening to his mother singing lullabies to his younger brothers 
she also played several traditional instruments 
she was my first idol she breathed the love of music into 
me he said 
his father made ouds and bashirs brother also plays the 
instrument 
in his ministry office crowded with musical instruments 
records and tapes he spends two to three hours a day playing no 
one is allowed to interrupt him 
all telephone calls and appointments have to be put off when 
alistath the master is playing until he finishes his solo 
performance in his office said his secretary nizar jawad who 
is also a lyricist and musician

salomon brothers inc filed a 150 
million countersuit against west virginia in federal court as the 
state settled for 2 million a claim with a second investment 
banker group 
the separate legal actions involve in over the loss of 279 
million in the states consolidated investment fund in 198789 
when the funds assets were traded on wall street 
the state sued salomon county natwest government securities 
inc and three other firms in october blaming them for the massive 
losses suffered by the fund 
salomon brothers in a countersuit filed thursday in us 
district court in charleston said west virginia wants the 
brokerage house to pay for the losses while giving the state the 
profits which it estimates at 150 million 
it said in the suit that the state however cannot it have both 
ways 
this heads we win tails you lose approach to the parties 
longsettled transactions is unconscionable inequitable and 
unjust the suit contended 
attorney general roger tompkins said salomons suit is just one 
of many countersuits against the state 
all four of those defendants have filed lawsuits against the 
state of west virginia and the board of investments were 
talking millions and millions of dollars tompkins said 
the board of investments which oversees the fund cleared one 
of the defendants from further litigation thursday 
it voted to accept a 2 million settlement offer from county 
natwest 
tompkins said the settlement is significant because by settling 
county natwest agreed that it was responsible in part for the 
damages 
they were willing to confess they had a problem and pay some 
money to get out of this lawsuit tompkins said

jaguar plc which is being acquired by ford motor 
co in a friendly 25 billion deal said friday its shareholders 
have approved lifting a restriction limiting holdings in the 
british luxury auto maker to just 15 percent 
the shareholders approved waiving the restriction by more than 
99 percent the measure required approval of at least 75 percent 
the approval was widely expected and clears the way for ford to 
buy more jaguar shares and gain control of its target 
ford spokesman rex greenslade said from the no 2 us 
automakers headquarters in dearborn mich that the company was 
pleased with the vote 
he said ford planned to acquire more than 50 percent of jaguar 
stock by dec 8 one week after the shareholders decision 
considering the strength of fridays vote it appeared likely that 
ford which currently owns about 13 percent of jaguar would reach 
that goal 
in response to the news jaguar rose 157 cents to 1313 a 
share on londons stock exchange ford has offered 1335 a share 
for jaguar 
at a special shareholders meeting jaguar chairman john egan 
reiterated his belief that the british company has a good future 
ahead as a strong autonomous company 
under terms of the agreement with ford jaguar will have a 
separate legal identity its own board of directors and will 
retain its separate dealership network 
trade secretary nicholas ridley announced on thursday that the 
takeover would not be referred to the monopolies and mergers 
commission 
ford announced the friendly bid on nov 2 a day after ridley 
waived the governments golden share 
the golden share established when the government privatized the 
formerly stateowned jaguar in 1984 gives the government veto 
power over any takeover and was originally designed to protect 
jaguar from being acquired until the end of 1990

movie producers peter guber and jon 
peters the new cochairmen of columbia pictures entertainment 
inc have chosen their longtime lawyer to oversee nearly all 
columbias operations 
the attorney alan j levine has represented the batman and 
rain man producers for the last decade levine has been a 
partner in the armstrong hirsch amp levine firm since 1980 handling 
major clients in the motion picture and television business 
levines move to columbia had been widely expected sony corp 
purchased the studio in september for 34 billion then bought 
guber and peters out of their warner bros production contract in a 
settlement that some analysts have valued at up to 500 million 
levine will become president and chief operating officer of the 
newly formed filmed entertainment group which includes columbia 
pictures tristar pictures triumph releasing columbia pictures 
television rcacolumbia home video merv griffin enterprises and 
their various offshoots 
the only thing left out is loews the theater chain owned 
by columbia said columbia spokesman ed russell 
the naming of levine underlined the precarious status of 
columbia pictures president dawn steel brought in to replace david 
puttnam at the helm of the columbia studio two years ago 
steels departure from columbia is expected soon according to 
two knowledgeable sources at the studio who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
she no longer is making important decisions an example was 
columbias purchase of the script radio flyer for more than 1 
million wednesday in a bidding war with warner which was handled 
by peters without her help 
steel who has been offered an independent production contract 
at disney did not return a call thursday inquiring about her plans 
levines compensation package was not revealed but it is 
expected to be extremely rich among other things sonys contract 
with guber and peters allows them to divide up a 50 million lump 
sum payment in five years between themselves and the three top 
executives they hire 
guber and peters also have been guaranteed salaries of 14 
million over the next five years a percentage of studio profits 
that increases substantially if the profits are big and a stake in 
the companys appreciation 
as part of the deal sending guber and peters to columbia warner 
bros was given columbias onethird interest in the burbank 
studios in exchange for the old mgm lot in culver city 
the move to culver city will involve real estate deals that 
levine will not oversee and russell said he would not be involved 
in any future deals columbia undertakes in that area a hotel 
purchase for example 
levine 42 of beverly hills graduated from hollywood high 
school in 1964 and received his bachelors and law degrees from the 
university of southern california

top executives of the aggressive 
superregional bank ncnb texas said their plans for the coming years 
include making billions of dollars worth of new loans and opening 
hundreds of new branches 
executives quoted in friday editions of the fort worth 
startelegram said the bank plans to open 250 new branches 
throughout texas by 1994 which will more than double the 219 
branches the bank currently operates 
we are part of a company that gained its reputation by being a 
very aggressive leader in the southeast said timothy hartman 
chairman of ncnb corp parent company of the dallas bank 
we have raised 19 billion in new capital since september 
1988 with 17 billion of that invested in ncnb texas that money 
will provide the support to grow deposits and make new loans 
the bank is committed to making about 11 billion in mortgage 
loans to about 13000 texans in 1990 hartman said 
ncnb has been criticized for cutting off credit to many longtime 
customers of first republicbank corp ncnb texas now owns and 
operates first republics banks 
the bank also has been criticized for not making new loans in 
texas 
we think this concept that ncnb is not addressing the credit 
side of the market is incorrect said jeffrey wentworth chairman 
of the banks west texas region 
to be able to show the market that we are in the marketplace 
we need to continue to demonstrate our commitment to making new 
loans he added 
ncnb texas president kenneth lewis said ncnb texas approved 
159 billion in loans during the first nine months of the year 
with most of that increase coming from new commercial loans 
the company also transferred 930 million in bad loans to its 
special asset pool 
hartman predicted that ncnb texas will earn just over 300 
million for 1989 with net income of between 290 million and 300 
million for 1990 
the company reported net income of 2443 million during the 
first nine months of this year

plans to build the nations largest hog 
farm and the waste it may produce are causing a stink between the 
billionaire bass family and two other major financial powers 
the bass family of texas is building the 50 million hog complex 
near the south platte river the farm is expected to raise 300000 
hogs a year by 1992 and unlike most hog operations the owners do 
not intend to inject the animals with antibiotics or other drugs 
philip anschutz owner of the southern pacific transportation 
co and peter coors of the brewing family who own nearby ranches 
are suing basss national hog farms to stop the construction 
fearing that waste from the animals will pollute the river 
theyve financed community campaigns against the farm although 
neither will discuss the fight the new york times reported 
other opposition groups complain that such a large operation 
would undercut competition and lower the quality of animals 
produced 
national hog farms a subsidiary of a kansas city mo 
livestock company insists that there is no evidence to support 
such concerns 
william ohare manager of the colorado hog farm said its 
isolation will allow the raising of hogs without drugs bucking a 
common midwest practice 
this is a brandnew modern facility that could set new trends 
in the industry ohare said we fully intend not to use drugs 
in these animals if we dont have to 
nonetheless opponents are suspicious saying national hog farms 
has had problems the past 10 years controlling livestock waste in 
holt county neb where three operations produce as many animals 
as will the new colorado farm 
nebraska residents have complained about the number of animals 
that have died and the manner used to dispose of the carcasses 
similar concerns have been raised in colorado

to many optimists on the investment 
outlook for the 1990s the magic word is demographics 
whatever the shortterm ups and downs of the economy over the 
next 10 years they believe shifting trends in the shape and makeup 
of the us population will spur savings and investment 
that theme was sounded over and over again last week as wall 
street leaders attending the annual convention of the securities 
industry association assessed the outlook for their troubled 
business 
the demographics are going with us for the first time in 10 to 
15 years declared robert goodman senior economist at the firm 
of putnam financial services inc 
about 20 years ago the economy began facing the challenge of 
absorbing into the workforce the huge generation both men and 
women that was born after world war ii 
once millions of those people found jobs and careers they 
acquired the image whether entirely accurate or not of big 
spenders unconcerned about the long term 
though perhaps not for that reason alone the nations savings 
rate dragged along at what many analysts described as dangerously 
low levels 
in the 90s however many baby boomers will be moving into 
their 40s and 50s traditionally the time of life when people 
reach their peak earning power and want to start putting money away 
in earnest for their later years 
whether this generation wants to do that or not many observers 
say it is going to feel an increasing sense that it needs to do 
so no outside source government or private is likely to have the 
means to cover more than a fraction of their retirement needs 
analysts say 
no generation has ever faced this kind of financial 
liability said john steffens president of merrill lynch 
consumer markets an arm of the big investment firm 
the requirement for savings i think is more compelling than 
ever before 
in the understandable reasoning of wall streets marketing 
planners a greater impulse to save means greater demand for 
stocks mutual funds taxsheltered retirement programs 
certificates of deposit in short just about every product and 
service the financialservices industry has to sell even advice 
people today require more and better advice on financial 
matters steffens said 
a corollary to this babyboom theory focuses on the baby 
bust that followed when birth rates fell sharply in the 60s and 
early 70s 
barring a huge influx of immigrants that is expected to mean a 
dramatic slowing during the 90s of the growth in the labor force 
though that might not be good news for all industries many 
analysts believe it too will be a stimulus to savings and 
investment by increasing demand for laborsaving business 
equipment 
fewer young people will lead to labor shortages and large 
capital spending on automation said john gutfreund chairman and 
chief executive of salomon brothers inc 
as any experienced demographer readily attests predicting the 
future based on population projections alone is a chancy endeavor 
now in particular crystal balls of this type are clouded by 
the international forces that influence the domestic economy 
besides despite all their clout it is a lot to expect of the 
baby boomers to assure by themselves the health and wellbeing of 
the financial world 
granted the experts say but they have it within their power to 
make a big difference

british aerospace plc and thomsoncsf a french 
defense contractor said friday they were no longer interested in 
mounting a joint bid for the british electronics concern ferranti 
international signal plc 
however thomson said it would continue to consider its options 
regarding making an offer for ferranti 
ferrantis shares fell the equivalent 14 cents friday to close 
at 63 cents on londons stock exchange 
ferranti has been hit in recent months by the revelation of 
fraud connected with international signal and control ltd a us 
defense contractor ferranti acquired in 1987 
british aerospace and thomsoncsf announced oct 10 they were 
considering making a joint offer for ferranti 
on friday british aerospace said in a statement that in 
reviewing the information so far made available on the ferranti 
business it had decided to withdraw its earlier interest 
british aerospace cited ferrantis recent publication of revised 
financial results for the year ending march 31 and british 
aerospaces judgment of its own strategic interests 
ferranti revised downward its pretax profit for that fiscal 
year to 206 million from 876 million originally reported 
ferranti also said it is dipping into capital and reserves in 
the amount of 2763 million after finding fraudulent contracts at 
its american subsidiary 
earlier friday ferranti announced the sale of 294 million 
worth of shares to existing shareholders the company said it would 
hold a special shareholders meeting to vote on the share sale in 
february 
the share sale which is fully underwritten by investment firms 
greatly strengthens our financial position said ferranti 
chairman derek alunjones 
on thursday ferranti filed a lawsuit against four former 
executives of its us operation and five panamanian companies 
seeking the return of 1985 million that it said was fraudulently 
siphoned off 
a writ issued in the high court said the money was part of 
4436 million paid out by ferrantis british firms isc 
technologies ltd and isc london plc from february 1984 to july 
1989 for three allegedly fictitious arms contracts with companies 
in pakistan the united arab emirates and china

the merchant shipping industry said friday that 
president bushs decision to bar panamanianflag vessels from us 
ports could make shipowners pawns in diplomatic disputes 
the move might interrupt free trade and prove costly and 
disruptive to shipowners industry insiders say 
bushs ban announced thursday goes into effect jan 31 and is 
one of various us economic sanctions already in place against 
panamas leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
the principle of the thing is worrying said chris horrocks 
secretarygeneral of the londonbased international chamber of 
shipping on friday once merchant shipping starts becoming a pawn 
in the political game where will it lead 
a shipping executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
obviously you could get a situation where other countries come 
out in a supportive way 
shipowners already are scurrying to change flags because bushs 
move will have a significant impact on their trading abilities he 
said 
other countries could press their own grievances with their own 
bans horrocks said 
another country might now say they will not accept a 
particular flag then yet another country might object to another 
flag he said 
a country could for example decide to ban liberianregistered 
ships because liberia trades with the united states he said 
the international chamber of shipping is the industrys 
international trade association and is made up of national 
shipowners associations 
turkey has banned cyrpiotregistered ships for about two years 
and countries at war ban typically each others ships horrocks 
said 
this is more stark in this case because it involves the 
worlds major trading nation horrocks said 
bushs move is also unfair he said because ships that fly 
panamas flag but dont trade with the central american country 
will be hurt 
weve never been happy with the principle that you use 
merchant shipping as a political weapon he said 
in addition to switching flags shipowners can reroute tankers 
both options are timeconsuming inconvenient and costly horrocks 
said 
but more importantly a spread of such bans could interfere with 
the movement of goods weve always stood for the principle of 
liberalized trade horrocks said 
bushs ban would affect some 1500 merchant ships of more than 
1000 gross tons that call each year in us ports according to 
state department estimates 
shipowners register under flags of convenience of panama 
liberia and cyprus to take advantage of cheaper taxes and fees and 
looser safety rules and labor laws 
as of july 1986 more ships above 1000 gross tons capacity flew 
panamas flag than any other flag for a total of 3620 ships 
the soviet union was in second place with 2514 ships and 
liberia was third with 1852 vessels just 737 ships flew the 
american flag

corn and soybean futures prices closed lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade in a late technically 
inspired drop 
wheat futures finished mixed supported by rumors that the 
soviet union had bid for 400000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices the soviets have about 800000 tons of wheat 
left to buy under an allocation granted under the agriculture 
deparments export enhancement program 
talk of increased soviet purchases of us grain has dominated 
trading ahead of this weekends meeting between president bush and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
thursdays weekly usda export figures showed soybean and soybean 
meal shipments running behind last years pace but analysts said 
that news had been in the market all day and was probably not to 
blame for the late dive in soybeans and corn 
fundamentally nothing has changed very much to warrant such a 
big selloff said janice kincheloe a soybean market analyst in 
chicago with cargill investor services inc 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn

dairy mart convenient stores inc has 
signed an agreement to buy 141 stopngo convenience stores in the 
midwest from sun co inc 
the purchases announced thursday and to be completed in march 
would boost the dairy mart 1200store chain by more than 10 
percent and would include stores in ohio michigan indiana and 
kentucky said charles nirenberg dairy marts chairman 
the price was not disclosed 
the purchase will be dairy marts third major acquisition in the 
past four years making it the nations no 3 convenience store 
chain after 7eleven and circle k nirenberg said 
sun the diversified oil company based in radnor pa recently 
announced plans to sell 200 of the 250 stores operated by its 
stopngo subsidiary which has been hurt by a slump in the 
convenience store industry 
of the 141 stopngo stores being purchased by dairy mart 54 
have gasoline pumps nirenberg said 
dairy mart founded by nirenberg in 1958 took over the 
700store lawson chain in 1985 and the 300store convenient food 
mart chain in 1986 
dairy mart last month abandoned a plan to go private in a 
leveraged buyout after its principals had trouble lining up 
financing because of the chains recent sluggish financial 
performance 
had the company been taken private nirenberg said thursday the 
terms of the financing would have precluded it from acquiring other 
stores for at least two years

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge signaled a slowdown in october but other evidence suggested 
lower interest rates will keep the economy from toppling into a 
recession 
the 04 percent drop in the commerce departments index of 
leading economic indicators announced friday fits in with the 
consensus among analysts that the final quarter of this year and 
the first three months of 1990 will see weak growth at best 
the indicators are telling us what theyvebeen telling us for 
some time and that is that the economy is continuing to expand but 
at a slow rate said economist david berson of the federal 
national mortgage association 
however he and other analysts said a number of factors 
mitigated the unfavorable report the decline followed two monthly 
gains most of the weakness was concentrated in only two of the 
indexs 11 forwardlooking business statistics 
and elements of the index and a separate report on october 
construction spending suggest that the federal reserve boards cuts 
in interest rates since june are beginning to stimulate the economy 
construction activity rose 1 percent in october bolstered by 
the first gain in singlefamily construction in nine months the 
commerce department said 
four of the 11 indicators were positive building permits 
increased 28 percent and the nations money supply reflecting 
lower interest rates expanded modestly other positive signs were 
a slight increase in prices of sensitive materials indicating 
increased demand and an upturn in business capital investment 
octobers overall drop which was expected by most economists 
followed gains of 03 percent in september and 06 percent in 
august both gains were revised in the report to reflect a slightly 
better increase than earlier reported 
for the first 10 months of 1989 the index has fallen five 
times risen four times and remained unchanged in one month 
the various changes left the index at 1446 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 that represents a 04 percent decline at an annual 
rate for the year so far compared with a 38 percent gain in the 
first 10 months of 1988 
the recent erratic fluctuations in the index are commensurate 
with an economy that has slowed substantially but is not headed 
over a precipice said economist gordon richards of the national 
association of manufacturers 
news of the october decline helped spark a stock market rally 
that put the dow jones average of 30 industrials ahead by 4138 
points at closing traders took the report as an indication the 
fed which last nudged interest rates lower in early november 
could move again optimism about the ussoviet summit meeting 
also contributed to the rally 
the two biggest negatives in the index were an increase in 
claims for unemployment insurance and a drop in average work week 
for factory workers 
the other weak signs were a drop in unfilled orders at 
factories a decline in a consumer confidence survey fewer late 
deliveries of factory goods indicating slackening demand and 
fewer new orders for consumer goods 
stock prices despite the fridaythe13th plunge in october 
were a neutral factor 
traditionally three consecutive monthly declines in the leading 
index are a good but far from foolproof indication that a 
recession is on the way it has not fallen three times in a row 
this year although it was down in may and june and flat in july 
berson said the overall index has probably looked worse than the 
condition of the economy would warrant it overemphasizes 
manufacturing one of the economys weakest sectors and 
undercounts the service sector one of the more resilient areas he 
said 
the national association of purchasing management which tracks 
the economy through a monthly survey of its members said friday 
the manufacturing economy weakened in november for the seventh 
straight month and at a faster pace than in september and october 
in other economic news the office of thrift supervision 
reported that the nations savings and loans continue to shrink in 
response to tough new financial standards taking effect next week 
industry assets declined by 152 billion in september breaking 
the record of 133 billion set in august net deposit withdrawals 
totaled 89 billion the biggest outflow since february

texas billionaire ross perot didnt waste any time 
friday jumping into competition with his former company electronic 
data systems corp after a threeyear noncompete court order 
expired 
perot said his perot systems inc sales people were out 
knocking on doors early friday 
if ive got anybody not out bidding for business for profit 
today then ive got to send them back to training he said 
perot and eds have been battling each other since 1986 when 
perot parted ways with general motors corp perot had sold eds to 
gm in 1984 
eds spokesman roger still said i would expect perot to say 
that nothing has changed from our standpoint well deal with 
them in the marketplace as we would any competitor 
perot formed perot systems based in vienna va in mid1988 
after gm paid the outspoken businessman an additional 700 million 
for his gm stock and removed him from its board of directors 
as part of the deal perot agreed not to compete with eds for 
profit until dec 1 1989 eds has complained that perot violated 
that agreement 
gm sued perot and perot systems alleging a deal struck between 
perot systems and the us postal service violated the noncompete 
clause 
perot says his company which provides computing service under 
contract wasnt making a profit so it didnt violate the 
agreement 
in april fairfax county va circuit judge william plummer 
ruled that perot systems couldnt compete on a forprofit basis 
with eds until dec 1 1989 
on dec 16 1988 the postal service canceled the contract 
since then perot systems has grown from 22 employees to 448 
we are delighted to reach this point perot said in 
retrospect my feeling for general motors has to be one of 
gratitude if they had not interfered with the postal contract 
today i would have a very small number of people working for me 
today i have a diversified base of federal business with 
a blue chip blue ribbon list of clients perot said and we 
got all that business because people would read about gm taking 
us to court and realize we were in business again

a federal judge extended a court order friday 
freezing the assets of finacor anstalt a liechtenstein company 
accused by us authorities of insider trading in asea brown boveri 
ltds bid for combustion engineering 
in new york us district judge john m cannella extended a 
temporary restraining order freezing finacor assets that the 
securities and exchange commission alleges may be subject to 
disgorgement 
the sec in a lawsuit filed earlier in new york charged 
finacor a financial services company with making 28 million in 
illegal profits allegedly using inside information about asea brown 
boveris 16 billion bid for combustion engineering 
in extending the temporary restraining order he issued last 
month cannella ordered finacor to account for all its assets by 
next friday 
cannella also ordered finacor to return any assets transferred 
out of the united states or to post a bond of equal amount 
sec lawyers had claimed that after they sought the asset freeze 
but before cannella granted it finacor was liquidating some of 
its assets and transferring them out of the country 
our client denies any wrongdoing said john newell an 
attorney for finacor in new york 
he was critical of sec claims that a preliminary injunction was 
needed because finacor had not responded to cannellas earlier 
assets freeze order 
our clients were given notice of this action by telecopier and 
overnight courier said newell adding that his firm whitman and 
ransom had just been retained as of yesterday 
cannella gave finacors lawyers until next friday to submit 
papers opposing the secs injunction request a hearing is 
scheduled for dec 20

relax credit if the economy is weak such an action would allow 
interest rates to decline and bond prices to rise 
ward mccarthy a principal with stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc said the market was cautious despite the economic 
reports because of mixed signals from fed in the last 10 days 
on monday the fed caught traders by surprise when it took steps 
to move interest rates higher the financial markets had expected 
the central bank to ease credit 
traders also were wary in advance of this weekends meeting 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev

energy futures prices rose sharply friday on the new york 
mercantile exchange paced by a surging heatingoil market that 
jumped more than 5 percent in the weeks last three trading days 
on other commodity markets friday corn and soybean prices fell 
while wheat futures were mixed gold rose silver fell cattle 
futures advanced and pork futures were mixed 
heating oil futures settled 57 cent to 132 cents higher in new 
york with the contract for delivery in january up 110 cents at 
6291 cents a gallon 
crude oil finished 37 cents to 44 cents higher with january at 
2030 a barrel unleaded gasoline was 65 cent to 101 cents 
higher with january at 5211 cents a gallon 
heatingoil futures have been climbing since august and have 
risen faster with the onset of cold weather reflecting unusually 
tight supplies both in the united states and in europe 
the european supply situation is more severe a result of 
disruptions in the movement of heating oil from the soviet union a 
major european supplier and the low level of the rhine river 
which has further restricted the movement of supplies 
meanwhile early episodes of cold weather in the united states 
and in europe have stirred strong demand for heating oil 
weve had a good quick start to the winter and were having 
heating oil usage at a very high level said ray mazzeo an 
energy futures specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the strength in heating oil has more than offset the bearish 
punch of opecs agreement to raise its crudeoil production ceiling 
to 22 million barrels a day from 205 million barrels in the first 
half of 1990 
if not for heating oil coming to the rescue there the last 
couple days crude oil could very easily be a dollar lower right 
now said james ritterbusch vice president of trading and 
research at carson petroleum co a chicagoarea oil distributor 
corn and soybean futures fell substantially on the chicago board 
of trade in a late technically inspired drop 
wheat futures finished mixed supported by rumors that the 
soviet union had bid for 400000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
talk of increased soviet purchases of us grain has dominated 
trading ahead of this weekends meeting between president bush and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
after the close the usda announced sales of 800000 tons of 
corn and 100000 tons of soybean meal to the soviets partially 
confirming rumors that had supported those markets on thursday 
wheat futures settled 1 cents lower to cent higher with 
december at 408 a bushel corn was cent to 3 cents lower with 
december at 234 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower 
with december at 143 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 6 
cents lower with january at 576 a bushel 
gold futures rose modestly on new yorks commodity exchange in 
quiet trading silver finished slightly lower 
gold settled 180 to 2 higher with december at 41360 a troy 
ounce silver was 01 cent to 07 cent lower with december at 
5663 a troy ounce 
frozen pork belly futures fell for the fifth straight day on the 
chicago mercantile exchange although not as sharply as in the 
three previous sessions the market has collapsed amid 
disappointment over the slow pace at which the government is buying 
pork bellies to donate to poland 
hog futures closed mixed while cattle futures advanced in a 
technical correction after falling along with the belly market for 
most of the week 
live cattle futures settled 05 cent to 35 cent higher with 
december at 7520 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 
23 cent higher with january at 8285 cents a pound live hogs were

pacificorp offered friday to acquire 
pinnacle west capital corp three weeks after proposing a buyout 
of the companys arizona public service co its only profitable 
division 
pacificorp which has interests in electric utilities in seven 
western states made its offer contingent on the sale of merabank 
pinnacle wests troubled savings bank subsidiary 
portlandbased pacificorp offered to exchange 18 of a share of 
its own stock for each outstanding pinnacle west share based on 
pacificorps current stock price the offer has an indicated value 
of nearly 8 a share or a total of about 6937 million based on 
the companys roughly 867 million oustanding shares 
that would be less than the 17 billion pacificorp offered for 
arizona public service on nov 8 but the company indicated the 
difference was due to concerns over the level of pinnacle wests 
debt 
however dave bolender pacificorps president for electric 
operations who conducted a news conference in phoenix put the 
total value of the revised offer at about 2 billion 
bolender said the offer includes roughly 500 million in cash or 
credit to pinnacle west for merabank 700 million in stock swaps 
and 800 million to assume pinnacle wests debt 
he said the offer was revised to provide upfront cash for 
pinnacle west to meet its needs regarding merabank and to resolve 
possible adverse tax consequences of a stock purchase for cash 
trading was halted in both companies shares friday on the new 
york stock exchange and did not resume by the markets close at 
the time pacificorp was trading at 4437 a share up 50 cents 
from thursdays close and pinnacle west was unchanged at 525 a 
share 
steve carr a spokesman for pinnacle west said the companys 
board of directors would consider the proposal but he could not say 
when that might be the next scheduled board meeting is later this 
month 
at this point it is just an offer and we havent had any 
discussion with pacificorp carr said 
pacificorp president am gleason issued a statement saying 
this proposal would provide a significant value to pinnacle west 
shareholders while maintaining our commitment to limit price 
increases for aps customers to 2 percent per year over the next 
four years 
we believe it is in the best interest of your shareholders 
customers and employees for us to discuss this transaction as soon 
as possible gleason wrote in a letter sent to turley 
the reason we are doing this today is that we have not gotten 
a response from pinnacle west on the original offer said sandra 
mcdonough pacificorps federal affairs manager 
in making its initial offer pacificorp said a buyout of arizona 
public service would benefit consumers in arizona and states it 
already serves because their varying periods of peak demand for 
power would lessen the need for new generating plants 
the new buyout offer was contingent on merabank being sold after 
receiving a capital infusion of 510 million from pinnacle and on 
other pinnacle assets having a net value of 300 million excluding 
arizona public service gleason said 
he said any variations would result in an adjusted stock 
exchange ratio 
todd parrish an analyst with the milwaukee brokerage blunt 
ellis amp loewi speculated the new offer was designed to appeal to 
pinnacle wests shareholders 
the previous offer was very very attractive to everybody but 
the pinnacle west shareholder he said 
parrish said however that the 510 million infusion in the 
bank appeared to be low we had been hearing upwards of 750 
million necessary every quarter that goes by the situation seems 
to be that much worse he said 
in addition to its utilities which serve customers in oregon 
wyoming washington california montana idaho and utah 
pacificorp has interests in mining telecommunications and 
financial services 
besides arizona public service and merabank pinnacle west owns 
a real estate development company a uranium company and a venture 
capital firm 
phoenixbased merabank a federal savings bank has suffered 
increasing losses due to the softening southwest real estate market 
and pinnacle west must pump 180 million into the thrift to meet 
federal capital guidelines 
pacificorp has said it would provide pinnacle west with cash or 
interim credit support pending regulatory approval of the merger 
the revised offer still includes redemption or exchange of 
arizona public service stock for pacificorp preferred stock and 
assumption or repayment of pinnacle west debt 
pacificorp earlier this year completed acquisition of utah power 
in the largest us utility merger ever
