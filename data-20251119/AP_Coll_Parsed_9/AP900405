a fragmented 20milelong fuel slick 
drifted wednesday past steel plants and boat marinas on the ohio 
river into ohio and west virginia where officials said it posed 
less of a threat to drinking water 
it does appear to be dissipating said dave plank chief of 
technical services for the pennsylvania department of environmental 
resources as the oil moves down the river it will pose less of 
a risk 
the slicks leading edge moving about 1 mph was near east 
liverpool ohio on wednesday afternoon said department 
spokeswoman betsy mallison 
at least 75000 gallons of diesel fuel gasoline and kerosene 
poured from a severed interstate pipeline into an allegheny river 
tributary friday following a mudslide near freeport 35 miles 
northeast of pittsburgh the allegheny flows into the ohio river at 
pittsburgh 
earlier this week the spill threatened the water supplies of as 
many as 1 million people along the allegheny and ohio rivers 
early wednesday it passed the beaver county community of 
midland five miles east of the ohiowest virginia line 
the midland water authority which serves 11700 residents in 
midland ohioville and industry reopened its filter plants intake 
valves at 2 pm at about half normal pumping volume said chief 
operator dan zuppe the valves were opened after state 
environmental officials tested the water for oil 
the spill has pretty much passed us by zuppe said wednesday 
evening were under the direction of the der and they will give 
us the direction when to go back on full 
weirton about 65 river miles south of pittsburgh was the first 
west virginia town whose water supply was threatened by the spill 
ken capozzoli a maintenance operator at the weirton water 
treatment plant said the authority would close its intakes and 
rely on well water until the spill passed 
we dont really know how long the wells can supply us but 
well do fine for the couple of days it should take for the spill 
to pass he said 
at east liverpool the first ohio community on the river south 
of the spill two intake valves near the rivers surface were 
closed as a precaution said glenn woodward water superintendent 
for the city of 7000 residents 
intakes deeper in the river continued to draw water wednesday 
afternoon because no oil had been detected that deep according to 
woodward 
we are anticipating it could hit anytime he said 
in midland a voluntary water conservation measure was in effect 
the spill was no threat to other water systems serving beaver 
county because they depend on well water said county emergency 
management agency director russell chiodo 
several manufacturing plants including a steel plant in 
midland a tin mill in aliquippa and the beaver valley i and ii 
nuclear power plants continued drawing water directly from the 
ohio for industrial use chiodo said 
in pittsburgh where small traces of petroleum were detected in 
river water mayor sophie masloff lifted her call for water 
conservation and water authorities along the allegheny river that 
had been affected by the spill were back in operation 
water conservation measures in some of those communities 
however remained in effect 
in harrison township the only community where the taps ran dry 
about 20000 residents were told to boil water to kill bacteria 
that might have grown in the system when it was empty

the nations roman catholic bishops on thursday 
announced that they have hired a major public relations firm and a 
polling concern for a nationwide campaign to persuade catholics and 
noncatholics to oppose abortion 
the bishops are expected to spend as much as 5 million over 
three to five years on the effort the new york times said in 
friday editions 
given the stakes life itself we can do no less said 
cardinal john oconnor archbishop of new york who made the 
announcement as chairman of the bishops committee for prolife 
activities 
the firms chosen hill amp knowlton and the wirthlin group 
represent two of the nations best known and most influential 
political and lobbying strategists 
the wirthlin group is a leading republican polling operation 
that served ronald reagan during his campaign for and time in the 
white house 
john berard deputy general manager of hill amp knowltons 
washington office said the campaign would involve neither lobbying 
nor electoral politics he said it was unclear whether it would 
include advertising 
we are focusing our efforts on a broadbased public education 
and information campaign to make the bishops better heard on 
abortion he said 
oconnor said in his statement we want this effort to unfold 
on peaceful grounds without vitriol as we work to encourage both 
within and beyond our faith community serious considerations of 
moral ends means and achievable policy goals 
the catholic bishops have hired media consultants for events 
like pope john paul iis visit to the united states in 1987 but 
never before on the abortion issue 
oconnor said money for the campaign would be raised from 
private individuals or organizations and would not detract from 
existing programs

researchers today reported an advance toward 
finding the defective gene or genes responsible for spinal muscular 
atrophy a disabling and sometimes lethal disease of children 
they narrowed down the search to a particular part of one 
chromosome one of the 23 pairs of threadlike structures on which 
genes reside 
finding the gene or genes responsible for the disease may give 
clues for developing treatments researchers said 
no firm numbers exist on how many people have the disease which 
weakens muscles by attacking nerves that control voluntary muscles 
the study included three forms of the disease that strike a total 
of about one in 10000 newborns said study coauthor t conrad 
gilliam 
the acute form the most common appears at birth or in infancy 
and usually kills by age 4 two chronic forms usually appear in 
early childhood with effects ranging from relatively mild muscle 
weakness to profound weakness and death in early adolescence 
ashley antolak the 6yearold national poster child for the 
muscular dystrophy association has a chronic form of spinal 
muscular atrophy 
the new study found evidence that a defective gene or genes 
causing the chronic forms is on chromosome number 5 it also 
suggests that the acute form may come from the same source or a 
nearby gene said study coauthor linda brzustowicz 
brzustowicz gilliam and others at columbia university and the 
new york state psychiatric institute did the work with theodore 
munsat of tufts university and the new england medical center in 
boston and others at the university of utah medical center in salt 
lake city odyssey biomedical corp in west paterson nj and 
scientists in britain west germany and poland 
the work is reported in todays issue of the british journal 
nature 
it marks a very important first step toward developing 
treatments and preventing the disease through prenatal diagnosis 
and detection of people at risk for having affected children 
genetics expert robert williamson of london university in england

never mind the trifling banter or the continual 
references to the buckets of sweat that cascaded down her ample 
frame 
none of that mattered when sarah vaughan seized the stage and 
seduced a willing audience with the moody excitement of her jazz 
stylings 
it was always sweet surrender 
she caressed a song with all the colorings of her voice 
sometimes teasing with the weighty depths of low d sometimes more 
direct with her pure c sometimes playful with inspired scat 
sometimes sentimental with soft singing from her soul 
who could resist such a temptress 
for those who knew and worked with sarah vaughan who died 
tuesday night at age 66 few could 
i traveled around the world with her and shed be sold out 
and people wouldnt even understand the language she was singing 
in recalled drummer harold jones who worked with vaughan for a 
decade and had been friends with the song stylist for 25 years 
sometimes id go up to them later and ask them why they came 
to the concert if they couldnt understand her why they thought 
she was so great they would say it was the feeling the feeling 
of the way she sang thats how they knew she was great 
she sang of love and life easy breezy tunes such as east of 
the sun moody bluesy ballads like easy living and the man 
i love complicated jazz songs that ended in rollicking scat 
fascinatin rhythm i remember april 
and along the way she always had fun 
once at a carnegie hall concert in 1980 she performed duke 
ellingtons sophisticated lady and confessed to a startled 
audience that she didnt know the lyrics so shed have to refer to 
the sheet music 
ive never done it until now she said with a laugh this 
could be my first and last time its not an easy song to sing if 
you hear me falter help 
she didnt she never did or if she did no one noticed or no 
one cared 
she was always an absolute nervous wreck before performing 
recalled andy simkins vaughans bassist theres a certain edge 
you need to perform but she would be a wreck she was fine after 
she went on stage or after she started the first set at a club 
she was always a little girl i always thought of her as a 
little sister there was a certain naivete and then again she was 
old professional show business and had stories for days billy 
eckstine was really her mentor when she was depressed and nobody 
could get to her shed call for b he was the only one who could 
get to her 
vaughan worked with eckstine in his own band after they both 
left earl hines in 1944 together they ignited romance with lovely 
duets on jazz standards alone they both produced a litany of hit 
romantic records 
she and eckstine reunited a few years back at the kool jazz 
festival in new york and reprised some of those love ballads but 
time had robbed them of memory and both whipped out their glasses 
to glance at an occasional lyric for passing strangers a song 
popular in england in the 1940s 
they had known each other so long they didnt even have to 
rehearse said jazz producer george wein it was the warmth of 
love that those two had for each other so the lyrics didnt mean 
anything it was the music 
as a soloist vaughan eventually ran into george shearing then a 
young jazz pianist who had emigrated to the united states from 
britain in 1947 she was the first vocalist with whom he worked 
jimmy jones the pianist had a trick whereby he would stab at 
a chord and then hit the sustaining pedal before the vibrations 
were gone and instead of getting baahhh hed get bink shearing 
recalled in an interview it was a wonderful trick and he and 
sarah would do that to tenderly he did that prior to the last 
note and then shed do some vocals that were just incredible 
she could hold on to great big long notes without vibrato 
vaughan took that great gift and used it for popular music when 
she recorded brokenhearted melody in 1958 and later with such 
middleoftheroad tunes as send in the clowns the switch 
generated new converts for her but saddened jazz purists 
i dont really feel she switched over said harold jones 
she went in and did them and then back on the gig she was still 
singing lush life and tenderly 
simkins wasnt bothered with pop sidesteps either i learned a 
lot from her he said she probably taught me how to play a 
ballad on my instrument she was always my image as to how a 
love song or ballad should be played 
vaughan never thought of herself as a pop singer or a jazz 
singer or even a great singer and as popular as she was jones 
said she never thought of herself as having a hit song 
to me she was the greatest simkins said what i loved 
was she never thought of herself as sarah vaughan and her trio she 
always thought of herself as a quartet 
a powerful and pleasing instrument that gave pleasure to 
generations

about the time nelson mandela went to 
jail 27 years ago lenford ganyile fled south africa after a 
violent encounter that cost him all his teeth and most of an ear 
a south african policemans rifle butt knocked out his teeth 
ganyile said and a bayonet sliced off the ear 
ganyile 68 has been in exile since first in botswana and then 
in zambia where mandelas african national congress set up its 
headquarters in february president fw de klerk of south africa 
legalized the anc and freed mandela 
i am waiting for comrade mandela to tell me what to do next 
said ganyile a respected elder on the ancs 7200acre chongela 
collective farm in zambias fertile ngwerere district 25 miles 
north of lusaka 
although he is eager to go home ganyile has difficulty 
remembering the wife and three children he left behind 
in the early years i sent them letters but had no reply he 
said i was afraid they would get into trouble so i stopped 
writing 
occasionally he heard news of his wife from newly arrived 
exiles then he lost all contact 
the struggle became my family ganyile said i saw my ear 
was not there and it reminded me always that i wanted all our 
people to be free 
he is one of thousands of south african exiles scattered through 
the world whose lives were transformed by the lifting of a 30year 
ban on the african national congress and mandelas release feb 12 
the anc has said most of its exiles probably would be home by the 
end of 1990 
it is a dream to me said ganyile a veteran of the pondo 
rebellion of the late 1950s when scores of blacks were killed in 
riots against south africas official apartheid policy of race 
segregation 
ganyile who spent 20 months in jail said he was arrested for 
leading anc protesters in the pondoland region near mandelas home 
in transkei 
we were fighting one of the worst devils on earth the bantu 
authorities act and its discriminatory laws he said 
after fleeing south africa ganyile used his farming experience 
to teach other exiles he is on the chongela farms management 
committee 
farm manager leslie ponusamy said the property three adjoining 
farms owned by whites before independence from britain in 1964 
feeds about threequarters of the 2000 anc members who live in 
zambia 
vegetables and maize grow on the farm and the residents raise 
cattle sheep pigs and ducks 
we dont produce everything for a balanced diet said 
ponusamy a veterinarian who was a student activist in south 
africas natal province we sell the surplus of one thing to buy 
other things we need 
young exiles are sent by anc headquarters in lusaka to learn 
practical skills on the farm foreign donations help finance a 
dairy slaughterhouse several workshops and an auto repair shop 
most of our young people interrupted their educations when 
they left south africa ponusamy said 
dan twala 22 said he fled after being assaulted by police in 
1987 during a disturbance in a black township 
i came to join the struggle he said now all i want to do 
is to go back to see the family 
what will happen to the farm when everyone returns home 
perhaps we will give it to the zambian government ponusamy 
said when we no longer need it we will leave it as a momument 
some sort of remembrance to our struggle

bush administration officials say the yearold 
testcase battle against drugs in the nations capitol has 
failed the new york times reported 
their conclusions were expected to be part of a report on the 
program to be released this month by william j bennett the 
national drug policy adviser the times said in thursday editions 
the times quoted unidentified federal officials as saying that 
washington has failed to demonstrate a commitment to control drug 
abuse 
unidentified city officials in turn blamed bennett saying he 
oversold the program and failed to back up his promises with 
federal funds 
in january the citys mayor marion s barry was arrested on 
cocaine charges 
both city and federal officials agreed that illegal drugs remain 
relatively cheap and plentiful and that there has been no reduction 
in drugrelated murders the times said 
the administration originally promised to direct an extra 100 
million to drug programs in the city much of which was supposed to 
go for jail space but the money has gone unspent because the city 
has been unable to agree on a plan for jail construction the times 
said 
the federal government also has had military prosecutors assist 
in federal drug cases has offered money for new drug treatment 
centers and created a team of federal agents led by the drug 
enforcement administration that has made scores of arrests and 
seized millions of dollars in assets from drug dealers the times 
said 
bennett spokesman don hamilton asked wednesday night whether 
the report said the drug effort in washington had failed said i 
dont think thats quite so 
i dont think were going to say everything in dc is 
hunkydory and we should get a ride down pennsylvania avenue on 
rose petals but the reports not done yet hamilton said 
he said bennetts staff planned to meet thursday morning to 
discuss what would be in the report which he said would be issued 
next week 
in october bennett said the drug problem in the capital had 
gotten worse in the first six months of the drug war 
we picked a difficult task last april and i never had any 
illusions about the challenges that lay before us he said at the 
time

the call on a marine hailing frequency was 
urgent and chilling a ship somewhere on the freezing waters off 
massachusetts was transmitting a lastditch plea for help 
this is the fishing vessel sol e mar a male voice shouted 
in frenzy were sinkin we need help now 
the plea rose into a scream the transmission was abruptly cut 
then there was only crackling static 
coast guard radio monitors on nantucket and marthas vineyard 
tried desperately to get the caller back to locate the ship and 
send help 
but just over a minute after the first call another distress 
signal came in 
sos im sinking a male voice said and then he laughed 
the coast guard officers didnt dispatch rescue planes or boats 
the calls they thought were just part of the rising number of 
hoaxes 
last friday five days later they discovered they were wrong 
the sol e mar was reported missing and the coast guard began a 
search for the father and son who manned the 50foot fishing vessel 
by then it was too late 
the sol e mar and the two men were presumed lost at sea 
somewhere south of marthas vineyard the search was called off 
sunday night 
the family grieved fishermen along the new england coast 
mourned the loss of more of their own and the coast guard was left 
wondering how to deal with hoaxers who think they are being clever 
by faking a call for help 
things might have been different said lt paul wolf the 
coast guard spokesman in boston i cant say the fake call killed 
them but it certainly lessened their chances 
bogus distress calls were once just a nuisance to coast guard 
rescuers now they are considered a serious problem 
this is the first case that i know of where it was a factor in 
a rescue wolf said it definitely influenced the way we 
responded 
in 1989 16 hoaxes were recorded on the coast from canada to new 
jersey and the coast guard responded to most of the calls said 
coast guard cmdr bill armstrong 
this year there already have been 11 known hoaxes 
we have limited resources and every time we respond to a 
hoax those resources arent there for someone who may need them 
armstrong said 
in 1986 a man was sentenced to a year in prison after he 
broadcast a bogus distress signal that triggered a massive 
seaandair search for a sinking yacht with 10 people aboard 
emergency responses often are hampered because of the constant 
chatter on radios largely by inexperienced boaters the problem is 
so acute in the boston area with its endless stream of seafaring 
radio traffic that the coast guard and the federal communications 
commission will experiment with an additional distress frequency 
beginning next year armstrong said 
lost with the sol e mar were william hokanson sr 44 and his 
19yearold son william jr the two fairhaven men set out march 22 
from kelleys landing for cape cod hoping for a large flounder 
catch 
manuel aguiar william srs brotherinlaw said he had heard 
the coast guard tapes he said the first call was clearly from the 
son and the second was a different voice he said the family was 
angry at the coast guard 
theyre out there to serve the public fake call or not he 
said 
fighting back tears aguiar described william sr as one of 
the best men in the world he would give you anything he had 
william jr was a hockey star and a good student who loved 
fishing as much as his father aguiar said william sr had been 
fishing for 20 years and his son started joining him at age 6 he 
said 
they were very close aguiar said william senior would 
never have let anything happen to his kid 
it was the second loss at sea for the hokanson family of 
fishermen in 1952 william srs father fritz was lost off 
nantucket on the fishing vessel paolina 
at the seamens bethel in new bedford marble cenotaphs honor 
lost seafarers from the whalers of the 1800s to presentday 
fishermen 
fritz hokanson is remembered here said director adolph 
allerdt now his son and grandson will be too 
wolf said the coast guard was reviewing its actions more 
detailed instructions on how to distinguish hoaxes from authentic 
calls are being sent to radio monitors with added urgency because 
of the sol e mar sinking he said 
even if the fake call had not come in the hokansons might never 
have been rescued since their boat apparently sank before they 
could radio their location wolf said 
if i could change anything i would have given them five more 
seconds on the radio wolf said 
the coast guard saved 6000 people last year he added i 
just wish we could have rescued two more

radio broadcasters are increasingly worried that 
cuba will retaliate for the us propaganda channel tv marti 
especially since a warning shot three weeks ago that was heard as 
far away as utah 
radio station operators and engineers at this weeks national 
association of broadcasters convention have done much talking about 
tv marti and more specifically about the threat that cuba might 
jam us radio broadcasts in retaliation 
it is widely believed that cuba has radio transmitters capable 
of 1 million watts or more 20 times the strength of the strongest 
us am stations 
tv marti is broadcast from a balloon high above the florida 
keys and is designed to beam a prodemocracy message into castros 
cuba 
cuba has been jamming the voice of america broadcasts since they 
started march 27 and cuban president fidel castro warned tuesday 
that any us attempt to interfere with the jamming could lead to 
war 
he told reporters in havana that tv marti was a gross 
instrument of subversion 
the warning shot that has broadcasters worried came on march 23 
four days before testing of tv marti began 
federal communications commission monitors heard cuban radio 
signals on six separate clearchannel frequencies on the us am 
radio dial said walter w wurfel senior vice president of the nab 
half a dozen am stations in florida battled with the 
interference and stations in red springs nc and donelson 
tenn filed complaints wurfel said 
the interference even turned up in salt lake city said john 
dehnel chief engineer at that utah citys clearchannel kslam 
it was definitely there no question about it dehnel said 
and we believe it was not their highestpowered transmitter 
castro delivered his message said patrick roberts 
president of the florida association of broadcasters 
if castro fires up his am radio transmitters it poses a 
substantial potential to interrupt and cause interference to a lot 
of radio stations in the united states perhaps 1000 to 1500 
wurfel said 
broadcasters at an nab seminar on tv marti heard an example of 
apparent cuban jamming taken from ksl it blended the mormon 
tabernacle choir with the unmistakable sounds of mariachi music 
president bush asked the broadcasters monday to stand for 
freedom and support tv marti but nab president edward fritts 
said his group remains concerned about tv marti interference and 
cuban retaliation he also complained that the administration 
refuses to allow broadcasters any input in the tv marti testing 
i have an am station in tampa that has been interfered with 
since radio marti began in the mid1980s said michael osterhout 
president of edens broadcasting which operates wrbqam weve 
had some minor interference at night 
i just dont believe this is a feasible way to get programming 
into cuba the system doesnt seem to work 
were somewhat opposed to tv marti said thomas l goodgame 
of westinghouse broadcasting chairman of the nabs television 
board the 22 million effort may not work anyway and if the 
cubans jam us radio broadcasts its definitely not worth it 
he said 
so far it appears that cuba has left us am radio alone since 
the events of march 23 we are not aware of any specific new 
interference to american am broadcasters by castro since the tv 
marti tests began wurfel said 
broadcasters also fear that the tv marti transmissions might 
bleed over and disrupt florida tv stations chiefly in tampa 
where a station already broadcasts on channel 13 the same used by 
tv marti wurfel said

undaunted by shortages in money and name 
recognition four eager north carolina democrats are jockeying for 
a shot at toppling conservative republican sen jesse helms in 
november 
with the primary election just a month away voters so far have 
been spared the roughandtumble politicking that early on 
characterized the 1984 race between helms and his democratic 
challenger thengov jim hunt 
this time around all four democratic challengers have been 
campaigning across the state to expand their appeal but none has 
broken out of his regional base and into the lead 
none of the democratic candidates have the widespread name 
recognition of a jim hunt but as we get closer to the primary i 
think that will resolve itself said state democratic party 
chairman lawrence davis 
its been an incredibly different campaign from 1984 said 
carter wrenn of the national congressional club helms political 
organization 
in that year neither helms nor hunt had a serious primary 
challenger so both candidates began gunning for one another early 
spending a national record 26 million on a race marked by negative 
campaigning and personal slurs 
the main challengers in this years may 8 democratic primary are 
former charlotte mayor harvey gantt who is seeking to become 
the first black to win a statewide race in north carolina gantts 
supporters say a solid black vote combined with his proven ability 
to attract white voters in his mayoral races could help him garner 
40 percent of the democratic vote and avoid a runoff 
southport prosecutor mike easley who has developed a 
reputation as a drug fighter in a region whose coastal areas have 
been used by smugglers since pirate days easley has the support of 
many party activists who were involved in hunts campaigns and has 
campaigned on themes such as day care and the environment that are 
likely to attract baby boomers 
rp bo thomas a produce broker who served nine years in 
the state senate thomas has campaigned on a strong populist 
message that he says can win back jessecrats conservative 
white democrats who routinely vote for helms 
former insurance commissioner john ingram whose major campaign 
theme has been a plan to force insurance companies to finance a 
highrisk pool to make affordable health insurance available to 
almost everyone 
early polls show helms ahead of all four potential challengers 
a reversal from 1984 when similar surveys had hunt in the lead by 
the november election however helms had hacked away at hunts 
support to take 52 percent of the vote 
helms 43 percent approval rating also is higher now than in 
1984 wrenn said 
while the noise of the campaign hasnt been as loud as in 1984 
both sides say the equation for victory remains the same helms 
starts out with 40 to 45 percent of the vote and his eventual 
democratic opponent can count on roughly the same amount 
you have people who are yellowdog democrats who will always 
vote against helms because hes a republican said thad beyle a 
political science professor at the university of north carolina at 
chapel hill and then there are others who will always vote 
against helms because of his views 
wrenn said the outcome depends on the 10 percent to 20 percent 
of the electorate identified as swing voters most of whom are 
registered as democrats 
they have to get all of their votes and a third of ours to 
win democratic chairman davis said of the republicans thats 
the same equation weve had for the last several years 
beyle said helms tactic for reaching those voters judging from 
his last campaign is he gets hold of some issue well before the 
campaign and beats it to death 
in 1984 it was the martin luther king holiday bill beyle 
said in 1990 its the national endowment for the arts which 
helms has criticized for supporting art he considers obscene 
wrenn attributes helms strength in the early polls to two 
factors one were not running against jim hunt a very popular 
governor and two all the democratic candidates positions are

modern dance pioneer alwin nikolais is 
accustomed to worldwide acclaim but he confesses he was terrified 
by the squirming secondgraders who attended the world premiere of 
his new space fantasy for children 
children frighten me said nikolais a 79yearold bachelor 
you never can know what their reaction might be unless youre 
around them a lot im not around children very much so it was 
doubly terrifying 
nikolais neednt have worried 
moments after the curtain rose tuesday on the crystal and the 
sphere his stage voyage through the galaxy of a childs 
imagination nikolais clearly had won the hearts of 500 local 
school children who packed the kennedy centers terrace theater 
the kids squealed as the house lights dimmed and the rumble of 
thunder shook their seats they oohed and aahed as the rising 
curtain revealed a 20foot balloon rocking gently on the stage 
like a strange new planet and a 12foot shard of crystal bathed in 
celestial lights 
they giggled at the wondrous aliens that cavorted across the 
stage a mermaid who teasingly tied her kelp tresses to an 
anglers hook a pair of fat webfooted birds that splashed in 
musical mud puddles herkyjerky androids ablaze in ultraviolet 
hues who disappeared in the twinkling of an eye 
nikolais did it all choreography synthesizer musical score 
scenery and costumes in creating the 20000 centerpiece for this 
years imagination celebration the kennedy centers annual 
arts festival for children 
his new work performed by five handpicked dancers from new 
york is being presented nine times this week at the kennedy center 
before it travels to childrens festivals at the el centro theater 
in dallas april 1820 and the orange county performing arts 
center in costa mesa calif april 2526 
the first show is a terror said nikolais sighing happily 
after the curtain fell on his latest premiere 
he hadnt created a dance work for youngsters since he was 
director of the henry street playhouse in new york in the late 
1940s when his company staged a dozen popular dance plays for 
children 
since then he has been cheered by audiences and critics around 
the world and received the coveted national medal of arts from 
president reagan in 1987 as a modern dance visionary in a way 
nikolais said his work on the crystal and the sphere meant 
returning to the world of children after a 40year absence 
they havent changed he said theyre made the same way 
and they behave the same way its that im rediscovering them 
again 
nikolais tried to envision the unearthly creatures a child might 
encounter on an imaginary exploration of the planets 
like most artists i have a childlike mind with a certain 
innocence that allows me to do things that others dont dare to 
do he said 
i do know that children love color and they like motions that 
they dont see all the time i thought theyd like these curious 
angular body shapes and dancers who suddenly appeared and 
disappeared 
children also like strange sounds you dont hear them humming 
beethovens fifth symphony they like the big bang like the 
worlds coming to an end and what really scares them is the lights 
going out and being left in the dark that always makes them 
yelp 
nikolais vision scored a hit with at least one member of the 
audience tuesday 
when the lights went up after the 45minute show a little girl 
turned to a schoolmate and asked its over already

this is not a great age of correspondence says 
the recently retired editor of the times venerable letters column 
though the mailbags still bulge with opinions both profound and 
eccentric 
there are many people who simply do not know how to put words 
onto paper they have to become so used to talking on the telephone 
or dictating into machines and having them tidied up by their 
secretaries leon pilpel said in an interview published in 
wednesdays editions of the times 
of the 300 letters a day only about 8 percent are 
publishable i am not talking about matters of syntax but about 
importance or meetness 
many of them are pretty mundane although frequently half a 
dozen not very brilliant ones can be made into a very good 
correspondence indeed with a bit of judicious editing and the 
specific approval of the letterwriter 
great debates have been waged in the sober letters columns of 
the times leavened with whimsical bits of english life such as 
the sighting of the first cuckoo of spring 
pilpel who is taking up new duties as a deputy ombudsman at the 
paper joined the times 40 years ago and became letters editor in 
1979 
the best letters during his tenure pilpel said came during the 
falklands war with argentina in 1982 when former ambassadors and 
highlevel bureaucrats were moved to pick up their pens 
the letters columns he said have declined in influence 
the amount of information and the diversity of viewpoints 
made available to the public from every medium chiefly radio and 
television with all their discussion programs mean that in some 
ways we are just part of a more widely disseminated form of 
argument he said 
wednesdays four columns of letters were typically diverse 
running the gamut from soviet policy in lithuania and the late 
bruno bettleheims theories about the docility of prisoners in nazi 
death camps to a letter from nina ec coltart of 1a well road 
boasting of nextday delivery of a firstclass letter addressed 
won eh well rowed 
graham chainey wrote from cambridge to summarize his researches 
on letters to the times regarding the oxfordcambridge boat race 
which was rowed last weekend and won by oxford 
in january of this year i calculate that you published no 
fewer than 15 letters from cambridge addresses against a miserable 
four from oxford chainey wrote 
this lead was magnificently maintained in february with a 
further 16 from cambridge against three from oxford only in march 
did the balance inexplicably swing the other way with oxford 
scoring seven published letters against five from cambridge 
the final tally he determined was cambridge 36 oxford 14 i 
do not of course offer any explanation chainey said in the 
style of times correspondents he signed off yours faithfully

badenbaden west germany ap two more west german companies 
are being investigated on suspicion of trying to deliver parts to 
the libyan plant allegedly involved in making poison gas a 
televison station reported 
suedwestfunk tv said wednesday that prosecutors in the southern 
city of ulm have opened a probe of abacaus gmbh in ulm and rose 
gmbh in stuttgart 
investigators searched the offices of the two companies last 
week and seized documents the report said agents also searched 
the home of abacus manager wolfgang liebert the television station 
said 
the two companies are suspected of seeking to deliver parts to 
libya needed to complete the chemical plant in rabta the report 
said no actual deliveries are believed to have taken place it 
said 
us and west german officials said earlier this year that the 
rabta plant has produced limited amounts of poison gas libya 
denied the reports insisting the plant is designed to manufacture 
only pharmaceuticals 
a fire last month caused damage at the rabta plant the cause of 
the fire is not clear nor is the extent of the damage 
us allegations that west german companies helped libya build 
the plant caused a row between bonn and washington last year the 
west german government at first denied the allegations but later 
ordered its own investigation 
imhausenchemie gmbh a chemical company in the southern town of 
lahr is suspected of delivering key equipment to the rabta plant 
juergen hippenstielimhausen the former chief of 
inhamusenchemie was indicted last month on charges he played a 
major role in supplying equipment to the rabta factory he was 
arrested 11 months ago 
the suedwestfunk television report said the abacus company 
ordered equipment from a siemens facility in karlsruhe saying the 
order was on behalf of a dutch company the final destination of 
the equipment was given by abacus as saudi arabia the report said 
but authorities believe the equipment was really destined for 
libya the report said 
the equipment involved parts needed to complete a production 
guidance system in rabta the report said some components of the 
system are believed to have been delivered by imhausen in 1987 it

greyhound lines inc on wednesday offered free bus 
trips through easter to passengers delayed on northeast routes in 
an effort to recapture business lost in the region during a 
monthlong drivers strike 
a suspicious fire broke out wednesday night in boston at a 
garage at a greyhound service terminal housing about 15 trailways 
buses fire officials said there were no injuries 
firefighters had to cut through a metal garage door to get to 
the fire and had a difficult time locating its source because the 
300 by 150foot garage was filled with smoke and heat said boston 
fire chief robert dillon the fire appeared to have been 
concentrated in a single bus trailways is owned by greyhound 
in new york city a state judge barred the company from hiring 
strikebreakers greyhound said it would appeal the ruling 
greyhounds 6300 drivers and about 3000 office and maintenance 
workers walked off the job march 2 in a dispute over wages and job 
security the countrys only nationwide bus company has operated on 
a reduced schedule since then using permanent replacements and 
union members who cross picket lines 
the union wednesday accused the company of allowing crazies 
and terrorists to block a resumption of talks the company 
called on the union to join in a news conference denouncing the 
violence and to cut strike benefits for union members who 
participate in attacks 
greyhound has said it will not bargain with the union until 
seven days have passed without shots being fired at one of its 
buses or facilities 
union spokesman nick nichols said the condition makes no sense 
they basically turned this whole process over to the people 
theyre calling the terrorists nichols said theres no way 
in my view that either the company or the union can control these 
crazies 
greyhound vice president p anthony lannie said in a letter to 
union president edward strait that absent implementation of 
effective measures to curb the illegal conduct the union cannot 
disclaim responsibility 
the unions conspicuous failure to implement effective 
measures against the violence lead to the inevitable conclusion of 
union responsibility for strike misconduct he said 
in new york judge diane lebedeff granted a union request for a 
temporary restraining order based on an antistrikebreaking statute 
passed by new yorks city council in 1962 but never used 
it prohibits a company for bringing in any workers for the 
purpose of having such person take the place in employment of 
employees in an industry or establishment where a strike or lockout 
exists 
the judge said greyhounds offer of a 2000 bonus to drivers 
hired during the strike tends to corroborate the charge that 
strikebreakers are being used 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said the ruling wouldnt 
affect the company much it does not interfere with our basic 
operations we dont hire strikebreakers he said 
dallasbased greyhound has been rebuilding its system since the 
strike began expanding mainly in the south and west 
last week company president frank schmieder said the walkout 
was essentially meaningless in much of the country however he 
acknowledged that the northeast which accounts for about 10 
percent of greyhound revenue remained a trouble spot 
greyhound said wednesday it was improving regional service by 
adding hourly departures on fridays and sundays from new york city 
to boston philadelphia and washington it guaranteed seats would 
be available and buses would run ontime 
we promise to arrive within 15 minutes of the scheduled 
arrival time schmieder said if we dont we will give our 
passengers a coupon good for a free round trip on the same route 
the guarantee covers albany buffalo rochester and syracuse 
ny boston montreal mount laurel nj philadelphia and 
washington is good only through easter sunday april 15 and must 
be redeemed by june 15 
greyhound spokeswoman elizabeth hale said the company had 
decided to focus attention on the northeast because of the regions 
level of commuter travel 
ms hale said 166 million people have taken greyhound buses 
since the strike began with 61437 traveling by bus on tuesday or 
468 percent of those who traveled on the same day last year 
percentages have been climbing slowly throughout the walkout 
greyhound has pledged not to resume negotiations with the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions until a week passes 
without major violence 
there have been 31 shootings including 26 at buses 70 bomb 
threats and more than 100 other incidents of violence greyhound 
officials say the union says about 60 of its pickets have been 
targets of violence a striker in redding calif was crushed to 
death march 3 by a bus being reversed by a replacement driver 
greyhound has offered a threeyear contract it values at 63 
million and says it can not afford to pay more the union says its 
own latest offer is worth about 40 million but greyhound says it 
would cost 180 million

putting out a newspaper without promotion is 
like winking at a girl in the dark wellintentioned but 
ineffective said press mogul william randolph hearst 
his quotation adorns an exhibit the american journalist 
paradox of the press it opens today at the library of congress 
and winks in full selfconsciousness at the american press in 
every manifestation from feisty hearst to feisty benjamin harris 
americas first newsman 
harris published the first american newspaper on sept 25 1690 
it lasted one issue before it was closed down by the british 
authorities the sole surviving copy was flown back from london for 
the exhibit 
the show underwritten by a 325000 grant from the gannett 
foundation and running through aug 12 coincides with the 67th 
annual meeting of the american society of newspaper editors whose 
members gathered at the library wednesday night to celebrate the 
occasion 
on display behind glass the little bedside notebook in which 
washington post reporter bob woodward made notes when the city desk 
awakened him on saturday june 17 1972 to tell him to cover a 
breakin at the watergate hotel 
he scratched down 5 men arrested at demo nat headquarters 
wsoph photo equip 
joined by street reporter carl bernstein he went on to uncover 
the watergate scandal that led to the resignation of richard m 
nixon as president two years later 
nothing so dramatic appeared in public occurrences both 
forreign and domestick benjamin harris scrawny paper three 
printed pages and a blank one it reported a suicide by hanging 
the spread of a smallpox epidemic and rumors about improprieties by 
the king of france 
harris proposed to publish once a month or if any glut of 
occurrences happen oftener but the authorities concluded that 
his paper contained sundry doubtful and uncertain reports and 
closed it down 
the paradox of the press is what the exhibit explores what 
curator david halaas says has been the lovehate relationship 
between the people and the news gatherers 
on one hand members of the press are seen as truthseekers and 
watchdogs of government on the other hand theyre seen as 
gossipmongers and purveyors of slander he said 
on exhibit are war correspondent ernie pyles typewriter the 
clippings in abraham lincolns pockets when he was assassinated 
the hustling newsboys who learned to condense a news story into a 
few catchy words the zany cartoons of rube goldberg such as one 
entitled simple way to light a cigar in an automobile traveling 
50 miles an hour a battlefield picture of a grinning boyish 
helmeted war cartoonist bill mauldin and the cluttered rolltop 
desk of william allen white editorowner of kansas emporia 
gazette who came to epitomize the courageous commonsense small 
town editor 
and too a poster advertising the new york sunday tribune the 
picture showed conductors tossing bundles of papers from a moving 
train onto a suburban platform the legend it has an illustrated 
supplement and being a high class dignified paper of superb 
merit is especially worthy to be read by intelligent and honest 
people 
back at the asne meeting another paradox of the press was the 
topic of a speech given by retiring association president loren 
ghiglione he told colleagues that journalists have become so 
successful comfortable wellpaid and suburban that they have 
forfeited their role as fighters for societys underdogs 
we often think of ourselves as davids fighting the 
establishment but the public sees us more and more as statusquo 
establishment goliaths said ghiglione publisher and editor of 
the southbridge mass news 
while we say we comfort the afflicted and afflict the 
comfortable we need to guard against looking at the world 
increasingly through the eyes of the comfortable he said

scientists have arranged 35 atoms to create what 
is probably the worlds tiniest advertisement attaining a 
precision that may one day lead to development of new materials and 
far faster computers 
it took 22 hours of moving atoms one by one to create the 
letters ibm researcher donald eigler said 
the design about 660 billionths of an inch long is featured in 
a report by eigler and erhard schweizer who did the work at ibms 
almaden research center in san jose calif the report is in 
todays issue of the british journal nature 
physicists called the work a significant step that demonstrates 
that individual atoms can be arranged with high precision 
the implications are really remarkable said stuart lindsay 
of arizona state university he called the work absolutely 
fascinating 
someday that ability may let researchers build vanishingly tiny 
electronic components allowing computers far faster than todays 
supercomputers scientists said atoms may also be assembled 
someday into molecules to create new substances and materials they 
said 
the atomhauling process was akin to tugging ping pong balls 
over the bumpy bottom of an egg carton the atoms were placed with 
such precision that scientists could choose an individual atom on 
the surface as the point on which to put a second atom to build the 
design eigler said in a telephone interview 
the ibm scientists arranged atoms of a heavy gas called xenon on 
a surface made of nickel they used a device called a scanning 
tunneling microscope which produces extremely detailed images of 
surfaces it can sense atoms on a surface by passing the tip of a 
needle over it 
the tip holds a magnetlike attraction for atoms when the tip 
was brought close enough to a xenon atom it could pull the atom 
across the surface 
the needle had to tug hard enough to haul a xenon atom over 
bumpy nickel atoms on the surface but gently enough not to lift it 
off the surface eigler said 
the amount of pull was adjusted by changing the needle tips 
height typically the tip hovered about 10 billionths of an inch 
above a xenon atom 
atoms could be moved about 16 billionths of an inch per second 
once they were positioned the tip was withdrawn 
apart from the ibm design researchers also arranged seven 
xenon atoms into a chain 
the work was done at about minus 452 degrees fahrenheit almost 
as cold as anything can get that kept the xenon atoms from 
wandering eigler said 
in addition it was done in an extremely high vaccuum to keep 
unwanted molecules from contaminating the surface eigler said the 
surface can be kept free of contamination for at least a month 
eigler said lindsay said that degree of control was impressive 
eigler said he did not know of any commercial use for placing 
xenon atoms on nickel but perhaps some more useful kinds of atoms 
will lend themselves to the technique he said 
such atombyatom placement should help scientists learn more 
about how atoms and molecules behave on surfaces which might help 
in developing semiconductors the building blocks of many 
electronic devices he said 
it may also provide a way to store perhaps 2 million times more 
electronic information in a given space than is now possible 
eigler said 
electronic information is now recorded in sort of a morse code 
consisting of 1s and 0s and that might be translated into the 
presence or absence of an atom at a particular location he said

the inmates raising their fists in 
defiance on the roof of strangeways prison may look like dangerous 
criminals on the evening tv news but for many in this northern 
industrial city theyre workingclass heroes 
crowds of supporters have lined police barricades several 
hundred yards from the roof of the prison which has been under 
siege since a riot by hundreds of inmates sunday morning 
inmates have continued to surrender and the number still on the 
loose inside early today was 20 to 25 authorities said but the 
crowds outside keep growing and hundreds of people fill the 
streets beside the prison 
anxious mothers sisters and wives and other supporters have 
followed the actions of rebel inmates on the roof through 
binoculars and telephoto camera lenses waving and shouting names 
or words of encouragement 
the crowd is very much manchesters under class 
they are the handicapped and the unemployed and many are poorly 
dressed and dirty some also are drunk and there are many 
children some as young as 9 sharing packs of cigarettes and 
lollipops 
some of those who have stood for hours in the bitter cold are 
former inmates others have never before been near the jail but 
nearly all stood vigil because they supported the prisoners 
demands for better jail conditions 
its a local jail a lot of people in manchester have had 
people in there and they know what goes on said john martin 
riley a construction worker whose brother is serving a 10year 
sentence for armed robbery 
strangeways massive and grim was built in 1868 to hold 970 
men on sunday when the riot began it held 1648 
even prison officials have used the siege in which at least one 
inmate has been killed and more than 45 people injured to condemn 
gruesome prison conditions 
at strangeways as many as three men are locked in a 5by7foot 
cell with a bucket instead of a toilet they get showers and a 
change of clothes once a week the prisoners claim the food is 
poor frequently cold liver stew and stale bread 
its a horrible place ancient and nasty and i hope they burn 
it down said tracy wilding 28 a parttime secretary whose 
exhusband once served time in the redbrick jail 
she said the rebel prisoners were very brave actually they 
will all be in big trouble in the end 
on tuesday manchester evening news editor michael unger went 
inside strangeways at the request of inmates who wanted to meet a 
member of the press in a story in the wednesday edition of the 
newspaper unger described his feelings after meeting two inmates 
in their small bleak cell who wished to surrender 
i knew they were villains but they were tragic villains 
unger wrote 
john turned to me he begged me to write and visit him 
whichever prison he ended up in then john wept 
eric had decided to give himself up he was very sad very 
low very frightened revenge from officers prison guards 
seemed inevitable he said eric like john thanked me before he 
was led away you couldnt help but feel sympathy unger wrote 
prisoners who surrender are given a medical checkup and 
interviewed by a prison inspection panel then they receive a 
shower and a hot meal and are transferred to other jails 
despite their fears and worries family members continued to 
support the dangerous action by the holdouts 
patricia lydon a parttime hotel receptionist kept a threeday 
vigil outside the jail and intently watched her 24yearold 
brother kiern one of the last prisoners on the roof wednesday 
evening 
like many of those in strangeways kiern lydon was jailed while 
awaiting trial and has not been convicted of any charge ms lydon 
was joined wednesday by her mother and the two women held hands as 
they stood in the biting cold wind 
i came to keep him company but i wish i was up there with 
him ms lydon said theyre fighting for a cause 
they shouldnt have to come to this to get attention her 
mother added just to get normal human conditions

states are inventing their own economic 
development policies in a quiet revolution that came because 
they couldnt wait for federal solutions to evolve a private 
research group said today 
the story is that while washington the federal government 
continues to be stalemated over what we ought to do over foreign 
competition the states have gone ahead and invented their own 
strategies said doug ross president of the corporation for 
enterprise development a research and consulting organization 
ross said the states reached a consensus over the last decade 
that we havent seen since the progressive era 100 years ago 
when the states led the way in figuring out how to make the 
transition from an agricultural to an industrial society 
unable to wait for new federal solutions states began 
tailoring homegrown strategies to cure state economic ills ross 
said 
states now encourage and support indigenous development 
modernizing instate businesses easing their expansion and product 
development educating their workers and facilitating startups 
he explained 
its a quiet revolution one that may well have more lasting 
impact on the quality of our lives and the prospects for our 
children than any other domestic policy shift of the past decade 
ross added 
the findings are included in the fourth annual development 
report card for the states financed by corporations labor 
unions and private foundations 
for more than 40 years the study said states relied on 
smokestack chasing or luring outofstate businesses with 
incentives and subsidies that approach no longer was working by 
the late 1970s the study found 
the study pointed to dramatic changes in communication 
transportation and technology that often made it possible for 
overseas competitors to produce goods cheaper than us 
manufacturers could 
our businesses were losing market share rapidly it said 
for the first time in our history it began to look as though we 
would not be able to promise our children a better life than our 
own 
the study said some of the new strategies and the extent of 
their use include 
fortyfour states are stimulating applied research through 
research centers and research grants 
fortyfive states help businesses commercialize new 
technologies or apply stateoftheart technologies 
thirtyfive states offer nontraditional development finance 
instruments like product development seed capital and venture 
capital 
forty states employ new financial mechanisms that leverage 
private resources to help meet business capital needs 
fortyseven states have launched specific education reform 
measures 
fortyseven states devote state resources to improving the 
quality and productivity of their existing work force 
as a result the study said rust belt states are resurgent less 
than 10 years after the 198182 recession nearly did them in 
recent investments in technology infrastructure and skill 
improvements as well as policy innovations in development finance 
and industry modernization have paid off in new economic strength 
for these states ross said 
according to the study the northeast and west coast states 
continue to be the nations strongest economically although some 
show troubling signs including labor shortages in the northeast 
and a decline of the timber industry in oregon and washington 
southern states continue to make remarkable progress toward 
economic health the study said but there is a long uphill 
struggle still ahead 
with the exception of utah however the plains and rocky 
mountain states have not recovered from the recession these 
states need intensive care and are not getting it the study said 
the world has changed but these states have not it said 
without substantial change in policy and growth in competitive 
capacity these states face a bleak future indeed

claims that it could not afford theft insurance for the works 
recently stolen there 
gardner officials said the museum target of the biggest art 
heist in history would have to pay an amount exceeding its 28 
million operating budget for such insurance the theft was 
committed march 18 when two men dressed as policemen talked their 
way in and tied up two security guards 
but art insurers said theft insurance is affordable even for 
small museums 
i dont know why theyd make such a statement said carl 
allen chairman of allen insurance associates a los angeles firm 
that insures about 100 museums nationwide those statements are 
just exaggerations 
both allen and huntington block president of a washington 
dc firm that insures 285 museums said a 100 million policy 
covering theft fire and any other loss or damage would run about 
150000 annually 
thats a pretty normal figure block said i dont know 
where the gardner people got the idea it would cost millions 
the heist was estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars the thieves made off with 11 paintings and prints by 
rembrandt vermeer manet and degas and swiped an ancient chinese 
vase and a gilded eagle from the flagpole of a napoleonic flag 
museum spokesman barry wanger said gardner officials reviewed 
the museums insurance policies about two years ago he said they 
had received widely varying cost estimates and concluded that 
protection against theft was too expensive 
there were all sorts of figures being bandied about wanger 
said it all depends on who you talk to 
wanger said the museums board of trustees last week formed a 
subcommittee to examine the museums security measures and 
insurance policies he said theft insurance would be discussed 
earlier this week fbi agent paul cavanagh said investigators 
continued to receive tips but werent close to a break in the case 
the stolen works were considered too well known to be sold on 
the open market the outlook for their recovery is better than 
average because they are so familiar but overall chances remain 
slim investigators said 
about 80 percent of stolen art is never recovered said 
robert spiel a private security consultant in chicago and former 
fbi agent specializing in art theft

republican party chairman lee atwater will 
receive chemotherapy in addition to the radiation treatments being 
used to combat a brain tumor 
in a statement issued wednesday through republican party 
headquarters dr paul l kornblith described the tumor as 
aggressive and dangerous but said atwater was fortunate that 
it was quite small and has been detected early in its 
development 
kornblith led a team of physicians at montefiore medical center 
in new york city who implanted radioactive isotopes into the tumor 
tuesday in an effort to kill it 
mr atwater has done so well following this procedure that he 
will be able to be discharged from the hospital in a few days and 
may well be able to return to work in some degree within a couple 
of weeks said kornblith 
although it is obvious that this tumor is aggressive and 
dangerous mr atwater has many factors working in his favor 
said kornblith who cited the fact the party chairman is only 39 
and is in excellent health 
the tumor called an astrocytoma was described as the most 
common primary brain tumor 
it does not spread to other parts of the body but can cause 
damage to brain tissue by pressure and by invasion said 
kornblith 
a brain tumor undergoing unrestrained growth would cause 
pressure within the closed skull this pressure would kill normal 
brain cells thus bringing eventual death by destroying vital 
functions 
brain tumors can also spread by extension into other parts of 
the central nervous system and displace normal cells during such a 
process there would be a progressive loss of function as normal 
brain cells associated with memory thought muscle control and 
even heartbeat and respiration are lost 
in addition to the radiation treatment now underway the doctor 
said that to assure that any tumor cells peripheral to the main 
lesion are destroyed he will be receiving chemotherapy as well 
he said atwater would receive chemotherapy orally once every six 
weeks and it would not limit his activities or functions 
atwaters wife sally who is expecting their third child within 
days accompanied him to new york 
mary matalin gop chief of staff said atwater received numerous 
visitors wednesday but they had to stand behind a lead shield 
because of radioactivity 
kornblith said atwater will need to be followed closely and 
may need to have additional therapies in the future for the 
present we are delighted with his progress

a real estate broker testified that an associate 
of imelda marcos threatened him and his family after a 1981 news 
report revealed that the philippine first lady was secretly 
negotiating for a posh new york apartment 
thomas bryan the prosecutions first witness in the fraud trial 
of mrs marcos and saudi financier adnan khashoggi said wednesday 
that gliceria tantoco did not accuse him of leaking the story to 
the new york post 
but she expressed regret that the information had become 
public and said i should fear for my life and my family bryan 
testified in federal court 
under questioning by mrs marcos attorney gerald spence bryan 
said that he was upset by the threat but that it did not deter him 
from further contacts with mrs marcos 
bryan of fairfax va who was then a 27000ayear broker for 
the sothebys auction house told how mrs marcos and mrs tantoco 
tried to secretly purchase the park avenue apartment and contents 
put up for sale by leslie samuels a philanthropist and art 
collector 
the socalled samuels collection was among the purchases 
that mrs marcos and her husband former philippine president 
ferdinand marcos made with 160 million embezzled from their 
homeland prosecutors have charged 
earlier wednesday a lawyer for khashoggi once described as the 
richest man in the world portrayed his client as a naive 
businessman who committed foolish acts 
if this wasnt such a serious charge this would be funny 
james linn said it is not the sinister thing that the government 
makes it out to be 
khashoggi 54 is charged with mail fraud and obstruction for 
allegedly helping the marcoses hide their ownership in new york 
real estate after the philippine government won a us court order 
in 1986 to prohibit any further transactions involving the 
properties 
linn admitted that khashoggi had signed a fake document 
involving the buildings but said this was intended to help a 
marcos associate not to defraud anyone 
khashoggi was trying to head off moves by creditors to foreclose 
on the properties linn said 
in explaining the saudi financiers frequent contacts with 
marcos linn also said khashoggi fell for a bizarre scheme in 
which marcos offered him 10 percent of a shipload of gold if he 
could find a safe port for the vessel preferably in the arab 
world 
marcos who died in exile in september supposedly intended to 
use the gold to finance a counterrevolution in case the 
philippines fell to the communists 
mrs marcos 60 is charged with racketeering conspiracy mail 
fraud and obstruction she could receive up to 50 years in prison 
and 1 million in fines khashoggi faces up to 10 years in prison 
and 500000 in fines 
mrs tantoco a longtime friend of mrs marcos and owner of the 
rustans department store in manila and her husband bienvenido 
sr former philippines ambassador to the vatican also were 
indicted but are fugitives 
bryan testified that mrs marcos offered to buy both the samuels 
apartment and its contents for nearly 14 million a corporation 
conrolled by mrs marcos acquired the artworks for 6 million but 
she lost the apartment when the cooperatives board of directors 
rejected mrs tantoco as the purchaser

president bush is expected to sign newly 
approved legislation under which the government will gather data on 
hate crimes motivated by race religion sexual orientation or 
ethnic roots 
this bill is a necessary first step toward combating hate 
crimes in a systematic and comprehensive manner said rep 
charles schumer dny 
the house debated the bill tuesday night and then on wednesday 
voted 40218 to agree to minor changes made by the senate and send 
it to bush for his signature 
the administration has supported the bill which would require 
the justice department to keep data on crimes related to race 
religion sexual orientation or ethnic groups it is supported by a 
variety of civil rights ethnic and police groups 
the house had already approved the bill and this time consented 
to the changes made when the senate passed the measure on feb 8 
under the measure the government would count the crimes of 
murder nonnegligent manslaughter forcible rape aggravated 
assault simple assault intimidation arson and destruction 
damage or vandalism of property 
a number of supporters said such a count is needed because of a 
rising tide of hate crimes on the part of neonazi 
skinheads and other such groups although there is no certainty 
that such offenses are increasing 
the justice department reported in may 1988 that an accurate 
count is not available but it said these types of offenses are 
far more serious than comparable crimes that do not involve 
prejudice because they are intended to intimidate an entire group 
estimates of the cost of gathering the information have varied 
but the justice department said it would have no trouble making 
hate crimes part of the fbis annually published uniform crime 
reports 
the only house member to rise in opposition to the bill was rep 
william dannemeyer rcalif who portrayed it as a concession to 
the gay community 
believe me whether we like to accept it or not there are 
persons outside this chamber who are crowing namely in the 
homosexual community he told the house 
dannemeyer said homosexuals now have something in the law 
which they have sought diligently for the last 20 years whereby 
they will equate homosexuality on a par with the traditional 
coverage of the 1964 civil rights act

the jury deliberating john poindexters guilt 
or innocence on charges he covered up oliver norths military 
assistance to the contras and the us role in a shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran is giving little hint of its progress 
there were no notes from the jury wednesday the third day of 
deliberations the panel of eight women and four men was resuming 
its work today 
poindexter is accused of conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements each charge 
carries a maximum fiveyear prison term and a 250000 fine 
poindexters lawyers expressed concern over jury instructions 
about 5000 messages that poindexter erased from his computer 
system defense lawyers asked us district judge harold greene to 
clarify the instructions but the judge refused 
the destruction of the messages is included in an obstruction 
charge alleging the former national security adviser tried to 
conceal from congress the us role in the hawk shipment 
the jurors asked for copies of the messages which were saved on 
a backup tape at the white house 
greene rejected the jurors request tuesday saying the notes 
hadnt been introduced as evidence at the trial and so you cant 
have them 
defense attorneys said wednesday the judge may have misled the 
jury into believing that it couldnt consider other evidence about 
the messages 
among that evidence is a stipulation a statement agreed to by 
prosecutors and the defense that none of the messages were from 
1985 when the hawk missiles were shipped to iran the inference 
that could be drawn is that poindexter did not cover up evidence 
about the hawk shipment by erasing the messages 
the hawk shipment is the focus of the indictment against 
poindexter ten days after 18 missiles were delivered by a cia 
proprietary airline to iran poindexter had president reagan sign a 
document which ratified the shipment 
the document depicted us involvement in an arrangement to 
trade arms for hostages 
poindexter tore up the document on nov 21 1986 hours after 
telling congress he hadnt found out about the hawks shipment until 
two months after it occurred 
he destroyed the document eight days after reagan said in a 
nationally televised address that we did not trade weapons 
for hostages 
the prosecution contends that poindexter lied to congress to 
hide the existence of the presidential document

the house is urging president bush to reaffirm 
his commitment to lithuania while a group of senators warns that 
the issue could threaten the future of ussoviet relations 
the house voted 4163 wednesday for a resolution calling on bush 
to reaffirm his commitment to an independent lithuania and take 
steps as soon as possible to normalize diplomatic relations 
between washington and the baltic republic 
the resolution which has no force of law is similar to one 
passed earlier by the senate 
thirtyone senators in a letter to bush said the president 
should take a more aggressive stand in support of lithuania which 
is attempting to secede from the soviet union 
now is the time to inform the soviet leadership what specific 
actions our government may take in response to the further use of 
armed force in lithuania the letter said 
the congressional appeals in support of an independent lithuania 
came as secretary of state james a baker iii raised the issue with 
visiting soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
shevardnadze said afterward i have no doubt we will be able 
to find a solution to that situation that we will find a wise and 
fair solution 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and minority 
leader bob dole rkan met late wednesday with shevardnadze at 
the soviet embassy the senators had requested the meeting and 
shevardnadze said i appreciate your visiting our embassy 
asked how his session with baker went shevardnadze said the two 
discussed issues in a constructive language he declined to say 
whether the united states had made any demands about lithuania 
the senate letter to bush warned that if the soviets continue to 
thwart the lithuanians drive for selfdetermination and dont 
engage in goodfaith negotiations the issue will have serious 
negative implications for ussoviet relations 
the letter was originated by sens bill armstrong rcolo and 
donald riegle dmich eighteen republicans and 13 democrats signed 
it 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee did not sign the letter but accused the 
soviets of turning a deaf ear on the lithuanians he said the 
tense situation could reverse progress in the ussoviet 
relationship 
opposing the house resolution were reps david obey dwis 
david nagle diowa and george crockett dmich 
rep lee hamilton dind said the state department did not 
want the resolution passed but he said it was necessary 
meantime sen alfonse damato rny flew to poland intending 
to cross the border into lithuania for a firsthand look at the 
baltic state 
i want to see if soviet president mikhail gorbachev is 
indeed a man of peace who adheres to the principles of open borders 
and freedom of travel damato said before he left 
lithuanias decision last month to declare itself an independent 
republic has put bush in a difficult diplomatic spot some people 
including sen edward kennedy dmass who recently met with 
gorbachev have told the president that taking too hard a line with 
gorbachev could topple him and that would not be in washingtons 
best interest 
but sen malcolm wallop rwyo said that if gorbachev is too 
weak to withstand the challenge of lithuania the united states 
shouldnt stake any future claim on him

if negotiations to liberalize world 
agricultural trade are successful look for fried chicken dinners 
to cost a bit more 
it wouldnt be much of an increase and its all pretty much of 
a guess anyway says the agriculture department but when 
economists and computers get together thats the way it goes 
the departments economic research service assumed in its study 
that a hypothetical onetime 10 percent increase in corn prices 
would occur if ongoing talks under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade succeed in liberalizing trade 
two computer models were set up to see what would happen to the 
broiler industries in the united states and canada if producers had 
to pay more for corn used to feed their birds 
prices would go up in both countries at the producer level and 
at retail counters the study concluded 
one of the reports authors economist greg gajewski said 
wednesday in a telephone interview that the study did not forecast 
that a gatt settlement would boost corn prices by 10 percent 
its not based on past historical data he said and 
thats because theres never been such a movement to free trade 
gajewski said an earlier study last year showed that if the gatt 
talks resulted in liberalized trade the us market prices for 
corn the prices that broiler producers would pay could rise 
between 1 percent and 11 percent a huge range of possibilities 
for purposes of the study a 10 percent increase was used 
gajewski said the main point of the study is that us broiler 
prices would be much more responsive than canadian prices to an 
increase in corn costs 
in the united states 
broiler prices at the producer level would start climbing 
immediately with the monthly maximum increase of 39 percent 
occurring in the fifth month however prices would continue to 
rise at slower rates for an additional 27 months 
over the entire period each percentage point in corn prices 
would lift producer broiler prices by an average of nearly 04 
percent 
at retail stores broiler price increases would resemble those 
at the producer level but the rise would be smaller the peak 
monthly increase of 28 percent would occur in the fourth month it 
would take an additional 26 months for the increases to end 
in canada 
broiler price increases at the farm would be delayed a month but 
would then rise and build strength through the 15th month with a 
peak rise of 43 percent farm broiler prices would continue up at 
lesser rates for another seven months 
on the retail level canadian broiler prices would begin 
increasing immediately gaining strength through the 16th month 
with a maximum monthly grain of 29 percent the rise would 
continue more slowly for another six months 
the study described in the april issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine showed that the canadian broiler price increases would 
taper off eight to 10 months sooner than in the united states 
which would have more volatile monthtomonth responses 
some of the uscanada difference may be due to marketing 
structures the report said in canada provincial governments 
control broiler output through marketing quotas and the federal 
government sets an import quota to help stabilize prices 
broiler production in the united states is largely unregulated 
and the top 20 firms account for about 80 percent of the total 
output

some mexican cattle are getting fasttrack 
clearance by the agriculture department to enter designated us 
feedlots because droughtshriveled pastures have been reduced to 
starvation levels 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said wednesday the agencys usual 
import regulations have been temporarily set aside so the cattle 
can be brought in 
normally he said imported animals and their herds of origin 
have to be tested and found free of cattle brucellosis and 
tuberculosis 
the usual requirement is that imported animals must come from 
herds that have been tested for the diseases no more than three 
months before the date of us entry with the special waiver the 
mexican cattle will be able to enter approximately three months 
sooner 
the droughtstricken pasture lands in parts of mexico cannot 
support the cattle glosser said by bringing the animals 
temporarily to us quarantined feedlots under strict movement 
restrictions we can avert starvation of the animals and still 
protect the health of us livestock 
glosser said the cattle will be taken directly to quarantined 
feedlots in usdasealed trucks or rail cars they will not be sold 
to any us buyer and will return directly to mexico from the 
feedlots the animals will be kept apart from us cattle while in 
the feedlots which are mostly in texas 
there was no estimate of how many mexican cattle may be imported 
under the special program said agency spokeswoman anita brown

as many as 6 million couples and individuals 
are expected to ask the internal revenue service for an extra four 
months to file their tax returns this year 
the filing deadline for most americans is april 16 but the irs 
will grant an extension automatically if a taxpayer unable to file 
by that date mails in a form 4868 instead however irs spokesman 
steve pyrek noted wednesday the form must be accompanied by a 
check for estimated taxes owed 
its not a good idea to underestimate your taxes when you seek 
an extension of filing time says accountant saul epstein of the 
philadelphia office of ernst amp young 
if you underestimate youll have to pay interest on the 
unpaid amount and if it the unpaid amount is more than 10 
percent of your total liability there will be an additional 
failuretopay penalty 
in some cases pyrek said an underestimate also can result in a 
failuretofile penalty 
the irs expects 111 million returns to be filed this year 
although not all taxpayers will meet either the regular deadline or 
an extended deadline through march 30 601 million returns had 
been received 2 million more than during the same period a year 
ago 
the irs has processed 515 million of those returns 35 million 
more than at this time last year nearly 79 percent of returns are 
qualifying for refunds 405 million this year for 344 billion 
at this time last year about 78 percent or 373 million received 
refunds which totaled 305 billion 
nearly 38 million taxpayers have filed electronic returns 270 
percent above the same period of 1989 and considerably more than 
the irs had forecast for the entire year 
electronic returns filed for a fee by irsauthorized companies 
are transmitted to the irs via telephone line they eliminate a 
considerable amount of paperwork and errors and allow the agency to 
promise refunds in two or three weeks 
taxpayers who file paper returns between now and the deadline 
can expect refunds in about eight weeks 
a person who filed a return at least eight weeks ago may call a 
computerized irs telephone number to find out why any refund has 
not been received tollfree numbers for that service are listed in 
the back of the taxform instructions 
to use this service you will need to know the first social 
security number on your return your filing status and the exact 
amount of the refund 
the irs said more than 10 million people have made such calls 
this year 
while most americans must file by midnight april 16 residents 
of new england and most counties of new york have an extra day 
that is because april 16 is patriots day a holiday in 
massachusetts the irs service center to which those people file 
their returns is in andover mass 
a person whose home and main workplace are outside the united 
states and puerto rico on april 16 automatically has until june 15 
to file

the bush administrations 1991 budget request 
for star wars research includes development money for an 8 billion 
satellite that wont be part of the antimissile defense the 
project director says 
air force lt gen george l monahan manager of the strategic 
defense initiative the official name of the antimissile program 
said wednesday that although the satellite no longer is an 
essential element of star wars the spending is justified 
bushs 1991 budget includes 265 million to start fullscale 
development of the satellite the proposed total budget for sdi in 
the next fiscal year is 45 billion 
the satellite called a boostphase surveillance and tracking 
system is important in its own right because it could replace the 
less capable existing satellites that provide early warning of 
ballistic missile launches monahan said 
the general told the house armed services research and 
development subcommittee that 1 billion already has been spent on 
research for the new satellite the total cost of developing and 
producing it would be about 8 billion 
i think its very wise to go forward with it monahan said 
he added that his office is studying ways that the satellite and 
radar network that would be part of a star wars system might be 
restructured to save money he told reporters afterward that he 
could not provide an estimate of potential savings 
many members of congress are looking for ways of reducing star 
wars spending last year the administrations funding request was 
cut by about 1 billion to 36 billion and support for the 
project appears to have eroded further as a result of historic 
political shifts in the east bloc since last fall 
rep william dickinson rala said congressional supporters of 
sdi such as himself need more help from the white house if further 
cuts are to be avoided 
the presidents going to have to get involved he said 
hes going to have to draw a line in the sand 
under the star wars concept as recently as 1988 the boostphase 
surveillance and tracking system would communicate with sensor 
satellites to help guide spacebased weapons toward the ballistic 
missile targets during flight 
now scientists have proposed building a new kind of spacebased 
weapon known as brilliant pebbles each weapon or pebble would 
have its own inhouse tracking and sensor capability so that it 
would not need to interact with separate satellites to see and 
home in on missiles 
monahan gave the house panel an upbeat assessment of technical 
progress in research on brilliant pebbles which are kinetic or 
nonexplosive weapons that would be permanently based in space and 
could be activated from a ground command center the kinetic 
warhead would destroy its target simply by crashing into it 
no tests of brilliant pebbles have been conducted but monahan 
said he believed that by late 1993 or early 1994 the pentagon 
should be ready to begin fullscale development of the weapons

latin american cocaine barons 
stymied by washingtons war on drugs are relying more and more on 
european ports to get their merchandise to us streets police say 
moreover officials say all across europe police seizures of 
cocaine have at least doubled in the past few years and the drug is 
challenging heroin as the narcotic of choice on the continent 
last month the national police intelligence service published 
figures that show cocaine seizures in the netherlands to have risen 
dramatically over the past three years 
dutch police confiscated 7700 pounds of cocaine in the first 
three months of this year alone more than double the 3120 pounds 
seized in all of last year and almost three times the 1130 pounds 
in 1988 
commissioner peter broeders of the intelligence services crime 
information division said drug kingpins from colombia and other 
latin american countries are searching for routes that are less 
vulnerable than the direct routes to the united states 
broeders in a radio interview tuesday upon his return from a 
twoweek trip visiting drug enforcement agencies in the united 
states attributed the shift to president bushs 79 billion war 
on drugs 
the tough way in which americans are handling the drug trade 
from south america is forcing the drug barons to shift their supply 
lines and theyre doing it through europe broeders said 
crime information division spokesman peter de waard said in an 
interview wednesday that another factor in the growing drug 
seizures is that the north american market is so saturated latin 
american drug barons cant sell there any more 
instead they are turning to europe he said 
on feb 28 police in the dutch north sea port of ijmuiden 
seized 6600 pounds of cocaine concealed in a shipment of frozen 
fruit juice although the cocaines origin remains unclear police 
said four of the eight suspects they arrested claimed to be 
colombian nationals 
broeders said much of the cocaine smuggled into this country is 
believed to be going through rotterdam packed mostly in freight 
containers 
rotterdam is the biggest port in the world and broeders said it 
is physically impossible to open and inspect all of the 25 million 
containers shipped through the port every year 
police seizures of cocaine across europe reached 15435 pounds 
in 1989 
french police hauled in 2000 pounds in 1989 up 58 percent from 
the previous year less than 220 pounds were seized in that country 
in 1982 
in great britain seizures more than quadrupled between 1986 and 
1989 with police confiscating 935 pounds last year 
although heroin seems to be europes most widely used drug 
cocaine is taking over 
1987 was the last year that dutch police hauled in more heroin 
than cocaine de waard said 
both drugs are relatively easy to obtain in the netherlands 
which rarely prosecutes drug abusers but concentrates on capturing 
traffickers 
drugrelated crime is increasing dramatically in holland we 
are seeing more shootouts between drug gangs de waard said 
until recently drug turf battles were relatively rare in the 
netherlands which also has experienced almost none of the violent 
crime associated with crack the highly addictive cocaine 
derivative

former president richard m nixon is sidelined 
with a heart problem but his doctor says it can be taken care of 
with medication and a little rest 
the former president 77 was diagnosed on wednesday as 
suffering from a benign supra ventricular heart rhythm disturbance 
dr jeffrey borer a cardiologist at cornell university medical 
college in new york city said that means signals that cause the 
heart to beat were being generated abnormally 
thats not a big problem and not hard to deal with borer 
said in these circumstances we generally control the situation 
with medication because the heart is beating faster than it ought 
to and therefore is less efficient 
nixon was not hospitalized his aide john taylor said the 
former president will recuperate at his home in saddle river nj 
and that he is expected to resume his full schedule when the 
condition is brought under control 
hes been feeling run down since a speech he made in miami on 
march 27 taylor said on the down side is that the president 
is not going to be able to go on his daily morning walk 
nixon will postpone an appearance on april 12 before the world 
affairs council of boston 
the former president recently published his eighth book in 
the arena a memoir

two republican members of the senate armed 
services committee today called on president bush to limit 
production of the b2 bomber and delay the advanced tactical 
fighter as part of additional cuts in defense spending 
we believe that the united states can meet its defense 
requirements with budget levels lower than those proposed by the 
administration said sens william cohen of maine and john mccain 
of arizona 
although caution is appropriate in crafting a defense policy 
using the possible return of the cold war as an excuse for delaying 
changes in the military is unwarranted the lawmakers said 
if we do not reorient our defense planning to the genuine 
needs of the future we will squander a unique opportunity and 
waste declining defense resources cohen and mccain said in 
releasing their recommendations 
the administration has proposed about a 2 percent reduction in 
defense spending in each of the next five years but twice that 
amount is realistic the gop senators said 
by their calculations the current defense budget of about 300 
billion would be reduced by about 50 billion 
cohen and mccain did not address spending on every major defense 
program but did make several recommendations on bigticket items 
that have come under attack in congress 
among the proposals were limiting production of the b2 stealth 
bomber while concentrating on equipping b52 and b1 bombers with 
advanced cruise missiles 
current plans call for building 132 of the radarevading 
aircraft by 1996 at a cost of more than 70 billion but air force 
secretary donald rice said tuesday that the administration is 
weighing alternatives to that proposal 
a bipartisan group of lawmakers on wednesday released a 
congressional budget office report that concluded that scaling back 
production of the b2 will force up the cost of a single plane to 
more than 1 billion 
it confirms my very worst fears that if you stretch out the 
b2 program it simply adds billions of dollars to its costs said 
sen patrick leahy dvt a cosponsor of legislation that would 
stop procurement of the aircraft at the 15 planes now in production 
in their recommendations cohen and mccain said it was unlikely 
that congress would approve spending for two landbased nuclear 
missiles the multiplewarhead railgarrison mx and the 
singlewarhead midgetman 
while railbasing for the mx is less expensive and probably 
can be deployed sooner than the small icbm we should actively 
pursue reciprocal restrictions with the soviet union to cut back 
icbms including the railbased mx in favor of singlewarhead 
missiles such as the small icbm the lawmakers said 
cohen and mccain also proposed gearing the strategic defense 
initiative to defend against threats from nations other than the 
soviet union the nearly 4 billion approved for the antimissile 
program this year should be considered the upper limit for all 
future budgets they said 
regarding the nations naval forces the senators proposed a 
reduction in the overall number of ships and deferral of the navys 
version of the advanced tactical fighter 
in addition many of the air forces modernization programs 
including their advanced tactical fighter are inappropriate or 
exceed the requirements for regional contingencies which can be 
met with currently deployed systems with upgrades as necessary

legislation giving federal health officials 
authority to decide which diseases can be used to keep foreigners 
out of the country would allow aids to be removed as a barrier to 
immigration sponsors say 
the measure was introduced wednesday by rep j roy rowland 
dga on behalf of the national commission on aids 
the commission whose members were appointed by congress and the 
white house has urged elimination of the entry restriction for 
people with aids and infection with the human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv which causes aids 
there is no rationale for it said dr june osborn 
commission chairwoman noting that numerous international groups 
have criticized the restriction the us is being looked at with 
such astonished horror 
the federal centers for disease control recently recommended 
that aids be stricken from the list that recommendation is under 
review by health and human services secretary louis sullivan but 
officials say his department lacks authority to remove it 
the entry restriction has prompted dozens of international 
organizations and agencies to boycott the sixth international 
conference on aids in san francisco in june france and switzerland 
also have said they wont send official delegations to the meeting 
the bush administrations position on the bill was unclear 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said wednesday 
night that a decision had not been reached on whether to support 
oppose or take no position on the bill 
under a law passed in 1987 by congress hiv infection was added 
to the list of contagious diseases for which foreigners can be 
barred from entering the country 
administration officials have said they could not eliminate the 
restriction because it was imposed by congress 
rep henry waxman dcalif a cosponsor of the bill said the 
legislation would make absolutely clear that hhs has authority 
to add or remove diseases from the list based on public health 
considerations 
we should let health officials make the health decisions 
waxman said that is what we did before 1987 and that is what we 
should continue to do

ryan whites hospitalization has softened 
hearts in the town that fought to bar him from its schools where 
residents recall the painful episode as an unavoidable chapter in 
the nations education on aids 
i dont think that anybody in kokomo feels good about what 
happened said art peirce a longtime resident he described 
kokomos reaction to white as one of fear 
if it hadnt happened here it would have happened somewhere 
else it allowed the nation to focus on the problem so some good 
did come out of it that fear has certainly been modified through 
education and experience 
white 18 remained in critical condition today at riley 
hospital for children in indianapolis with an aidsrelated 
respiratory infection complicated by hemophilia doctors said 
wednesday his condition had stabilized 
white is on a lifesupport system that helps him breathe he has 
been unconscious and heavily sedated so the lifesupport system 
would function more efficiently 
his physician dr martin b kleiman said patients as ill as 
white had recovered 
hes holding on his status deteriorated in the first day or 
two and then reached a plateau any patient who is critical must 
stabilize before he can recover and ryan has stabilized kleiman 
said 
singer elton john spent a second full day with the family at the 
hospital making jokes and playing tapes of his music family 
spokeswoman carrie van dyke said 
calls from celebrities flooded the hospital switchboard 
including one from sen edward m kennedy dmass whose senate 
committee on wednesday approved a bill to spend an additional 600 
million a year for two years to combat aids 
this ones for you ryan kennedy said in a telephone 
conversation with whites mother jeannie 
residents of kokomo said they hoped white would recover some 
reflected on the communitys unsuccessful legal battle in 1985 to 
keep white out of school 
attorney david rosselot who represented the school district 
that tried to keep ryan out after it learned he had contracted aids 
from tainted blood products said he would not take a similar case 
today 
i think there is a lot more knowledge available and that 
coupled with the fact that the law has changed about how an aids 
child should be treated in the school system would lead me to say 
no he said 
rosselot defended the communitys reaction 
the only thing that was guaranteed to parents at that time 
was it was communicable and its fatal he said 
there is nobody in this community that at some point in time 
hasnt said but for the grace of god that could have been me or 
my children or my relatives and there is nothing except concern 
and sympathy for him

pan american world airways security at 
frankfurt airport in west germany remained dangerously flawed for 
more than eight months after the bombing of flight 103 federal 
aviation officials say 
all passengers flying out of frankfurt by pan am are at great 
risk said a june 1989 internal federal aviation administration 
memo read wednesday at a hearing by the presidential commission on 
aviation security and terrorism 
investigators believe terrorists smuggled a bomb in baggage 
aboard flight 103 in frankfurt before the flight switched planes in 
london and blew up over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people 
aboard and 11 on the ground 
the sevenmember commission which has been looking into the 
dec 21 1988 bombing will send president bush recommendations 
next month for avoiding future aviation terrorist attacks and 
improving government response if they occur 
top federal aviation officials testified wednesday that the 
frankfurt airport is now a model station but they acknowledged 
that serious security problems persisted there until a team of 
airline and faa officials flew to the airport last september and 
corrected the flaws 
commission chairwoman ann mclaughlin sharply criticized the faa 
for allowing the problems with pan am at frankfurt to go 
uncorrected for so long 
ive never seen anything like this in my life ms 
mclaughlin told faa administrator james busey busey who took 
office last july said part of the problem was that his agency was 
leaderless for part of the time after the bombing 
ms mclaughlin said that was an absolutely unacceptable 
excuse for failures at the airport the faa is responsible for 
overseeing security of us airlines in the united states and 
abroad 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett told the commission that the 
airline followed inspection procedures approved by the faa the 
airline is contesting 630000 in fines levied by the agency last 
september for security lapses related to flight 103 and five other 
european flights around the same time 
alleged pan am security lapses in 1989 have not been the subject 
of faa fines however 
faa associate administrator monte belger and security chief ray 
salazar testified that security problems were found at frankfurt 
during inspections in january may june and august 1989 
if i was frustrated in june i hit the ceiling in august 
said belger who received reports of the frankfurt inspections 
he said problems included failure to properly check personnel 
who serviced pan am planes at the airport failure to secure planes 
overnight and problems with ground personnel at the airport 
salazar denied sworn statements by pan am officials that he gave 
them permission before december 1988 to xray checked luggage as an 
alternative to requirements that it be matched to passengers at 
frankfurt 
salazar said that procedure was a violation of faa rules 
although pan am was never fined for it he said faa lawyers advised 
against including the charge when fines were levied 
paul hudson head of one of two organizations formed by 
relatives of flight 103 victims said the faa and pan am 
disclosures at wednesdays hearing confirmed family members 
deepest concerns about airline security 
my daughter had no chance at all hudson said in an 
interview outside the hearing room after pan ams plaskett 
testified that luggage at frankfurt was not handsearched and that 
no special procedures were used following threats against pan am 
flights to the united states

president bush is urging the white minority 
government of south africa and the black opposition to bend and 
work out a peaceful resolution of their differences 
bush called on president fw de klerk on wednesday to lift the 
state of emergency and he urged blacks to renounce violence 
especially against one another 
we stand ready to support this fragile process in any way we 
can bush said in a speech marking the anniversary of the 1968 
assassination of civil rights leader dr martin luther king jr 
there must be an end to the tragic cycle of violence a task 
that demands great courage and resolve from all south african 
leaders black and white he said in a speech to the 20th 
anniversary dinner of the joint center for political studies 
violent repression by the government has failed along with 
violence by the opponents of pretorias apartheid system of racial 
separation bush said 
most tragically the senseless violence perpetrated by blacks 
against blacks has become a major impediment to rapid progress 
toward a negotiated settlement all sides should follow the spirit 
of martin luther king jr and renounce violence he said 
he said de klerk should lift the state of emergency and free all 
political prisoners two of the conditions that would be required 
before the united states could lift economic sanctions against 
pretoria 
he praised de klerk for freeing black nationalist leader nelson 
mandela and for lifting the ban on dissident political parties 
he has invited de klerk and mandela to meet with him separately 
at the white house 
bush said he was encouraged by signs that all sides share a 
growing commitment toward negotiations to resolve the south 
african turmoil 
he said us businesses that operate in south africa also must 
work for change 
and we will make clear our strong conviction that multiparty 
democracy based on a vigorous free enterprise system represents the 
best model for any successful society he said 
bush also took the occasion to talk about the legacy of abraham 
lincoln whose emancipation proclamation freed the slaves 
he predicted that the day will come and it is not far off 
when the legacy of lincoln will finally be fulfilled at 1600 
pennsylvania avenue when a black man or woman will sit in the 
oval office 
when that day comes the most remarkable thing about it will 
be how naturally it occurs 
virginia gov l douglas wilder who was guest of honor at the 
dinner predicted that victories by black politicians like himself 
and new york mayor david dinkins will become more common 
we are not oddities we are not aberrations we are merely 
the extensions of those dreams wilder said in a reference to 
kings historic i have a dream speech

former white house adviser robert sweet has 
won senate confirmation to head the nations 70 million juvenile 
justice program 
despite opposition from several interest groups approval came 
wednesday on a voice vote 
sweet 52 figured prominently in turmoil at the education 
department eight years ago and sen john f kerry dmass had 
pushed for defeat of the nomination 
kerry said in a letter to members of the senate judiciary 
committee that sweets approach to juvenile justice is naive at 
best and in any case not congruent with the statutory requirements 
of the position to which he has been nominated 
by law the administrator of the office of juvenile justice and 
delinquency prevention in the justice department must have 
experience in juvenile justice 
critics of the nomination ranging from the washingtonbased 
liberal group people for the american way to the national 
parentteacher association complained that he lacked the required 
background 
sweet replied that his experience in education fulfills the 
requirement he is a former high school teacher and textbook 
salesman and served as an education department official and white 
house education adviser in the reagan administration 
he also was at one time the head of the new hampshire affiliate 
of the moral majority some of the opposition stems from infighting 
at the education department former education secretary terrel bell 
was critical of sweet in his memoirs the thirteenth man

surgeon general antonia novello says 
adolescents need to be taught about aids but that communities 
should decide for themselves how to do that 
what is good for iowa might not be good for new york she 
said wednesday during a meeting with reporters you always have 
to take into consideration the state where they live what is 
the morality of that particular community and what is the incidence 
of aids in that community 
she said that while some parents object to aids education 
because they feel their children are not at risk at least some 
education has to be going on 
you at least have to have the data out there she 
said but you have to make sure its done with sensitivity 
and in the cases in which monogamy and abstention doesnt 
work then the adolescent should know that the condom in the 
absence of a vaccine might be the most common available form of 
prevention 
novello said an educational aids brochure discussing condom use 
a project begun more than two years ago at the department of health 
and human services will be released soon critics had charged that 
conservatives in the department were trying to derail the 
publication because it discussed condoms

proposed legislation to end the turf battle 
between the federal agencies that oversee the stock markets and the 
futures exchanges would combine them into a single markets and 
trading commission 
a bill to merge the securities and exchange commission and the 
commodity futures trading commission was introduced wednesday but 
even supporters concede it faces rough going 
meanwhile the chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees 
the sec proposed a bill to curb abuses in the low cost high risk 
penny stock market 
the cftc which regulates the futures exchanges and the sec 
which oversees the securities industry have been squabbling over 
which agency has authority to regulate socalled hybrid 
financial products with elements of both a security and a futures 
contract 
the new agency would be phased in over a twoyear period and one 
division would still deal exclusively with physical commodities 
such as metals and oil as well as farm products like wheat pork 
bellies and soybeans 
rep dan glickman dkan who cosponsored the bill with rep 
dennis e eckart dohio said the legislation does not seek to 
create a super sec or a super cftc it is not a takeover of one 
agency by the other 
the penny stock reform bill by rep edward markey dmass 
would require that all penny stocks be traded through an automated 
quotation system

labor party leader shimon peres says he has put 
together a parliamentary majority for a new government opening the 
way for israels first leftdominated governing coalition in 13 
years 
peres on wednesday night asked parliament to convene and approve 
his new cabinet on sunday saying a major goal of his coalition 
would be pursuing usbacked efforts to open israelipalestinian 
peace talks 
he refused to say how he had broken a 6060 deadlock with the 
rightwing likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir in the 
120member legislature 
i have a majority it doesnt matter which one i have a 
majority and hope to enlarge it peres said on israel radio 
the labor party leader justified the mystery by saying it was 
necessary to crucial negotiations still under way to bring other 
small parties into the government 
likud leaders immediately cast doubt on peres claim of a 
majority meaning the war of nerves in which likud tries to block 
the labor government will go on until a vote in parliament 
we can paint the opposite picture said transport minister 
moshe katsav insisting likud still had 60 votes katsav said peres 
was exerting psychological pressure to win over wavering 
legislators 
shamir issued a statement read on television that said only 
we did what we could to maintain this government it was a walk 
on the brink 
israeli media said the deciding vote was likely to be a defector 
from likud or a religious party peres also hinted at this 
possibility by defending the idea in a state television interview 
the question is defector from what peres askedwhy for 
example should a minister who is for peace be ready to accept the 
breakdown of the peace process is this not defection 
peres 66 a former prime minister and strong proponent of a 
conciliatory stance toward palestinians was asked to form a 
government after shamirs likudlabor coalition fell in a 
parliament vote of no confidence march 15 
the government crisis was triggered by a dispute over us 
secretary of state james a baker iiis proposals for a 
palestinianisraeli meeting in cairo egypt 
peres was in favor and forced a showdown with shamir who was 
reluctant to accept bakers ideas 
since then labor has tried to bring together conservative 
religious parties and its leftwing allies for a coalition 
government 
peres fortunes turned tuesday when the ultraorthodox agudat 
israel signed a coalition agreement bringing others to the 
negotiating table 
radio reports said the likely defector was avraham sharir a 
member of a disgruntled faction within likud sharir 58 a former 
tourism and justice minister could not be reached for comment 
katsav insisted sharir was not deserting likud 
israeli newspapers said sharir has been promised the tourism 
portfolio in a peres government labor officials refused to comment 
on the reports about sharir 
the partys secretary general micha harish suggested labor had 
succeeded in luring other former likud backers saying we are 
talking about more than 61 who support labor 
other potential swing votes could come from five lawmakers in 
the ultraorthodox torah guardians party which helped peres topple 
shamirs cabinet 
the wheeling and dealing among so many tiny parties also carried 
an additional complication as three leftwing parties threatened 
in anger to refrain from joining the coalition 
amnon rubinstein of shinui said the notion of switching back and 
forth between political blocs was a problem that goes to the very 
core of israeli democracy 
in defense peres noted past examples of political defections 
including the late war hero moshe dayan who switched from labor to 
likud in 1977 to become foreign minister in former premier menachem 
begins first cabinet 
i propose that we each examine ourselves and not preach 
morality to others peres said 
he said his government would be based on two principles the 
status quo on religion and secondly the continuation of the peace 
process 
but peres could have trouble making bold peace moves with only a 
narrow majority in parliament that includes some conservative 
lawmakers 
his labor party dominated israeli government from the states 
founding in 1948 until begins victory in may 1977 the party has 
shared power with likud following two indecisive elections since 
1984

despite a federal appeals courts 
desegregation order lawyers for schools in kansas city and its 
suburbs are uncertain where more integrated education will result 
the order issued monday instructs a federal judge to draw up a 
plan for transferring students from mostly black innercity schools 
to the overwhelmingly white suburbs it orders the state to pay 
transportation costs and tuition for the students 
individual schools participation is voluntary however if they 
refuse there may be further litigation 
it would be a voluntary plan reg rowe a kansas city school 
district spokesman said this week however the language is very 
firm in the order concerning participation 
attorneys for the independence lees summit and north kansas 
city schools said their suburban districts may not be quick to 
participate 
if a district will take a thousand kids in the fall that 
would be satisfactory for all concerned said norman humphrey a 
lawyer representing the independence district but i dont know 
if any district can or would do that 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals in 
st louis told us district judge russell g clark on monday to 
draw up and implement the transfer program in line with a 
desegregation plan he ordered in 1985 
the order said the state would have to pay for up to 1200 
transfer students in the 199091 school year 2400 in 199192 
3600 in 199293 4800 in 199394 and 6000 in 199495 
i think 1200 is a very realistic number for the first year 
and another 1200 for the next year said arthur a benson ii an 
attorney for the plaintiffs in the case who include the kansas 
city school district we have surveyed the black kids and they 
want to volunteer 
humphrey said the plan might enjoy the limited success of the 
kansas city districts magnet school program also formulated under 
the 1985 desegregation plan the magnet schools have drawn about 
720 mostly white students from suburban or private schools to the 
innercity schools 
the kansas city districts enrollment of 34500 students is 
about 68 percent black 
in its ruling the appeals panel also reinstated a 
discrimination lawsuit against the independence lees summit and 
north kansas city districts 
the suit was filed in 1988 by kansas city black students who 
applied unsuccessfully to the three suburban districts the lawsuit 
had been dismissed by a federal court 
the appeals ruling put the discrimination case on hold to give 
the suburban schools time to accept the voluntary desegregation 
plan

the fiery crash of a small plane may have 
been caused by a struggle for control of the aircraft by a 
passenger dying of brain cancer and bent on suicide investigators 
say 
we thought we were investigating an air accident and it has 
turned into something else police spokesman david grimm said 
wednesday 
the twinengine plane plowed into a boulder neighborhood sunday 
setting a house and garages ablaze and killing pilot james wilford 
bill layne 56 of aurora and his passenger gordon larry hood 
45 of atlanta authorities said 
grimm said outofstate acquaintances of hoods said he had 
discussed plans to commit suicide by way of a fiery plane crash 
over colorado because of terminal cancer 
witnesses on sunday said the airplane was flying erratically 
then flipped on its side and dove to the ground it was as if a 
struggle was going on for control of the craft authorities said 
was the pilot overpowered was the pilot shot was the pilot 
stabbed we just dont know said grimm as far as we can tell 
right now the pilot just happens to be the unfortunate person who 
got hired that day 
ruth loftus of indianapolis said in a telephone interview 
wednesday that she met hood in indianapolis in december and that he 
told her about a diagnosis of brain cancer and his plans to hire a 
colorado plane and hit the pilot over the head 
loftus 32 said hood told her the cancer was eating him 
alive but would not be detectable because his body would be 
burned badly in the crash enabling his friends to collect 
insurance benefits 
i tried to talk him out of it he said he felt sorry for me 
he wanted to leave me as one of his beneficiaries she said she 
said tried to call the fbi and other law enforcement agencies but 
nobody would do anything i gave up on it 
investigators said one clue that remains to be checked is the 
mail hood apparently dropped off in granby an hour before the crash 
granby cab driver pete gallo said he drove hood around granby 
for a while sunday including three stops by the post office each 
time to mail a package or letter 
layne worked for intensive air care a denver charter company 
and had taken hood to granby about 80 miles from denver the crash 
happened on the return trip 
autopsies showed hood and layne died of injuries suffered in the 
crash and not from other causes said tom faure chief medical 
investigator of the boulder county coroners office 
police returned to the crash site wednesday to look for a weapon 
or other evidence that would support the murdersuicide theory 
the cessna 421 golden eagle streaked over the foothills west of 
boulder slammed into a tree and destroyed a vacant house four 
garages and six parked cars engulfing a large section of the block 
in flames

the iowa house has approved what would 
be the nations first statewide ban on food packaging made of 
polystyrene foam but the measure was given little chance of 
success in the senate 
the ban was adopted 4946 wednesday night it was contained in a 
bill to earmark 400 million in state lottery profits for 
environmental programs over the next decade 
polystyrene foam containers are widely used in the fastfood 
industry in cups and hamburger boxes environmentalists say the 
tough flexible plastic takes generations to break down is not 
easily recyclable takes up too much landfill space and causes 
litter 
environmentalist legislators were jubilant over wednesdays 
vote but some conceded the provision may eventually face 
rejection the senate is considered more conservative than the 
house 
its not going to cause major disruption in our lives and we 
still cant work up the courage to do it said rep darrell 
hanson 
the ban would become effective in 1991 violations would be 
punishable by a 100 fine 
its one of the most environmentally conscious things the 
general assembly has done in decades said rep dennis black 
more than a dozen cities and counties nationwide have enacted 
bans on polystyrene foam a tough flexible plastic also a 
bipartisan group of congressmen has asked for the removal of such 
foam cups from congressional restaurants

a state house subcommittee approved a 
bill that would make it illegal for newspapers to publish unsigned 
editorials and force editorial writers to disclose financial 
holdings 
a subcommittee of the house judiciary committee approved the 
measure 43 wednesday sending it to the full committee 
the bill would require editorial board members to file financial 
disclosure forms or face fines of up to 5000 
it would make it a misdemeanor for a newspaper to run an 
editorial not signed by the author 
the measure clearly infringes on the first amendment and would 
never stand up in court said barry richard attorney for the 
florida press association 
one of the 32 cosponsors of the bill democrat elvin martinez 
said the measures intent was to shed more light on newspapers 
role as opinion leaders 
the real molder of public opinion is the press martinez 
said they can take you and beat you and do anything to you and 
theyre immune i think people have a right to know if their views 
are jaundiced by some financial interest

creeping like a fiery dragon lava from 
kilauea volcano vaporized two houses and oozed toward four others 
in a rural subdivision on hawaii island 
loren lewisohn watched helplessly wednesday as the lava advanced 
and ignited the house he had built in the kalapana gardens 
subdivision 
if the lava takes away the house nothing can take away the 
experience of building it said lewisohn whose insurance made it 
easier to be philosophical im gaining a lot of respect for the 
awesome force of nature 
lava crept around a support pillar and set fire to the 
latticework an hour later all that was left of lewisohns house 
were the twisted remains of its corrugated metal roof earlier a 
house owned by john and ruth duff erupted in flames after the 
molten rock surged beneath the raised structure 
kilauea volcano has wiped out 78 residences since it began 
erupting more than seven years ago the wooden houses incinerated 
wednesday were the first kalapanaarea homes destroyed by lava 
since december 1986 
residents of 59 homes have been ordered to evacuate civil 
defense officials said all residents of the 125home coastal 
community should be ready to pack their belongings within 72 hours 
the flow had entered the community on tuesday from the west 
passing within several feet of two homes those homes remained 
standing wednesday when the lava flowed into a gulley and toward 
the duff home 
ed torrison whose house was just 20 feet from molten rock that 
was filling his back yard expected to be next 
its a shame to watch this sort of thing happen but its kind 
of exciting too he said 
torrison said he was going to watch the flow from his balcony 
until the last possible minute and take pictures as his home 
burned ive got 12 shots left he said 
the flow on the west side of the subdivision had split into two 
fingers tuesday night before merging wednesday to move down a 
street along the subdivisons western edge 
its just finding low spots said reggie okamura a 
geologist with the hawaiian volcano observatory its like water 
it will seek the quickest route downhill 
okamura said the flow probably would meander in the subdivision 
because it is a relatively level area kim said the flow had no 
direct path toward the ocean without cutting through populated 
areas

peruvians vote sunday for the next president 
of their violencetorn inflationwracked nation opinion polls say 
their choice will be mario vargas llosa one of the worlds most 
celebrated novelists 
apparently the only question is whether vargas llosa 54 will 
fall short of a majority that would force him into a runoff 
against one of the eight other candidates trailing far behind him 
in opinion polls 
regardless of whether a second round is necessary most 
pollsters predict the novelist will be writing the next five years 
of peruvian history as successor to populist president alan garcia 
vargas llosa addressed at least 50000 screaming supporters in 
front of limas palace of justice on wednesday night promising to 
do away with inflation and bring peace to the country 
he said he would make peru again a country of high culture and 
civilization 
the latest published surveys show vargas llosa candidate of the 
centerright democratic front coalition with support of around 45 
percent more than twice that of his nearest competitor luis alva 
castro of the leftofcenter governing aprista party 
the constitution requires a runoff between the top two 
votegetters if no candidate gets more than 50 percent 
nearly 10 million people are registered to vote voting is 
obligatory and violators face stiff penalties including fines 
equivalent to nearly half the minimum wage of 45 a month 
in addition to voting for president and two vice presidents 
peruvians will fill all of the senates 60 seats and congress 180 
seats 
but violence has marred the campaign and threatens to overshadow 
the election guerrillas of the maoistinspired shining path have 
mounted a bombing and assassination campaign to try to thwart it 
and say they will launch electionday armed strikes 
more than 18000 people have been killed as a result of the 
10yearold insurgency the governnment says half the country is 
under emergency rule because of the leftist rebels 
vargas llosa entered politics reluctantly in 1987 after leading 
a huge public rally against garcias plan to nationalize perus 
banks he advocates freemarket policies and foreign investment 
and promises to apply economic shock treatment to perus ravaged 
economy 
backed by a wellheeled publicity campaign vargas llosa enjoyed 
55 percent support as recently as midfebruary but his lead has 
slipped largely due to late surges by alva castro and independent 
candidate alberto fujimori 
fujimori former rector of the national university of 
agriculture was virtually unknown until two months ago pollsters 
say his appeal stems from voters mistrust of professional 
politicians 
people planning to vote for fujimori say they distrust the 
traditional conservative parties supporting vargas llosa a 
political independent 
alva castro 48 became finance minister when garcia was elected 
in 1985 he stuck with garcia through the glory years of 19851987 
when peru had the fastestgrowing economy in south america 
but the freespending policies that paid for the boom also 
brought the bust alva castro quit say critics when he realized 
the economy was running out of steam 
last year peru suffered nearly 3000 percent inflation in the 
last two years the economy has shrunk by 20 percent 
the decline in my partys government weighs on the campaign 
alva castro admitted recently but he promised to correct the 
errors that have been committed 
alva castros campaign has benefitted from an eleventhhour 
spending spree by the garcia government which has used up much of 
the treasurys remaining reserves to subsidize basic services and 
hold down inflation 
many believe the 40yearold garcia wants to position himself 
for the 1995 race and is trying to boost his image before he goes 
out he is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a 
consecutive term 
if necessary a runoff would probably be held in early june the 
exact date depends on how soon results are known from the first 
round 
ballots trickled in for weeks following the 1985 election due to 
poor communications with much of the countrys interior official 
results were not released for nearly two months 
a major concern for the democratic front coalition is whether it 
can win a majority in the congress without it vargas llosa will 
have difficulty imposing the economic austeriy measures he says are 
necessary 
the latest surveys show 10 percent of voters remain undecided 
and the candidates have been campaigning hard to win those votes in 
the final days 
one day recently vargas llosa campaigned in a lima slum 
addressed two rallies in different cities in the andes then flew 
to trujillo 350 miles up the coast 
owing to constant threats by leftist guerrillas the candidates 
often appear with little advance notice flying in and out of 
provincial towns quickly so the rebels cant plan an attack 
the tactic often leaves voters equally surprised 
they come and they go said shopkeeper rosa casa during a 
recent vargas llosa rally in chincha 125 miles southeast of lima 
theyve all been here but chincha still doesnt have water 
chincha still doesnt have electricity nothings going to 
change said ms casa 
she said she had not decided which candidate would get her vote

a suspicious fire destroyed a bus in a greyhound 
garage whose door had been welded shut authorities said the blaze 
came after the company and its striking drivers blamed each other 
for violence during the walkout 
greyhound lines spokesman kevin fry said today a flare found on 
a bus in the service garage by federal alcohol tobacco and 
firearms investigators apparently caused wednesday nights blaze 
which he characterized as arson 
district fire chief robert dillon said the fire was of a 
suspicious nature 
no one was injured in the blaze which burned about 45 minutes 
the fire was one of the most serious instances of damage during 
the monthlong strike by 6300 drivers 
we will continue to operate as we have in the past fry 
said we will not give into acts of terrorism we will just 
continue to operate period 
when firemen tried to open the garages large overhead door to 
get at the fire they found it welded shut said fire dispatcher 
frank fell firefighters had to cut through the metal door to the 
300by150foot brick garage dillon said 
fry said a padlock was missing from the door and the lights of 
several of the buses were on when firemen arrived he said 13 
trailways buses were in the garage dallasbased greyhound owns 
trailways 
fry had no estimate of damage to the bus and garage 
earlier wednesday greyhound vice president p anthony lannie 
called on the union to send officers to monitor pickets and 
withhold benefits from members who take part in violence 
certainly mere pious assertions unsupported by visible signs 
of union condemnation of illegal conduct cannot serve to relieve 
the union of its legal and moral responsibility lannie said in a 
letter to the union 
a union spokesman repeated its condemnation of the violence but 
criticized greyhound for refusing to negotiate until a week passes 
without shots being fired at one of its buses or garages 
theres no way in my view that either the company or the 
union can control these crazies said union spokesman nick 
nichols 
what theyve done is turn this whole process over to some 
crazy on the road who likes to take potshots at buses he said of 
greyhound 
greyhound has reported 31 shootings including 26 at buses 70 
bomb threats and more than 100 other incidents of violence since 
the strike began march 2 
the union says about 60 pickets have been targets of violence a 
striker in redding calif was crushed to death march 3 by a bus 
driven by a replacement 
in an effort to recapture business in the key northeast 
corridor greyhound on wednesday offered free bus trips through 
easter to passengers who dont reach their destination within 15 
minutes of the scheduled arrival time 
passengers will get a coupon good for a free round trip on the 
same route 
meanwhile a judge in new york city barred the company from 
hiring strikebreakers greyhound said it would appeal 
greyhounds drivers and about 3000 of its office and 
maintenance workers walked out over wages and job security the 
company has operated on a reduced schedule since using 
replacements and union members who cross picket lines 
greyhound operates the only nationwide bus system

about 1000 people rallied in support of a 
museum threatened with prosecution for running a photography 
exhibit deemed smut by the citys conservative lawmen 
the contemporary arts center is awaiting a court hearing friday 
on the artistic merit of the photos by the late robert 
mapplethorpe whose work last year led congress to restrict arts 
funding 
the private museums supporters carried signs declaring the city 
censornati at the rally wednesday museum curator jack sawyer 
wore a censorship is obscene tshirt over his suit 
police chief larry whalen claiming nine of the 175 photographs 
in the show are obscene said authorities havent decided whether 
to file charges against the center when the exhibit opens friday 
it is scheduled to run for six weeks 
opponents of the show including an antipornography group said 
the arts center would affront cincinnatis moral standards by 
exhibiting the photos which include some graphic depictions of 
homosexuality and sadomasochism as well as nude children 
after whalen and sheriff simon leis jr threatened to close the 
show the arts center sued to get a jury verdict on whether the 
exhibition violates community standards 
on wednesday the centers lawyers asked for a judgment without 
trial they said the entire exhibit was constitutionally protected 
because it is legitimate art that already has been shown in 
philadelphia washington and other cities 
the mapplethorpe pictures led congress last year to limit 
federal support for the arts after sen jesse helms rnc 
labeled them obscene mapplethorpe died of aids a year ago 
at the rally clyde jeffries a bartender and a member of 
citizens against artistic censorship gathered signatures on a 
petition to the city government protesting police involvement in 
the case 
its not so much the exhibit its that we dont want a few 
select individuals in the city telling us what we can do 
jeffries said this has gone on too long its embarrassing 
cincinnati authorities are among the strictest in the nation in 
enforcing antipornography codes they have closed all of the 
citys adult bookstores and movie theaters 
the arts centers director dennis barrie said the museum 
expects to sell more than 3000 tickets for the first night of the 
exhibit

police cordoned off tiananmen square today a 
holiday honoring the dead in an apparent bid to block any attempt 
to mourn protesters killed in june when the military crushed the 
prodemocracy movement 
on the nearly deserted 100acre square authorized groups of 
flagwaving schoolchildren joined soldiers for rites marking the 
annual holiday chingming 
it was the second time in a week that police kept the general 
public off the square the focal point of the studentled 
prodemocracy movement and the countrys symbolic center of power 
police guards stood at 30foot intervals around the perimeter 
police vans and jeeps were parked at strategic points and dozens of 
police with walkietalkies patrolled adjacent streets 
overseas dissidents had called on beijing students to stroll 
through the square on chingming in a silent memorial to the 
hundreds of people killed when troops stormed the city june 34 to 
drive thousands of prodemocracy students from tiananmen 
a similar appeal to walk through the square on sunday was 
blocked when authorities closed it to the public on that occasion 
for ceremonies to promote support for the asian games to be held in 
beijing next fall 
beijing schools and factories warned young people to stay away 
from tiananmen and advised them against wearing black armbands or 
the traditional white mourning flower on chingming 
the city also issued orders forbidding group memorial activities 
unless authorities granted permission 
some students said they wanted to go to tiananmen but others 
said they were fearful of potential repercussions and would stay 
away 
on the square today children wearing the yellow caps of the 
young pioneers a youth group that gives ideological training 
participated in ceremonies around the monument to revolutionary 
martyrs 
red banners on the monument called on people to honor the 
chinese revolution and to raise our chinese spirit 
multicolored flags around the square gave it a festive look but 
police yelled at foreigners who tried to take photographs 
premier li peng asked at a news conference wednesday about 
tightened security around the square said tiananmen is the symbol 
of beijing and china and that it was quite normal for police 
to take all necessary measures to preserve order there

cannot be ruled out either 
the chief investigator for the selected cancers study said 
wednesday that the findings dont eliminate an agent orange 
connection 
the study does not rule out that agent orange may cause 
cancer dr edward brann of the centers for disease control in 
atlanta told the house veterans affairs committee 
asked about this afterward brann added agent orange may 
cause cancer we dont know from this study 
in a summary of the study released last week cdc said we 
found no evidence that the increased risk of nhl nonhodgkins 
lymphoma might be related to exposure to agent orange in vietnam 
the summary noted the studys determination that sailors with 
the least exposure to agent orange were more prone than ground 
troops to get the disease and that veterans from the region that 
included the area of highest use of the herbicide had a lower risk 
these data along with evidence from other studies regarding 
the likelihood of vietnam veterans exposure to agent orange make 
it quite unlikely that the increased risk of nhl among vietnam 
veterans results from exposure to herbicides it added 
brann and cdc director william l roper told lawmakers that the 
study must be seen in the light of other scientific research 
still members of the panel questioned the reliability of the 
study in the 12yearold debate over agent orange brann himself 
said he did not approve of one major question veterans were asked 
to determine whether they had been exposed to the herbicide which 
was sprayed on jungle areas in vietnam to deny cover to the enemy 
veterans were asked if they had been in defoliated areas 
interpretations of the cdc study by scientists veterans 
organizations and the department of veterans affairs have varied 
widely because the new report looked only obliquely at agent orange 
exposure 
the original intent of the study was to look at agent orange and 
its relationship to various cancers on the assumption that 25 
percent of vietnam veterans were exposed to the herbicide 
cdc later changed course however deciding that the results 
of several studies make the premise of 25 percent exposure 
unlikely 
the study found a 50 percent higher risk of nonhodgkins 
lymphoma in all vietnam veterans compared with the overall male 
population but no significantly higher risk for five other 
cancers the va last week decided to award disability payments to 
those veterans as a result 
agent orange were sprayed in vietnam from 1965 to 1970 
according to the va the herbicide has two active phenoxy 
ingredients but the prime suspect is another ingredient dioxin 
with which it was contaminated 
dioxin is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals 
more than 36000 of the nations 26 million vietnam veterans 
have requested benefits based on claims they suffered diseases 
attributable to agent orange only three of those veterans have 
been granted disability payments for a skin condition known as 
chloracne 
roper said the air forces ranch hand study of the people 
who flew the agent orange spraying operations and handled the 
barrels of the herbicide puts the new study in the right 
perspective 
he said the men in that study were known to have been exposed to 
dioxin yet have not developed cancers 
but rep douglas applegate dohio said that study ignored the 
ground troops who ate breathed drank and sometimes slept in 
agent orange

despite chinas ratification of a new 
constitution for hong kong the territory appeared more interested 
today in the unveiling of a proposal to allow 50000 households to 
emigrate to britain 
the british government on wednesday announced details of the 
plan which paves the way for an estimated 225000 hong kong 
chinese living in its colony to be granted the right to live in 
britain 
prime minister margaret thatcher has supported the plan by 
saying britian has a solemn duty to the colony before it 
reverts to chinese rule in 1997 but the proposal faces stiff 
opposition and possibly defeat in parliament 
its unveiling grabbed more media attention in hong kong than the 
chinese legislatures vote wednesday to approve the basic law by 
which beijing will govern the territory after the change in 
sovereignty 
while the final draft of the basic law was reached several weeks 
ago details of the nationality package were previously unknown 
the intense interest in the emigration proposal also seems to 
indicate residents are increasingly looking to a future outside of 
the territory once it becomes part of communist china 
the respected ming pao daily news ran the entire text of the 
emigration selection procedure on its front page and some 
newspapers included tables that explained the point system under 
which passports would be alloted to people holding key positions in 
hong kong 
the plan would go some way to alleviating hong kongs 
emigration problem by giving key people confidence to stay in hong 
kong the hong kong government said in a statement officials 
estimate about 1000 people emigrate each week including many of 
the colonys best educated 
the legislatures special working group on nationality issued a 
statement expressing disappointment over the limited scope of the 
package but it also acknowledged that any measure designed to 
encourage people to remain in hong kong would go some way toward 
reducing the brain drain 
it added that london had the moral responsibility to provide a 
safe and secure future for the entire population of hong kong 
several newspapers also commented on the basic law which is 
designed to guarantee that the territory can maintain its 
capitalist system for 50 years and enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy after 1997 
the constitution has been widely criticized for not being 
democratic enough and for an antisubversion clause that is viewed 
as a means for beijing to assert political control over the 
territory 
hong kong people have not been that enthusiastic in the basic 
law from the very beginning its promulgation just marks the end of 
the drafting era an editorital in the chineselanguage hong kong 
economic journal said 
the sing po daily news said in an editorial that it was barely 
acceptable 
political commentator lo chikin said the final promulgation of 
the law had little impact on the colony 
the whole process of the drafting work reflected that the 
chinese leaders were not prepared to give way to a general call for 
greater democracy here he said people here believe that it is 
futile to speak on the basic law as beijing has the final say 
anyway 
the colonys legislature which functions primarily as a 
debating forum on public issues on wednesday urged china to make 
the law more democratic 
the new constitution provides for a 60seat legislature in which 
onehalf of the members would be directly elected by the year 2003 
it also sets up a complicated voting system that gives appointed 
legislators power to veto controversial bills

hollywood loved the twisted tale of the 
totos that fun couple whose murderous marriage came to light in 
1983 
boy meets girl boy marries girl husband fools around wife 
tries to kill him wife does time husband takes her back 
i love you to death the film based on the totos tale 
premieres today a nonfiction book subtitled the true story 
will be in bookstores soon and fran and tony toto in their 25th 
year of marriage are making the rounds of talk shows to be asked 
how can they still be together after no fewer than five botched 
attempts on tonys life 
a tripwire at the top of the porch steps failed to trip him as 
he stepped out a boy waiting in the bushes with a baseball bat ran 
off a wire rigged to tonys cars gasoline tank failed to spark an 
explosion a gunshot to the head failed to kill him a gunshot to 
the chest missed his heart sleeping pills merely slowed his 
metabolism and helped him survive 
the movie couple kevin kline and tracey ullman play the story 
for laughs a black comedy with a happy ending 
the story was amazing to me said director lawrence kasdan 
whose movies include body heat and the big chill it made 
me laugh and the way it ended touched me the guy was so full of 
life that you couldnt kill him and their love was so strong that 
you couldnt kill that 
the truth is remarkably similar to the script but with some 
crucial differences for instance in real life there was no 
motherinlaw instigator 
the happy ending is true last week fran toto 46 sat in her 
living room bouncing her second grandson on her lap watching a tv 
show about the movie and giggling at william hurt and keanu reeves 
playing drugaddled amateur hit men 
the way we can laugh about it now is so that we dont get 
crazy she explained the reality she said was very scary 
in the same house in 1983 fran was talking to reallife 
amateur hit men about how to get rid of tonys body he had just 
been shot in the heart or so they thought until he walked into 
the room 
whats going on tony asked the startled conspirators 
thats what the cops wanted to know too two days later police 
tipped off about the strange goingson at the house went inside 
hustled tony off to the hospital and arrested fran 
she pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit murder and reckless 
endangerment and served four years in prison anthony bruno a 
young man who worked at the totos pizza shop pleaded guilty and 
went to prison as did druggie cousins ronald and donald barlips 
tony spent 12 days in the hospital then bailed out his wife he 
had lived to forgive 
i was the bad guy i made a mistake said tony 44 who says 
his adultery was astonishingly frequent i did not deserve to get 
shot of course 
it was not my time to go god gave me another chance to live 
after 12 days i walk miraculous i walk nothing wrong with me 
thank god now what do i do now walk away from my family and say 
forget about it no no no no if i could bring my family back 
together im gonna try and now were happy 
for her part fran said i dont even really think i really 
deep down wanted to kill him it was something that just happened 
the moral is to be faithful said tony who still carries a 
25caliber slug in his skull dont cheat on your spouse be 
honest with each other and learn to communicate with each other 
i think well save a lot of marriages

the government said today that it would 
introduce legislation to outlaw capital punishment which has not 
been carried out in ireland since 1954 
abolishing the death penalty was an element of a coalition deal 
between the fianna fail party and the small progressive democrats 
party that allowed prime minister charles haughey to form a 
government after elections last summer 
current irish law provides for the death sentence for treason 
and for the murder of a member of the government a diplomat a 
foreign head of state or a police or prison officer on duty 
the proposed legislation would prescribe a mandatory sentence of 
40 years for those offenses with a possibility of release after 26 
years and eight months attempted murder of a policeman or prison 
officer would carry a mandatory sentence of 20 years 
the bill published today will be introduced in parliament when 
it reconvenes april 25 it is expected to pass overwhelmingly 
the government is satisfied that the death penalty should now 
be finally removed from the statute book and be replaced for 
treason and capital murder by a realistic custodial penalty which 
will reflect the particularly heinous and serious nature of these 
offences and act as a deterrent said justice minister ray burke 
the last person executed in ireland was michael manning who was 
hanged for the murder of a 65yearold woman 
twelve policemen have been murdered on duty since 1970 although 
some convicts in those cases were sentenced to death their 
sentences were commuted to 40 years in prison

medical experts expressed skepticism about 
reports that a licensed drug alleviated aids patients symptoms 
after it was prepared in a novel way 
researchers said data is too inconclusive to embrace the results 
reported on wednesday by dr joseph m cummins head of the 
amarillo cell culture co inc 
cummins said that alpha interferon given to patients in a wafer 
form in small amounts has reduced the symptoms of a person 
suffering from aids 
a veterinarian cummins said he began experiments with 
interferon to treat illnesses in cattle he offered a pure form of 
the drug to dr davy k koech the director of the kenyan medical 
research institute in nairobi for use on aids patients 
dr koech was desperate enough to try something new cummins 
said wednesday and he is reporting positive results with every 
patient he has treated 
in the current issue of biotechnology newswatch koech reported 
that within days of taking oral alpha interferon all of his 99 aids 
patients in the test group developed an appetite fever diarrhea 
and fungal infections and other symptoms subsided the report said 
dr anthony s fauci head of the national institutes of allergy 
and infectious disease in bethesda md said wednesday the results 
from africa were astounding and very difficult to believe but 
you have to keep an open mind 
dr sidney wolfe director of the health research group in 
washington dc said there is not enough data on the tests to 
make an opinion 
cummins agreed that more tests need to be done 
people dont have to believe it but lets test it he said 
we need to see if its a true and natural way to treat aids 
koechs research showed interferon led to a significant increase 
in the number of cd4 lymphocytes the white blood cell destroyed by 
the hiv virus which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
alpha interferon has been scrutinized for its antiviral activity 
since its discovery more than 30 years ago 
the us food and drug administration has approved alpha 
interferon to treat kaposis sarcoma a cancer that occurs commonly 
among people with aids but the drug has not generally been tested 
in pill form because of the belief it would be destroyed by stomach 
acid 
koech prepared the drug in wafer form so that small doses could 
be absorbed through the mouth 
cummins said a veterinarian called him last year seeking 
interferon to treat a big dog for leukemia cummins later 
learned the man had aids and was using the interferon to treat 
himself 
the man agreed to talk to the associated press upon condition of 
anonymiity the 47yearold man said interferon was keeping him 
alive 
i contracted aids along with three other people who split 
infected blood during a transfusion he said wednesday they 
are both dead and i am still here 
the man who said he was diagnosed with aids three years ago 
said the drug stimulated his appetite boosted his low cd4 count 
and eradicated fever blisters 
dr jordan u gutterman an interferon expert at the md 
anderson center in houston said wednesday that cummins use of 
interferon to treat animals with leukemia produced some 
intriguing results 
we are going to start studies ourselves with interferon for 
cancer treatment gutterman said more studies need to be done 
to provide confirmation for the results being reported

the state has agreed to change its policy on 
foster children placement to settle a lawsuit filed by a homosexual 
couple who contended that the policy was discriminatory 
the new policy proposal makes parenting experience not marital 
status the key factor in placement decisions state human servics 
secretary philip johnston said wednesday 
this agreement is a victory for children because it will 
serve their best interests johnston said 
the lawsuit was filed in suffolk superior court in 1986 by 
donald babets and david jean a homosexual couple from boston who 
had two young brothers taken away by state officials 
the men claimed the states policy irrationally and arbitrarily 
presumed that a traditional family setting of a husband and wife 
was the best placement for every foster child 
the policy change makes parenting experience the key factor in 
placement decisions it also says sexual orientation marital 
status race sex religion economic status education and ethnic 
background can all be weighed in a social workers decision 
the policy will continue to encourage social workers to look 
first to placing a child with relatives about 23 percent of the 
8455 children placed in foster care are currently placed with 
relatives 
anthony doniger an attorney who represented babets and jean 
through the civil liberties union of massachusetts said he was 
pleased 
the changes that the government has agreed to make in this 
policy now returns the system to what it was before this whole 
controversy was created he said 
the policy under dispute called for trying to place foster 
children in a traditional setting of a married couple with 
parenting experience couples without parenting experience or a 
single person with experience were given second priority the third 
and final group included individuals without parenting experience

denverarea residents are now being blamed on a rare virulent form 
of strep related to bacteria that cause strep throat 
the connection between strep and the 11th death was recorded 
wednesday as health officials planned more studies on the unusual 
strep including a determination of who might be at risk of 
contracting it 
anyone with strep symptoms should see a doctor to prevent the 
infection from progressing to a severe form of the disease state 
and federal health investigators said 
common strep symptoms are a sore throat swollen glands and 
fever the severe form of strep is characterized by a sudden onset 
of a very high fever chills shock and low blood pressure there 
also may be skin or muscle infections and pneumonia the 
investigators said 
usually strep bacteria cause sore throats or skin infections 
the severe form known as group a streptococcus bacteremia gets 
past the bodys primary defenses and enters the bloodstream strep 
can be treated with penicillin

for disease control has come from denver said dr ben schwartz an 
epidemiologist in the cdcs respiratory disease branch in atlanta 
in addition to colorado investigations also are being conducted 
in parts of alabama arizona california maryland and ohio where 
severe strep clusters have been reported

a former politburo member expelled from the 
communist party in a scandal over the purchase of a mercedes has 
returned the car and received his party card back tass reported 
yuri solovyov former leningrad party chief and nonvoting 
member of the partys national politburo was demoted last summer 
after a humiliating election defeat then ousted from the party in 
february for violating party ethics 
the 64yearold solovyov was reinstated at a meeting of the 
leningrad regional communist party following numerous requests 
from communists and an outpouring of public opinion tass said 
wednesday 
in a february account on his expulsion from the party the 
newspaper izvestia said solovyov purchased a luxurious mercedes 
in december for a practically symbolic price 
the sensational leningrad television program 600 seconds 
broadcast a report showing solovyovs name on an auto registration 
list and he was expelled at an emergency meeting of the leningrad 
party committee a day later 
a tass report at the time implied that solovyov had abused his 
position to obtain the car a mercedes 280s the model was last 
produced in 1985 and cost about 23000 without taxes in west 
germany 
members of the communist party elite long have enjoyed special 
privileges such as foreign cars and special food allotments but 
president mikhail s gorbachev has launched a drive to eliminate 
such favors 
ordinary soviets must wait years to purchase domestic cars or 
pay a vastly higher blackmarket price 
solovyov was reinstated after participants at last weeks party 
meeting proposed that he return the car now described as a 
secondhand mercedes to the shop and he agreed tass 
reported 
tass quoted solovyov as saying his expulsion from the party was 
a horrible injustice and one of the excesses of the system that 
has always been a nutrient medium for puppets 
at the time of his demotion solovyov one of many conservatives 
in the leningrad party was criticized for failing to implement 
reforms 
however in its account of his reinstatement to the party tass 
quoted him as acknowledging the radical changes in the soviet 
union and endorsing the new executive presidency that gorbachev has 
assumed 
i have long believed that a multiparty system can exist in 
soviet society he was quoted as saying let there be two 
three or even more parties but it is important that they should 
channel their activities into creation rather than into the 
struggle for power 
in march 1989 balloting for the national congress of peoples 
deputies parliament solovyov failed to win a seat even though he 
was the only candidate on the ballot more than half the voters 
crossed off his name 
he was replaced as regional party leader by boris gidaspov 
considered by reformers to be using his base in leningrad to try to 
unite communist party conservatives

czechoslovak vice premier jan 
carnogursky said in an interview published today that he wants his 
republic of slovakia to become an independent nation eventually 
europe is headed towards integration when it becomes a 
reality one day we would like to join it as an independent 
subject carnogursky said in comments to the trade union daily 
prace 
asked what he thought of slovak independence carnogursky 
avoided a direct answer suggesting that extremely close economic 
ties make it virtually impossible for the two republics to separate 
immediately 
right now slovakia does not even have what it takes he 
said 
but asked about slovakias role in a possible future european 
federation he made it clear independence is the ultimate objective 
you must admit it would be absurd for one federation to join 
another federation he said 
carnogurskys comments come during a time of renewed ethnic 
tensions between czechs and slovaks triggered by a recent 
parliamentary dispute over the countrys name 
slovaks who make up onethird of the countrys 155 million 
people demanded a hyphenated version czechoslovakia to 
strengthen their national identity most czechs consider the demand 
an example of petty nationalism 
to reflect the nations recent prodemocracy revolution the 
national parliament on march 30 changed the countrys name from the 
socialist republic of czechoslovakia to the czechoslovak federative 
republic 
in a compromise between the two republics parliament allowed 
the people to write the new name of the country either as the 
czechoslovak federative republic or the czechoslovak federative 
republic 
nevertheless 20000 people demonstrated in the slovak capital 
of bratislava to demand an independent slovak state 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel who is a czech and the 
premiers of both republics have expressed opposition to the idea of 
secession 
carnogursky the leader of the slovak christian democratic 
movement opposed an open campaign for independence 
we clearly distance ourselves from the demonstration i speak 
here naturally on behalf of the whole christian democratic 
movement the newspaper quoted him as saying we are going to 
insist on the hyphen but everything must happen on the basis of 
the czechoslovak republic a reasonable agreement and without 
separatist tendencies 
carnogurskys movement on tuesday formed a coalition with the 
czech peoples party and the czech christian democratic party 
signaling his desire to work with czechs who share his groups 
politics 
the ambitious alliance was the first to formally link czech and 
slovak parties in campaigning for national elections june 8 that 
will decide the shape of the government for the next two years 
they will be the first free elections in czechoslovakia in more

singer peggy lee won a summary judgment 
against walt disney productions in a lawsuit in which she claimed 
disney needed her approval before releasing the videocassette 
version of lady and the tramp 
lee provided voices for four characters and cowrote songs with 
sonny burke for the 1955 animated classic 
los angeles superior court judge william huss granted a request 
for the judgment establishing disneys liability in the case daily 
variety reported wednesday 
neil papiano lees attorney said the court will schedule a 
trial to determine damages lee is seeking 125 million 
disney has sold about 32 million cassettes of the movie at a 
wholesale value of 45 million to 50 million daily variety said 
theatrical rentals have totaled about 4025 million 
lee argued that her contract with disney which gives her the 
right to participate in transcriptions for sale to the public 
covered the videocassette release 
huss decision could affect similar contracts drawn before the 
emergence of videocassette technology 
the paper said a disney spokesman declined to say what steps 
disney might take in the case the studio cannot appeal until the 
damages trial is completed but it can seek a writ of prohibition 
that could prompt an appellate court to review the summary judgment

nasa technicians finished testing 
the 15 billion hubble space telescope today keeping pace for 
tuesdays launch aboard space shuttle discovery 
were working under a tight schedule nasa spokesman bruce 
buckingham said today but theres really nothing right now to 
indicate the 10th cant be met 
further delays in preparations however would force a 
postponement of the 847 am liftoff nasa said 
technicians completed a check of the hubbles systems and 
scientific instruments wednesday overnight they finished readying 
the telescopes computer system for launch 
on completion of the telescope tests technicians started 
routine prelaunch procedures placing explosive devices on the 
shuttles solid rocket boosters external tank and the orbiter 
itself to be used in the event of a serious malfunction buckingham 
said cooling propellants also were to be loaded today into the 
orbiters storage tanks 
testing was interrupted monday by a power outage at kennedy 
space center that knocked out air conditioning and forced the 
shutdown of heatsensitive computers work resumed tuesday using a 
backup power system 
an unrelated mishap resulted in possible damage wednesday to one 
of shuttle atlantis fuel cells the extent of damage was not 
known but it was not expected to affect atlantis next flight in 
july said nasa spokesman dick young 
because the tests on the hubble telescope were longer than 
expected the deadline for completion was moved from midnight 
wednesday to this morning to give itself extra time nasa 
rearranged launch preparations said george diller another nasa 
spokesman 
bill taylor the telescopes chief engineer said technicians 
were being extra cautious 
were doing a looktwice and then another look again to make 
sure everythings going right taylor said the telescope is 
nasas most expensive unmanned spacecraft 
discoverys five astronauts are scheduled to put the telescope 
into orbit during a fiveday mission 
the hubble will orbit 380 miles above earth for 15 years free 
of atmospheric distortion it will be capable of detecting objects 
50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best 
groundbased observatory 
astronomers will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant 
that their light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years 
one of atlantis fuel cells probably was damaged because 
excessive pressure was exerted when the unit was being prepared for 
removal for repairs nasa said fuel cells provide electrical power 
through a reaction between liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen 
atlantis returned to kennedy space center last month after a 
secret pentagon mission to put a spy satellite into orbit one of 
the fuel cell units 96 individual cells had failed a voltage test 
during a postflight checkout

iraq and three other arab countries called 
today for the establishment of a nuclearfree middle east and urged 
the international community to pressure israel to sign the 
nonproliferation treaty 
on wednesday iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz said his 
country would destroy its supply of chemical weapons if israel did 
the same and signed the 1968 treaty designed to limit the spread of 
nuclear weapons 
aziz made his remarks in a closed meeting of arab foreign 
ministers in amman an official at the talks told the associated 
press 
the arab offer comes three days after president saddam hussein 
of iraq said his nation possessed sophisticated binary chemical 
weapons and threatened to destroy half of israel if his country 
were attacked 
the disclosure followed the arrest in london last week of 
several people accused of attempting to smuggle usmade nuclear 
bomb triggers to iraq baghdad has denied that it is trying to 
build an atomic bomb 
in reaction to the arrests the european parliament called today 
on the 12 member states of the european community to ban the export 
to iraq of all material essential for the production of weapons 
of mass destruction and for their delivery 
the resolution called for a meeting of the un security council 
to discuss the threats posed by the iraqi regime to world 
security 
the resolution stated that the arrests in london confirm the 
iraqi regimes intention of equipping itself with nuclear weapons 
despite having signed the international nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty 
in todays meeting in amman the foreign ministers of egypt 
jordan north yemen and iraq issued a communique calling for a 
nuclearfree middle east and the prohibition of chemical weapons 
our countries all of them signatories of the 
nonproliferation treaty are keen to keep the middle east region a 
nuclearfree zone the communique said 
israel is widely suspected of being the middle easts sole 
nuclear power 
the four countries called on the international community to 
pressure israel to abide by the international will and join the 
global nuclear disarmament accord 
the 22yearold pact requires participating nations to agree 
that nuclear energy and research will not be used for military 
purposes 
the arab ministers also said that all kinds of destructive 
weapons including nuclear chemical and biological should be 
prohibited in order to guarantee regional and international 
security 
but they defended iraqs production of chemical weapons saying 
that in light of the continuous chemical and nuclear threats 
which the arabs confront it was necessary to defend ourselves 
an israeli foreign ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said there was nothing new in the statement 
it is a position they have expounded for some time he said 
in an unusual interview published today in an israeli newspaper 
syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa echoed the arab ministers 
offer for disarmament 
if there was a sincere desire for peace and security then 
israel should agree to declare the middle east an area clear of all 
destructive weaponry sharaa told the masscirculation hadashot 
newspaper 
syria is one of israels most implacable foes and syrian 
officials generally avoid all contacts with the jewish state

fighting died down today after gen 
michel aoun and warlord samir geagea accepted a ceasefire called 
by clergymen who said the warfare threatened christians very 
existence 
police said overnight howitzer and mortar duels between the 
rival christian forces killed two people and wounded three in east 
beirut and north of the city before the big guns fell silent at 
daybreak 
but sharpshooters of aouns army and snipers from geageas 
lebanese forces militia continued to skirmish in the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
in moslem west beirut president elias hrawi said he would heed 
geageas appeal that the presidents 22000man mainly moslem army 
led by gen emile lahoud take over army barracks in the enclave 
but it was not believed he had the firepower to dislodge aoun nor 
were there any signs that syrias army in lebanon would back a 
foray in the christian enclave 
the inconclusive showdown for mastery of the enclave normally 
home for about 1 million christians has killed 841 people and 
wounded 2298 since it broke out jan 30 numerous ceasefires have 
been declared and broken 
police say at least onefourth of the enclaves population has 
fled to safer areas in lebanon and neighboring countries to escape 
the savage fighting that has inflicted damage estimated at 1 
billion 
aouns television station located in beiruts eastern suburb of 
hazmiyeh resumed its broadcasts late wednesday night after 
repairing the antenna that was hit early in the evening during 
fierce artillery exchanges with geageas men the station was off 
the air for five hours 
geagea and aoun in separate statements said they accepted a 
ceasefire in line with the plea from 20 maronite catholic 
clergymen who met wednesday with patriarch nasrallah sfeir at his 
seat in bkirki north of beirut 
in their peace bid the 16th ceasefire call in the 66day 
confrontation the clergymen told geagea and aoun their war 
threatened the christians very existence in lebanon and the 
orient 
the maronite clerics said continued fighting between aouns 
19000 troops and the 6000 militiamen of geagea would finish off 
the christians 
the christians fate should not be decided by two guns 
confronting each other and spreading horror death and 
destruction the clergmen said in their statement copies of 
which were delivered to geagea and aoun 
the statement was released after geagea called on lahoud to 
take over all the army barracks in lebanon 
geagea in a radio interview said he was fully prepared to hand 
over three army barracks in the kesrouan and byblos provinces 
dominated by his militia north of beirut to lahoud within the 
framework of a comprehensive plan that puts all army barracks in 
lebanon under the command of gen lahoud 
i urge gen aoun to hand over his barracks to gen lahoud 
he added 
aoun geagea hrawi and lahoud are maronites the main christian 
sect that has controlled key government posts parliament the army 
command and the judiciary since independence from france in 1943 
aoun has rejected hrawis nov 24 election as president by 
lebanese legislators meeting under arab league auspices he 
complains the peace plan under which hrawi was elected does not 
contain a specific timetable for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 
troops in lebanon as part of a peacekeeping mandate aoun contends 
the syrians abrogated that mandate by siding with the moslems 
aoun has refused to withdraw from the shellwrecked presidential 
palace in beiruts eastern suburb of baabda and also maintained 
control of the adjacent defense ministry offices in yarze this has 
forced hrawi and lahoud to set up temporary headquarters in 
syrianpoliced moslem west beirut

the national council of churches has come under 
fire for a prayer for middle eastern peace that is branded by some 
religious leaders as a propalestinian political statement 
the national council of christians and jews based in new york 
said the sevenparagraph prayer from jerusalem appears 
extremely provocative 
it recalls the worst uses of the christian holy week as a club 
against jews said conference official elliott wright 
the clamor stems from references which critics say appear to 
accuse israel of denying palestinians their civil and human rights 
and to blame the jewish state for the violence of the palestinian 
uprising 
we see there is no peace and that people remain in agony and 
suffering the prayer reads in part free them from oppression 
restore to them the right of life and to independence in their own 
land just as other nations enjoy this right 
the ncc an umbrella group of 31 protestant and orthodox 
churches had distributed the prayer to its members for reading in 
churches this sunday which is palm sunday 
the prayer was prepared by the middle east council of churches 
a coalition of 24 orthodox catholic and protestant churches in 
the middle east 
rabbi james rudin director of the american jewish committees 
office of interreligious affairs labeled parts of the prayer 
malicious slander

a west virginia city shut down its water intakes on the ohio 
river and two ohio cities intensified treatment of water from the 
river as a fuel spill flowed slowly downstream today 
at least 75000 gallons of diesel oil gasoline and kerosene 
spilled into an allegheny river tributary upriver from pittsburgh 
on friday forcing pennsylvania cities along the river to shut 
water intakes the allegheny and monongahela rivers meet in 
pittsburgh to form the ohio river 
at east liverpool ohio water superintendent glenn woodward 
said the worst of the spill appeared to have passed by his city 
wednesday he said fuel concentrations peaked around 3 pm at 14 
or 15 parts per billion that was down to a normal level of 4 ppb 
early today 
the city treats about 3 million gallons of river water a day 
woodward said 
in steubenville ohio 25 miles downstream from east liverpool 
assistant public works director bill fabian said the spill had 
apparently arrived but lab tests of the water were not completed 
this morning 
two water intakes near the rivers surface were closed at east 
liverpool those deeper in the river remained open to draw water 
for the city of 7000 people 
its here but you cant tell it by sight or smell we started 
accelerated treatment of water at 3 yesterday afternoon and will 
continue until sunday to make sure we get the leading and tail 
edges of it fabian said 
across the river in weirton wva workers shut down the water 
intake pump wednesday said ken capozzoli a maintenance operator 
at the city water treatment plant 
we dont really know how long the wells can supply us but 
well do fine for the couple of days it should take for the spill 
to pass capozzoli said 
downtstream in wheeling wva city workers prepared to mix 
activated carbon with river water to absorb any remaining fuel 
they had pretty good luck using the carbon to remove the oil 
up in pittsburgh said phil kowalski supervisor of wheelings 
water plant we dont anticipate that people will notice any 
difference we may have to slow down our treatment process but the 
reservoirs will pick up the slack and there shouldnt be any drop 
in pressure 
the water supplies of some communities on the river will not be 
affected by the spill wellsville ohio about six miles south of 
east liverpool draws its water from a reservoir fed by springs 
said mayor nunzio lombardozzi 
in beaver county pa the midland water authoritys treatment 
plant reopened its intake valves wednesday said dan zuppe the 
chief filter plant operator the system was operating at about half 
its normal pumping volume he said

the timber industry predicts economic 
catastrophe if the government follows recommendations to save the 
northern spotted owl from extinction by reducing logging in the 
northwests old forests 
what weve been presented today is a program that forces a 
very stark choice between owls and people said mark rey 
executive director of the american forest resource council in 
washington dc it obviously provides a maximum advantage for 
the owls with significant impacts on the people 
a panel of government scientists said logging must stop in a 
large section of federal forests if the northern spotted owl is to 
be saved the stands of old trees in the northwest are the primary 
habitat for the owl 
the committee on wednesday recommended a reduction of about 25 
percent in the allowable cut of timber in national forests and a 30 
percent to 40 percent reduction on bureau of land management lands 
john hampton president of willamina lumber co and chairman of 
the northwest forest resource council said initial estimates 
indicate up to 60000 jobs in the northwest would be lost as a 
direct or indirect result 
some 4 to 5 million acres will be set aside under the 
recommendation for owl habitat at an estimated cost of 95 million 
in timber for each pair of spotted owls he said at a news 
conference 
the american forest resource council estimated 9000 jobs would 
be lost in the region 
hampton said his groups best hope is to get the bush 
administration and congress to consider the impact implementing the 
recommendation would have on the industry 
the oregon lands coalition a proindustry group condemned the 
environmentalists who have fought logging 
the preservationists have done their deadly work coalition 
chairwoman valerie johnson said 
environmentalists were elated by the report 
this confirms what environmentalists have been saying for a 
number of years said larry tuttle of the wilderness society 
that the spotted owl is in grave danger and by extension 
therefore the ancient forest is also in grave danger 
the panels recommendations are expected to weigh heavily in the 
us fish and wildlife services decision on whether to list the 
owl as a threatened or endangered species such a designation would 
mean further restrictions on logging in oldgrowth forests that 
provide the bulk of timber harvested in the region 
a decision on designating the owl a threatened species is 
expected by june 23 
in forks wash jerry leppell president of the american logger 
solidarity committee said one government study estimated that a 30 
percent cutback in logging would lead to 1000 lost jobs and 800 
families leaving the town 
we all like spotted owls he said theres no problem with 
spotted owls the gripe weve got is with preservationists i think 
theyre overeducated and they drive through and judge us within 
three hours instead of living here all their life

the first noncommunist parliament in east 
german history convened today and began replacing four decades of 
stalinist rule with a democratic government 
in the hall where communist lawmakers once meted out edicts 
lawmakers chosen in the nations first free elections on march 18 
began the process of forming a government that could be the 
countrys last before unification with west germany 
forty years of difficult times have ended in this moment 
said lothar piche 63 the eldest member of the new parliament as 
he called the session to order in the palace of the republic god 
support our german fatherland 
the 400member parliament was expected to empower christian 
democrat leader lothar de maiziere to build a new government and to 
decide whether to form a commission to investigate allegations that 
some new parliament members worked with the dreaded secret police 
in its first action the 390 new leaders who attended the 
session elected physician sabine bergmannpohl a christian 
democrat as president of the parliament 
among those seeking the post were outgoing communist premier 
hans modrow who leads a rebuilt prodemocracy party that finished 
a distant third in the march elections he finished third in the 
voting for parliament president behind social democrat reinhard 
hoeppner 
the parliament also created an office of president to be a 
ceremonial head of state as east germanys new government was 
being shaped to mirror that of west germanys 
dr bergmannpohl is to serve as head of state until a president 
is elected by parliament de maiziere will likely be the premier 
or prime minister 
dr bergmannpohl called on lawmakers to work with their 
counterparts in west germany to merge their nations and to bring 
the capital of a single germany back to a united berlin 
the parliament also formally abolished the old communist 
presidium the council of state 
de maiziere will lead talks in the coming days on forming a new 
cabinet 
if de maiziere is successful in bringing together the disparate 
political groups parliament will then reconvene on april 11 and 
vote on his cabinet nominations said martin kirchner a 
highranking christian democrat 
de maiziere leads a christian democratled conservative alliance 
that has been trying to form a coalition with the leftleaning 
social democrats and a smaller group of liberal lawmakers 
his alliance for germany won the most seats in the march 18 
elections but it needs a broad coalition to ensure the twothirds 
vote needed in parliament to enact constitutional changes required 
for unification 
kirchner predicted that a government may be formed quickly so 
that this nation is no longer devoid of government 
backroom political wrangling and charges that newly elected 
lawmakers had ties to the secret police of the ousted communist 
regime have taken the steam out of the reunification process 
a communistled caretaker government that followed the ousted 
regime of hardliner erich honecker in october has been running the 
country 
the alliance for germany favors rapid reunification while the 
leftleaning social democrats favor a more gradual pace with each 
east german state to decide independently on a merger 
nevertheless swift reunification is demanded by voters who 
backed de maizieres coalition overwhelmingly after he promised a 
quick merger as a means to western prosperity 
even acting social democrat party leader markus meckel said 
wednesday he favors reunification as quickly as possible 
the negotiations quickened this week after west germanys 
central bank said it was recommending a 21 conversion of east 
german marks to west german marks as part of a currency union 
east german parties united in opposition to that proposal 
calling for a direct 11 conversion to ease the withdrawal pains of 
unemployment and high prices as east germany sheds its socialist 
system 
west germany said wednesday it wants a pact on monetary union by 
early next month but the east germans are expected to be tough 
negotiators once serious talks begin 
de maizieres opposition to the west german bundesbank proposal 
raised his stature with the smaller parties which have often 
described him as a puppet of west german chancellor helmut kohl 
but the social democrats still are opposed to the more 
conservative elements in de maizieres alliance much of the 
wrangling has been over the distribution of cabinet posts in a new 
government 
the social democrats who favor more emphasis on environmental 
and social issues have asked for the education foreign and labor 
ministries

defense secretary dick cheney urged congress 
today to give the pentagon more leeway to manage its budget 
contending that less intense congressional oversight would save 
money and improve defense programs 
we can do much to improve defense management by ourselves we 
could accomplish far more with the cooperation of capitol hill 
cheney said in a statement 
the defense secretarys recommendations were contained in a 
41page policy paper sent to congress today it recommended many 
changes in the way the defense department manages its programs and 
personnel as well as changes in the congressional budgetwriting 
process 
among cheneys recommendations was one that congress appropriate 
defense spending for twoyear periods instead of every year that 
would help stabilize pentagon programs by forcing more clearcut 
choices on spending priorities the report said 
if next years budget debate is only a few days away from the 
end of this years debate there is no reason to accept a negative 
decision as final the report said 
on wednesday cheney announced the pentagon was reassessing the 
need for the navys seawolf nuclear attack submarine and the 
arleigh burkeclass destroyer in light of disarmament moves and 
political changes under way in the soviet union 
in a speech to the american society of newspaper editors he 
said the move meant the pentagon was determined to readjust 
american defenses in response to global changes 
as circumstances change we will adjust the kinds of naval 
forces we need cheney said we are now looking at a smaller 
navy than we were in the early 1980s 
the united states should not however give up its global 
maritime superiority he said 
well need to control the seas regardless of what happens in 
moscow cheney said in part because the american economy is 
being more interwoven with the world economy and thus is 
increasingly dependent on the free flow of goods on the seas 
the defense secretary earlier ordered reviews of other major new 
weapons systems including the air forces b2 bomber the armys 
new light helicopter and the strategic defense initiative research 
on an antimissile defense he said results from those reviews will 
be completed within the next few weeks 
meanwhile two republican members of the senate armed services 
committee today called on president bush to limit production of the 
b2 and delay the advanced tactical fighter as part of additional 
cuts in defense spending 
we believe that the united states can meet its defense 
requirements with budget levels lower than those proposed by the 
administration said sens william cohen of maine and john mccain 
of arizona 
the administration has proposed about a 2 percent reduction in 
defense spending in each of the next five years but twice that 
amount is realistic the gop senators said by their calculations 
the current 300 billion defense budget would be reduced by about 
50 billion 
cheney gave no details of the navy program reviews a department 
spokesman bob hall said today the internal review would 
reconsider whether the seawolf subs and the burke destroyers meet 
the navys requirements taking into account such factors as 
maritime strategy cost schedules and performance 
the administration is proposing to cancel many smaller weapons 
systems and plans to cut about 50000 men and women from the 
21millionmember armed forces in 1991 the army and air force 
have taken the brunt of the reductions but cheneys remarks to the 
newspaper editors indicated the navys share of the pain may grow 
a scaling back of the navys attack submarine fleet already was 
in the wind last month vice adm daniel cooper told a house panel 
that budget constraints would limit deployments to fewer than 80 by 
the year 2000 the goal has been 100 by that date 
the first seawolf nuclear attack submarine is scheduled for 
completion in mid1995 it is designed to be quieter and have more 
weapons greater speed and more capability to kill soviet subs than 
the existing los angelesclass attack sub 
the navy is planning to buy 12 seawolfs at an average projected 
cost of 157 billion apiece 
the seawolf has been criticized for being too expensive but 
adm carlisle trost chief of naval operations wrote recently that 
the sub is required in order to ensure that we maintain an 
acceptable level of risk in the face of the continuing 
modernization of the soviet submarine force 
the burke guidedmissile destroyers are to replace the adams and 
farragut class destroyers that were built in the 1960s the 
pentagon claims the burke ships will be the most advanced and 
powerful destroyers ever built they are to be equipped with the 
hightech aegis aircraft tracking system and sophisticated missiles 
the navy plans to buy 33 of the destroyers at an average 
projected cost of 820 million apiece 
the navy is scheduled to take possession of the first destroyer 
in february 1991 eight of the new ships are under construction and 
the navy in february awarded contracts valued at a combined 11 
billion to build two more

a drawing pen for the blind and partially blind 
won the grand prize today at the annual geneva invention fair 
the two frenchmen who developed the pen originally intended it 
to be used as a tool for teaching blind youngsters computer science 
but jack sagot a special education teacher in paris and gerard 
pavard a teacher of handicapped children near the city of nantes 
eventually developed it for general use by the blind in drawing 
graphics and the production of documents in the braille alphabet 
the pen has a special ink that forms a slight relief or ridge 
after drying for a few minutes the raised patterns can easily be 
detected by people who touch them the inventors say 
the drawing paper can be heated to heighten the relief for 
children just starting to read braille pavard said 
fair organizers claimed the invention is the biggest 
breakthrough in the field since the 1829 invention of braille 
which uses patterns of embossed dots to signify letters 
an international jury at the weeklong fair chose the pen as top 
entry among some 1000 inventions from 25 countries 
it was not immediately clear if the inventors would receive a 
cash prize

the highway tobacco and alcohol industries 
opened a campaign thursday against using higher federal excise 
taxes to reduce the budget deficit 
raising taxes on gasoline cigarettes beer wine and liquor 
would impose an unfair burden on lowerincome americans the 
coalition against regressive taxation told a news conference 
a study prepared for the coalition by the peat marwick policy 
economics group concluded that lowerincome families already pay 
five times as high a share of their income on excise taxes as 
higherincome americans do 
if there is to be a tax for deficit reduction said thomas 
j donohue president of the coalition and of the american trucking 
associations then all the companies and all the citizens should 
share in that tax 
although president bush says he opposes any tax increase for 
deficit reduction several members of congress are urging higher 
excise taxes for that purpose 
for example rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
house ways and means committee has outlined a comprehensive plan 
that includes higher taxes for gasoline beer wine and cigarettes 
as well as increased income taxes and a oneyear freeze on social 
security benefits 
the peat marwick report said that while a 20billionayear 
boost in excise taxes would raise the tax burden of the average 
american by 19 percent the onethird of people with the lowest 
incomes would see a 65 percent increase

the head of the federal program that 
distributes federal aid to libraries and for scholarly work told a 
senate panel thursday that the controversy over arts financing has 
hindered her agencys work 
the system we had in place before was much more 
satisfactory lynne v cheney told the labor and human resources 
subcommittee on education arts and humanities 
cheney chairman of the national endowment for the humanities 
said changes that congress ordered last year in the grants process 
have given the endowment veto power over grants known as subgrants 
under the subgrant process a foundation or other organization 
receives a grant from the endowment and parcels out the money for 
various projects the group receiving the overall grant judges who 
should receive money from it and the endowment then passes on the 
subgrant 
when congress last fall appropriated funds for the humanities 
endowment and its companion national endowment for the arts it 
said the subgrants should be more tightly controlled 
the condition was a result of the political furor over two 
controversial exhibits funded by the nea the restrictions do not 
cover subgrants awarded by state humanities councils 
both the house and senate are holding hearings this year on 
renewing the national foundation on the arts and the humanities 
the parent agency for the arts and humanities endowments 
cheney told the senate panel that there never has been a 
controversial grant award by the humanities endowment supporters 
of the arts endowment say only 20 of the 85000 grants it has 
awarded have been controversial 
im not seeking restrictive language she said in a 
reflection of the bush administrations opposition to content 
restriction in arts grants there simply is no rationale for 
such language she said

a leader of the prodemocracy movement 
that was crushed in china last june believes the campaign might 
have succeeded if it had come after the uprisings in eastern 
europe a newspaper reported thursday 
the activist chai ling 23 escaped to france this week with 
her husband feng congde after 10 months on the run in beijing 
both were on a list of 21 student leaders sought by chinese 
communist authorities who said the prodemocracy movement was a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the couple has remained in hiding 
we might have had a good chance to succeed if our movement had 
come after the recent prodemocracy trend in eastern europe the 
masscirculation china times quoted chai as saying in an exclusive 
interview 
chai said that while hiding in china she heard about eastern 
european developments in radio broadcasts from the voice of america 
and the british broadcasting corp 
the colossal changes in eastern europe surprised and 
encouraged us anyway we had made the first step and it was a 
correct step she added

european revolutions started in october in east germany and soon 
spread to other soviet bloc states ending decades of communist 
domination

states in the industrial midwest seemingly on 
their last legs as the 1980s began are now flexing their economic 
muscles while plains and rocky mountain states show little sign of 
recovering from the last recession a private research group 
reported thursday 
the study by the corporation for enterprise development a 
research and consulting organization also said states on both 
coasts generally are in good economic health and those in the 
south are improving but still have a long way to go 
those states whose economies are healthy or improving have 
invented their own development policies in a quiet revolution 
rather than wait for federal solutions to evolve according to the 
study 
the story is that while washington continues to be stalemated 
over what we ought to do over foreign competition the states have 
gone ahead and invented their own strategies corporation 
president doug ross said 
the findings are including in the fourth annual development 
report card for the states financed by corporations labor 
unions and private foundations in it the states are graded 
according to economic performance business vitality economic 
capacity and government policy 
the study said that for more than 40 years states relied on 
smokestack chasing or luring outofstate businesses with 
incentives and subsidies to build their economies 
by the late 1970s that approach no longer worked as dramatic 
changes in communication transportation and technology often 
made it impossible for us businesses to meet overseas 
competition the study said 
states thus began creating homegrown strategies that 
focused mostly on new and existing businesses and now encourage 
and support indigenous development modernizing instate 
businesses easing their expansion and product development 
educating their workers and facilitating startups ross 
explained 
here is how the corporation views the various regional economies 
industrial midwest recovering from long decline condition 
still improving satisfactorily 
less than 10 years after the early 1980s recession nearly did 
them in the rust belt states are resurgent it may never again 
be the worlds industrial center but it is showing signs of its 
old muscle pennsylvania with two as and two bs this year leads 
the region other great lakes states earn mostly good or average 
grades overall the regions economic performance is getting 
stronger and it shines in state policy with all as and bs 
recent investments in technology infrastructure and skill 
improvements as well as policy innovations in development finance 
and industry modernization have paid off in new economic strength 
for these states ross said 
northeast and west coast continuing in good economic health 
condition stable with some troubling symptoms 
the northeast and pacific states continue to be the nations 
strongest economically of the 13 states with no more than one 
grade below b this year nine are in these two regions 
california connecticut maryland massachusetts new jersey new 
york oregon rhode island and vermont 
but ross cautions that despite their recent prosperity these 
states show some troubling signs the northeast is struggling with 
labor shortages the pacific wrestling with the decline of the 
timber industry we already see economic slowdowns here and 
significant defense cutbacks on the horizon could further shock 
their systems 
south surprisingly healthy getting healthier condition 
guarded 
of the 13 states with no as or bs on any index this year only 
five are in the south real progress is obvious in state policy 
although limited resources slow the speed of change though most 
southern states earn cs in policy several still earn ds but 
virginia rates a b 
progress has been heartening in the south but the road to 
recovery is still long and uphill ross said 
plains and rocky mountain states weak static condition 
critical 
states in the great plains and intermountain west with the 
exception of utah are still lingering from the early 1980s 
recession of the 13 states that received no report card grade 
above a c eight are in these two regions arizona idaho 
montana nebraska new mexico north dakota south dakota and 
wyoming 
few are working aggressively to revive their economies indeed 
four of the five fs in state policy are in these two regions along 
with many ds with the notable exceptions of iowa and oklahoma 
which merit as 
these states are essentially the couch potatoes of economic 
innovation ross said it seems they are simply waiting for the 
next economic boom to blot out the current bust it is a wait that 
will be in vain given the enormous structural changes affecting 
our economy

pvt gerald pierre fled the american airlines airbus a300 around

the white house renewed a veto threat today 
against a major bill to combat job discrimination saying we are 
for civil rights legislation we are simply not for that bill 
the measure is headed for senate action after sailing through 
committee with support from lawmakers of both parties 
we need to send a clear message to the american people and the 
message is that we will not tolerate a retreat on civil rights 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said as the senate labor and 
human resources committee approved the bill wednesday 115 
civil rights organizations have been calling for such a measure 
as a way of overcoming six supreme court decisions last year that 
they say represent a setback in the fight against discrimination in 
the workplace 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated the veto 
threat saying we are interested in correcting problems which 
arose from last years supreme court cases we are for civil 
rights legislation we are simply not for that bill 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a letter to sen edward 
m kennedy dmass that he and other senior advisers would urge 
bush to veto the bill if it reaches his desk 
thornburgh said the administration opposes as inconsistent 
with equal opportunity any legislation that would encourage quota 
systems or otherwise divide our society along racial lines 
the administration has been calling for a more modest version 
civil rights forces said they already have enough votes to win 
in the senate where the bill now has 40 cosponsors and the house 
as well 
the bill would ban racial discrimination in all workplace 
activities including hiring promotion demotion and firing it 
would bar onthejob harassment which the supreme court has said 
is not covered by federal law 
under the bill employers would be held liable for actions in 
which discrimination was a motivating factor even if those 
decisions had been made for nondiscriminatory reasons it also 
would provide means of locking in settlements in civil rights suits 
that otherwise might be reopened later 
the bill would expand the right of employees to challenge a 
seniority system adopted for discriminatory reasons 
perhaps the bills most controversial feature would effectively 
negate a supreme court decision last year involving a salmon 
cannery in alaska until that ruling those showing statistical 
evidence in court of hiring discrimination could force employers to 
change their practices or justify them on the basis of business 
necessity 
in the socalled wards cove decision however the court said 
that those filing discrimination suits must show that such hiring 
practices were not based upon business necessity 
in his letter to kennedy thornburgh said the administration 
is determined to help root out racial bias and bigotry but he 
said that if the measure were presented to the president in its 
current form i and other senior advisers would recommend that it 
be vetoed 
sen orrin hatch rutah told the committee the bill would go 
much further than overturning the supreme court decisions 
it is in my view a radical reworking of our nations basic 
employment antidiscrimination law hatch said hiring the most 
qualified person will not be a satisfactory explanation if an 
employers numbers are not right 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan said the panel should find 
harmony and conciliation in the workplace but that under the 
legislation we simply add litigation 
several other republicans however are cosponsors of the 
measure 
if this committee did not move and this congress did not move 
on this issue this administration would not either said sen 
david durenberger rminn who voted in favor of the bill along 
with sen james jeffords rvt 
durenberger said his remark did not reflect on the 
administrations commitment to civil rights but he applauded the 
lawmakers for putting the pressure on the rest of this process

a member of the soviet parliament said thursday 
that about 320 billion will be needed to cope with the 
consequences of the chernobyl nuclear disaster during the next 10 
years 
yuri shtsherbak vice chairman of the supreme soviets 
commission on environment and nuclear energy told reporters an 
international fund should be set up to assist the soviet union 
shtsherbak said almost 4 million people are still living in 
regions with higher than normal levels of radiation the accident 
occurred april 26 1986 at the power plant in the soviet ukraine 
shtsherbaks commission came up with proposals at the request of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev they include a call for the 
immediate evacuation of more than 100000 people in the most 
contaminated areas of byelorussia the ukraine and the russian 
republic according to shtsherbak 
he said the thyroid glands of more than 15 million people 
including 160000 children were exposed to important levels of 
radiation after the chernobyl disaster in the ukraine the 
incidence of thyroid cancer was expected to increase as much as 
10fold shtsherbak said 
there are also considerably more cases of leukemia and immunity 
deficiencies we call that chernobyl aids he added we 
believe this is only the beginning 
people in the affected region are living under great nervous 
stress socially politically and psychologically he said 
shtsherbak said his commission proposed that the government 
issue a worldwide appeal for contributions to an international 
chernobyl relief fund the estimate of needed funds over the next 
decade was based on surveys made by the three republics affected 
according to official figures 31 people were killed in the 
chernobyl accident caused by an explosion at the no 4 reactor of 
the fourunit plant 
by 1989 officials said more than 250 people who had worked at 
the plant or who were involved in the postaccident cleanup had 
died of various causes not all of them necessarily traceable to 
radiation exposure

in a major setback to peace 
hopes leaders of four black homelands pulled out of talks today 
with president fw de klerk on ending unrest and dismantling 
whiteminority rule 
constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen said four of 
the six invited homeland chiefs withdrew under pressure from 
opposition groups he said the pressure amounted to 
intimidation but gave no details 
african national congress leader nelson mandela arrived today in 
cape town for a separate meeting with de klerk to consider ways to 
revive negotiations on ending white minority rule 
meanwhile the government in venda one of the four nominally 
independent homelands which were not invited to the de klerk talks 
was overthrown in a military coup today according to a radio 
announcement by coup leader gabriel ramushwana the deputy chief of 
the venda defense force said he wanted the tiny homeland which was 
declared an independent republic in 1979 to be reincorporated into 
south africa 
mandelas discussion with de klerk may lead to rescheduling the 
canceled april 11 talks between the government and exiled anc 
leaders said patrick lekota spokesman for the ancaffiliated 
united democratic front 
we are hopeful that the state president will be able to 
respond in such a way as for the movement to be able to salvage the 
discussions that were scheduled for april 11 lekota said 
kwazulu chief minister magosuthu buthelezi and kwa kwa chief 
minister tk mopeli turned up for the talks buthelezi heads the 
zulu tribes conservative inkatha movement and is seen as mandelas 
main black rival 
de klerk met first with buthelezi and heads of the majority 
parties in the white asian and colored or mixedrace parliaments 
allan hendrickse head of the labor party in the colored 
parliament said mandela had asked him to pull out of the talks 
with de klerk he said he would attend but ask de klerk to adjourn 
until all homeland leaders could attend 
south africa has three parliaments for whites asians and 
colored voters there is no parliament for blacks who do not have 
the vote 
the homelands were set up by the whiteminority government as 
separate areas for blacks most black opposition groups including 
anc elements oppose the homelands conservative governments and 
have helped organize resistance against them 
the anc and other opposition groups want the homelands 
reintegrated into south africa the regions have been hit by major 
unrest and the military has seized power in transkei and ciskei 
four homelands are now officially independent nations though 
they are recognized by no foreign government and six are 
classified as selfgoverning and were invited to todays talks 
the south african government says the homeland leaders must be 
included in negotiations on the countrys future 
government leaders had hoped todays meetings would help revive 
efforts to start fullscale negotiations on sharing political power 
with blacks de klerk has pledged to end apartheid 
talks set for next wednesday collapsed when the anc pulled out 
to protest the police killing of nine blacks during a march 26 
demonstration in the black township of sebokeng outside 
johannesburg the anc said it would agree to talks once the 
government brought the police under control 
mandela later agreed to a private meeting with de klerk he said 
he wanted to discuss ways to end the wave of violence across south 
africa that has claimed hundreds of lives in recent weeks 
mandela told a news conference wednesday he could not say when 
fullscale talks with the government might be rescheduled 
that will depend on the result of the discussions we are going 
to have tomorrow he said adding that the anc remained committed 
to negotiations 
we would not work so hard over three years to secure a meeting 
between the anc and the government if we were now going to turn 
around and refuse to talk mandela said 
he and other anc leaders have charged police with favoring 
buthelezis relatively conservative inkatha movement in fighting 
among rival black factions in natal province the fighting has 
claimed some 4000 lives since 1986 
police said today that the situation around edendale in natal 
province was quiet after a week of savage black factional fighting 
left at least 58 people dead the fighting pitted inkatha against 
ancbacked groups

about 50 armed soviet soldiers dressed as 
policemen stormed the lithuanian prosecutors office today 
expelled its employees and occupied the building said witnesses 
and spokesmen for the republics parliament 
the incident occurred one day after lithuanias secessionist 
government accused the kremlin of backing forces bent on its 
overthrow 
lithuania and moscow have faced off in a tense showdown since 
the republic declared independence march 11 statements in recent 
days indicated movement toward a common ground including a 
possible referendum by lithuanians 
but today men armed with automatic weapons entered the 
prosecutors office site of a previous soviet attempt to seize 
authority from officials appointed by the breakway republics 
government 
the men fully occupied the building and there are six or 
eight paratroopers on each floor dressed as policemen henrika 
pocei secretary to lithuanias chief prosecutor said in a 
telephone interview from vilnius 
a bulletin put out by the lithuanian supreme council legislature 
quoted kazimieras motieka deputy head of the parliament as saying 
soldiers were dressed in police uniforms and carried boxes of 
ammunition with them into the building 
the chief prosecutor is the republics top lawenforcement 
authority a confrontation arose at the same offices last week when 
moscow officials tried to remove arturas paulauskas the chief 
prosecutor appointed by the new lithuanian government and install 
their own man 
employees refused to obey the moscow loyalist and several 
soldiers were stationed in the building friday in the first 
occupation by soviet troops of a lithuanian government building 
soldiers had previously taken control of several communist party 
buildings 
the soviet union with the aid of its army supports a small 
group of its political supporters which is attempting to restore 
the old structures of the soviet administration lithuanias 
parliament said in a statement wednesday 
there is therefore a threat to overthrow the legally elected 
authority and the government said the statement broadcast on 
lithuanian radio 
in london the republics de facto spokesman expressed a 
willingness to agree to concessions including a continued soviet 
military presence the retention of economic ties with moscow and a 
referendum on independence 
the announcement came from algis cekuolis a foreign affairs 
adviser to lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis and was the 
first such public offer from the lithuanians 
president mikhail s gorbachev declared saturday that moscow 
would not negotiate with the lithuanians unless they repeal their 
march 11 declaration of independence 
landsbergis responded by saying the declaration was not 
negotiable but otherwise struck a conciliatory tone on tuesday 
highranking kremlin and lithuanian officials met for the first 
time on the issue indicating both sides were seeking compromise 
after weeks of tense confrontation 
however more informal moscow talks slated for wednesday were 
postponed without explanation and word emerged of gorbachevs harsh 
message to the new premier of lithuanias equally 
independenceminded baltic neighbor estonia 
on tuesday night gorbachev told president arnold ruutel of 
estonia that the republic must back off from its declaration of 
sovereignty ruutel said 
estonia which moscow forcibly annexed with fellow baltic states 
lithuania and latvia in 1940 is cautiously following lithuanias 
lead on friday its new parliament declared estonia to be under 
soviet occupation and set an indefinite transition period for 
independence 
ruutel interviewed by estonian radio quoted gorbachev as 
saying when i heard of your resolution i was completely beside 
myself you must declare the resolution null and void it is an 
invalid one 
it seems to me that i have to introduce similar measures as 
those taken in lithuania he quoted gorbachev as saying 
since lithuanias independence declaration march 11 red army 
convoys have rolled through the republic and troops have occupied 
buildings and rounded up lithuanian military deserters 
in london cekuolis told a news conference that landsbergis had 
authorized him to publicize the proposed concessions in hopes of 
starting formal negotiations with moscow on its claim to 
independent status 
he said his government had decided to make the announcement in 
what he referred to as the uncensored environment of a western 
capital most foreign reporters were forced to leave lithuania on 
sunday 
cekuolis who arrived in london from moscow on tuesday listed 
these proposed concessions 
recognition of soviet interests but not rights in the baltic 
states maybe including a military presence 
soviet access to the soviet city of kaliningrad from which it 
would lose direct land access 
soviet use of the baltic ports which are crucial to the soviet 
navy 
retention of the present economic relations between lithuania 
and the soviet union 
a referendum on independence a key demand of gorbachev and an 
element of a tough secession law passed by the soviet parliament on 
tuesday the law also stipulates a fiveyear waiting period for 
secession 
cekuolis did not have any meetings with british officials prime 
minister margaret thatchers government has made it clear it does 
not wish to complicate matters for gorbachev over the difficult 
issue of lithuania 
the bush administration has likewise refrained from recognizing 
lithuania as independent though it has expressed support for the 
republics right to selfdetermination

president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will hold a summit in the united states between may 30 
and june 3 the two superpowers announced today as toplevel 
negotiations resumed on arms control treaties 
im looking forward to meeting with him bush told reporters 
a few hours after the formal announcement was made it is very 
important that we have these conversations 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the summit 
would be a tough love session that would deal with the 
breakaway soviet republic of lithuania and perhaps result in 
agreement on arms control issues hopefully including a pact 
limiting longrange strategic nuclear weapons 
he also said it was hoped an agreement could be reached on 
conventional troop levels in europe and added that ussoviet 
trade would be on the agenda 
the simultaneous announcements of the summit came from the white 
house and the soviet news agency tass as secretary of state james 
a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze held 
their second day of meetings 
bush said the conversations between baker and the soviet 
diplomat were going reasonably well the president is scheduled 
to meet with shevardnadze at the white house on friday 
shevardnadze summed up his first two rounds of talks with baker 
saying i think its going rather well 
as the morning session ended shevardnadze said he and baker had 
discussed the entire range of arms control issues as well as 
practical preparations for the summit 
the details of the summit were sketchy fitzwater said it may 
not last five days and offered little information on time and 
specific locations 
it could turn out to be a two or threeday summit depending 
on travel schedules fitzwater suggested bush had been expected 
to deliver a commencement speech at the military academy at west 
point ny on may 31 and there has been talk that gorbachev might 
make a similar speech at brown university in providence ri 
the spokesman said the crisis in lithuania would undoubtedly 
be an issue at the summit and that the president intended to 
raise it if anything lithuania makes the summit even more 
important fitzwater said 
i would characterize this summit more in terms of 
demonstrating the kind of tough love working relationship that we 
were able to develop with the soviet union by virtue of four or 
five summits the spokesman said 
lithuania aside bush and gorbachev have planned the summit to 
discuss three major arms control agreements dealing with longrange 
nuclear missiles chemical arms and troops and weapons in europe 
the summit is also expected to include talks on such political 
issues as the reunification of germany 
im very pleased the dates have been set bush said its 
very important that we have these conversations dialogue is 
important 
the two leaders hope to sign a treaty limiting longrange 
nuclear missiles deployed on land in submarines and aboard 
bombers but several knotty issues must be settled first 
baker and shevardnadze both stressed how short a period there is 
to prepare for the summit 
there is very little time only seven weeks shevardnadze 
said there is still a great amount of work to be done and this 
time the agenda as everybody knows is very extensive 
baker agreed quite a bit of work remains to be done he 
said we hope as far as our side is concerned we will be able to 
move forward on the full range of our agenda 
in the arms control field bush and gorbachev may initial an 
agreement for a phased reduction of american and soviet chemical 
weapons but an international ban depends on agreement among more 
than a score of nations negotiating terms in geneva 
the two leaders could set final terms for reducing us and 
soviet troops tanks and other conventional forces in europe but a 
treaty would be finalized at a 35nation summit meeting later in 
the year provided there is no hangup in negotiations 
on the issue of german reunification the soviets are concerned 
that merger of their ally east germany with the nato linchpin 
west germany would give the western alliance a considerable 
advantage over the warsaw pact 
bush and the allies are considering concessions such as keeping 
nato troops out of what is now east germany 
on regional fronts the two sides are backing opposing forces in 
wars in angola and afghanistan and could be ready to strike 
compromise deals 
summits generally are an occasion for superpower accords on such 
issues as cultural and business exchanges and this one may be as 
well gorbachev also is seeking access to western credit and 
improved trade relations and the subject of trade is certain to 
come up 
bush and gorbachev last met in early december on the island of 
malta in the mediterranean and seemed to agree on a basis for us 
support for gorbachevs program of reform within the soviet union 
since then the drive for independence in lithuania and other 
regions of the soviet union has strained superpower relations but 
not to the extent that bush would withdraw offers of us technical 
assistance 
meanwhile senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said 
after a meeting with bush today that the lithuanian situation could 
make it a little more difficult to achieve new trade agreements 
with the soviet union 
the members of congress in both parties might have a different 
view if theres any force used in lithuania about trade or anything 
else dealing with the soviet union he said 
i dont know that it would spill over into arms control 
agreements said dole 
fitzwaters announcement said 
president bush and president gorbachev have agreed on dates 
for holding their summit meeting in the united states the summit 
will take place during the dates of wednesday may 30 and sunday 
june 3 
tass said in a brief announcement there is an agreement that 
the visit of the soviet president ms gorbachev to the united 
states would take place on may 30june 3 this year

conservatives are flourishing in america but 
it will be some time before they have another ronald reagan to 
cheer leaders of a conservative think tank said thursday 
top officials of the heritage foundation which had close ties to 
the reagan administration released a state of conservatism 
message saying president bush is following up on his predecessors 
conservative agenda but is no match for him at inspiring followers 
george bush might in fact come along at the end of four years 
with an enactment record as conservative as ronald reagans was at 
the end of his first term but clearly his rhetoric is not what 
conservatives are looking for said heritage president edwin j 
feulner jr 
feulner conceded that this is a problem in terms of building 
and maintaining a movement nevertheless he said there are a 
lot of good conservative institutions out there that are doing very 
well 
sure we miss reagan said burton yale pines senior vice 
president of the foundation democrats for a half century have 
been looking for a successor to franklin roosevelt were going 
to be looking for a long time for the next ronald reagan 
i think it is going to take a while for a new political person 
to come along to build on the reagan legacy and claim that turf 
said feulner i dont see him out there today 
feulner said roosevelts new deal formulated in the 1930s did 
not come to fruition until the johnson administrations great 
society in the 1960s 
similarly he saidbecause ronald reagan came to town and 
enunciated some radically different and new ideas it would be 
utopian for conservatives to think that by the time he left town in 
january 1989 those ideas would all be in place its going to be a 
longterm process 
critics from the left and the right are saying that we are 
cracking up or that we have lost our cohesion but i believe the 
conservative movement is healthy alive and well today feulner 
said 
he conceded however that conservatives are in a difficult 
bind between those who believe a certain level of the welfare 
state is more or less acceptable and those who do not he said 
heritage believes there is a certain minimal role of government 
that conservatives at least those involved in the policy process 
in washington ought to be willing to accept and try and promote 
new ways of looking at these problems 
it is almost a generational kind of question said feulner 
a veteran of the conservative movement who has headed heritage 
since 1977 we are being accused by our successors of being 
rather squishy 
he said this conflict is in some respects personified in the 
contrast betwen reagans rhetoric and bushs yet i see the two 
of them in terms of their policies basically one following the 
other 
in the message distributed in advance of the meeting feulner 
wrote that reagan sought power to give it away to states 
localities private enterprise and institutions that make 
americans actively involved citizens instead of resentful 
taxpayers 
in view of the obstacles he confronted its amazing he got as 
far as he did feulner said but it wasnt far beyond the 
starting blocks 
in domestic affairs the foundation president urged 
conservatives to press for such things as giving parents the 
freedom to choose the schools their children attend empowering 
tenants to manage the public housing projects where they live and 
providing business incentives to invest in poor innercity 
neighborhoods 
turning to world affairs he said that because of our success 
in rolling back communism there is no longer much consensus on 
what constitutes a conservative foreign policy 
this isnt the place to set forth a new conservative foreign 
policy agenda he added but it is the place to acknowledge 
that in an era when even many communists have turned 
anticommunist anticommunism is no longer enough to unify and 
energize conservatives 
the message was published by the foundation under the title 
conservatism in a new age as a supplement to its annual report

president bush on thursday lifted the state of 
emergency against panama a formal step toward returning to normal 
trade and economic relations 
the state of emergency was imposed april 8 1988 during the 
regime of gen manuel antonio noriega he was deposed during the 
us invasion in december and a new government was installed 
although no elections have been held since then the bush 
administration considers the usinstalled government to be 
democratically elected 
that is because president guillermo endara was seen by 
independent observers as the obvious winner in last mays election 
which was invalidated by noriega 
the restoration of a democratically elected government in 
panama has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security foreign policy and economy of the united states 
previously posed by the policies and actions of manuel antonio 
noriega in that country and the need to continue the national 
emergency bush said in an executive order lifting the state of 
emergency 
thursdays move came as bush continued to press for 500 million 
in emergency aid for panama to help get its economy back on track 
and aid the endara governments recovery from the invasion damage 
the house this week approved a 420 million package the senate 
seems unlikely to act on the measure before leaving thursday for 
the easter recess as bush had hoped 
the state of emergency order imposed by thenpresident reagan 
had led to withholding us payments to panama for operations of 
the panama canal and froze an estimated 400 million worth of 
panamanian assets in us banks besides hampering panamanian trade 
with the united states 
bush imposed further sanctions including prohibiting ships 
flying the panamanian flag from entering us ports 
in advance of thursdays announcement however bush had 
unfrozen the panamanian bank assets and effectively lifted all 
other sanctions

the way of his opportunity to be photographed thursday with rock 
star michael jackson

firefighting experts across the country are 
bracing for what could become the worst fire season in the nations 
history the result of drought hurricane debris and a lack of 
manpower 
representatives of the army air force national guard forest 
service bureau of land management and other federal agencies met 
at the boise interagency fire center this week to assess the threat 
of range and forest fires nationwide this summer 
the boise center is charged with coordinating firefighting 
efforts nationwide 
jack wilson the centers director said the western states are 
suffering their sixth year of drought 
the moisture is real low in most areas in the west if we get 
the lightning were in trouble he said 
in 1988 widespread lightning storms over the west contributed 
to fires that burned more than 5 million acres nationwide 
including about 700000 to 1 million acres in yellowstone national 
park 
the center says the nations worst fire year in terms of total 
acreage burned was 1926 when 28 million acres of land was charred 
in the southeast hurricane hugo last year cut a wide swath 
through south carolina the storms powerful wind knocked down 
trees and brush over 6million acres 
its dead and down and that makes it doubly dangerous 
wilson said 
he said the region generally has about 100 tons of dead trees 
and brush per acre but in the wake of hugo the potential fire 
fuel has more than doubled 
if it gets going its going to be a disaster im looking for 
a rough tough year wilson said 
adding to the problem is a lack of manpower nearly 2000 fewer 
civilian firefighters will be available the fires this summer 
officials said 
timber programs and other competing programs have taken up the 
manpower theyre just not available this summer and may not be for 
the next five years wilson said 
sixtythree hotshot crews welltrained firstattack 
firefighting teams of about 20 people each will lead the nations 
firefighting efforts along with 395 smoke jumpers 
including support crews nearly 20000 firefighters will be on 
line for this seasons blazes but wilson expects more will be 
needed 
most of the time civilian firefighting forces are more than 
adequate but in the event it becomes necessary to call for 
military help we want to be ready to do that

american companies plan to boost their 
overseas capital spending by 13 percent this year up substantially 
from a 2 percent increase projected six months ago the government 
said thursday 
the commerce department said a survey conducted in december 
showed that majorityowned foreign affiliates of us companies 
plan to spend 549 billion after increases of 14 percent in 1989 
and 24 percent in 1988 
the increases over the three years are widespread by area and 
industry the department said reflecting parent companies growing 
emphasis on overseas operations 
manufacturing affiliates said they plan a 17 percent boost to 
274 billion in 1990 up from 2 percent in the previous survey 
last june that compares to a 15 percent gain in 1989 
the department said all manufacturing industries plan increases 
manufacturers have been attracted by favorable conditions 
abroad including increasing european economic integration and 
rapid economic growth in east asia it continued 
the largest manufacturing increases were in primary and 
fabricated metals nonelectrical machinery and transportation 
equipment 
the boost in primary and fabricated metals is mainly for 
construction and expansion of aluminium smelters in canada the 
department said 
in transportation equipment european manufacturers of 
automobiles are expanding capacity in anticipation of market growth 
related to the 1992 singlemarket initiative of the european 
communities it added that initiative is also encouraging 
spending in nonelectrical machinery particularly by european 
computermanufacturing affiliates 
the department said petroleum affiliates plan an 8 percent 
increase to 156 billion after boosting spending 9 percent in 
1989 those affiliates had said they planned a 6 percent boost in 
spending in the initial survey 
petroleum firms have been slowing their domestic capital 
spending for exploration and development and they have been 
shifting these activities overseas partly in response to 
environmental concerns in the united states it reported 
in addition petroleum spending reflects rising world oil 
prices resulting from increasing worldwide demand and declining 
production in the united states and the soviet union 
affiliates in developed countries plan to increase expenditures 
13 percent to 423 billion after a 10 percent gain in 1989 
affiliates in developing countries plan a 15 percent boost to 117 
billion following a 15 percent advance a year earlier

eastman kodak co was fined 215 million 
in criminal and civil penalties on thursday for violating new 
yorks environmental laws 
the photographic giant pleaded guilty in rochester city court to 
two misdemeanor violations for illegally disposing of hazardous 
waste and failing to report the spill of a toxic solvent until five 
days after it was discovered 
the 1 million criminal fine is the largest ever assessed by new 
york in an environmental case and among the largest in the nation 
said state attorney general robert abrams 
the incidents occurred in 1986 and 1987 at the 2200acre kodak 
park manufacturing center for film and photographic products the 
illegal hazardous waste disposal was one of a series of violations 
said assistant state attorney general paul mccarthy 
under a plea agreement kodak was fined 1 million in criminal 
penalties for the two violations plus 150000 to be paid to local 
emergency planning committees 
kodak also signed a consent order with the state department of 
environmental conservation under that order the company will pay 
an additional 1 million in civil penalties and begin an extensive 
cleanup of kodak park 
but judge herman j walz criticized the agreement for letting 
kodaks officers off the hook 
when a corporation pleads guilty in exchange for an agreement 
not to prosecute members of the corporation then people who have 
participated in a criminal act go unpunished walz said 
in this courts view socalled white collar criminals ought 
to be punished as severely as any other criminal and because such 
criminal conduct frequently results in much more serious 
consequences to society perhaps more severely 
kodak spokesman ronald roberts said the company had accepted 
responsibility for the violations 
we believe it is in the best interest of our company our 
employees and the community to put any problems behind us and 
direct our attention to the many strong environmental programs to 
which we are committed roberts said in a statement 
industry analysts said the fines would have little effect on the 
companys finances 
a fine of a couple million is peanuts to eastman kodak 
company said michael ellmann of wertheim schroder amp co in new 
york 
mccarthy said kodak had illegally contracted with an 
unauthorized company to dispose of nearly 50000 pounds of 
silvercontaiminated soil in 1986 kodak was fined 997500 for 
that violation double the profit it had made from the incident 
mccarthy said 
the other charge involved a feb 5 1987 spill of more than 
5000 gallons of a toxic solvent at one of kodaks tank farms 
kodak discovered the spill on feb 6 but did not notify the state 
environmental office until feb 11 
kodak was fined 2500 for that violation 
the settlements are the result of nearly two years 
investigation after officials discovered in 1988 that chemical 
leaks and spills had contaminated ground water under kodak park 
joseph polito a former leader of concerned neighbors of kodak 
park said he was disappointed with the size of the penalties 
against kodak 
its equivalent to you or i getting a jaywalking ticket he 
said

ecological reserves gold miners extracting gold from indian areas 
indians kicked out into the cities rubber tappers living in the

parliament returned king baudouin to 
the throne thursday two days after he agreed to be suspended to 
avoid signing a bill legalizing abortion lawmakers urged changes 
in the law to reduce royal privileges 
there were no votes against putting the king back on the throne 
but 93 of the 338 deputies present abstained 
king baudouin a devout catholic refused to sign the abortion 
bill after it was passed by parliament last friday as the 
constitutional head of state he must sign all bills to make them 
law 
on tuesday baudouin agreed to a temporary suspension he was 
removed from the throne wednesday after which the government 
enacted the law itself 
prime minister wilfried martens said his centerleft government 
will seek changes in the constitution to prevent future refusals by 
the king on moral grounds to endorse legislation he did not 
elaborate 
but it is expected the government wants the royal powers 
already largely ceremonial reduced further 
experts said the king cannot cast aside his constitutional role 
only because he morally opposes legislation they said he can only 
lose his constitutional powers if he is physically or mentally 
unable to rule 
the bill the king opposes ended a 123year ban on abortions in 
this overwhelmingly catholic nation it allows abortions if a 
womans doctor deems a patient is in a state of distress 
opponents say this in fact makes abortion available on demand 
in short the bill represents a serious diminution of respect 
for the life of the weakest you will therefore understand i do not 
wish to be involved with that law the monarch said in a letter 
to martens last week 
to those who are surprised at my attitude i put the following 
question is it normal that i am the only belgian citizen who must 
act against his conscience in such important matters do all have 
the freedom of conscience except the king 
the belgian monarch has long opposed abortion in his 1989 
christmas message he spoke of the need for special protection 
and care for children including the correct legal protection both 
before and after birth 
vatican radio on thursday praised king baudouin for refusing to 
sign the bill into law 
in an introduction to a news report the radio station said the 
king made a noble and courageous choice that was dictated by 
his very strong moral conscience and his undisputible sense of 
statehood 
the roman catholic church opposes abortion in all circumstances 
and pope john paul ii has campaigned continuously against it there 
has been no comment from the pope on the kings move

sen alfonse damato said thursday he will 
test a soviet blockade of lithuania by trying to enter the 
breakaway baltic republic on a visa issued by the nations 
independent government 
damato a new york republican said he has an invitation to 
visit friday from lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis he 
said he expects to be accompanied to the border 185 miles from 
warsaw by a highlevel lithuanian government delegation 
damato said he will try to cross the border with a lithuanian 
visa despite the fact that the soviet union does not recognize the 
republic as an independent nation 
the soviet union has ordered western diplomats out of lithuania 
evicted foreign journalists and forbidden traffic at the single 
polishlithuanian border crossing it is lithuanias only direct 
land access to the rest of europe 
the steps were taken in an effort to force lithuania to retract 
its declaration of independence made march 11 
the united states never recognized the forced incorporation of 
lithuania into the soviet union in 1940 but it also has not 
recognized lithuania as an independent state it has urged 
negotiations between vilnius and moscow 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commented 
on damatos trip and said were always concerned about members 
of congress and others getting too involved in foreign policy 
but on the other hand he is a senator who has an important 
message to deliver he represents a broad constituency and has 
every right to make that trip and deliver his message 
congressmen including damato have been urging president bush 
to give lithuania more support some us politicians have 
suggested sanctions if force is used against the republic 
well find out about glasnost damato said when asked what 
he thought soviet kgb border troops would do when he reached the 
border 
well find out if they are really for peace or if this is a 
case of saying one thing and doing another he said 
if blocked he pledged to raise the question as to why they 
would be turning back a united states senator who has come at the 
invitation of the elected representatives of the people of 
lithuanian 
he criticized western news organizations for withdrawing their 
correspondents from vilnius after being to ordered to do so by the 
soviets 
damato is the junior republican on the senate intelligence 
committee and also serves on the appropriations subcomittee on 
foreign operations 
he is not considered one of the senates leading voices on 
foreign relations 
before he left wednesday damato tried to deflect suggestions 
that the trip was designed to counteract problems at home 
damatos public opinion ratings have slipped dramatically since 
the senate ethics committee began looking into allegations he used 
his influence to steer federal housing and urban development money 
to friends and political supporters 
now if every time i do something thats not associated with 
hud youre going to say oh youre doing that because its not 
associated with hud thats silly he told reporters wednesday

a jury today rejected a delicatessen 
owners claims that he was promised a slice of actor paul newmans 
gourmet food companies 
the superior court jury deliberated just five hours over two 
days before deciding that newman never promised westport deli owner 
julius gold 8 percent stock in the companies newmans own inc and 
salad king inc for the help gold said he provided in launching 
the businesses in 1982 and 1983 
its just tragic all of this energy and time could not have 
been spent in more charitable pursuits but thats the nature of 
the beast newman said moments after the verdict was announced 
newman showed no emotion as the decision of the sixmember jury 
was announced he shook hands with his attorneys and his partner 
author ae hotchner before leaving the courtroom 
gold sat dejectedly without moving for 15 minutes after the 
verdict was announced and appeared despondent over the verdict but 
he said he would not appeal 
im disappointed gold said i brought the case because i 
thought i was wronged i realized i was dealing with an uphill

west germany said thursday it was 
moving ahead with plans to replace the nearly worthless east german 
currency with the mighty western mark by summer amid uproar over 
the proposed exchange rate 
finance minister theo waigel confirmed newspaper reports that 
under the proposed currency union east germany would relinquish 
control of monetary policy to the west german central bank 
bundesbank 
naturally sovereignty over monetary policy in this currency 
union will lie completely with the bundesbank waigel told 
reporters 
waigel said government ministers were studying a 50page draft 
proposal for replacing the east german mark he said west germany 
would like basic agreement on the contract by next month and 
establishment of the common currency sometime this summer 
merging the german currencies is crucial to plans for rebuilding 
east germanys battered economy and to west german chancellor 
helmut kohls hope for a speedy unification of the states 
but east germans are outraged by a bundesbank recommendation 
that they get one west german mark for every two east german marks 
according to the proposal a 11 conversion rate would apply only 
on limited amounts of savings 
thousands of people rallied in east german cities thursday to 
underscore demands for a 11 exchange rate the east germans say a 
broad 2to1 rate could lead to impoverishment 
how the german currency union will be worked out is also 
worrying other european countries 
a senior dutch banker said this week that irresponsible 
promises by kohl to east germans about the terms of monetary union 
have driven european interest rates to absurdly high levels 
france italy and european economic community officials have 
been pushing for quick creation of a common eec currency and 
central bank a number of west european countries have expressed 
concern the unification process might distract west germans from 
the eecs stated goal of closer european integration 
waigel said bonn hoped to offer a finished proposal to east 
germany by midapril but that depended on when a new east german 
government was formed negotiations are under way in east berlin on 
forming a coalition government following east germanys first free 
elections on march 18 
we expect there will be negotiations with east germany after 
easter at the latest waigel said 
waigel said the bundesbanks recommendation for a 2to1 
conversion rate was not discussed by the government ministers 
thursday 
the bundesbank has said a general 1to1 swap for east german 
marks could doom many east german industries and businesses not 
only by increasing the value of their debt but by boosting the 
purchasing power of east germans who might then start buying 
superior west german products 
the west german government says it is examining the bundesbank 
proposal but has not disclosed what it will offer east germany 
handelsblatt a widely respected west german financial 
newspaper said the government would choose a 1to1 rate for wages 
and pensions and increase the amount of savings that can be 
exchanged at that favorable rate 
but even if wages and pensions are converted at 1to1 
corporate debt and other businessrelated aggregates will still be 
exchanged at a 2to1 rate the newspaper said

nasa finished testing the 15 
billion hubble space telescope aboard discovery and started final 
precountdown work thursday raising the space agencys hopes for a 
timely launch next week 
it is the most comfortable nasa officials have felt about 
tuesdays launch date since a power outage interrupted the testing 
monday said george diller a spokesman for the space agency 
basically the works done were just down to the things you 
cant do before now anyway diller said 
were essentially on or near schedule on all of that work im 
really not aware of anything thats unusually shaky he said 
the countdown is scheduled to begin saturday afternoon early 
forecasts show an 80 percent chance of weather favorable for launch 
tuesday with the weather worsening slightly during the next two 
days 
functional testing of the telescope and shuttle was completed 
early thursday and the launch pad was cleared of all nonessential 
personnel for final preparation of the payload and orbiter 
technicians were in the middle of the 52hour test when a power 
outage at kennedy space center knocked out air conditioning and 
forced the shutdown of heatsensitive computers testing resumed 
tuesday evening and had to be completed by thursday morning for the 
mission to stay on schedule 
as soon as the testing ended technicians began the routine 
procedure of placing explosive devices on the shuttles solid 
rocket boosters external tank and the orbiter itself to be used in 
the event of a serious malfunction said nasa spokesman bruce 
buckingham 
power was turned off to the telescope and shuttle so that the 
hazardous work could be performed charging of the telescopes 
nickelhydrogen batteries also was halted and was to resume 
the telescopes batteries will be charged until the shuttles 
payload bay doors are closed two days before launch 
the 24250pound 43footlong telescope named for the late 
american astronomer edwin p hubble is the most expensive unmanned 
spacecraft ever built by the national aeronautics and space 
administration it originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but 
was delayed due to technical problems and the 1986 challenger 
explosion 
discoverys five astronauts plan to deploy the telescope on the 
second day of the fiveday mission 
the hubble will orbit 380 miles high for 15 years enabling 
astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant that their light 
has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years it will be 
capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times 
greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory

labor party leader shimon peres criticized for 
forming a coalition dependent on defectors from the rightwing 
likud bloc reaffirmed thursday that he will be able to pursue the 
peace process if he is prime minister 
peres said that once installed his government would without 
question approve us secretary of state james a bakers plan 
for convening palestinianisraeli talks in cairo 
we say the government will be based on the peace policy of the 
outgoing cabinet peres said on israel radio but we will 
permit the continuation of the process to renew the peace 
process 
leftists feared peres could have trouble making bold moves since 
his majority in parliament would be thin and dependent on 
conservative religious factions and hawks who had crossed party 
lines 
peres met in tel aviv with leaders of three leftwing parties 
who were critical of his tactics in trying to form a new 
government they control 10 seats in the parliament or knesset 
and some threatened to withhold support vital to peres 
amnon rubinstein leader of the shinui change faction which 
has demanded sweeping election reform said the notion of switching 
back and forth between political blocs was a problem that goes to 
the very core of israeli democracy 
peres told president chaim herzog on wednesday he had succeeded 
in piecing together a ruling coalition but labor leaders have 
refused to divulge the names of the prospective defectors who have 
promised support 
peres said secrecy was necessary to woo other supporters he is 
believed to have only 61 or 62 members of the 120seat knesset 
pledged to support his leadership 
the announcement came two weeks after he was assigned to replace 
likud prime minister yitzhak shamir 
shamir lost a noconfidence vote march 15 in a crisis triggered 
by dispute over bakers conditions for holding palestinianisraeli 
talks peres forced the showdown with shamir who was reluctant to 
accept bakers proposals on forming a palestinian delegation 
parliament officials were expected to set a voting date on the 
proposed new government for either sunday or wednesday 
if peres succeeds it would be the first time since 1977 that 
the leftofcenter labor ruled without sharing power with likud 
according to israeli media the key defector is likud legislator 
avraham sharir whom shamir dumped as tourism minister after 
criticism that sharir spent too much time on junkets abroad and 
padded government payrolls with cronies 
labor promised sharir 67 he would return to the tourism post 
or be named transport minister in a laborled government 
sharirs tel aviv home was placed under special police 
surveillance thursday after his family received telephone threats 
tel aviv police spokeswoman ahuva ivri said 
the liberal daily haaretz newspaper said labor has left open 
other cabinet jobs for potential defectors 
it said two religious parties the national religious party and 
the torah guardians were being offered the education and interior 
portfolios respectively if they support labor the finance ministry 
was held for yitzhak modai head of a disgruntled likud breakaway 
group 
likud leaders mounted intensive efforts to court modai and other 
potential defectors promising seats in the next parliament 
army radio said modais breakaway group was even offered a 25 
million letter of credit signed by a wealthy party contributor as a 
guarantee that the promise of future parliament seats would be 
fulfilled

americans took out 34 billion more in 
consumer credit than they retired in february but the pace slowed 
because of slackening demand for car loans the government said 
thursday 
the federal reserve said consumer credit increased at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 57 percent down from januarys 
revised 64 percent pace the january rate was reported last month 
to have been 59 percent 
consumer credit which includes all consumer loans except 
mortgages was up 73 percent in december 
automobile loans advanced in february to a seasonally adjusted 
889 million in february that represented an annual rate of 37 
percent less than half the 84 percent jump in january when sales 
incentives were reinstated the incentives continued in february 
but consumer response failed to keep up 
without incentives auto loans had fallen 04 percent in 
december 
credit card debt rose 485 million 29 percent at an annual 
rate slightly faster pace than januarys 18 percent gain but much 
slower than the 237 percent rate during the december holiday 
shopping period 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate were up 
121 percent an increase of 204 billion after gains of 9 
percent in january and 3 percent in december 
borrowing for mobile homes continued its recent downward trend 
off 2 million or 01 percent with the exception of a 28 percent 
gain in september mobile home credit has fallen each month since 
february 1989 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of 
february at 7237 billion

an oftencited study that shows the 
experimental drug azt can delay the onset of aids in people with 
the hiv virus appeared in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine 
now we have something to give people said dr anthony 
fauci director of the office of aids research of the national 
institutes of health its important for people who feel they 
have been exposed to hiv to get tested to determine if they are 
infected 
the study whose preliminary findings were first released last 
august formed the basis of the federal food and drug 
administrations decision last month to allow physicians to 
prescribe the drug for patients who are infected with the 
humanimmunodeficiency virus but have not developed symptoms of the 
disease researchers said although the studys conclusions were 
known the data had not been published until thursday 
fauci on wednesday discussed the clinical trials after 
addressing the johns hopkins conference on aids a threeday 
gathering of 650 scientists from across the country 
this is a strong mandate for increased testing said dr 
john bartlett chief of aids service at the johns hopkins hospital 
one of the 32 medical centers that participated in the study of 
1338 patients 
researchers hailed the results not only as good news for those 
infected with the virus that causes aids but also for those who 
have placed themselves at risk of contracting the virus with early 
detection people may stand a better chance of staving off the 
disease they said 
over a twoyear span fewer patients who were given azt 
progressed to the fullblown stage of the disease than patients 
taking a placebo the study found 
despite the encouraging results researchers said patients must 
be observed longer before it can be determined if the drug actually 
lengthens the life of infected people 
the studys lead author was dr paul volberding of the 
university of california at san francisco 
in the study the 1338 subjects were divided into three groups 
of nearly equal size one group received a placebo one received a 
small dosage of azt and the third received a higher dosage of azt 
aids developed in 33 patients taking the placebo 11 taking the 
smaller dosage and 14 taking the higher dosage the researchers 
reported 
the drug is manufactured by the burroughs wellcome co of 
research triangle nc it was first sold in 1987 when the company 
received fda approval to market it for people with fullblown aids 
and advanced cases of aidsrelated complex

plo chairman yasser arafat asked italian officials 
on thursday to help him persuade israel to negotiate a settlement 
with the palestinians 
italian political leaders who met with arafat said he described 
1990 as a doordie year for the arabisraeli peace process 
arafat explained clearly that 1990 is either a year in which 
the peace process truly opens or else it can lead to a new 
terrible spiral of war said giorgio napolitano an italian 
communist party official 
arafat said earlier in paris that he would like to meet with 
shimon peres the israeli labor party leader who is working on 
forming a coalition government 
before leaving paris for rome on thursday arafat told the 
europe one radio station he would meet with peres at the french 
presidential palace 
the peace process is blocked because of problems in another 
camp said arafat in the radio interview referring to israel 
but if mr peres can assure himself a majority at that moment 
things could move 
arafat said he also expects to hold more talks with former 
president jimmy carter they met twice in paris and carter praised 
what he said were the plo leaders efforts to advance peace in the 
middle east 
in a separate interview broadcast by abu dhabi television on

former us district judge harry claiborne who 
was convicted of tax evasion in 1984 and later impeached has won a 
legal battle to resume practicing law in federal court 
us district judge robert broomfield of phoenix said wednesday 
he was adopting a nevada state bar disciplinary boards 
recommendation that claiborne be reinstated 
claiborne 73 was convicted of failing to report more than 
106000 on his 1979 and 1980 tax returns he was removed from his 
lifetime post oct 10 1986 after the us senate convicted him on 
three of four articles of impeachment 
claiborne claimed at his impeachment hearing that he was the 
victim of prosecutors he had offended while on the bench 
he served 17 months of a twoyear prison term and resumed his 
law practice in state court shortly after he was released 
broomfield had denied claiborne permission to practice in 
federal court in september 1988 but allowed him to apply again 
last september 
i am very happy about it claiborne said wednesday i 
certainly intend to go back to practicing in federal court but i 
dont have anything lined up yet because i had to be careful not to 
encourage people to wait around for me 
the disciplinary board said claiborne has built up a reservoir 
of good deeds and for whatever transgressions he may have 
committed in the past harry claiborne has by any standard paid the 
price

two national groups pressing for voluntary 
warning labels on records urged state legislators thursday to drop 
crusades for mandatory labels in light of an industry effort to 
alert consumers to explicit lyrics 
tipper gore president of the parents music resource center 
said lawmakers in 13 states had promised to abandon their efforts 
to require labels on music with graphic lyrics about sex and 
violence 
bills are pending in six states she said 
the center has never believed that legislation is the answer 
today we are asking state lawmakers to give the voluntary system a 
chance to work gore said 
six major record companies said last week they plan to create a 
uniform voluntary labeling system to identify explicit recordings 
gore and ann lynch president of the national pta said that 
would strengthen a labeling agreement their groups had reached with 
the industry in 1985 companies were not complying with that 
agreement in many cases 
the key difference is the uniform standard they are going to 
use gore said 
asked if a standard alone will result in a wider use of the 
labels she replied 
we take the industry on good faith that they really do mean to 
seriously address the problem we take them at their word and we 
believe they will do the job correctly this time 
at least one state legislator said he would reintroduce his bill 
next year if the record industry doesnt improve 
we hope for a positive outcome said tom susman a member of 
the west virginia house of delegates if not then it will be 
up to the legislators to look at this issue again 
states where lawmakers have promised not to pursue or revive 
mandatory labeling bills include arizona iowa maryland oklahoma 
west virginia tennessee alaska illinois kansas minnesota new 
mexico new york and rhode island gores group said 
similar bills are pending in new york and rhode island as well 
as missouri florida delaware and pennsylvania according to the 
national association of recording merchandisers 
gores group and others have expressed concern about music that 
they believe encourages violence suicide drug use sexual 
promiscuity bigotry and devil worship 
susman said the record labeling system would be comparable to 
the guidance parents receive from film ratings 
gore said her group has never favored censorship and denied that 
it inspired state legislators to propose mandatory labeling she 
gave parents and teachers credit for spurring the latest industry 
plan 
however record merchandising industry executives last week 
indicated that pressure from state legislatures was at least partly 
responsible for their decision to standardize and try to broaden 
the labeling system the music industry has been lobbying hard in 
state capitols to kill the bills 
companies creating the new system are warner brothers mca cbs 
capitolemi rca and polygram 
representatives of the recording industry association of america 
were scheduled to meet with state legislators friday in washington 
to discuss the size content and placement of the new stickers 
the association represents companies that produce more than 90 
percent of the records sold in the united states

one in three american adults say they or 
someone in their family have sought help from a psychiatrist or a 
psychologist according to a survey released thursday 
yet the survey also found among those polled widespread 
opposition to putting any kind of mental health facility or housing 
for people with mental illness in their neighborhoods 
miles shore director of the robert wood johnson foundations 
program on chronic mental illness said he was encouraged that 
nearly 90 percent describe mental illness as a serious health 
problem and many believe it can be treated 
but he said the survey points out a contradiction in what he 
called the notinmybackyard or nimby phenomenon 
on the one hand people do object to siting these facilities 
in their back yard on the other hand over half recognize that 
mental illness can improve and that keeping up a normal life 
which includes community living will help with that 
improvement he said 
the survey found that 74 percent of those polled believe 
correctly that anyone can become mentally ill and that mental 
illness can be cured and 53 percent believe that keeping up a 
normal life in the community will help a person with mental illness 
get better 
but two in three believe there is a lot of stigma attached to 
mental illness according to the survey which was commissioned by 
the foundation 
it also found that those with higher incomes were more likely to 
oppose placing mental health facilities in their neighborhoods 
members of families with income of more than 50000 were twice 
as likely to oppose these facilities in their neighborhoods and 
the strongest opponents tended to be older well educated 
professional men who were married and owned a home in a large city 
or a suburb of a large city shore said 
the foundations program on chronic mental illness commissioned 
the study to help in its efforts to encourage acceptance of housing 
for people with mental illnesses 
the study was based on telephone interviews with 1300 adults 
between dec 1 and dec 11 1989 
it was funded by the foundation the american psychiatric 
association the national institute for mental health and the pew 
charitable trusts

one american does 20 to 100 times more damage 
to the planet than one person in the third world and one rich 
american causes 1000 times more destruction a population expert 
said thursday 
the most serious population problem in the world is right here 
in the united states said paul ehrlich stanford university 
professor of population studies 
the most common misperception of the population problem is 
that its a problem of poor indians who dont know how to use 
condoms he said actually the problem in the world is that 
there are too many rich people 
ehrlich and other environmentalists spoke to about 1200 
students teachers gardenclub members and corporate executives at 
a conference on solving global environmental problems 
he said the current world population of 53 billion is 18 
billion more than in 1968 when he first prophesied the problems of 
overpopulation in his book the population bomb 
he and his wife anne howland ehrlich who cowrote the current 
book the population explosion say this decade will be the 
turning point for global environmental problems 
if we dont see some real action in this decade it will 
probably be too late to avert some very serious problems 
including inadequate food production global warming species 
extinction and deforestation said mrs ehrlich associate director 
for the center for conservation biology at stanford 
ehrlich railed against highly developed nations like the united 
states that he claims consume too much of the worlds resources 
the birth of a baby in the united states is something on the 
order of 20 to 100 times more disastrous for the life support 
systems of the planet as the birth of a baby in poor countries like 
bangladesh or venezuela he said 
most developing countries fall within the range with bangladesh 
among the poorest and venezuela among the richest third world 
countries mrs ehrlich said 
she said she and her husband based the figures on 1987 
statistics compiled by the united nations on per capita commerical 
energy consumption an index used by environmentalists to measure 
damage to the earth 
if its a rich baby it could be a thousand times more 
erlich said actually the problem in the world is that there is 
much too many rich people its not how many people you have 
but how those people behave 
people who drive gasguzzling luxury cars aircondition their 
homes and live from what ehrlich calls 
highintensitythehellwithtomorrow agriculture do far more 
environmental damage than subsistence farmers he said 
but he was not promoting the idea that americans should adopt a 
peasant lifestyle 
in highly affluent sweden the average person uses about 60 
percent as much energy as consumed by the average american ehrlich 
said 
we are super consumers and very unselective and were 
extraordinarily incompetent and sloppy with our technologies he 
said 
several environmentalists at the conference echoed ehrlichs 
assessments on overpopulation and his claim the world is running 
out of time to find solutions 
you cannot address the problems soon enough said george 
woodwell president of the woods hole research center in woods 
hole mass 
we are driving the earth into impoverishment we are living on

themselves to a chain stretched across a onelane bridge leading to 
the dump site in caneadea which is about 65 miles southeast of 
buffalo 
i remember allegany county when it was so clean and so 
beautiful said one of the protesters ermena barber of 
friendship weve got to go back to those days even if weve got 
to give up a lot of things to do it

lowincome families that receive food stamps 
will keep most of those benefits despite an increase in the minimum 
wage a senior agriculture department official said thursday 
every case is different but most food stamp recipients will 
keep at least 64 cents in benefits for each dollar they gain in 
wages said assistant secretary catherine bertini who oversees 
usda food and consumer services 
the food stamp program is not an alternative to work she 
said in a statement we want to encourage people to work earn 
money and support themselves and their families 
the federal hourly minimum wage rose to from 335 an hour april 
1 and will increase again next april 1 to 425 an hour 
food stamp benefits are allocated on the basis of several 
factors including household size and net income as determined by 
deducting expenses for such items as housing utilities and day 
care 
bertini cited an example of a family of three claiming the 
maximum deduction for housing earning 580 per month in wages and 
receiving 207 in food stamps under the new minimum wage law the 
familys earnings would increase by 78 to 658 per month while 
food stamp benefits would be reduced by 19 per month 
that would total 787 per month under the old minimum wage and 
846 under the new a net gain of 67 per month she said 
the gain in wages more than makes up for the loss in food 
stamps bertini said in fact for each new dollar earned with 
the new minimum wage this household would keep 76 cents in food 
stamp benefits 
more than 19 million people get benefits under the food stamp 
program which is estimated to cost 148 billion this year

the prime minister resigned thursday 
following six weeks of prodemocracy demonstrations across the 
himalayan kingdom highly placed sources said 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a formal 
announcement of the resignation of prime minister marich man singh 
shrestha would be made soon by king birendra they said shrestha 
prime minister since 1986 submitted his resignation thursday night 
at least 16 people have been killed in confrontations between 
demonstrators and police since feb 18 when two banned political 
groups the nepali congress party and a coalition of leftwing 
parties began agitating for a return to a multiparty democracy in 
one of the oldest monarchies in the world 
the first sign that there were differences in the government 
over the handling of the prodemocracy movement came when 
shailendra kumar upadhyaya resigned friday as foreign minister 
upadhyaya said he was resigning because he considered it 
immoral to stay in a cabinet headed by the prime minister 
upadhyaya said he had advised shrestha to hold talks with the 
agitators but he did not listen to me my advice to him went 
unheeded 
on sunday king birendra shuffled shresthas cabinet dropping 
nine ministers although no reasons were given for the reshuffle 
wellplaced observers said it was to remove dissent within the 
government 
the government has not shown any signs of holding talks with the 
agitators despite the momentum the movement is gathering daily 
at least 3000 telecommunication workers defied a government ban 
on strikes and walked off their jobs on thursday employees at 13 
other government and semigovernment corporations also struck 
this week airline pilots lawyers doctors teachers and 
engineers have stopped working expressing support for the 
prodemocracy movement 
the agitators are demanding an end to a 29yearold royal decree 
banning political parties 
power in nepal is shared by the monarch and a partyless 
rashtriya panchayat or national assembly onefifth of the 
assemblys 140 members are nominated by the king and the rest are 
elected but members are not allowed to belong to any political 
party or propagate political ideology 
a twoyear experiment with a westernstyle democracy ended in 
1961 when birendras father king mahendra dismissed the 
government of the nepali congress party accusing it of 
mismanagement and corruption

a humpback whale was found tangled in 
fishing nets off the virginia coast thursday morning but the huge 
mammal apparently either freed itself or drowned before officials 
could rescue it 
it may be that he broke free from the net he appeared to 
leave the area rapidly said mark swingle a curator at the 
virginia marine science museum the museum along with the virginia 
institute for marine science organized the rescue operation 
the whale was spotted in the atlantic ocean just off this resort 
city near rudee inlet said museum director c mac rawls the 
whale slowly drifted south dragging nets and anchors along with 
it rawls said 
rescue boats lost sight of the whale shortly before noon 
rawls said a diver rescue was considered but it could be 
dangerous because this animal is so strong it could knock the 
diver into the nets and entangle him he said 
the whale apparently became entangled in shad nets which are 
strung up and down the shallow coastal waters of the area swingle 
speculated the whale may have been in shallow water feeding on fish 
the 35footlong whale was a young animal that probably weighed 
around 30 tons swingle said 
a humpback whale washed ashore last weekend several miles 
farther south of where the entangled whale was seen thursday 
tissue from that whale has been sent to the national marine 
fisheries service for analysis it also appeared to have been 
entangled in a net

your appeals to the supreme council of the republic of lithuania

of independent states creates concerns for the soviet union and for

situation as complex demanding wellbased discussions and 
acceptable decisions we value highly your efforts aimed at the 
peaceful solution of problems however certain questions connected 
with your position are not quite clear to us lithuania as before

to hold soon initial bilateral consultations with the goal of 
clarifying the positions of both sides on the questions that 
interest them

the existing economic cultural and humanitarian ties with the 
ussr 
we believe that you esteemed president will prefer a political 
solution of the problem to all others in view of this the supreme 
council of the republic of lithuania once again affirms its 
readiness to enter a dialogue and discuss measures of establishing 
new relations between our states

said the area should be reincorperated into south africa radio 
reports said 
col gabriel ramushwana 48 deputy chief of the venda defense 
force announced the coup in a broadcast over radio thohoyandou he 
said the government of president frank ravele had been corrupt and 
unstable and the country had been plagued by lawlessness boycotts 
and human rights violations 
the independent south african press association confirmed the 
report and said there was singing and dancing in the streets of 
venda as news of the coup spread 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp said ravele 
and his cabinet resigned it said nothing about a coup 
raveles government was the target of mass protests in recent 
weeks that shut down schools transportation and government 
services

reincorporated into south africa this would allow venda residents 
to receive the benefits that go with south african citizenship 
they also demanded an investigation into allegations some cabinet 
members participated in ritual murder and witchcraft 
several of the demonstrations were dispersed by police gunfire 
and there were reports of casualties although the exact number is 
uncertain 
ramushwana made no mention of raveles fate he told everyone to 
go home and return to work on monday friday is a national holiday

israelis are increasingly demanding electoral 
reforms as cases of politicians offering favors for support to form 
a coalition government become more blatant 
there is a complete breakdown in trust said law professor 
uriel reichman who is leading the reform campaign politicians 
are using their power to enhance their own political ambitions by 
bribing parties and legislators 
examples abound 
hours before he left the finance ministry last month labor 
party leader shimon peres gave 35 million to religious 
institutions belonging to an ultraorthodox faction he hoped would 
support his bid to become prime minister 
the rival likud offered a 25 million guarantee to ensure its 
promise of a new cabinet post to economics minister yitzhak modai 
who had threatened to defect to labor the money did not reach the 
10 million modai demanded 
both labor and likud archrivals in the race to form a 
government adopted a lastminute budget amendment march 30 giving 
110 million to religious institutions triple last years 
allocations 
israelis are used to a certain amount of dealmaking in coalition 
negotiations as israels political system often makes small 
parties the kingmakers between the two major parties 
but the desperate steps taken by both the leftleaning labor and 
the rightwing likud have brought an unprecedented call for reform 
newspaper editorials student groups womens groups and even 
some politicians have urged a change in the system 
the most dramatic appeal has come from two army reserve officers 
who began a hunger strike thursday in a park opposite parliament 
the same day peres announced he had succeeded in piecing together 
a ruling coalition to replace the one that collapsed over 
disagreement on middle east peace moves 
the strikers have since been joined by eight others in their 
fast they met with thousands of wellwishers and collected 25000 
signatures calling for electoral reform 
ohad limor a lieutenant in the army reserves said he joined 
the hunger strikers after parliament approved the extra funds for 
the religious parties 
when i heard this i said thats it no more this is not 
something you see on television this is my life said limor 25 
sitting on a beach chair outside a tent 
most of those opposed to the current political system have only 
vague notions about what should replace it but there is nothing 
that could be worse than what we have now limor said 
reichman who says he has support from 68 israeli mayors made 
three demands direct election of the prime minister direct 
election of at least half the legislators and adoption of a bill of 
rights 
the current system has israelis voting for parties not 
individual candidates any party capturing 1 percent of the total 
vote in the country wins a seat in the 120member knesset 
reichmans public committee for a constitution for israel and 
other protest groups called a rally in tel aviv for saturday and a 
wide range of organizations have urged members to attend 
likud facing the possibility of a laborled government jumped 
on the bandwagon thursday it offered to set up a transition 
government with labor to legislate reform including the direct 
election of the prime minister 
the reformers chances for success are up against a long history 
of broken promises from legislators who benefit from the existing 
unbalanced system 
but reichman and others were optimistic that the tide could not 
be turned back this is a critical moment in the history of the 
country there is hope that from the present chaos a new chapter in 
our history will be written

a tearful but defiant leona helmsley vowed 
thursday i am not going to jail after her attorneys asked a 
judge to dismiss state income tax evasion charges against her 
the 69yearold selfproclaimed hotel queen was convicted last 
year of federal income tax fraud and sentenced to four years in 
prison but is free on bond pending appeal 
she still faces state charges that she her husband and two 
former employees falsified 3 million worth of business and tax 
records from 1982 to 1986 
mrs helmsley sat quietly through the proceedings in manhattans 
state supreme court but surrounded by reporters as she left the 
courthouse she again protested her innocence 
enough is enough she said in a hoarse voice occasionally 
choked by tears i am not going to jail ive done nothing wrong 
my only crime is that im leona helmsley for that im guilty 
her attorney sandor frankel told justice john ak bradley 
that his client has already been enormously punished by the 
federal prosecution 
he also argued that the state charges constituted double 
jeopardy the federal indictment contained at least 10 charges 
specifically dealing with state income taxes he said 
the government should not be able to take multiple bites out 
of the human hide he said 
assistant attorney general alfredo mendez said that the 
188count state indictment contained many other charges not 
prosecuted by federal authorities 
it is in fact in the interest of justice that new york tax 
cheats be brought to justice he said 
the judge asked frankel if i dismiss the indictment would 
not the public conclude that theres one law for the rich and 
another for the poor 
the fact that were here judge frankel replied isnt 
that saying there is one law for the wealthy wellknown and 
vilified and another for everyone else 
frankel also asked bradley to allow a pretrial hearing to 
establish whether the indictment originated through a tainted 
chain from testimony mrs helmsley gave under a grant of immunity 
in a separate 1985 investigation of sales tax fraud 
her attorneys maintain that leaks to the media a year later 
about her testimony prompted mrs helmsleys enemies to contact 
reporters about other activities which led to the state and 
federal investigations 
bradley said he would rule on the motions on may 17 
mrs helmsley faces up to four years in state prison if 
convicted 
her husband harry 80 was found mentally incompetent to stand 
trial in federal court and wants to have the state charges against 
him dismissed on the same grounds an april 30 court date was set 
to address that issue 
in december mrs helmsley rejected an offer to serve a prison 
term concurrently with her federal sentence in exchange for 
pleading guilty to evading 750000 in state income taxes 
the two former executives joseph v licari and frank j turco 
have accepted similar deals

prosecutors urged jurors thursday not to let 
sympathy or psychobabble prevent them from finding a college 
student guilty of firstdegree murder in the drowning of her 
newborn in a dormitory toilet 
claire moritt showed no expression as the state used its 
summation to attack the defense argument that she was legally 
insane out of touch with reality and had no memory of being 
pregnant or even giving birth 
to allow your sympathy your anger psychobabble theories to 
enter into your deliberations increases the chances of turning in 
an unjust verdict said assistant state attorney stephen 
crawford just apply your common sense apply the obvious 
facts 
meanwhile circuit judge richard lazzara dismissed a juror after 
a customer in a downtown lunchroom overheard her telling her 
sisterinlaw about the case he then sequestered the jury until a 
verdict is reached 
the case was heard by 16 jurors and will be decided by 12 
members the jurors had not been told which of them were alternates 
in his closing arguments crawford recounted in detail the 
morning of oct 23 1989 to prove the 18yearold hillsborough 
community college student from hollywood gave birth in her dorm 
room and made a conscious decision to kill her baby son 
using a chalkboard diagrams and a photograph of the dead 
6pound 9ounce infant crawford told how a roommate awoke to the 
sounds of a baby crying 
when roommates finally entered the bathroom they found ms 
moritt kneeling and the baby stuffed in the toilet headfirst 
wrapped in bloody towels and sheets 
defense attorney b anderson mitcham tried during his final 
arguments to discredit the prosecutions case one witness at a time 
he noted discrepancies in the testimony of the roommates about 
whether there were towels and sheets covering the baby he said the 
medical examiner blew the autopsy and questioned why the bloody 
linen was never tested for blood type 
did the prosecutor prove his case beyond and to the exclusion 
of a reasonable doubt i think not mitcham said 
if convicted of firstdegree murder ms moritt would 
automatically be sent to prison for life without possibility of 
parole for 25 years because the prosecution did not seek the only 
other penalty the electric chair

the united states and the soviet union have 
seven short weeks to put together a summit package of nuclear 
weapons cutbacks and to find common ground on german unification 
and ways to awaken the sluggish soviet economy 
but as secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze plodded past the midpoint of this 
weeks heavy presummit agenda the outlook for meeting the may 30 
deadline with solid accomplishments was uncertain 
in fact the summit may turn out to be less of a ceremonial 
signing event than a working session for president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
its going to be a working visit no time for sightseeing 
is the way gennadi gerasimov the spokesman for the soviet foreign 
ministry described gorbachevs trip here 
whatever reasons gorbachev had for advancing the summit it was 
initially planned for the second half of june the effect is to 
put additional pressure on negotiators grappling with three of the 
most complicated arms control treaties in history 
and officials on both sides suggested on thursday chances of 
finishing the accord to cut longrange nuclear missiles by the time 
gorbachev comes here to see bush are virtually nil 
the most optimistic projection is that baker and shevardnadze 
and negotiators meeting in geneva will be able to reach agreement 
by may 30 on the key issues and leave the details to be mopped up 
after the summit 
taking into account its in seven weeks yuri nazarkin the 
chief soviet start negotiator said its impractical i think 
to expect its going to be signed at the summit but definitely 
all the major issues should be resolved making the treaty ready 
for signing later on 
similarly a senior us official said it depends in some 
part on what were able to do here the desire was to resolve all 
the major issues by the summit meeting and looking realistically 
toward completing and signing a treaty later in the year 
that could mean a second bushgorbachev summit by the end of 
1990 but no strategic arms reduction treaty before then 
there are knotty problems confronting the ministers and the 
negotiators among them how to limit cruise missiles aboard 
planes submarines and surface vessels and how to verify the 
cutbacks are being implemented 
the outlook is somewhat better for bush and gorbachev to be able 
to approve protocols for monitoring underground nuclear test 
explosions 
on the third arms control front the two sides are in tentative 
agreement to slash their chemical weapons stockpiles to 20 percent 
of the current us level but sergei b batsanov a soviet 
negotiator said there was no agreement yet on two big issues how 
to dispose of weapons and when to end production 
the white house had left setting a precise summit date to the 
soviets taking a flexible approach bush wanted gorbachev to set 
his own timetable 
the soviet leader has a date june 19 in moscow to take up 
creation of a communist party for the republic of russia as well as 
the big soviet communist party congress beginning july 2 
evidently he wanted more time between the two sessions than 
holding a late june summit with bush would allow 
as a result us and soviet officials will have to hurry their 
consideration of the kind of economic assistance the bush 
administration might extend to the soviet leader for his 
perestroika program of restructuring the soviet economy that could 
mean anything from technical advice to trade credits congress will 
have to be sounded out as well 
pushing up the summit also shortens the time for the soviets to 
find a peaceful solution to their problems with breakaway lithuania 
and to work out a formula on german unification tensions in either 
area could cloud what bush and gorbachev hope will be another 
milestone in improving superpower relations

second time to kill a swiss hostage in lebanon unless two lebanese 
jailed in france and switzerland were freed 
the threat was phoned to a western news agency in nicosia by a 
man who said he was speaking for the action group for the release 
of hariri authenticity of the call could not be verified

life in switzerland for air hijacking and murder and anis 
naccache serving a life sentence in france for an attempt to 
assassinate an iranian emigre leader in paris 
they gave march 12 as a deadline 
the same caller said thursday we did not execute one of the 
swiss hostages because of his past humanitarian work in sidon 
this time unless the lebanese pair are released he said we 
will execute the first hostage after the blessed month of ramadan 
he referred to the moslem holy month scheduled to end about 
april 26 depending on the sighting of the new moon 
our demands are clear which is the release of fighter 
mohammed hariri and fighter anis naccache the caller said he 
spoke arabic with a south lebanese accent 
after the first call the international committee of the red 
cross and the swiss foreign ministry expressed doubts about the 
authenticity of the threat 
there are 18 western hostages in lebanon including eight 
americans 
longest held of the hostages is terry anderson chief middle

an abortion rights organization on thursday began a national 
campaign to register college students to vote against abortion foes 
hollywood actors handed out leaflets at harvard square in 
cambridge mass and at columbia university in new york nearly 
100 students attended a political gathering at a city college in 
santa monica calif where they heard a call to activism 
you are part of a generation that grew up without the fear 
that a crisis pregnancy an unwanted pregnancy could threaten your 
health in a back alley abortion said kate michelman executive 
director of the national abortion rights action league 
the campaign planned events at about 40 colleges thursday and 
friday 
in massachusetts actors judd nelson howard hesseman and 
elizabeth pena stood outside a subway stop and handed out leaflets 
to passersby urging them to register and vote prochoice 
between 40 and 50 people were registered said joyce cunha 
associate director of masschoice an affiliate of the national 
group 
the actors were emissaries from the hollywood policy foundation 
center the nonprofit arm of the hollywood womens political 
action committee 
cunha said students were a key part of the prochoice movement 
which she said had been too complacent before last years us 
supreme court decision allowed states to restrict abortion rights 
this is a right theyve always had i think thats part of why 
we want to help them to educate their peers to understand that the

twothirds of defendants charged with felonies 
in 39 of the nations largest counties were released from police 
custody pending court action the justice department said in a 
study released thursday 
the sampling of 11063 felony cases filed in february 1988 
showed that 66 percent of the defendants were released on bail 
bond or their own recognizance while awaiting trial or ther 
dispositions of their cases 
the study showed that 31 percent were held in jail pending trial 
because they were unable to post bail another 4 percent of the 
defendants were ordered held without bail following their 
arraignments 
the statistics gathered from local courts by the justice 
departments bureau of justice statistics was intended to be a 
sampling of the disposition of felony charges in 75 of the nations 
largest counties 
the study tracked the felony cases from initial filing to 
disposition in courts in 39 local jurisdictions including the 
district of columbia 
of the defendants accused of violent offenses 59 percent were 
released on bail or their own recognizance sixtyone percent of 
murder defendants were kept in custody while 39 percent were 
released on bail or personal recognizance twentysix percent of 
murder suspects were ordered held without bail 35 percent could 
not post enough money to obtain their release 
among accused rapists 55 percent were released while 45 percent 
were detained pending disposition of their cases fiftytwo percent 
of robbery defendants were released as were 66 percent of those 
accused of assault 
seventytwo percent of defendants charged with sale or 
possession of illegal drugs were released from custody while 
awaiting trial the study said 
bail is requested by prosecutors to guarantee that a defendant 
will appear in court for subsequent proceedings and does not 
necessarily reflect the seriousness of the charges against the 
defendant 
to determine if there is a risk of flight judges traditionally 
consider whether the defendant has strong ties to the community 
through relatives or friends 
some jurisdictions such as the district of columbia have 
preventive detention statutes that allow defendants charged with 
serious crimes to be held without bail 
the statistics gathered in the study indicate that defendants 
previously convicted of violent offenses were less likely to be 
released on bail than suspects who had records of other types of 
offenses 
only 33 percent of defendants who already had been convicted of 
violent felony crimes such as rape or murder were released on bail 
by contrast 62 percent of defendants with prior felony drug 
convictions were released on bail 
according to the study 76 percent of those released on bail 
appeared for all court proceedings while 24 percent missed a court 
date 
of the defendants for whom bench warrants were issued 16 
percent were eventually returned to court and 8 percent were 
fugitives after one year

two republican senators accused president bush 
and congressional leaders thursday of reacting too slowly to 
changes in eastern europe and urged cuts in the us nuclear 
arsenal 
frustrated with the administrations fiscal 1991 defense budget 
and with proposed adjustments circulating on capitol hill sens 
william cohen of maine and john mccain of arizona recommended a 
leaner framework including cutbacks for the b2 stealth bomber and 
landbased nuclear missiles 
they propose keeping military spending basically stable over the 
next five years compared to the administrations recommendation of 
modest increases of 2 percent or less each year less than the 
probable rate of inflation 
following the senators plan would mean cutting about 50 
billion from proposed military spending during the five years said 
cohen and mccain both members of the senate armed services 
committee 
the gop senators call for a comprehensive defense strategy and 
further reductions in spending came on the heels of a series of 
congressional attacks on bushs military budget and increasing 
opposition to the administrations favored strategic weapons 
asked on thursday whether colleagues shared the two senators 
sentiments regarding the defense budget cohen said there were 
several republicans and democrats on the armed services panel who 
have yet to identify themselves 
is it a majority yet i think not cohen said a majority 
in a month or two perhaps 
mccain said at the senators news conference unfortunately 
the administration and our leadership here in congress has failed 
to come up with a comprehensive plan 
he and cohen discounted defense secretary dick cheneys position 
that this is a transitional year and the bush administration should 
wait before making major cuts in the pentagon budget 
by waiting another year we run the risk of having numbers 
plucked out of the air arbitrarily and then being forced to cut and 
paste our defense structure to meet budget numbers cohen said 
asked about the pace of pentagon recommendations for change 
mccain said bureaucracies respond with incredible glaciallike 
speed 
cheney when told of the cohenmccain proposal thursday 
defended his own as a responsible plan that does in fact respond 
to the developments weve seen in the world in the last six 
months 
he also said that while no decision has been made to submit a 
revised pentagon budget for 1991 the results of major aircraft 
reviews may lead to piecemeal proposals to further reduce 1991 
spending 
there may be some decisions that youll want to feed into 
the 91 budget process he said the department would make 
decisions within the next few weeks 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
complained recently that the bush budget had several major blanks 
that congress would fill if the administration didnt 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee has criticized the pentagon spending plan for its 
disconnects what he sees as its failure to account for the 
rapid changes in eastern europe and the soviet union 
and on wednesday a bipartisan group of senators renewed their 
plea for canceling the b2 bomber they released a congressional 
budget office report concluding that stretching out the program 
over a longer term would push the cost of each plane to more than 
1 billion 
under the cohenmccain plan the program to build 132 of the 
stealth aircraft at a total cost of more than 70 billion would be 
curtailed cohen however said he favors canceling the plane 
mccain a proponent of the b2 last year said he favors 
limiting production but indicated he could go either way on killing 
the program 
both senators acknowledged that the radarevading plane is in 
serious trouble in congress 
it was in trouble long before our statements mccain said 
later in the day nunn said the b2 bomber faces considerable 
opposition and either the per unit cost or the total number of b2 
bombers has to be cut for the program to fly 
any time you have a weapons system start showing up on 
saturday night live and in the cartoons you know its got 
problems the b2 is in that category said nunn a proponent of 
the plane 
mccain and cohen also predicted that congress will not support 
two landbased nuclear missiles the multiplewarhead 
railgarrison mx and the roadmobile singlewarhead midgetman 
in their proposal they called for negotiating with the soviets 
a trade for the mx while continuing development of the smaller 
midgetman missile 
i feel we should look toward dramatic restructuring of our 
strategic capability to a twopronged system rather than three 
mccain said composed of strategic aircraft capability and our 
submarine trident forces 
the senators also proposed a reduction in the overall number of 
ships deferral of the navys version of the advanced tactical 
fighter and a review of the seawolf attack submarine program 
cheney said wednesday that the pentagon is taking a close look 
at the plan to buy the seawolf the submarine program according to 
mccain is in trouble in congress 
cohen later added that a consensus is developing within the 
senate armed services committee and possibly the house armed 
services committee to change the defense strategy 
we have to reshape our forces whether we like it or not he 
said the answer is this is the reality weve got to make the 
best of that reality

jurors in the irancontra coverup trial of 
former national security adviser john m poindexter provoked 
courtroom laughter thursday by asking for a dictionary 
the jury failed to reach a verdict in its fourth day of 
deliberations 
us district judge harold greene summoned prosecutors and 
defense lawyers to the federal courthouse to discuss how he should 
handle the jurys request 
laughter broke out in the courtroom when the judge read the 
jurys note which said we need a dictionary please 
prosecutor dan k webb told greene he had no objection to giving 
jurors a dictionary unless they wanted to look up a legal term 
already defined in the judges instructions 
turning to defense lawyer richard beckler greene asked 
you have some supreme court cases on that 
beckler said he opposed giving the panel a dictionary but the 
defense lawyer didnt object to greenes proposal to send the jury 
a note offering to provide a definition of a common word 
the judge said he didnt want to send jurors a dictionary 
because the next thing you know they will look up conspiracy and 
theyll know more than we do 
after a 10minute recess during which greene sent a note to the 
jury the judge took the bench 
struggling to suppress a laugh he read the jurys reply to his 
note 
the definition we required before is no longer needed 
the jurys request interrupted an otherwise uneventful day of 
deliberations the jury has been sequestered since tuesday after 
two jurors reported receiving telephone calls from reporters 
poindexter a retired navy rear admiral who served as 
thenpresident reagans top national security adviser from late 
1985 until the unraveling of the irancontra affair in november 
1986 is charged with five felony counts 
poindexter 53 is accused of conspiring with former aide oliver 
l north and others to make false statements and destroy documents 
to obstruct congressional inquiries in 1986 about both elements of 
the irancontra affair 
he is also accused of obstructing congress and making false 
statements by assuring lawmakers that the national security council 
staff was not covertly helping arm the nicaraguan rebels when such 
assistance had been banned by law 
the indictment also charges that poindexter lied to congress on 
nov 21 1986 when he said he did not learn of us involvement in 
a 1985 shipment of israeli hawk missiles to iran until two months 
after it occurred 
the panel of eight women and four men is considering three weeks 
of testimony including videotaped testimony from reagan and 
reviewing nearly 100 exhibits

the defense department asked congress thursday 
for new powers to reduce the officer corps including authority to 
demote some officers to enlisted status if they refuse a transfer 
from active duty to the reserves 
the department also proposed reducing its oversight of defense 
contractors as a costsaving measure and called on congress to give 
the pentagon more leeway in managing its budget 
the proposals were contained in a pair of reports to congress 
that defense secretary dick cheney said were aimed at improving 
pentagon management limiting wasteful spending and improving 
relations between the department and congress 
donald atwood the deputy defense secretary said the department 
needs wider authority to reduce the officer ranks in order to 
maintain a balanced force as troops are demobilized the force will 
shrink by at least 90000 people over the next two years he said 
and more cuts are likely in the years beyond 
he did not say how many officers might be cut 
atwood said the personnel proposals which include incentives 
for officers to voluntarily leave the service seek to avoid 
harming morale in the allvolunteer force 
these are people who have decided to make the military their 
career and we need to have the flexibility to let them leave with 
honor with dignity and with some kind of a financial benefit 
atwood told a news conference 
the department recently proposed to congress that enlisted 
personnel who are forced out of the service be given severance pay 
currently only officers qualify for severance benefits 
atwood also said the pentagon was seeking legislative authority 
to reduce its monitoring of contractors work he said this would 
make the defense acquisition process more like a commercial 
business and thus more cost effective 
he said current law forces the pentagon to use more inspectors 
and auditors of suppliers work than is necessary to ensure the 
work is performed properly 
we almost have to assume theres a dishonest atmosphere out 
there among contractors he said we believe that by reducing 
the degree of inspections and audits that we put on these 
contractors we can save money and we feel well get better 
products 
cheney speaking at the same news conference said that while 
the pentagon could improve its own management system congress was 
partly to blame for inefficiencies in the department 
in a 41page policy paper sent to capitol hill on thursday 
cheney decried the tyranny of the annual budget review by 
congress he said the six major committees that deliberate on the 
defense budget every year should dwell more on overall military 
goals and less on the particulars of individual weapons programs 
cheney said the congressional budget writers give the pentagon 
sometimes contradictory instructions and require too much paperwork 
to justify budget requests he recommended that congress 
appropriate defense money for twoyear periods instead of every 
year 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee gave high marks to cheneys proposal saying this 
overall thrust will be well received on capitol hill 
nunn said he will join sen john warner rva ranking gop 
member on the armed services panel in presenting cheneys package 
as legislation in the senate 
i think secretary cheney is absolutely correct when he says 
that what weve got to have is cooperation not confrontation 
between the department of defense and congress nunn told a news 
conference 
i also agree and have said things very similar to what he said 
about congress role should be broad policy and not getting into 
every detail 
nunn said his committee has done its best on crafting a twoyear 
defense budget but he said until we get an overall budget by the 
white house that gives us the second year of numbers other than 
defense there is no hope of getting a twoyear defense budget 
authorized and appropriated 
cheney reacted coolly to a proposal thursday by republican sens 
william cohen of maine and john mccain of arizona to cut spending 
on the b2 stealth bomber and landbased nuclear missiles as part 
of additional reductions in the 1991 defense budget 
the budget weve sent up there is the one we think is the 
right one he said adding later that the department might 
recommend further cuts later this year after the completion of 
internal reviews of major aircraft programs including the b2

an indiana congressman called thursday for the 
creation of a national ancient forest reserve system to protect old 
forests in the pacific northwest but lawmakers from the region 
said they dont appreciate his help 
the ancient forests of washington oregon and california are 
not less a part of our natural heritage than the grand canyon the 
everglades or yosemite rep jim jontz dind said these 
great forests of the northwest are truly a national treasure 
jontz was joined by the leaders of five environmental groups in 
unveiling his proposal to identify significant areas of ancient 
forests and designate reserve areas that would be managed and 
protected to maintain the biological integrity of the ancient 
forest ecosystem 
jontz proposal was endorsed by the national audubon society 
the sierra club the wilderness society the national wildlife 
federation and the ancient forest alliance 
logging and roadbuilding activites would be prohibited within 
the designated areas under the proposal 
the congressmans involvement in the debate over the northwests 
timber supply crisis has drawn criticism from politicians in the 
region who view him as an outsider with no sympathy toward the 
economic impact on timberbased communities of his proposal 
all i will say is that i know that indianans are experts on 
overcutting the forests because a couple of centuries ago they 
completed the job in their own state so now they are bringing their 
expertise to oregon rep les aucoin dore said 
sen bob packwood rore said he was not familiar with jontz 
or his proposal i think ill introduce a bill to break up all 
the dams on his private rivers the senator quipped 
jontz said he should not be viewed as an outsider 
these are national forests as national forests all of us 
have a stake in their future he said 
under jontz bill the secretaries of agriculture and interior 
would have 45 days to produce maps targeting areas of ancient and 
associated forests to be protected 
in addition to housing trees as old as 250 to 1000 years old 
the characteristics of ancient forests include a mixed canopy 
conifer certain numbers of live species of trees and a certain 
density of snags and down logs he said 
associated forests would be defined as forest and lands which 
are not ancient forests but are still necessary to retain the 
integrity of the ecosystem he said

federal agents raided highpriced call girl 
escort services around the country culminating a twoyear 25 
million moneylaundering sting authorities said thursday 
these are not streetlevel hookers the average receipts were 
for 800 to 1000 an evening said maurice dettmer chief of 
criminal investigations for the internal revenue service 
the raids on more than 40 escort services late wednesday and 
early thursday culminated what investigators called the nations 
largest concerted attack on upscale prostitution 
the probe targeted escort services that accept credit cards 
dettmer said agents created phony businesses in atlanta and in 
tampa to process and disguise more than 25000 creditcard receipts 
for escort services from 23 cities in 15 states he said 
the businesses given the name sunset enterprises often 
disguised the creditcard charges for copying services or converted 
the charges to cash or loans for escort services or massage 
parlors authorities said 
the 25 million in charged payments represented only about 
onequarter of the 10 million to 12 million the escort services 
took in in gross earnings dettmer said 
agents charged a 13 percent to 18 percent fee said tampa police 
spokesman steve cole typically a call girl would collect 500 
the escort service 300 and the agents 200 cole said 
local authorities said the clients included politicians 
entertainers athletes business executives using company credit 
cards doctors lawyers and clergymen but they gave no details of 
the clients 
we expect a lot of bosses and wives will be looking through 
receipts this evening to see if they say sunset enterprises not to 
mention nervous businessmen cole said 
federal and state agents armed with warrants searched the 
escortservice companies for records of prostitution activities 
income and expenses and names of customers and their credit card 
charges said us attorney robert genzman 
also sought was evidence relative to alleged moneylaundering 
activities by escortservice operators to conceal an estimated 10 
million in gross earnings in alleged creditcard fraud genzman 
said 
authorities recently made three arrests in california and one 
each in fort lauderdale atlanta and dallas during the 
investigation after the raids more arrests were expected 
authorities said 
they said federal moneylaundering and taxevasion charges could 
be expected state racketeering and organized crime charges also 
could be filed 
if there are substantial amounts of charges for escort 
services on a corporate or business credit card that would be a 
strong likelihood theres been false tax deductions and they may 
hear from the irs said dettmer 
agents used the telephone directory to find escort services that 
accepted credit cards the reason they take credit cards is 
because businessmen traveling have company credit cards companies 
then deduct it as a business expense dettmer said 
most escort services would pay to disguise creditcard charges 
as going to a copying service said an agent who worked on the 
operation in savannah ga 
the sting began in tampa on a small scale and grew like a spider 
web cole said as word spread agents in the storefront contacted 
the irs after they were bombarded with laundering requests from as 
many as 100 companies 
agents then sent out letters soliticing business cole said the 
escort service would send charge slips to the tampa office agents 
would make up another slip in the name of sunset enterprises and 
send it on to the bank 
the bank would send the money to sunset and the agents in turn 
would pay the escort service with checks that looked like taxfree 
loans

the fbi and other federal agencies 
investigating bombings that killed a us judge and a civil rights 
lawyer are considering offering a 500000 reward a law 
enforcement source said thursday 
the decision on a reward for information leading to the arrest 
of a suspect has not been made pending coordination among the 
various federal agencies involved in the case said the source who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the dec 16 murder of circuit judge robert s vance also being 
investigated by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and 
us postal inspectors the us marshals service which is 
responsible for protecting federal judges may also contribute to a 
reward fund if one is established said the source 
vance a member of the 11th circuit court of appeals was killed 
by an explosion when he opened a package sent to his home in 
suburban birmingham ala two days later a similar bomb killed a 
savannah ga city councilman and civil rights lawyer robert 
robinson 
package bombs that law enforcement officials say are similar to 
the ones that killed vance and robinson were found and defused at 
the offices of the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta and the 
jacksonville fla chapter of the naacp 
officials had considered offering a reward several months ago 
but rejected the idea at the time because they did not want to give 
the appearance that the investigation had reached an impasse 
investigators are also trying to find the source of a series of 
anonymous letters dating back to one sent last august to news 
organizations threatening violence against the 11th circuit

a house armed services subcommittee on 
thursday accused south korean companies of violating us contracts 
by selling military parts and weapons to unfriendly nations 
members of the investigations subcommittee made the charges as 
they urged the bush administration to negotiate a strict contract 
with the asian nation on a proposal to allow korea to manufacture 
parts for and assemble fa18 jets 
lawmakers expressed concerns that south korea might sell the 
aircraft parts to iran 
they are selling to unfriendly countries for a lousy buck 
rep nicholas mavroules chairman of the subcommittee said in a 
statement when you negotiate this contract make sure you get a 
tighter provision with tighter controls to prevent more 
diversions 
the massachusetts democrat cited hearings last year in which it 
was revealed that korean companies had sold m16 rifles 
manufactured under a coproduction deal with the united states to 
unfriendly countries despite a ban on such sales 
the names of the nations are classified 
mavroules said thursday that korean companies have been caught 
violating other coproduction contracts in addition he said the 
asian nation has refused to allow us officials access to the m16 
plant since the subcommittees revelations last year 
rep larry j hopkins of kentucky ranking republican on the 
panel said we have trusted them we have caught them and now 
we are preparing to sign another deal with them 
the subcommittee held a closeddoor hearing on wednesday on the 
coproduction plan for the fighter which calls for the south korean 
air force to acquire 120 fa18 jets 
under the plan korea would buy the first 12 jets directly from 
the us manufacturer mcdonnelldouglas the company would then 
supply kits to korea to assemble the next 36 fighters korea would 
assemble the final 72 with many of the components made in korea 
the navy estimates that the total value of the fighter 
coproduction contract for the united states is about 3 billion 
some 400 million less than if all 120 aircraft were built in the 
united states 
in releasing a statement on the hearing the panel did not 
identify the unfriendly nations but it include a page from the 
daewoo corp annual report for 1988 which showed that the company 
had sales offices in libya iran and iraq 
mavroules said those nations have been the principal buyers of 
koreas military exports from a number of korean companies 
including daewoo 
isnt it in their interest to prove to us that they have 
cleaned up their act mavroules said of south korea

sen bob packwood said thursday a special 
provision of the endangered species act could allow logging to 
continue in the forests where the northern spotted owl lives even 
if the bird is declared threatened or endangered 
lawmakers in the pacific northwest are concerned that efforts to 
save the owl from extinction will have a disastrous impact on the 
regional economy because large tracts of federal forests could be 
put off limits to loggers 
packwood rore said in an interview thursday the special 
provision in the act allowing a committee to consider possible 
economic hardship may provide a way to continue logging 
when the fish and wildlife service decides on the listing it 
is allowed to consider only biological factors but this special 
committee can also consider economic factors packwood said 
the special committee would consist of the us secretaries of 
agriculture interior and army the administrator of the 
environmental protection agency the chairman of the council of 
economic advisors the head of the national oceanographic and 
atmospheric administration and one individual from each of the 
states effected 
they would have the power to set aside the listing in 
essence they could allow whatever economic activities to continue 
even if the species is listed packwood said 
they would have to be sure to try not to affect the species 
but they would have the power to allow the continuation of logging 
if they decided the payments to schools the jobs of mill workers 
and the economic viability of oregon are more important than the 
owl he said 
a request for the convening of the committee can be made by the 
governor of a state effected a federal agency involved in the case 
or an interested party packwood said 
i dont know if i qualify as an interested party but i dont 
think we would have any trouble finding someone to make the 
request im going to call the governor of oregon and talk about 
this he said 
brock evans vice president of the national audubon society 
said he doubted the special committee process would have any impact 
if the fish and wildlife service decides to list the owl as 
threatened or endangered a decision due by june 23 
weve said all along that the more public attention we get 
the better off we are we cant wait for this to become a national 
issue i can see it now the today show and everyone else would be 
running programs on us he said 
evans said a report issued wednesday by a government panel of 
scientists leaves no question that logging must stop across a large 
section of national forests in order to save the spotted owl 
i think the science is overwhelming now if a special 
extinction committee ruled against it it would be clear that it 
was a blatant political act he said

emergency crews packed up their gear and city water officials in 
west virginia and ohio breathed easier thursday as a fuel spill in 
the ohio river dissipated to nearly undetectable levels 
its evaporating and emulsifying to the point where were not 
actively monitoring it anymore said jeanne ison a spokeswoman 
for the ohio river valley water sanitation commission our crews 
are on their way home 
the diluted spill is all that remains of at least 75000 gallons 
of diesel oil gasoline and kerosene that spilled into a tributary 
of the allegheny river above pittsburgh last friday forcing 
western pennsylvania cities to close water intakes 
the allegheny and monongahela rivers meet in pittsburgh to form 
the ohio river 
officials in toronto ohio and weirton wva near the 
pennsylvania border said they planned to keep river water intakes 
closed until friday afternoon both towns shut down their water 
filtration plants wednesday in anticipation of the spill 
were running on wells 100 percent now said larry coxen 
foreman at the weirton water treatment plant we dont want to 
take any chances were meeting all our demands and well probably 
go with the wells another day just to make sure 
across the river in steubenville ohio officials mixed 
activated carbon and chemicals with river water to remove any 
remaining petroleum 
so far we havent picked up anything thats noticeable even 
before the water is treated said john west an operator at the 
steubenville plant were operating normally theres not a whole 
lot of concern here 
twentyfive miles upstream at east liverpool ohio two water 
intakes near the rivers surface remained closed to avoid floating 
or suspended oil a deeper intake remained open to draw water for 
the town of 7000 
officials at wheeling wva about 25 miles downstream from 
weirton canceled an emergency planning meeting that had been 
scheduled for thursday 
to be honest i havent even talked to anybody about the spill 
in two days thats how concerned we are said conrad slanina 
wheelings acting public works director we dont anticipate any 
problems at all 
its gotten to the point where we can just have water plants 
check it for us said chris norman an environmental engineer at 
the cincinnatibased ohio river sanitation commission which 
oversees pollution control on the river 
the organic matter in the water has dissipated so much that 
its easily treatable but it does still need to be treated 
norman said there should be no worry about drinking water and 
little concern about the spills effect on wildlife 
pennsylvania officials on thursday were assessing the damage to 
fish insects and wildlife 
thomas j qualters of the state fish commission said authorities 
recovered about a dozen dead fish along the spills path he said 
more fish could have been killed but have not yet floated to the 
surface 
the impact could be much more serious if the spill interfered 
with spawning which occurs at this time of year for various 
species said qualters 
most pennsylvania towns affected by the spill have returned to 
normal 
water conservation measures remained in effect in six 
pennsylvania communities and residents of harrison county the only 
area where taps went dry were still being advised to boil water as 
a precaution 
guillermo cole a spokesman for the allegheny county pa water 
department said tests conducted wednesday indicated the water is 
nearly back to normal but health officials were concerned about 
globs of oil that could get into some intakes

the corn belt has been selected for a new 
testing program designed to protect groundwater from contamination 
by fertilizers and pesticides agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said wednesday 
yeutter said the research scheduled to begin this summer will 
be undertaken on farmland overlying aquifers in nine states iowa 
kansas minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota south dakota 
ohio and wisconsin 
the research is part of a governmentwide water quality 
initiative provided in the bush administrations budget requests 
he said 
spending for all of the agriculture departments water quality 
activities this year is budgeted at 158 million compared with 
1127 million last year yeutter said the administrations 
request for the fiscal 1991 year that will begin oct 1 is for 207 
million 
yeutter said about 37 million of this years funds has been 
targeted for the corn belt projects 
c richard amerman of the departments agricultural research 
service said the sites were selected because corn and soybeans are 
grown extensively using relatively large amounts of agricultural 
chemicals 
amerman who is executive secretary of usdas working group on 
water quality said researchers will evaluate the environmental 
and economic impacts of various farming practices on underground 
water supplies 
we also will develop and implement new farming practices he 
said in each area well seek advice from farm community 
agribusiness and environmental representatives 
amerman said the project should have broad national 
significance because information from it can be applied to other 
parts of the country

president fw de klerk and 
nelson mandela agreed thursday on a new date for formal talks 
between the government and the african national congress on giving 
blacks a share of political power in south africa 
de klerk and mandela freed feb 11 by the president after 27 
years in prison met for three hours but said the time and place 
for talks to replace a canceled april 11 meeting would be announced 
later the two did not appear together afterwards 
instead at separate news conferences de klerk said he objected 
to the anc pressuring some tribal homeland leaders not to meet with 
the government earlier thursday while mandela said nothing could 
be further from the truth than charges of anc intimidation 
next wednesdays talks were to have been the governments first 
meeting with a delegation of exiled and internal anc leaders but 
the anc canceled to protest against police firing on demonstrators 
killing at least 11 protesters 
de klerk said he was considering appointing a judicial inquiry 
into the march 26 shootings in sebokeng south of johannesburg and 
that an investigation had begun 
mandela said the inquest being presided over by a white judge 
was not conducive to gaining the black communitys confidence he 
said an inquiry commission should include credible black leaders 
de klerk said they also discussed the widespread political 
violence in the country frankly and clearly i had the 
impression that there is a general agreement that violence had to 
come to an end and that there was a need for creating an atmosphere 
in which normal political processes could take place 
mandela said solid progress had been made in a cordial and 
productive atmosphere 
the talks were intended to discuss black factional violence that 
has left hundreds dead in recent weeks and to help prepare for 
formal negotiations on a new constitution to give blacks a share of 
power in south africa 
earlier thursday during an impromptu news conference de klerk 
said i dont have a problem finding anyone to sit down with me 
i just have a problem with those who want to sit down and who dont 
want to allow others to sit down with them 
mandela and other anc leaders have called for unity among all 
black political factions in order to present a solid front at 
eventual negotiations with the whiteminority government 
de klerk said some homeland leaders had been pressured not to 
come and that choice was not voluntary in any sense of the word 
however every homeland leader that the governmentrun 
television interviewed thursday night denied being pressured by the 
anc mandela said he spoke to three of the homeland leaders after 
they had told him of their decision not to meet with the government 
de klerk told reporters that during his meeting with mandela 
i made the point that no one should inhibit discussions which 
need to take place on the widest possible scale 
in addition to mandela de klerk had been scheduled to meet with 
six homeland leaders but four did not show up 
however many south african officials and observers believe the 
anc canceled the meeting because of internal disagreements about 
how to proceed with negotiations 
de klerk and his cabinet have repeated that they want all 
currently recognized leaders to participate in negotiations 
but the anc does not recognize the legitimacy of homeland 
governments and their leaders it says the plan of dividing black 
south africans into 10 tribal areas deprives them of their 
citizenship land ownership and work rights and leaves the majority 
of the country for whites 
four of the 10 homelands have accepted independence but they 
are not recognized as independent by other countries those leaders 
were not invited to the talks 
of the six who were invited two showed up kwazulu chief 
minister mangosuthu buthelezi and qwaqwa chief minister kenneth 
mopeli buthelezi heads the zulu tribes conservative inkatha 
movement and is seen as mandelas main black rival 
meanwhile in venda the smallest of the socalled independent 
homelands there was a report of a coup thursday over the issue of 
independence a radio announcement in the homeland said frank 
ravele president of venda was overthrown in a military coup 
the deputy chief of vendas defense force gabriel ramushwana 
said he wanted the homeland reincorporated into south africa and 
staged the coup

the federal initiative to stem drug abuse and 
related violence in the nations capital has failed the citys 
police chief said thursday 
a spokesman for federal drug policy coordinator william j 
bennett also said one lesson learned from the yearlong effort was 
that civic resolve is needed to make any antidrug program a 
success 
a senior spokesman for bennett later backed away from that 
comment saying bennett doesnt believe washington residents lack 
the resolve needed to reduce drug abuse 
isaac fulwood the district of columbias police chief 
acknowledged that the special antidrug effort announced a year ago 
by bennett has not lived up to expectations 
i think theres enough blame to go around for everybody 
fulwood said i would say everything has failed right now because 
we havent turned it around victory wont be declared until we 
stop the murders 
however city administrator carol b thompson said we think 
we have made great strides in addressing the problem 
the federal government originally promised to direct an extra 
100 million to drug programs in the district primarily for 
additional jail space that money has gone unspent because the city 
has failed to agree on a plan for jail construction 
the administration also assigned military prosecutors to 
district drug cases offered money for new drug treatment centers 
and established a special drug enforcement administration team 
bennett spokesman david robb said thursday that one of the 
lessons learned from the special effort was that lack of civic 
resolve on the part of citizens in any city can block efforts to 
control the drug problem 
but don hamilton bennetts main spokesman later disavowed 
robbs comment 
it is not the view of the office or of director bennett that 
there is any lack of resolve on the part of the citizens of the 
district or anywhere else to combat drugs hamilton said we 
dont believe there is a lack of citizen resolve 
robb had cited the districts failure to find a site for a 
pretrial detention center that bennett pushed a year ago when he 
announced the intensified battle against drugs 
everyone needs to play a part in this robb said thats 
the lesson that you learn from dc 
robb and hamilton both refused to confirm or deny whether the 
12month report on federal efforts to curtail washingtons drug 
problem will say its been a failure as the new york times 
reported 
we have committed ourselves to report on both successes and 
failures every six months robb said 
bennett and city officials said a news conference to announce 
the update has been scheduled for april 13 
there have been 127 homicides in the nations capital so far in 
1990 the city recorded a record 438 in 1989 authorities have 
blamed more than 60 percent on drugs 
unidentified federal officials told the times that washington 
has failed to demonstrate a commitment to control drug abuse 
the sources blamed bennett saying he oversold the program and 
failed to back up his promises with federal funds the newspaper 
reported 
both city and federal officials agreed that illegal drugs remain 
relatively cheap and plentiful and drugrelated murders have not 
abated 
we need to improve the lines of communication fulwood said 
fulwood said the city has made progress in expanding 
communitybased street patrols and other anticrime programs 
hamilton said the report was not completed 
i dont think were going to say everything in dc is 
hunkydory and we should get a ride down pennsylvania avenue on 
rose petals but the reports not done yet he said

sen alan dixon dill asked president bush 
on thursday to explain why he has not issued an executive order 
ensuring that chinese students would not be sent home against their 
will 
i am quite concerned about recent statements from the white 
house spokesman mr marlin fitzwater concerning your promise to 
issue an executive order protecting the chinese students in this 
country dixon said in a letter to bush 
fitzwater said wednesday that bush did not issue the order 
covering the students as he said in january he would and relied 
instead on a directive by attorney general dick thornburgh 
that directed the head of the immigration and naturalization 
service to protect the chinese students many of whom did not want 
to return home after last junes crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
but dixon said bush should issue the executive order as 
promised if bush does not take such action dixon said he will 
introduce legislation to protect the students as their visas to 
study in the united states expire 
similiar legislation became a target of controversy earlier this 
year congress passed it but it was vetoed by bush the house 
overrode the veto but in the senate the override effort fell short 
of the necessary twothirds majority

savage shelling broke out at sundown 
thursday between rival christian forces leaving 14 people dead 
east beirut ablaze and shattering a brief ceasefire requested by 
church leaders 
flames lighted the night sky huge clouds of smoke obscured much 
of the embattled christian enclave north of the capital as shells 
and rockets rained down from mountaintop and coastal positions 
hundreds of cars are smoldering and dozens of apartment 
buildings as well as hospitals and churches are burning nothing is 
being spared said a police spokesman who gave the toll as 14 
dead and 27 wounded 
thousands of families in east beirut and jounieh are in 
basements and bomb shelters seeking refuge from the mad 
bombardment 
police said the fourstory building housing renegade gen michel 
aouns radio and television stations in east beiruts hazmiyeh 
district was burning after taking a barrage of phosphorous bombs 
both stations went off the air 
aouns gunners targeted the voice of lebanon radio station and 
the lebanese broadcasting corp tv station outlets of the lebanese 
forces militia of his rival christian military chief samir geagea 
the spokesman said 
were taking a lot of shells but so far were all okay said 
an announcer over voice of lebanon 
the stations 14story building is in east beiruts ashrafiyeh 
district 
lebanese broadcastings tv station in the christian port of 
jounieh 12 miles north of beirut said shells fell near its 
buildings but it was not hit 
a salvo set off fiery explosions at a lebanese forces ammunition 
depot in jeita near jounieh said the police spokesman whose name 
cannot be used under standing rules 
the struggle for control of the christian enclave has killed 855 
people and wounded 2325 since it began jan 30 and inflicted 1 
billion worth of damage 
the violence broke a lull of a few hours after aoun and geagea 
told their fighters to abide by a truce called by maronite catholic 
clergymen 
it was the 16th ceasefire in the fighting and the shortest 
twenty maronite church leaders under patriarch nasrallah sfeir 
warned that the geageaaoun war was threatening the christians 
very existence in lebanon and the orient 
syrianbacked president elias hrawi told an agricultural 
delegation that visited him in moslem west beirut his government 
was prepared to take over control of all army garrisons in the 
christian enclave 
but he did not indicate he was ready to order his 22000 
predominantly moslem troops under gen emile lahoud to force 
their way into the christian enclave 
hrawis address was broadcast by several radio stations 
in what appeared to be a call to aouns troops to give up their 
loyalty to the general hrawi said i hope that the military in 
the eastern areas will be true to its oath of maintaining loyalty 
to lebanon not to individuals 
because of the confrontation about 250000 people onequarter 
of the christian enclaves original 1 million population have 
fled the region to seek refuge in safer areas of lebanon and in 
neighboring countries 
aoun geagea hrawi and lahoud are maronites the largest 
christian community in lebanon 
the maronites have traditionally controlled key government 
posts the army command and judiciary since independence from 
france in 1943 
hrawi was elected by lebanons parliament that also adopted a 
peace plan last year giving moslems a 50 per cent share of power 
aoun balked and refused to accept hrwais presidency and hrawis 
dismissal of him as army commander 
the clergymen called the ceasefire hours after geagea said he 
was prepared to hand over to lahoud the three army camps in the 
kersrouan and byblos provinces controlled by his militia north of 
beirut

the former east german secret police 
eavesdropped on the telephone conversations of chancellor helmut 
kohl president richard von weiszaecker and at least 10000 other 
west german officials a newspaper reported thursday 
cabinet ministers businessmen and the leadership of the armed 
forces also had their phones tapped the conservative west german 
daily die welt said in an article released to news media in advance 
of its publication friday 
the outgoing communistled government ordered the hated secret 
police known as stasi dissolved in december following a peaceful 
revolution that ousted dictator erich honecker 
there were numerous demonstrations and violent takeovers of 
secret police buildings by angry citizens 
the stasi force once had 85000 paid agents and more than 
100000 informers among east germanys 16 million citizens 
the huge eavesdropping operation was performed with powerful 
transmitters and computers stationed in east germany and 
neighboring czechoslovakia the newspaper said 
the computers were programmed to recognize certain numbers and 
could even pick up calls placed from telephones with secret 
numbers die welt said 
the article cited unidentified western security officials as 
saying the folders with the secret numbers must be kept from 
falling into the hands of the soviet kgb 
the stasis special monitoring service was saved from 
dissolution by the army which continued to monitor the west german 
telephone calls despite growing links between the two german states

the senate on thursday approved legislation 
authorizing us aid to the new democratic governments in panama 
and nicaragua but president bushs deadline for action on a more 
important money bill for those countries slipped by without a vote 
on a voice vote the senate approved a measure that would permit 
spending of up to 470 million this year to aid panama and 300 
million for nicaragua it also included 30 million for africa and 
70 million to pay costs of resettling soviet jewish emigres in the 
united states 
the new spending would be paid for through cuts in the pentagon 
budget in what amounts to the governments first application of a 
peace dividend from reduced eastwest tensions 
to provide aid to the two central american countries congress 
must first authorize the aid programs then pass separate 
legislation appropriating the money for them bush had sought 
completion of the entire cycle by thursday but congress left for a 
12day easter recess without doing so 
the house has passed a 24 billion money bill that includes 
420 million for panama and 300 million for nicaragua but 
companion legislation to authorize the spending is mired in the 
foreign affairs committee 
the senate passed its authorizing bill on thursday but will not 
act on the crucial money legislation until it returns to washington 
on april 18 
aid proponents have argued that the two countries economies 
battered by us trade sanctions and by military action need quick 
infusions of aid to stabilize the new democratic governments and to 
demonstrate the benefits of democracy 
we need to make sure democracy has a chance to take root and 
flourish said sen christopher dodd dconn thats not going 
to happen if people find they are no better off tomorrow than they 
were yesterday 
administration officials said they now hope the aid measure can 
be completed by the time nicaraguan presidentelect violeta 
chamorro is inaugurated on april 25

frederic castet charged back into the fashion arena 
with several shows in his new fur and fashion shop this week 
after 20 years as fur creator at dior castet bowed out when new 
management came in over two years ago 
now with backing from banks and friends he has launched his 
own firm and boutique in the fashion district near the 
champselysees 
and hes feeling bullish about furs because france is a country 
where animalrights campaigns are relatively modest many 
frenchwomen are proud to wear coats from unendangered species 
such as sable fox or mink 
in any case castet has covered all the options 
hes patented a soft new fake fur called castiss which he 
uses cleverly in everything from white greatcoats to linings for 
mink it looks a lot like sheared raccoon beaver or even seal 
depending on how castet uses it 
the showstoppers were cartoon mink coats colorfully cut to 
show an eiffel tower in homage to france a statue of liberty for 
the united states and a cheery tribesman for africa 
they were reminders of castets command of the leatherandfur 
medium he was the first to introduce pictures in mink coats at 
dior some 15 years ago 
but there was lots more to point up the talent of this creator 
from toulouse in the south of france 
the line also included beautifully cut trouser and short skirts 
suits in fine gabardine or cash wool tulipdraped silk dresses 
and several ensembles splashed with castets optimistic logo a 
sunflower 
even more surprising were the cute young numbers such as leather

his sunray effects in 1940sstyle minks are given a snappy 
update and have peppy appeal for all ages

a museum planning to exhibit sexually graphic 
photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe has signed up hundreds 
of patrons in the 10 days before fridays opening the director 
said 
the 175photograph exhibit includes nine pictures of nude 
children or homoerotic and sadomasochistic sex acts it has 
prompted a police investigation and opposition from 
antipornography groups 
director dennis barrie said he expects 3000 ticketholders to 
attend the opening which is restricted to members of the 
contemporary arts center the exhibit opens to the public saturday 
were going to have to regulate the flow into the gallery 
barrie said thursday weve handled about 1000 people in here at 
once but that was our maximum 
about 400 people have paid 25 to 150 to become museum patrons 
in the last 10 days barrie said in a normal 1week stretch the 
museum would be lucky to sign 10 members he said 
the arts center sued city and county law enforcement officials 
seeking a decision on whether the exhibit violates local obscenity 
standards a hearing on the citys request to dismiss the lawsuit 
was scheduled for friday before hamilton county muncipal judge 
edward l donnellon 
assistant city solicitor karl p kadon iii said he intends to 
argue that the lawsuit is based on hypothetical facts because 
police havent taken any action against the museum 
an attorney for the museum marc mezibov said the lawsuit is 
justified because of the public dispute over the exhibit and police 
threats of criminal charges 
attorneys for the arts center on wednesday filed a motion in the 
lawsuit for a judgment by donnellon that the entire exhibit is 
constitutionally protected because it is art despite the sexually 
graphic pictures if donnellon does not grant a judgment the case 
would go to trial 
in a supporting affidavit bruce h evans director of the 
dayton art institute said the exhibit demonstrates mapplethorpes 
skill as a photographer as well as the range of emotional reaction 
his works produce 
it can be for example the breathtaking sense of simple 
beauty of a human figure or floral stilllife or a 
gutwrenching sense of disgust to acts of human sadism evans 
said 
mapplethorpe who was born in floral park ny died of aids in 
march 1989 at the age of 42 
kadon said he couldnt comment on the request because he hadnt 
received a copy 
police chief larry whalen has called the photographs criminally 
obscene but has not said whether police plan to file charges 
whalen did not return telephone calls thursday seeking comment 
more than 1000 museum supporters staged a demonstration 
wednesday protesting police involvement in the dispute barrie the 
director said he was surprised at the breadth of popular support 
we hear it from people in grocery stores and on elevators 
he said im not exaggerating i get on an elevator and total 
strangers tell me keep the faith

a rare virulent form of strep is on the rise in 
at least six states and has been blamed for 11 denverarea deaths 
investigators trying to determine who else is at risk said thursday 
another 29 cases have been reported in denver in the last six 
months the fatality rate is about 25 percent health officials say 
investigations were under way in parts of colorado alabama 
arizona california maryland and ohio where severe strep clusters 
have been reported since sept 1 40 severe strep case have been 
reported in those states said dr ben schwartz an epidemiologist 
in the cdcs respiratory disease branch in atlanta 
forty severe strep cases have been reported since sept 1 
schwartz said 
the strep bacteria has been around a million years and were 
learning more about it to prevent people from getting it its 
actually rather mundane dr roger gollub epidemic intelligence 
service officer for the colorado department of health said in 
denver 
the outbreak has nothing to do with common strep throat 
gollub said its just the strep organism is involved all the 
victims were elderly and suffering from other illnesses too 
gollub said 
common strep symptoms are a sore throat swollen glands and 
fever they can be treated with penicillin 
the severe form of strep is characterized by a sudden onset of a 
very high fever chills shock and low blood pressure there also 
may be skin or muscle infections and pneumonia the investigators 
said 
the severe form known as group a streptococcus bacteremia gets 
past the bodys primary defenses and enters the bloodstream through 
injury infection from a surgical incision or other ways that are 
still unclear 
much of the information on the disease thats been collected by 
the us centers for disease control has come from denver said 
schwartz 
nationally cases of severe strep have occurred at a rate of 
five per 10000 population per year 
health officials around the country have expressed interest in 
working with us and we think it gives a good geographical 
ruralurban mix to the investigation schwartz said its not 
because there have been any problems in those areas it just gives 
us a better picture 
health officials started investigating the bacteria a year ago 
when a cluster of cases was noticed in denver 
a year ago a very smart perceptive infection control nurse at 
a local hospital noticed nine cases in a sixweek period and since 
then we have been looking into it gollub said 
schwartz said he did not want people getting the impression that 
they can die from strep throat or that the disease is rampant 
the important thing to realize is that strep throat is very 
common all kids get it and this is actually strep throat season 
he said parents should really not be worrying that it is going 
to be turning into the severe disease 
but schwartz said if a parent believes that his child has 
strep throat it should be diagnosed and treated 
a denver doctor is working with the world health organization to 
investigate a possible link with a reported strep outbreak in 
europe schwartz said the cdc also is in contact with european 
health officials and has heard of some problems in scandinavia and 
england

an experimental pegasus 
rocket was blasted into space thursday from a b52 and successfully 
delivered its first satellite payload into a polar orbit officials 
said 
pegasus is on its way f18 chase plane pilot jim molka 
radioed to controllers at 1211 pm as the 50foot rocket was 
dropped from its perch beneath the jets right wing 
it looked like a little shuttle heading toward the sky 
bomber pilot gordon fullerton said 
twelve minutes later tracking crews at the amesdryden flight 
research facility at edwards determined the 440pound satellite had 
successfully reached orbit 368 miles above earth 
everything went according to the mission profile said cj 
fenrick spokesman for amesdryden this is a big step for the 
air force nasa and private corporations interested in space 
vice president dan quayle praised the missions success 
todays pegasus launch marks an important achievement for the 
emerging commercial launch industry quayle said in a statement 
this initiative holds great promise for not only the aerospace 
industry but for the us space program as well 
strapped beneath the right wing of the gleaming white and silver 
bomber pegasus was flown to 43000 feet over the militarys 
western test range in the ocean off southern california 
the 41000pound rocket was released and appeared to fall free 
for five seconds then streaked into space trailing a fiery ribbon 
of smoke 
the deltawinged firststage booster flew to 200000 feet then 
second and thirdstage rocket engines ignited to carry pegasus 
into low orbit to eject it and its navy satellite 
developed by virginiabased orbital sciences corp and 
delawarebased hercules aerospace corp pegasus was designed to 
put small satellites into orbit at low cost it has been called the 
poor mans satellite booster 
you are watching history guys orbital sciences spokeswoman 
barbara zedina told reporters i cant believe it you go over 
this so many times in your mind its wonderful 
the estimated cost of a pegasus launch was between 6 million 
and 8 million a fraction of the cost of an atlas or titan rocket 
firing officials said 
the pentagon and the national aeronautics and space 
administration want to use pegasus for military and science 
satellites but pegasus also is expected to attract business from 
companies foreign governments and university scientists who need a 
cheap way to put small payloads in orbit 
in addition to placement of the navy communications satellite 
two other missions were accomplished said jan bodanyi of the 
pentagons defense advanced research projects agency 
remaining on the frame was an instrument package to send data 
back to scientists about the stress on pegasus and its payload as 
it goes through the atmosphere and into space bodanyi said 
two canisters designed to release chemicals to produce an 
artificial northern lights effect also were aboard 
barium mixed with a small amount of strontium released over 
central canada will allow nasa scientists to study the resulting 
glowing space cloud to learn more about the earths magnetosphere 
and ionosphere 
skies were clear when the rocketbearing jet took off at 1104 
am from the mojave desert military base 60 miles north of los 
angeles the mission was scrubbed wednesday because of rainy 
weather

the parliament speaker announced thursday that 
he would convene the legislature next wednesday to approve the new 
government pieced together by labor party leader shimon peres 
peres wanted parliament which is in recess to convene sunday 
allowing the rival likud bloc less time to win back a lawmaker who 
defected to labors side and to convince smaller leftwing parties 
to withold support for peres 
before announcing his decision the speaker dov shilansky 
consulted with fellow likud colleague prime minister yitzhak shamir 
after the attorney general ruled parliament must be convened as 
soon as possible 
he told army radio he reached his decision on wednesday out of 
religious not political considerations shilansky said sunday was 
ruled out so observant jewish parliament members could be home for 
a religious ceremony preparing themselves for next weeks passover 
holiday which commemorates the exodus of israelites from biblical 
egypt 
meanwhile peres met with leaders of three leftwing parties to 
urge them to return to his new government so the middle east peace 
process could continue 
the parties control 10 of the 120 seats in parliament but have 
been critical of labors tactics in trying to form a new government 
on wednesday peres informed president chaim herzog he had 
succeeded in stitching together a ruling coalition the 
announcement came two weeks after he was assigned to replace shamir 
shamir lost a noconfidence vote march 15 in a crisis triggered 
by a dispute over us conditions for holding israelipalestinian 
peace talks peres forced the showdown with shamir who was 
reluctant to accept the us proposals on forming a palestinian 
delegation 
peres declined to reveal who would be in his coalition saying 
secrecy was needed to woo other supporters he is believed to have 
only 61 or 62 members of the parliament pledged to support his 
leadership 
if peres succeeds it would be the first time since 1977 that 
the leftofcenter labor ruled without sharing power with likud

boneweakening osteoporosis cannot be 
prevented by gorging on calciumrich foods university of michigan 
researchers said thursday 
we found that adults with high calcium intakes didnt lose 
less bone and that adults with low calcium intakes didnt lose more 
bone said stanley garn a professor of nutrition at the 
universitys school of public health 
the more bone you have the more you have to lose he said 
in a news release from the university you dont create more bone 
by stuffing calcium into young women any more than you create more 
muscle by stuffing steak into football players 
the study was based on comparisons of xray measurements of 745 
adult mens and womens hand bones taken from 196365 and again in 
1985 the ann arbor university said the subjects also reported 
their eating habits focusing on calcium and phosphorous intake 
osteoporosis a softening of the bones tends to begin with 
women in their early 40s and with men in their 50s regardless of 
their calcium intake the researchers said in a study presented 
thursday at a joint meeting of the american association of physical 
anthropology and the human biology council in miami 
the results were consistent with earlier studies in which garn 
and other researchers found that entire populations with high 
calcium intake as part of their everyday diet suffered bone loss 
comparable to groups eating a predominantly lowcalcium ricebased 
diet 
dr richard mazess professor emeritus of medical physics at the 
university of wisconsin endorsed the findings 
theyre entirely in accord with the rest of the scientific 
evidence to date mazess said in a telephone interview the 
overwhelming evidence is that calcium has very little to do with 
bone loss except in people with marginal intake under 400 
milligrams a day 
the average americans diet supplies 600800 milligrams of 
calcium daily mazess said calcium supplements might benefit those 
receiving less he said but increasing consumption of dairy 
products the most common source of calcium carries higher levels 
of cholesterol and coronary risk 
exercise may help women prevent the disease but the most 
effective treatment is estrogen therapy beginning with menopause 
when the loss of bone mass tends to accelerate mazess said its 
not a calciumdeficiency disease he said 
the michigan study also found no relationship between cigarette 
smoking alcohol or the use of antihypertensive drugs and the 
amount of bone loss

lithuania declared independence from 50 years of soviet rule on 
march 11 entering into a bitter confrontation with moscow 
soviet officials have also complained that polish 
representatives were treating lithuania as a separate state

internal affairs of the ussr foreign ministry spokesman yuri 
d gremitskikh told a press briefing wednesday we assume that 
will be taken into account by the polish side 
despite their displeasure over lithuania the soviets are 
looking to poland as an example for a radical economic reform in 
essence the transition of a state economy to a market economy 
reportedly being considered in the soviet union

a loving grandmother wouldnt give up despite 
what doctors said and helped her injured grandson learn to breathe 
on his own again 
through her persistence and doctors doubt dolores anderson 
helped 9yearold lortray gordon learn to breathe for up to 10 
hours a day without his ventilator 
they said there was no way this kid could live i refused to 
hear that stuff mrs anderson said 
they said hed always be on a ventilator she said they 
wanted me to put tray away into an old folks home i said no 
way forget it 
janna jacobs of the national spinal cord injury association near 
boston said it is unusual for a family member to accomplish what 
mrs anderson did 
what a brave lady ms jacobs said i admire her spirit 
and courage 
the credit belongs to the grandma said dr jim hillman one 
of the boys doctors 
while visiting relatives in vero beach in november 1986 the boy 
darted into traffic and was hit by a car his injury is called a 
hangmans fracture because that is where a noose hits in a 
hanging the fracture was in an area of the spinal cord that 
controls breathing 
he spent two months in a coma in a vero beach hospital then was 
transferred to a tampa hospital where he underwent six operations 
in seven months he then went to a spinal cord center in atlanta 
for six months 
a lot of people had written him off said peggy berger 
director of nurses at west shore hospital where gordon later went 
for treatment his grandmother said no youre not going to put 
him aside she was right 
mrs anderson said she talked to gordon about taking him off the 
ventilator he couldnt say anything but she said he indicated he 
wanted to try 
on the first try she took the air supply away for five minutes 
his diaphragm the muscle that moves the lungs up and down had 
atrophied from disuse but strengthened as she increased the time 
off the machine each day 
in two months when the boy could be off the ventilator an hour 
and a half a day mrs anderson told doctors and social workers 
what she had done 
everybody was in shock they said he cant breathe on his 
own i said come over and see for yourselves 
to help his recovery doctors sent gordon to west shore 
hospital which specializes in the rehabilitation of patients on 
ventilators after five months he can breathe on his own long 
enough to make it through a school day 
mrs anderson is appealing for donations to pay for a van to 
carry gordon to school in hillsborough county where officials say 
he will be the school systems first student to need the assistance

prime minister toshiki kaifu said friday that 
carrying out some of the economic reforms agreed to in washington 
talks with the united states will be painful but could ultimately 
improve the lives of the japanese 
at a news conference kaifu called the reforms a duty that 
japan must discharge as a responsible member of the international 
community 
he said the reforms would benefit not only the united states and 
japan but also the whole world serve to prevent the rise of 
protectionism and thus contribute to the steady development of the 
world economy 
i ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of 
my country kaifu said 
on japans promise to revise laws protecting small retailers 
kaifu told reporters the situation was severe but added i 
believe it is important for me and all of you to think of the 
viewpoint of consumers interests 
influential associations of small shopkeepers have resisted 
changes that would make it easier to open new largescale retail 
stores both japanese and foreign a process that now can take 10 
years the united states contends larger stores are more likely to 
sell foreign products 
the japanese measures included in the interim report on 
usjapan negotiations have been attained after undergoing a 
difficult domestic process and their implementation may in some 
cases be painful kaifu said it is my conviction however 
that they are essential in furthering japans own national 
interest 
the interim report reflects the maximum measures that our 
country can take at this point we will make the whole picture 
clearer in the final report due in july 
kaifu said japan also should express its opinions more openly 
i think we have exchanged frank opinions with the us 
negotiators that is a way in which japan can contribute to the 
rest of the world 
japan said the united states contributed to its 49 billion 
trade imbalance with the japanese because of its large budget 
deficit low savings rate shortterm corporate planning and 
relatively weak education system us negotiators promised efforts 
to remedy these problems 
us officials have also argued the changes sought in japanese 
business practices would benefit japanese consumers who pay some 
of the worlds highest prices as a result of a complex distribution 
system and a web of government restrictions 
some japanese commentators have berated their government for 
relying on us and other outside pressure to make reforms it is 
too weak to push through on its own 
they also say such reforms could strengthen japans economy in 
ways that would make it an even more formidable international 
competitor 
foreign minister taro nakayama said friday against the 
background of the serious largescale trade imbalance the present 
japanus economic relations unless managed properly are in 
danger of suffering grave damage posing a threat of undermining 
the mutual trust which lies at the foundation of the overall 
relationship between the two nations 
he said the reforms have significant bearings upon the 
improvement of the quality of life and the advancement of consumer 
interests in japan 
among japans pledges was one to spend more on public works such 
as housing sewers parks airports and port facilities 
the united states counting on such spending to boost japans 
demand for foreign goods and services had sought a definite 
spending target but japan said it would decide yearly expenditures 
flexibly to avoid overheating the local economy

us and japanese negotiators on thursday 
announced completion of an unprecedented agreement pledging to 
reduce trade frictions by making broadbased reforms in the 
economies of both countries 
the agreement reached after four days of marathon discussions 
set forth a complex set of proposals aimed at lowering americas 
huge 49 billion deficit with japan by attacking structural 
barriers to trade 
under secretary of state richard mccormack the leader of the 
us negotiating team said the talks had produced substantive 
progress in resolving trade differences between the two economic 
superpowers 
a white house statement praised the agreement as an important 
way station along the road leading to a strengthened usjapan 
relationship 
in tokyo japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu said carrying 
out some of the deep economic reforms promised in the talks could 
be painful but in the end would improve the lives of the japanese 
speaking at a news conference kaifu called the reforms a duty 
that japan must discharge as a responsible member of the 
international community 
i ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of 
my country kaifu said 
the talks were unprecedented in their scope because they aimed 
not at boosting sales for specific foreign products but at 
correcting broad barriers to trade in both countries 
for the first time representatives of sovereign states drew up 
detailed lists of the economic shortcomings in the other nation and 
demanded changes 
japanese critics of the effort complained that the united states 
was trying to scrap centuries of japanese tradition and remake the 
country into the image of the united states 
the bush administration insisted that its recommendations would 
benefit japan by increasing competition in a country where 
consumers now pay some of the highest prices in the industrial 
world 
the japanese had their own list of complaints against the united 
states citing americas huge budget deficit low savings rate and 
shortterm planning by us companies as restraints on us 
productivity 
the administration chose not to accept the most politically 
sensitive japanese recommendations to limit americans use of 
credit cards boost gasoline taxes and scrap tax deductions for 
home mortgages 
instead the administration pledged to increase efforts to 
improve americas education system and pointed to proposals the 
white house already is pushing to cut the federal budget deficit 
and to provide tax credits for increased personal savings 
the 22page us section of the report primarily recycled 
previous administration proposals including its effort to get 
congress to enact a cut in the capital gains tax as a way of 
fostering investment 
however the 32page japanese section contained a number of 
sweeping proposals to revamp how businesses is conducted in japan 
among the pledges made by the japanese 
to deregulate japans complex goodsdistribution system 
including a gradual relaxation of restrictions on the establishment 
of large retail stores such a move would allow us and other 
foreign retailers to open outlets in japan 
to increase enforcement of antitrust laws with tougher 
penalties to discourage bidrigging and other collusive practices 
by japanese corporations 
to boost government spending on public works projects thus 
expanding the volume of work on which american firms could bid 
the talks on broad barriers to trade known as the structural 
impediments initiative were launched by the administration in 
july until this week they had made little headway 
but kaifu seeking to lessen growing antijapanese sentiment in 
congress promised bush at a summit meeting in early march that he 
would make lowering trade tensions a top priority for his 
government 
sen max baucus dmont and chairman of a senate trade 
subcommittee said he was impressed with the newfound willingness 
by the japanese to make concessions but he and other members of 
congress said it was critical for the japanese words to be followed 
by action 
i am encouraged that some first steps have been taken on the 
structural impediments initiative but these are only first 
steps baucus said much remains to be done 
sen john danforth rmo said he was concerned because there 
was no enforcement mechanism to make sure japan lives up to its 
commitments in any commercial agreement with japan seeing is 
believing he said 
senate finance committee chairman sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
said he was not yet convinced that japan was willing to put an 
end to its longstanding protectionist practices 
put me down as a skeptic who has seen too many agreements in 
which the results didnt match the rhetoric he said in a 
statement usjapan trade agreements and we had a lot of them 
throughout the 1980s were like nothing so much as a drugstore 
cowboy all hat and no cattle 
since the bushkaifu meeting there has been a flurry of 
activity in trade negotiations agreement were announced in the 
last two weeks to expand the opportunity for sales of americanmade 
telecommunications equipment satellites and supercomputers in 
japan 
some saw the concessions as an attempt by japan to keep from 
being put on a hit list of the countries with the worst 
barriers to trade for the second year in a row the administration 
faces a congressional deadline of april 30 for releasing a new list 
of target countries

a strong earthquake 
shook a section of the marianas islands on friday and rattled 
windows 200 miles away authorities said there were no reports of 
injury or serious damage 
the quake occurred at 715 am 515 pm thursday edt and 
registered 74 on the richter scale according to bruce presgrave 
a spokesman for the national earthquake information service in 
golden colo 
the epicenter was 138 miles northeast of saipan near the island 
of anatahan in the western pacific 
a reading of 74 would make it a major earthquake but the 
only information we have is that it was felt on guam presgrave 
said weve had no reports of damage at all 
we felt it for about 10 seconds everything shook said 
andrew mazella program director at radio station ksai in saipan 
the quake rattled windows and dishes in guam 220 miles southwest 
of the epicenter 
the quake slammed a 15foot wave into tinian a tiny island 
south of saipan and pushed 5 feet of water into houses on tanapag 
a village on saipan island said felix sasamoto civil defense 
coordinator for the islands 
some moorings broke loose in tinian but no other damage was 
reported sasamoto said 
on tuesday all 21 residents of anatahan closest to the 
epicenter abandoned the island after a volcano there showed signs 
of erupting 
a navy crew from guam was checking the volcano friday but 
geologists said the quake and volcanic activity apparently were 
unrelated 
this is different from the volcanic activity that has been 
occurring in the islands said presgrave 
anatahan and saipan are part of the northern marianas chain just 
north of guam about 1500 miles east of the philippines 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 6 on the richter scale can cause severe damage 
in the local area a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable 
of widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale

authorities staged allday rallies in tiananmen 
square on thursday chinas annual day for mourning the dead 
preventing unofficial visits to the symbolic center of last years 
crushed democracy movement 
it was the second time in a week city officials held official 
activities in the square as an excuse for closing it to the public 
the method appeared successful there were no reports of 
attempts to lay wreaths near the square or otherwise honor the 
hundreds and possibly thousands of people killed june 34 when the 
army opened fire on prodemocracy protesters and retook the square 
where they had camped 
authorities reopened tiananmen square without fanfare on friday 
with police standing guard or strolling around continuing a heavy 
presence in the area 
in hong kong however an estimated 20000 people marched in 
honor of the beijing dead many carrying banners or bouquets of 
flowers 
a wreath was left from chai ling a leading activist in the 
beijing uprising who escaped to the west last week after 10 months 
on the run in china patriotic heroes will live forever read a 
banner on the wreath 
thursday was chinas annual qingming or clear and bright 
festival when families traditionally visit graves to mourn their 
dead chinese dissidents abroad through faxes and mailed leaflets 
urged beijing residents to stroll through tiananmen square on 
qingming in memory of the slain protesters 
early in the week however beijing authorities issued orders 
curbing even normal mourning activities such as group visits to 
crematoriums 
the beijing daily newspaper published a letter sunday from a 
city official warning residents to pass qingming in a civilized 
and healthy way and not take advantage of the opportunity to 
create distubances 
schools and factories told people to not to wear traditional 
signs of mourning such as black armbands or white flowers some 
colleges suddenly announced special mandatory political lectures 
apparently in an effort to keep students occupied 
authorities bused thousands of high schoolage communist youth 
league members into tiananmen square in the morning they paid 
homage to chinas revolutionary martyrs and listened to a lecture 
on chinas past struggles against foreign imperialists 
in the afternoon primary school members of the young pioneers 
wearing their insignia red handkerchiefs around their necks 
marched onto the square in formation to hear more patriotic 
speeches both the youth league and the young pioneers try to 
foster marxism among young people 
members of the peoples armed police a paramilitary unit stood 
guard on the squares perimeter dozens of ordinary police 
patrolled adjoining streets making sure members of the public did 
not try to enter they yelled at foreigners who tried to photograph 
the ceremonies 
the city also held official rallies in the square sunday 
another day when overseas dissidents suggested beijing residents 
hold protest strolls there 
the next three months include many other dates when memorials or 
protests might seem apt april 15 is the oneyear anniversary of 
the death of ousted communist party leader hu yaobang a relative 
liberal it was his death that first caused beijing college 
students to take to the streets initiating seven weeks of marches 
for democratic reform 
beijing college campuses were quiet thursday regular campus 
security guards checked identification at the gates of beijing and 
qinghua universities but no other uniformed police were visible 
students played tennis and volleyball in the warm spring 
sunshine none was willing to talk about last years protests 
the mood is tense but everyone agrees it wont be possible 
to try for political change until after senior leader deng 
xiaoping dies said a teacher speaking on condition of anonymity 
the 85yearold deng led china out of its radical leftist 
cultural revolution and introduced marketstyle economic reforms 
but he approved last years violent crackdown on political dissent 
and insists china cannot develop its backward economy unless the 
communist party maintains tight political control 
the hong kong protesters chanted dont forget june 4 and 
democracy will win as they marched through the british colony 
which will revert to chinese rule in 1997 
wearing yellow headbands the crowd laid wreaths at a makeshift 
monument set up at a downtown park a book of condolence was also 
placed there for the people to sign their names 
the signatures will be burned during a candlelight vigil june 4

president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will meet for a superpower summit in the united states 
beginning may 30 us and soviet officials said thursday as the 
two sides broke new ground on germany and on the middle east 
accepting the principle of unifying east and west germany the 
soviets edged away from their demand that the merged country be 
neutralized us and soviet officials reported at the end of a 
long day of bargaining on tough regional issues 
and in another potential breakthrough the soviets said they 
would consider restoring diplomatic relations with israel and 
permitting the direct flight of jews to tel aviv if they had 
assurances the refugees would not be settled on the west bank and 
in east jerusalem 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said several 
major agreements could emerge at the summit including a 
longsought strategic arms reduction treaty to limit longrange 
nuclear weapons 
but bush said merely that the summit would provide time for a 
lot of dialogue and a lot of discussion 
officials on both sides acknowledged that in the more than seven 
weeks remaining it would be difficult to forge agreements across 
the board of ussoviet relations 
but a group of us and soviet regional experts working at the 
direction of secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze achieved surprising 
progress on germany the middle east and also the wars in angola 
and afghanistan 
the soviets insisted as they have in the past that the pace of 
merging east and west germany is too fast however a us official 
told reporters we also got the impression a neutral germany is 
not the only answer to security questions there 
confirming the development a soviet official briefing 
separately said we think neutrality may be the answer but we 
invite people to supply us with other ideas 
he said moscows aim was simply that a unified germany should 
be no danger to its neighbors 
in the middle east the soviets continued their attack on israel 
for settling jews on the west bank and in east jerusalem territory 
that the arabs held until the 1967 sixday war 
however the soviet offer to resume relations with israel which 
were suspended in 1967 and to open direct flights of refugees to 
tel aviv provided they do not settle in the disputed lands was a 
different kind of response than we heard before a us official 
said 
the briefings held for reporters in a state department 
auditorium were conducted under rules that prohibited identifying 
the officials further 
on two other troubled fronts angola and afghanistan the us 
officials said the soviets had shown an interest in elections as a 
way of ending wars in the countries between forces backed by the 
two superpowers to limit longrange nuclear weapons 
earlier soviet negotiator yuri nazarkin said of the possibility 
of signing a ussoviet pact on longrange nuclear weapons 
taking into account the summit is in seven weeks its 
impractical i think to expect it the treaty is going to be 
signed at the summit 
fitzwater said the summit bushs second meeting as president 
with the soviet leader would be a tough love encounter with 
the crisis in lithuania a central topic 
bush and gorbachev last met early in december in a stormtossed 
shipboard summit at the mediterranean island of malta since then 
pushes for independence in lithuania and other regions of the 
soviet union and the soviet response to them have strained 
superpower relations 
simultaneous announcements of the summit came from the white 
house and the soviet news agency tass early thursday as baker and 
shevardnadze were holding their second day of meetings on arms 
control and other issues 
theres still a lot of work to do particularly in light of 
the fact that the summit will begin on the 30th baker told 
reporters so we have our work cut out for us 
shevardnadze who will meet with bush on friday echoed bakers 
remarks there is very little time only seven weeks he said 
both the washington and moscow announcements gave the summit 
dates as may 30 to june 3 
however fitzwater said all five days might not be used it 
could turn out to be a two or threeday summit depending on travel 
schedules he suggested 
us officials were also vague on whether the meeting would take 
place entirely in washington or at some other location as well 
such as the presidents oceanside home in kennebunkport maine 
fitzwater said that the crisis in lithuania would undoubtedly 
be an issue at the summit and that the president intended to 
raise it if anything lithuania makes the summit even more 
important the spokesman said 
i would characterize this summit more in terms of 
demonstrating the kind of toughlove working relationship that we 
were able to develop with the soviet union by virtue of four or 
five summits he said 
gennadi gerasimov the soviet spokesman indicated that baker 
had energetically raised us concerns about the use of soviet 
force in the breakaway baltic state in his sessions with 
shevardnadze there was a serious hardball exchange of opinions 
on this subject gerasimov told reporters 
senate leaders who met with shevardnadze wednesday night said he 
told them gorbachev faced heavy pressure at home including 
criticism for not being tougher on lithuania 
fitzwater said that trade with the soviet union also would be 
discussed at the summit possibly including conditions under which 
the united states might lift the jacksonvanik trade sanctions in 
place since the mid 1970s to protest moscows restrictions on 
emigration of soviet jews 
gorbachev is seeking access to western credit and improved trade 
relations 
bush and gorbachev might also set final terms for reducing us 
and soviet troops tanks and other conventional forces in europe 
fitzwater suggested but a treaty would be finalized at a 35nation 
summit meeting later in the year 
the two leaders also might initial an agreement for a phased 
reduction of american and soviet chemical weapons fitzwater 
suggested an international ban depends on agreement among more 
than a score of nations negotiating terms in geneva

bernstein testified that later the fbi asked him to go to 
california to identify samuels collection items found at the small 
estate of mrs marcos younger daughter irene araneta 
bernstein said he found the items in horrible condition 
with priceless pieces of furniture stacked in a damp dirtfloored 
barn he said mirrors were cracked tables damaged and some 
statues had fingers broken off 
it was heartbreaking he said 
but you are not blaming mrs marcos are you asked gerald 
spence mrs marcos attorney 
bernstein paused then replied yes i do 
spence visibly taken aback asked why 
somebody had to supervise it whose fault was it bernstein

east germanys first freely chosen parliament 
declared the nation a democracy on thursday and began building a 
political system that will lead it to unification with west germany 
the lawmakers elected march 18 in the nations first democratic 
ballot convened for the first time and formally dismantled the 
communist system that ruled four decades 
meeting in the palace of the republic built by the former 
stalinist regime the 400member parliament began rewriting the 
constitution to mirror that of west germany 
the new legislature and the government it creates could be east 
germanys last as a sovereign state because of the moves toward 
unification with west germany 
the parliament empowered christian democrat leader lothar de 
maiziere whose party holds the most seats in parliament to build 
a new government from the 11 parties represented in the legislature 
dr sabine bergmannpohl a christian democrat was elected 
president of parliament and urged that lawmakers do justice to 
our responsibilities and that we soon sit in a common german 
parliament 
bergmannpohl said legislators must work with their west german 
counterparts to merge the nations and bring the capital of a single 
germany back to a united berlin 
some heartening news also came from washington late thursday 
us and soviet officials who are bargaining on regional isssues 
there said the soviets accepting the principle of unifying the two 
germanys edged away from their demand that the merged country be 
neutralized 
a soviet official told a briefing we think neutrality may be 
the answer but we invite people to supply us with other ideas 
thursdays gathering at the palace of the republic was rich in 
symbolism and was the culmination of the revolt that toppled the 
former communist regime in october but the shape of de maizieres 
government and the pace of reunification will likely be worked out 
in backroom negotiations 
forty years of difficult times have ended in this moment 
said lothar piche 63 the oldest member of parliament god 
support our german fatherland 
the first thing the 390 lawmakers in attendance did was elect 
bergmannpolh to be parliaments president 
others seeking the post were outgoing communist premier hans 
modrow who leads a rebuilt prodemocracy party that finished a 
distant third in the march elections he finished third in the 
voting for parliament president behind social democrat reinhard 
hoeppner 
the parliament also created an office of president to be a 
ceremonial head of state and abolished the old communist collective 
body the council of state 
bergmannpohl will serve as head of state until a president is 
elected by parliament 
de maiziere will likely be the premier or prime minister and 
will lead talks in the coming days on forming a new cabinet 
if de maiziere is successful in bringing together the disparate 
political groups parliament will then reconvene april 11 and vote 
on his cabinet nominations 
de maiziere leads an alliance of three parties that has been 
trying to form a coalition with the more leftleaning social 
democrats and a smaller group of liberal lawmakers 
his alliance for germany won the most seats in the march 18 
elections campaigning on the need for fast unification with west 
germany but it needs a broad coalition to ensure the twothirds 
vote necessary in parliament to enact constitutional changes 
required for unification 
while the alliance favors quick reunification with west germany 
the social democrats support a slower pace 
despite their differences the east german parties are united in 
their opposition to a proposal regarding the establishment of a 
single currency for east and west germany 
the west german central bank wants to trade east marks for west 
marks at a 21 exchange rate east germany is demanding a 11 
exchange to help offset widespread uneployment and rising costs 
once the nations are merged 
thousands protested the 21 proposal in the east german cities 
of halle neubrandenburg magdeburg dresden gera and cottbus on 
thursday the government news agency adn reported 
about 50000 people rallied in leipzig where mass protests 
against the old communist government began last fall adn said the 
leipzig protesters were demanding that west german chancellor 
helmut kohl live up to promises of prosperity for east germans 
kohl campaigned hard on de maizieres behalf and promised that 
east germans would be protected as unification proceeded 
east germanys many inefficient and obsolete industries are 
having difficulty competing with the flood of western products 
already available to east germans according to adn 40000 east 
germans lost their jobs in march 
west germany said thursday it is pressing ahead with its plans 
for making the west german mark the east german currency by summer 
in bonn finance minister theo waigel told reporters government 
ministers are examining a 50page draft proposal for replacing east 
germanys nearly worthless currency waigel said the recommendation 
for a 2to1 conversion rate was not discussed by the ministers

a federal judge ruled thursday that the 
citys program for giving minorityowned businesses preferred 
status is unconstitutional 
the socalled setaside program called for at least 15 
percent of budgeted city contracts were go to minorityowned 
businesses and 10 percent to femaleowned businesses 
businesses in which minorities or women held at least 51 percent 
ownership also were eligible for setaside contracts 
a coalition of contractors sued in 1989 contending that the 
program discriminated against them because of their nonminority 
status 
us district judge louis c bechtles order permanently enjoins 
the setaside program he said it violates the fourteenth amendment 
of the us constitution which guarantees the rights of citizens 
city solictor charisse r lillie said the city would appeal and 
is asking for a stay 
philadelphia contracting firm owner barbera bushing said i 
think thats really too bad the maleowned businesses really dont 
care about hiring women 
its already hard for women to get into it this decision 
makes it even tougher she added 
john h widman an attorney for the contractors said he did not 
think minority firms would be hurt by the decision 
now we can focus on what contracting is all about and that is 
skills price and expericence widman said 
mayor w wilson goode has praised the program which was 
established in 1982 under former mayor william j green 
bechtle said he based his decision on a 1989 us supreme court 
ruling that threw out richmond vas program of setting aside 30 
percent of city construction contracts for minorityowned 
businesses 
the supreme court ruled that past discrimination would have to 
be well documented before a program could constitutionally be 
enacted to correct discrimination they ruled that discrimination 
did not exist simply because 50 percent of the richmond population 
was black and only twothirds of 1 percent of the contracts went to 
blackowned business 
philadelphias minority setaside program was aimed at 
correcting a pattern of past and present racial sexual and 
economic discrimination according to the ordinances preamble

armored vehicles rolled into michoacan state 
as opposition supporters were ousted thursday from city halls they 
had shut down in december to dramatize election fraud charges 
against mexicos ruling party 
demonstrators from the democratic revolutionary party prd were 
dislodged from 14 of the 17 city halls closed since the disputed 
december municipal elections according to news reports thursday 
evening at least 80 people were arrested but there was no 
violence the reports said 
the army refused to acknowledge the controversial operation in 
the rugged farming state known as a prd stronghold 
we dont have any information on this absolutely nothing 
said second lt jimenez a defense department spokeswoman in mexico 
city who declined to give her first name 
a presidential spokesman who demanded anonymity said state 
judicial police had dislodged the demonstrators he said the army 
did not take part 
but the government news agency notimex said military police had 
peacefully removed demonstrators some of whom were armd from 
all but three of the city halls by thursday evening notimex said 
80 protesters had been arrested 
mexicos attorney general said there was no violence 
there hasnt been even one blow nor one drop of blood 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo was quoted as saying 
by the private televisa tv network from the state capital of 
morelia 150 miles northwest of mexico city 
the prd issued a statement saying there could be a bloodbath 
in michoacan 
seven people died in february and in march in neighboring 
guerrero state during election fraud protests and the eviction by 
police of prd supporters from occupied city halls 
the prd says the ruling institutional revolutionary party or 
pri which has ruled mexico 61 years cheated it out of victory in 
the december elections in both states 
armored vehicles entered michoacan wednesday according to 
witnesses and news reports the action came the same day the pri 
governor called on federal and state authorities to intervene if 
the prd did not relinquish the city halls 
the fraud protests have brought michoacan to the edge of 
anarchy gov jaime genovevo figueroa zamudio said in a letter 
published in mexico city newspapers 
the pri invariably denies election fraud allegations and often 
makes countercharges of violence against the opposition especially 
the leftist prd 
the question of whether the opposition gets a fair shake at 
mexicos polls remains unresolved mexico unlike panama under 
strongman manuel antonio noriega or nicaragua under the leftist 
sandinistas does not permit international election observers 
television news aired film of military vehicles rumbling through 
the streets of morelia five armored vehicles began patrolling 
ciudad hidalgo 110 miles northwest of mexico city on wednesday 
said hector edmundo tinajero gonzales editor of the local 
newspaper el clarion 
he said he had similar accounts from apatzingan 
the official news agency notimex said prd sympathizers were 
ousted at city halls in apatzingan ciudad hidalgo brisenas 
chavinda huandacareo cotija and jacona at midday thursday 
the government newspaper el nacional announced the end of the 
city hall occupations before it happened 
it said prd protesters voluntarily disbanded wednesday at all 17 
city halls after talks with army officials the story said 
nothing about army deployments 
army intervention in political disputes is as touchy a subject 
for the mexican government as vote fraud interior minister 
fernando gutierrez barrios issued a statement thursday saying the 
federal presence in michoacan had been reinforced to avoid 
violence on the part of the prd 
michoacan has been a problem for the pri since the 1988 
presidential race when native son and prd founder cuauhtemoc 
cardenas came in second to president carlos salinas de gortari in 
an election still clouded by allegations of vote fraud 
nearly half of michoacans 110 city halls were occupied by 
cardenas supporters after the national elections to protest alleged 
vote fraud and demand the replacement of the pri governor 
in one of his first officials acts after taking office in 
december 1988 salinas replaced the governor the move failed to 
pacify the prd 
there was further occupations after the july 2 state elections 
in which pri claimed a majority in the state legislative races over 
prd fraud charges

a juvenile court judge on wednesday refused to 
allow an 11yearold boy to visit the younger brother he was 
separated from when their adoptive parents decided the older boy 
hadnt bonded well with them 
juvenile court judge arthur n hamilton transferred a lawsuit 
asking that two boys be able to visit each other to the courts 
chancery division which he said was the more appropriate forum 
cook county public guardian patrick murphy who brought the 
lawsuit on behalf of the 11yearold boy argued that the judge 
should act because the situation was an emergency 
rick wants to see his brother and he wants to see him now 
murphy said 
murphy told reporters later that the two boys have seen each 
other just once since rick went to the group home nov 20 just 
before thanksgiving 
a lawsuit filed by murphy last week charges that the adoptive 
parents separated rick not his real name and his 8yearold 
brother whom they adopted in 1984 it seeks 50000 in damages for 
rick the lawsuit says the parents called joseph and pamela doe in 
the lawsuit returned him to state custody because he hadnt 
bonded well with them 
hamilton said he would not issue a ruling on the visitation 
because chancery court handles injunctions hamilton said he also 
thought it would be quicker if murphy went back to the judge who 
originally denied visitation to get that judge to change his ruling 
juvenile court judge walter williams on march 9 approved the 
parents petition to surrender their parental rights to rick and 
ruled at that time there would be no visitation 
murphy said that while he pursues the injunction for visitation 
in the chancery court he also would go back to williams next week 
and ask the judge to change his mind 
advocates for children say that the case is unusual because 
damages are being sought from adoptive parents and the case 
involves siblings who have been separated 
bill pierce president of the national committee for adoption in 
washington dc called the case extremely rare 
murphy said the lawsuit was unusual because parents usually 
dont separate adopted chidlren 
its every little boys nightmare murphy said after filing 
the lawsuit ricks parents told him they were going to put him 
into an orphange and they did it its like telling a kid youre 
going to send the bogey man after him and then doing it 
murphy said the boy who is in a foster home blames himself 
the parents attorney mary c martin did not comment after the 
hearing

rock hudsons exlover claimed wednesday in a 
22 million libel lawsuit that he was maliciously portrayed as a 
psychotic criminal by the authors of a book about the late actor 
marc christian who won 55 million from the hudson estate a 
year ago in a landmark aids lawsuit said in a superior court 
lawsuit filed by celebrity lawyer marvin mitchelson that he was 
shamed by the books depiction of him 
the tom clark and dick kleiner book rock hudson friend of 
mine released last month referred to christian as a criminal 
a thief an unclean person a blackmailer a psychotic an 
extortionist a forger a perjurer a liar a whore an arsonist 
and a squatter the lawsuit said 
mitchelson said the portrayal was false and that christian was 
asking 11 million in general damages and 11 million in punitive 
damages for a loss of his reputation shame and mortification 
hes just not going to sit still for it mitchelson said 
we asked them to take out all the passages we felt were libelous 
and they didnt take them out 
in addition to clark and kleiner the lawsuit names new 
yorkbased pharos books as defendants martha clark a spokeswoman 
for the publisher did not return a phone call seeking comment 
the written statements are libelous on their face because 
christian is charged with improper and immoral conduct 
mitchelson said they arent backed up by any facts at all 
the most scurrilous one of all was that marc knew hudson had 
aids at the time hudson learned he had it the attorney said 
it says he might have known it before hudson knew 
that issue was prominent in christians suit against the hudson 
estate 
a jury ruled in february 1989 that hudson was guilty of 
outrageous conduct for concealing his aids diagnosis from 
christian his lover for two years christian said he didnt learn 
of the actors illness until a few months before hudson 58 died 
on oct 5 1985 
i thought i was a dead man christian testified about the 
terror that gripped him in the wake of the disclosure 
although christian didnt contract aids and has tested negative 
for the presence of the virus the judge and the jury found he 
deserved damages it was a unique ruling in personal injury law on 
sexually transmitted diseases 
the jury ruled christian should get 215 million but superior 
court judge bruce geernaert ruled the amount excessive deciding 
last april that it should be whittled down to 55 million 
mitchelson said christian has received 600000 so far but the 
rest was tied up in appeals by the hudson estate he expects an 
appellate court decision by the end of the year

the cabinet on wednesday ordered a 
fourday work week for government employees and approved major 
electricity cutbacks in manila to cope with a critical power 
shortage 
under the plan government offices will close on five 
consecutive mondays starting april 23 the government urged major 
private companies to close on those mondays and said electricity to 
large commercial users would be shut off during those days 
factories will lose power for four hours one day each week the 
government said residential districts will continue to have daily 
power cuts of up to four hours 
the staterun national power corp npc which generates 
electricity for sale to distributors said the cutbacks were 
necessary because of power plant repairs and a drought that has 
reduced water levels at hydroelectric stations 
the situation clearly calls for some sacrifice from all 
sectors the government said in a statement realizing the 
seriousness of the situation business and industrial groups have 
reached a consensus that power needs to be rationed on an equitable 
manner based on essentiality 
npc spokesman alex dizon said 12 of 22 power plants on luzon 
the main philippine island were not operational 
he said some were undergoing regular maintenance others were 
being repaired for damage sustained during a typhoon last year 
while others could not operate because of low water levels at 
hydroelectric stations 
the 22 plants generate 2982 megawatts with at least 80 percent 
consumed by the metropolitan manila area 
metropolitan manila which has a population of about 8 million 
suffered frequent power outages last year until military dissidents 
launched a nineday coup attempt against the government of 
president corazon aquino on dec 1 
rebels cited the power crisis as an example of alleged 
government incompetence officials of the power corporation had 
complained that they predicted the crisis as early as 1986 but that 
mrs aquinos government stalled on their request to invest in new 
generating facilities

much lies behind the tower of londons mustached 
beefeaters cobblestone lanes and ravens including the workshop of 
ted smith and son armorers who preserve an ancient craft from 
extinctionyal armory craftsmen and five assistants restore and 
conserve the 40000 pieces of armor in the tower collection 
smith 62 will retire in 1992 and is passing on his knowledge 
of makin 
the two rog and repairing armor to his 26yearold son christopher 
behind a bright red door away from the crown jewels and the 2 
million tourists who flock to the 900yearold tower each year the 
smiths work together on a replica of a knights fighting helmet 
made in northern italy in 1460 
their one concession to modernity is a propane torch all other 
materials and methods are authentic to the time 
medieval armorers used cumbersome coal forges a propane torch 
makes it easier to work on those awkward lancerests and chanfrons 
we had a small forge for awhile but it blew up a couple of 
times and with a gallery directly above us it wouldnt have been 
practical ted smith explained 
for the rouns to disband the 
assembly and have new elections 
ibrahim nafei a mubarak confidant and editor of the leading 
newspaper alahram expressed the government position there can 
be no invalidation of the peoples assembly 
the constitutional argument is part of a political tugofwar 
that began almost as soon as mubarak took office 
a major issue has been the regular extension of an emergency 
enacted after sadat was killed it gives the executive branch wide 
powers of arrest and search without warrant and bans strikes and 
demonstrations 
opposition parties want the law scrapped but the government 
says it is a vital tool against moslem extremists the latest 
extension runs until spring 1991 
mubarak has not said whether he will disband the peoples 
assembly an aide mustafa elfiki said the president will act 
at the right time in the light of litigation indicating he might 
await the constitutional court ruling 
the constitution gives a president the right to dissolve 
parliament only with the electorates approval in a referendum 
in 1987 mubarak called a referendum before the court upheld 
khalids suit against parts of the election law the voters 
endorsed dissolution and elections two months later in april 
after the peoples assembly nominated mubarak for a second 
sixyear term in october 1987 voters approved him in another 
referendum 
at the time the political consensus that mubarak dissolved 
parliament quickly because the presidential nomination was nearly 
at hand this time no such urgent business is pending

are you nostalgic for slipping through the blackout 
to the alley door savoring haute rutabaga and other joys of dining 
out in nazioccupied paris drop in at the curfew 
le couvrefeu as the living theater restaurant is known in 
french is near montmartre and does not let diners in through the 
blackened street door on rue philippe de girard 
a young man in knickers and visored cap whispers go around to 
the back alley 
inside the ambience changes to what might be the set of a jean 
renoir film zinc bar photos of 1940s movie idols like clark 
gable and humphrey bogart red banquettes old black telephones 
proprietors lulu and maurice played by actors rush forward to 
ask if youve had any trouble getting there a kir or whitewine 
cassis appears on the bar 
lulu is catherine de ville who wears a flowery period dress but 
was born after the war edouard bouzy who plays maurice was born 
in 1938 and remembers little of the war years except that we 
rarely had good food to eat 
they do a lively job of recreating the resistance atmosphere 
they take orders shout at their children also actors and 
occasionally break into song 
their renditions of a la bastille and rue saintvincent 
bring smiles or tears to customers old enough to remember the war 
many younger diners know the words well enough to join the singing 
bouzy learned the prewar skill of rolling cigarettes so a 
burnedout butt hangs from the corner of his mouth 
the restaurant opened four months ago is the idea of roland 
petitprez who developed similar restaurants in madrid 
every period has its own form of joie de vivre said 
petitprez who was a little boy during the war he remembers going 
to a restaurant much like the one he has made 
we went after dark when the curtains were closed and we were 
able to eat treats like chicken and fried potatoes the produce 
smuggled in by farmers petitprez said 
an antique radio blared the music that signaled wartime news 
broadcasts of the british broadcasting corp hidden radios were 
turned on across france to hear how the allies were doing 
guests of le couvrefeu chose more or less authentic food from 
the menu 
herring and potatoes are a period dish that i loved said a 
patron carla acquanegra who remembered growing up during the 
german occupation 
she pronounced the rabbit dish delicious and quite true to 
tradition but noted that such food really was scarce for 
people like my family we didnt have any relatives raising food in 
the country 
vegetables of the period included rutabaga leeks and 
topinambours jerusalem artichokes which were served so often 
during the war that carla now tends to avoid them 
at one point in the evening the lights went out a loud 
knocking came at the door and an idiot nephew of lulu and 
maurice tumbled in spilling illgotten black market goods on 
the floor to much scolding from maurice 
the party resumed lulu sang piafstyle some diners 
jitterbugged 
jerome mingueneau the 30yearold chef emerged from his 
basement kitchen 
i used a 1938 cordon bleu and other old cookbooks to recreate 
the traditional bourgeois and bistro styles he said 
mingueneaus pate is from a 1796 recipe 
carla chose creme caramel a typical dessert of the period but 
another guest had a rich chocolate mousse 
there was absolutely no chocolate until the liberation 
carla said 
customers pay the equivalent of 5250 for the show and dinner 
those who prefer a quiet meal without the dramatics can have lunch 
for about 1650 
most patrons are french but english and americans come 
even some germans visit the curfew theyre welcome here and 
seem to like it petitprez said

defenders of nature say the 
appointment of jose lutzenberger a noted ecologist as brazils 
environment minister could signal an end to wanton destruction of 
the amazon rain forest 
the choice of lutzenberger 63 was seen as a victory for 
conservationists who claim the government has done little to stop 
slashandburn devastation of the amazon he was named by president 
fernando collor de mello who took office march 15 
by 1988 ranchers and farmers had destroyed about 8 percent of 
the rain forest in the 2 million square miles of amazon wilderness 
said us researcher philip fearnside of the national institute of 
research in the amazon 
carbon dioxide produced by the burning is believed to add to the 
greenhouse effect warming the earths surface 
lutzenberger is the right man in the right place nobody else 
has his credibility johan dalgas frisch head of the wildlife 
preservation association in sao paulo said in an interview 
antonio carlos de oliveira of the ecology group oikos said he 
is superimportant a legend we all have the greatest respect and 
admiration for him 
lutzenberger seeks radical changes in brazils environmental 
policy he favors solar wind and other natural forms of energy 
over the huge hydroelectric complexes of recent decades 
a rio newspaper made the wry comment that lutzenberger was so 
radical about protecting nature that he even opposed lawn mowers 
the new environment minister told the associated press we 
have to question the fundamental doctrines of modern industrial 
society which is geared to the needs of the powerful were not 
saying give up technology but go a different way 
in his first week on the job lutzenberger spoke out against the 
controversial northern rim project which would create army posts 
to guard brazils vast jungle border 
he also promised to review a decision that allowed gold miners 
to settle on land claimed by the primitive yanomami indians 
prospectors have invaded yanomami land in the remote western 
amazon state of roraima devastating the forest and bringing 
disease and death to the indians 
after consulting with lutzenberger and visiting the area collor 
ordered the dynamiting of clandestine air strips on tribal land and 
said the northern rim project would be redirected toward protecting 
the environment 
we must remove the prospectors but we also must give them 
decent living conditions lutzenberger said they are not there 
because theyre bad or want to destroy 
lutzenberger a descendant of german immigrants is an 
agronomist with a degree from the university of louisiana in the 
1970s he resigned as a chemical company executive to join the 
ecology movement and helped found brazils first environmental 
protection group 
later lutzenberger established an environmental consulting firm 
he pushed for tougher laws on pesticide control and for 
installation of antipollution filters at a cellulose plant in his 
native rio grande do sul state in southern brazil 
lutzenberger was among the first to sound the alarm about the 
amazon 
this problem concerns all of humanity he told reporters 
shortly after becoming environment secretary 
it concerns the continuation of life on this planet this 
requires not just plans for preservation protection or parks it 
requires fundamentally rethinking our economic programs 
he appealed for help from industrialized countries 
we must establish now an intensive and continuing dialogue 
between the governments of the first world and the third world on 
how we can collaborate to save the last jungles lutzenberger 
told the journalists 
one way he said is to write off part of brazils 114 billion 
foreign debt against programs to preserve the amazon 
brazil has rejected such debt for nature swaps on grounds 
they violate national sovereignty of that lutzenberger said 
the idea is to find ways to reduce the debt in exchange for 
the preservation of amazonia by our government there is not the 
slightest intention to internationalize the amazon 
a key test of his strength is likely to be a proposed highway 
from the western amazon through peru to the pacific 
lutzenberger opposes the highway but peru and governors of 
brazils amazonian states say it is vital to economic development 
in the region most of the governors supported collor for president 
the important thing to watch is how much power he has lets 
see what happens when he conflicts with the highway lobby 
fearnside the us researcher said in a telephone interview from 
manaus in the amazon jungle 3000 miles northwest of rio 
some fear lutzenbergers wellknown temper and firm convictions 
could work against him 
if hes very radical collor will be pressured to get rid of 
him frisch said

billed as slightly twisted and preceded by 
enough hype to fill a railroad hopper car david lynchs twin 
peaks a cuttingedge soap opera for prime time will open sunday 
on abc with a twohour premiere 
admirers of his cinematic oeuvre oeuvre is french for whole 
bunch of stuff may say peaks has subhematomal echoes of his 
neonoir blue velvet but not the nonlinear grecoroman 
postmodernism of eraserhead 
well okay some critics do talk that way 
but gee this series which starts its regular thursday run next 
week really seems more like a beautifully filmed pacific northwest 
edition of peyton place set in avantgarde mist 
full of slightly askew moments and characters it also is rife 
with little visual bumps to tip you that things are not always what 
they seem its an admirable effort to battle cable by offering 
something different in network tv 
abc deserves a cheer for that but sundays premiere directed 
and cowritten by lynch occasionally edges close to plumb boring 
at times you fear there has been a ruling that the director not 
the play is the thing 
the proceedings occur in washington near the canadian border 
in a small makebelieve logging town called twin peaks this 
hamlet surrounded by lovely cloudshrouded woods appears to be 
nice peaceful normal 
but all that starts changing early on when a fisherman 
discovers the plasticwrapped body of a slain high school 
homecoming queen naturally her nogood leatherjacketed 
boyfriend is a prime suspect 
unlike the usual tv epic the shows early moments contain 
leisurely digressions and characters that arent firmly and 
immediately established thats not all bad but it wears thin 
after awhile 
one gets a tad impatient waiting for things to get moving and 
for the stylistic fog to lift just a little 
those who wait and they should bring lunch eventually will 
learn that there is a killer at large apparently a sadist and 
rapist who preys on high school girls a serial killer maybe or 
maybe not ominous ambiguity is a major part of the proceedings 
bit by bit you learn that twin peaks is full of dark secrets 
subplots and furtive sex between consenting adults high school 
kids or a combination thereof but thats not enough nowadays 
so by golly theres also surrealism here although its the 
lowkey kind nothing really far out for example nobody suddenly 
up and shoots his mornings wheaties too bad that would give the 
show a cereal killer 
on the bright side there is a sheriffs deputy who cries every 
time hes at a murder scene also a derangedlooking psychiatrist 
who laughs about his dark secret and a group of potential land 
investors from norway 
there also is a lovely mysterious chinese woman she has what 
seems to be a light secret not so two townsfolk one a brutalized 
minor the other a trucker they prove to be advertisers in a 
swingers magazine 
this being the tv version of lynchs auteur theory there are 
various examples of his celebrated eccentric vision like a 
nighttime shot of a traffic light changing from green to amber to 
red hmm symbolic 
other auteur highlights a bad rich girls feet in saddle shoes 
a flickering light in a morgue and a dreamlike fight in a biker 
bar as a softrock vocalist gently sings 
meanwhile back at the plot the main event is an investigation 
of two things the homecoming queens murder and the rape and 
attempted murder of another high school girl 
the investigators here are sheriff harry s truman of course 
and fbi agent dale cooper played by michael ontkean and blue 
velvet graduate kyle maclachlan respectively 
the sheriff is the strong calm type the young razorsharp 
agent is a tad weird amazed at all the douglas firs he sees and 
constantly dictating all manner of things into his tape recorder 
included a misquote of wc fields 
ontkean and maclachlan are firstrate in fact all the actors 
in twin peaks are good 
but the only thing that truly keeps the show interesting is 
angelo badalamentis alwaysmoving score its a solid plus even 
though mostly played on a synthesizer a machine that is to music 
what helium is to combustion 
because of all the hoopla about twin peaks the show 
doubtless will get a large curious audience at least in its 
first hour on opening night 
but unless thursdays continuation of the plot is an improvement 
over chapter one the series that began as a rare network display 
of avantgarde may soon wind up as a video museum piece

elsewhere in television 
can we talk immediately starting april 30 the syndicated 
the joan rivers show will be broadcast almost live with a 
sevensecond delay so any naughty bits can be blipped immediately 
each show previously was shown two to three weeks after it was 
taped 
the idea is to take advantage of rivers topical humor 
abilities a spokesman says of the 146 stations now carrying her 
talk show 35 will carry the live version with the others taping 
it for sameday broadcast 
the show also will start featuring top gossip columnists from 
newspapers and magazines on a onceaweek basis every monday one 
chosen gossip columnist will relay uplifting lowdown to rivers

even an environmental debacle like the 
huntington beach oil spill generates its own kind of gallows humor 
including this joke among residents 
question what do you get when you mix oil and water 
answer politicians 
in this case it seemed as if there were one politician for 
every barrel of oil washing up on surf city usa 
so many politicians took to the blackened sands of huntington 
beach to condemn the feb 7 spill from the ruptured american trader 
tanker that mayor tom mays had to ask them to go through his office 
first so they wouldnt interfere with the cleanup 
in this election year talking tough against the oil companies 
with proposals to ban offshore drilling and to enact strict tanker 
safety measures adds up to smart politics 
for the first time in a decade environmentalists politicians 
and even some oil industry executives expect this 20th anniversary 
year of earth day to bring sweeping reform to the oil industry 
the reform movement is being pushed by oil spills in alaska 
california new york new jersey and louisiana and a growing 
feeling among americans that more should be done to protect the 
environment 
possible changes include requiring double hulls and bottoms on 
tankers shifting shipping lanes farther offshore better charting 
of the ocean bottom improving procedures for oil spill cleanup 
and putting a fourth yearlong moratorium on new offshore drilling 
the interest in the general public in protecting the coastline 
is at an alltime high declared ann whitfield executive 
director of the florida public interest research group 
the oil industry meanwhile worries about an overreaction that 
could stifle us oil production and return the country to the days 
of oil embargoes and gas lines 
but even many oil officials concede more must be done to avoid 
spills and to minimize damage when they occur 
while it is impossible to guarantee that future accidents will 
never happen we are committed to working to prevent them and to 
improving the industrys safety record said james benton 
executive director of the new jersey petroleum council 
benton spoke at a recent meeting between oil executives and 
officials of new york and new jersey where four major spills in 
the first 10 weeks of 1990 dumped almost 730000 gallons of heating 
oil and heavy crude into the arthur kill and kill van kull 
waterways between new york city and northern new jersey 
the first major reform is under consideration in washington 
legislation pending in congress would require double hulls and 
double bottoms on tankers engineers speculate that a double hull 
could have prevented the huntington beach spill apparently the 
result of the tanker striking its own anchor and lessened the 
effects of the exxon valdez disaster in which the tanker ripped 
open on a reef in alaskas prince william sound 
eyes are also on president bush who pledged in his campaign to 
be the environmental president to see whether he will try to 
reinstate oil and gas drilling in federal waters after the 
moratorium expires this year 
the issue is of particular importance in california where oil 
companies have proposed developing millions of acres off the coasts 
of central and northern california off florida companies want to 
drill in tracts north of the keys 
many member of congress say that if bush decides to resume 
additional drilling they are prepared to seek another moratorium 
the administration is in a quagmire in the sense that the 
politics of california a very crucial gubernatorial race and the 
presidents own commitments in the state are in conflict with 
presidents gut instincts as a former oilman on offshore 
drilling said rep leon panetta dmonterey 
some of the most active work on oil industry reforms is going on 
at the state level 
even before the huntington beach spill the environment was a 
hot political issue in california all three candidates for 
governor us sen pete wilson state attorney general john van 
de kamp and former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein have 
tried to oneup each other in pledging love for mother earth 
wilson a republican is a longtime opponent of offshore 
drilling so much so that his stance strained relations with the 
white house in the early months of the administration 
in addition state controller gray davis and lt gov leo 
mccarthy say their reelection is important to maintain their 21 
lock on the threemember state lands commission and a virtual ban 
on additional drilling 
im a strong environmentalist and im committed to remaining a 
good steward for californias magnificent coastline davis said 
it doesnt take a genius to see that if you change one or two 
people on that board you change the direction of californias 
coast

after nine years of bickering 42 lawsuits 
design changes and false starts a 25 billion plan to sanitize 
tawdry times square is about to become reality 
or is it the 42nd street development project says 
groundbreaking is in sight opponents say it might never come to 
pass 
is it alive or dead i dont think anybody knows said kent 
barwick president of the municipal art society a nonprofit 
organization that analyzes and addresses aesthetic issues affecting 
new york city particularly architecture and planning 
not a single spade of dirt has been turned in the 
governmentbacked project but the mere promise of it has helped 
trigger brisk construction by private developers elsewhere in the 
neighborhood 
critics say that means the development project has served its 
purpose and should just fade away 
the projects parent the state urban development corp wants 
to replace rundown buildings in the historic entertainment 
district with four office towers ranging from 32 to 57 stories and 
glitzed up with signs lights and mirrors a merchandise mart and 
new hotel are on the back burner 
the idea is to discourage drug dealers muggers con artists and 
prostitutes 
theres a sense that times square has become a more menacing 
place said sociologist william kornblum of the city university 
graduate center who has studied the district for 12 years 
in 1988 2246 felony crimes were reported on 42nd street 
between broadway and eighth avenue an area of just over a block 
safety was a major concern of madeline dominique danthony 
proprietor of the harmony burlesque theater when she moved three 
years ago to the artsy tribeca area near wall street her landlord 
had sold the building at 48th street and broadway where shed done 
business for 10 years 
just because im in the burlesque business doesnt mean i like 
42nd street she said i was offered a rental situation there 
but didnt take it because im not walking down that block 
danthony who strives to keep her business tasteful no 
barkers unseemly pictures or neon girls girls girls signs 
outside said its wrong to blame the crime on the sex industry 
volume is what attracts crime she said when you put all 
those places together you create a hightraffic situation drug 
pushers pickpockets they get lost in the crowd 
when i left times square i noticed immediately that my good 
customers stayed with me and the riffraff stayed in times square 
my girls said the same thing she said 
barwick blames the blight on real estate speculation 
since everybody had been led to believe for generations that 
the area would be creamed to make way for highrise offices people 
werent taking care of their buildings he said 
still critics say flooding times square with office workers in 
suits would douse the vitality and offbeat flavor of one of the 
worlds most famous entertainment districts 
i think the times square cacophony is a delight a visual 
riot said stephen f wilder a member of community board 5 a 
volunteer advisory board of area residents and business people 
its truly the one place in the city historically where 
different classes and races and kinds of people came together 
said barwick cities need such places for their spirit and soul 
and their economies 
times square still has a national and international cachet 
agreed kornblum one hears when you interview people on the 
streets as we do a sense of disappointment in some circles how 
did it get to be this shabby but the whole of times square the 
lights and the glitter has the capacity to get peoples blood 
rushing 
some say the redevelopment would eradicate appealing old 
architecture and wipe out cheap entertainment especially for 
lowincome patrons 
depending on whom you ask it would cause midtown real estate 
values to plummet or drive them up affecting business costs and 
livelihoods in the adjoining garment district 
brian kell spokesman for the 42nd street project said the 
groundbreaking for the towers now is targeted for early next year 
on thursday the state court of appeals refused to hear a suit 
by wilder that sought further review of the project under state 
environmental guidelines 
kell predicted his side also would win two final lawsuits within 
a few months 
one a suit against the metropolitan transportation authority 
before the state court of appeals concerns bidding procedures for 
times square subway reconstruction in the other before a federal 
court a realty company is trying to stop the project on grounds 
among others that it lacks a public purpose 
after the disposition of the last two suits kell expects state 
supreme court justice stanley j parness to rule on the 42nd street 
development projects request to condemn 34 theaters book stores 
video shops tshirt shops momandpop grocery stores and other 
properties 
the developers for the urban development corp project the 
prudential insurance co and park tower realty can cancel the 
deal any time after june 21 said gary rosenberg attorney for the 
durst organization which filed three suits against the project 
we believe they have an absolute right to walk at that point 
with no liability rosenberg said we think they will 
he said there are no tenants for the proposed office towers 
we expect that at this point everybody is looking for a way 
out you need a good facesaver rosenberg said 
but supporters say developers are committed to the project 
until it is redeveloped the cancer will remain in the center 
of times square said gerald schoenfeld chairman of the shubert 
organization and head of the mayors midtown citizens committee 
it is essential to legitimate theater it is essential to the 
image of new york it is essential to the community it is 
essential to tourism

foreign brokers who had a hard time riding the 
bulls on the tokyo stock market are wrestling the bears with 
greater success 
nearly all the 50odd foreign brokerages in tokyo reported 
losing money during the late 1980s the 22 with seats on the tokyo 
stock exchange paid huge sums to get there and the others faced 
vast startup costs as well as of march 1988 for example 14 of 
the top 20 foreign houses were in the red 
but having absorbed the onetime expenses and gained market 
experience many are wellpositioned to capitalize on a plunging 
market 
while many decline to specify profits for the first quarter a 
period of sharp decline in tokyo stocks they claim an edge in 
research experience with bear markets and facility in hedging 
techniques 
at the french house of wi carr deputy branch manager john 
price said for the first three months of the year were showing 
profits on all our books 
this resulted he said from caution diversification and a 
concentration on advising institutional investors overseas on how 
to deal with turbulent japanese stocks 
when market times are very rough we do quite well price 
said 
he said the firm had kept its exposure to stocks down to about 
30 percent of its inhouse limit during the plunge while doing 
well with alternative investments such as options and futures 
were not complaining price said 
american firms have deeper experience in trading futures 
contracts based on stock market indexes and in arbitrage using 
computers they spot profit opportunities in rapidly shifting gaps 
between futures and spot prices for stock indexes 
options in futures provide a tool for dealing with the 
downside market said kevin parker chief of futures trading at 
morgan stanley international 
parker said volume on the spot market had been very light 
making it difficult to sell shares without a loss 
you cant sell stocks but there is ample opportunity in 
futures to hedge portfolios and many institutions have done just 
that he said 
trading in stockindex futures began in tokyo in september 1988 
but became really active only this year parker attributed this to 
expanding price swings in the market since january rising to 
over five times the historical average in recent days 
mike morizumi a strategist with merrill lynch japan said one 
result of the markets slump has been to bring his firms research 
capabilities into prominence 
over the past three years just about any company in any 
sector showed pretty good earnings and sales looking at the fine 
print in the balance sheets back then didnt make much 
difference he said 
but the nearly 30 percent loss on the stock market has created 
widely divergent trends among japanese companies morizumi added 
japanese competitors are formidable in sales strategy he said 
but their research is often subordinated to sales tactics 
in contrast since the market reversal began weve made a lot 
of sales points with our research morizumi said especially with 
japanese clients whose former brokers had led them to believe the 
bulls would run indefinitely 
foreign brokerages largely relied on foreign clients in the 
past but this is clearly changing 
betty wu a broker at hong kongbased sbci securities asia 
said foreign institutional clients had turned increasingly sour on 
the tokyo market this year 
some have sold out their entire portfolios she said 
thus she said her company has emphasized domestic sales 
weve been doing well wu said because weve been very 
successful in hiring japanese sales people who have a very 
solid client base

nuns monks and priests once were a 
common sight in dutch schools and hospitals but some are now being 
imported from the united states and elsewhere to keep alive roman 
catholic orders and clergy 
six nuns from the order of poor clare in roswell nm came to 
this dutch village in march in a series of foreign arrivals that 
has already brought parish priests from poland and a university 
pastor from spain 
reformminded catholics worried about the american nuns 
reputation for conservatism denounce the plan as reactionary 
and say it wont work 
but the church leadership hopes the project will mean 
deliverance for an ailing poor clare monastery in eindhoven 25 
miles away where 14 nuns aged 48100 havent seen any newcomers 
since 1984 
the american sisters will move into a recently renovated 
convent and move to eindhoven if they succeed in attracting young 
dutch nuns 
only 12 dutch women and 50 men took holy orders or the cloth in 
1988 while 898 died and 43 quit according to a report compiled by 
the catholic research institute kaski 
more than 21000 people in this nation of 148 million are 
members of a catholic religious order but about three quarters of 
them live in retirement the report said 
faith in all of the netherlands has been put on the back 
burner said sister celine a spokeswoman for the eindhoven poor 
clare monastery of the immaculate conception of mary if we dont 
have any new vocations we wont be able to keep this up much

about 60 poor clare nuns still live in the netherlands where 
they are part of what used to be an intensely catholic social 
fabric setting its stamp on much of the nations southern half 
in the 1950s schools hospitals and homes for the elderly here 
were staffed by nuns and priests and southern dutch politics were 
dominated by the roman catholic peoples party now part of premier 
ruud lubbers christian democrats 
but the era that followed saw rapid economic growth and the 
development of a welfare state that took over most of the 
charitable work that had been traditional church territory 
today only 15 percent of the netherlands 55 million nominal 
catholics are regular churchgoers according to the kaski report 
the social role of the religious orders has been taken over by 
the state health care education looking after the sick they 
dont have anything left to them in those areas said kees van 
hasselt spokesman for bishop johannes ter schure of the southern 
diocese of den bosch who supports the elshout project 
young people can sign up as foreign aid workers instead of 
becoming missionaries sister celine agreed they get more 
opportunity to study to get better jobs and to enjoy 
themselves in the secular world 
however the elshout project has pitted bishop ter schure a 
provatican hardliner against liberal catholics who regard it as 
an attempt to yank them back to the straight and narrow 
its a reactionary plan part of den boschs policy of turning 
back the clock said peter de rijk of the may eight movement 
which spearheaded opposition within the catholic church to the 1985 
dutch visit of pope john paul ii 
de rijk noted that the sisters from boswell will be living in 
strict separation from the outside world dutch clarissan nuns no 
longer observe that statute which once made the poor clare order 
one of the most ascetic groups in the catholic church 
this is no way to restore monastic life its certainly not a 
method that we would approve of said ton smits of the dutch 
monastic association which represents all catholic religious 
orders 
the liberal response is similar to widespread criticism 
triggered by the 1988 arrival of three priests from the pontiffs 
native poland and of a spanish university pastor in 1982 
we are daughters of the church very loyal to the holy 
father said a spokeswoman for the roswell group mother mary 
francis were coming to serve not to argue i hate anybody to 
be suspicious of us

we do not support an action that represents such a flagrant

the numbers say this election year should be a 
good one for democrats to strengthen their hold on the senate but 
since candidates and not numbers win elections its the gop thats 
on the offensive 
we have a better crop of challengers this time than weve ever 
had said sen don nickles rokla chairman of the national 
republican senatorial committee 
id be happy and pleased and i think we would say weve done a 
good job if we stay the same in democratic strength said sen 
john breaux dla chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee 
by tradition an offyear election bodes well for the party that 
doesnt control the white house and from a distance it looks like 
this one should follow the pattern 
democrats have a 5545 majority in the senate but the 
republicans have more seats at risk of the 34 senate seats on the 
line the gop must defend 18 and the democrats 16 
three incumbent republicans are retiring heightening the 
apparent democratic opportunity 
but seven months before the election it appears the democrats 
have failed to recruit many topflight candidates while the gop has 
succeeded that gives republicans hope they can narrow the 
democrats majority this year and perhaps reclaim control of the 
senate in 1992 
in all three cases where republican senators are stepping down 
this year gop house members have stepped forward as candidates and 
are the early frontrunners 
in colorado where sen bill armstrong is retiring rep hank 
brown hopes to step into the breach popular rep robert smith is 
running for the seat being vacated by sen gordon humphrey in new 
hampshire and in idaho rep larry craig is seeking to succeed 
sen james a mcclure 
four other house republicans are taking the far riskier leap 
into races against incumbent democrats creating potentially the 
hottest senate contests in the nation 
the iowa senate campaign already is steaming as republican rep 
tom tauke challenges incumbent democrat tom harkin in illinois 
gop rep lynn martin has had help from president bush in her 
challenge against democratic sen paul simon 
in rhode island republican rep claudine schneider is trying to 
unseat a popular but aging democratic sen claiborne pell and in 
michigan republican rep bill schuette is in a primary fight 
against conservative activist clark durant for the right to 
challenge democratic sen carl levin 
another close race is shaping up in nebraska where former 
republican rep hal daub who failed in a senate bid two years ago 
is challenging democratic incumbent sen j james exon another 
democratic incumbent that republicans consider vulnerable is sen 
max baucus of montana the list of republican challengers there 
includes lt gov allen kolstad 
meanwhile no republican senators who are seeking reelection 
appear to be in serious trouble so far poll results suggest that 
gop sens jesse helms in north carolina and mitch mcconnell in 
kentucky are vulnerable but potential democratic challengers still 
are fighting among themselves in both states 
although some house democrats flirted with entering senate 
races none did and in several cases popular present and former 
state office holders passed up seemingly good opportunities to move 
to washington 
the democrats tried hard to recruit candidates but their 
efforts just seemed to come up a little bit short said political 
analyst charles cook finding a good senate candidate is mostly 
luck of the draw and this time the republicans got all the 
breaks he said 
the result is apparent security for the gop even a slim chance 
of taking control of the senate if they can sweep all of the close 
races while democrats have too many seats close to the edge 
cook said 
a 5050 split would give republicans control because the 
republican vice president would break tie votes 
if the republicans trimmed the democratic majority to less than 
two or three seats after this election the gop would be in a good 
position to retake the senate in 1992 when 20 democrats and only 14 
republicans face reelection 
there is talk of two more races being added to the 34 scheduled 
this fall 
hawaii democrat spark matsunaga has cancer and must be brought 
into the senate chamber by wheelchair to vote although he has not 
indicated he will resign potential successors have been quietly 
eyeing his seat 
a senate ethics committee investigation of sen dave 
durenbergers personal finances has led to speculation that the 
minnesota republican might resign if serious charges were brought 
breaux who leads the senate democrats campaign committee said 
his lack of senate challengers from the house isnt the handicap 
the washington cognoscenti make it out to be 
whos to say that house members are better candidates than 
people who are not from washington and can run against the mistakes 
and the problems that washington is in fact responsible for he 
asked 
breaux acknowledged though that hes hoping for some upsets 
one race where he sees potential is democratic businessman ted 
muensters bid to oust republican sen larry pressler in south 
dakota 
the democratic drive to hold the line this year is fueled by the 
specter of 1992 
im running down the track looking over my left shoulder and 
then i turn and look over my right shoulder said breaux who 
faces reelection himself in two years 
neither breaux nor nickles saw an overriding national theme in 
this years races 
breaux said the abortion issue could help democrats in several 
prochoice states where the republican candidate has an 
antiabortion stance as is the case in iowa and michigan it also 
could give democrats an upset perhaps in new hampshire or oregon 
where antiabortion incumbent mark o hatfield is being challenged 
by democratic businessman harry lansdale 
nickles discounts abortions role in the next election 
republican gubernatorial losses in new jersey and virginia last 
fall may have been due to antiabortion stands because 
republicans did a poor job responding and that wont happen 
this time he said

an unexpected resurrection of nations from 
totalitarianism has swept eastern europe in recent months 
reintroducing longtrampled freedoms and reducing international 
distrust the first story in a fivepart easter series 
resurrection of nations examines the surprising upheaval and 
its religious threads 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a blink the landscape heaved and the world changed people 
could hardly believe it amazed incredulous they saw a new 
reality dawning over the earth surmounting old fears and fatalism 
the grim immutable facts of their existence were suddenly not 
what they had seemed 
that baffled astonishment among eastern europeans at their burst 
from bondage also resonates in the recorded reaction to the 
resurrection of christ and the liberating word of easter 
it has indeed been miraculous a miracle that happened in the 
souls of people said the rev john meyendorff a scholar of the 
russianderived but independent orthodox church in america it 
has been a resurrection from a long deadening of individual 
creativity and the godgiven dignity of being human for millions of 
people 
no one could have predicted its suddenness and sweep he said 
i never thought id live to see it people are finding it hard to 
believe 
an idle tale he apostles scoffed at first reports of 
christs resurrection it made no sense the buried restored to 
life they couldnt conceive of it until it confronted them 
directly and plainly 
likewise it had seemed impossible that half a continent 
coumenon the berlin wall that barrier of cold war that for three 
decades had divided humanity literally and figuratively at last 
came tumbling down nov 9 
among rejoicing throngs an east german friar said with a 
chuckle the iron curtain is not so much iron anymore 
the walls demise and the rest of the whirlwind that freed 
nations and eased superpower antagonisms symbolically reflected a 
scripture passage on christs crucifixion and resurrection 
for he is our peace who has made us both one and has broken 
down the dividing wall of hostility 
the changes came in tidal profusion in the soviet union and its 
satellite countries one after another like some pentup force 
breaking loose uncontainable overflowing toppling tyrants 
unleashing multitudes from their chains 
almost magically the changes came generally without violence 
in socalled soft or velvet revolutions 
not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord of 
hosts the biblical prophet zechariah said 
just as christs resurrection defied logic so on another plane 
did the breakthrough of nations the sweeping transformation of 
1989 contradicted all prior analyses and predictions it went 
against the prognostications of the keenest thinkers and the 
gloomiest doomsayers 
it is difficult to think of any series of developments more 
astonishing said roman catholic historiantheologian richard 
mcbrien 
harvard historian richard pipes wrote the recent events there 
have surpassed the wildest fantasies of any observer of soviet 
affairs who was willing to go on record 
the facts those grim facts of life in the soviet bloc were 
suddenly turned upside down just as the crucified arose eastern 
europes long coerced and silenced millions lurched forth into the 
exhilarating yet bewilderingly unfamiliar light of new freedom 
we are like children waking from a nightmare in the middle of 
the night emilian mercan a member of the hastily formed 
provisional government of craiova romania said after the 
middecember collapse of the harsh ceausescu regime all we want 
is reassurance that it wont happen again 
gradually the countries of eastern europe are permitting such 
gifts to the spirit as the freedoms to speak out assemble 
organize and vote but the daybreak atmosphere like life itself 
is loaded with risk and uncertainty 
it happened so quickly said petar darliev a bulgarian 
imprisoned for nine years who at 74 is helping plan the countrys 
first multiparty elections in 45 years scheduled for june the 
hard part starts now 
it is a peculiar drama which no earthling could have 
written said previously imprisoned playwright vaclav havel 
chosen to be czechoslovakias president by a new parliament in 
december general elections are set for june 8 
of the times before the crucifixion the apostle paul wrote 
we know that the whole world has been groaning in travail until 
now 
for much of the 20th century the globe has been groaning 
caught in a tightening nuclear stranglehold with no apparent way 
to escape 
but the metamorphosis provided by christ has come in a 
different order for nations writing after christ rose from the 
tomb paul said so then you are no longer strangers and 
sojourners but fellow citizens and members of the household of 
god 
the pace and scope of the changes have left statesmen and 
pundits groping for reasons scrambling to adjust to the 
transfigured scene they came in such a mounting crescendo as to 
seem almost sheer revelation 
one sees evidence of divine providence in human events like 
this said church historian robert t handy who could have 
thought it would happen 
handy historian emeritus of new yorks union theological 
seminary said he was worried about a backlash were still 
dealing with politics but he cited church involvement in eastern 
europes reform movements in saying 
the ferment for freedom has always been very strong in the 
jewishchristian tradition it boils up again and again and has 
throughout history it can be put down but it boils up again 
the hand of god can be seen in these developments handy 
added god does work in history 
so do people what scripture calls gods coworkers jesus in 
giving up his life for a greater one at easter said people would 
have to endure oppression and pain but a better time beckoned 
you will be sorrowful he said before his death at the hands 
of an occupation military regime that dominated a subjugated 
people but your sorrow will turn into joy

all at once democratic processes have come 
alive in the soviet union its monolithic communist system starting

the core of communism the soviet union is the focus of the second 
story in a fivepart easter series resurrection of nations

when secretary of state james a baker iii met with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in wyoming last fall they 
exchanged gifts baker gave cowboy boots to shevardnadze who 
presented baker with an enameled picture of jesus teaching the 
people 
you see shevardnadze remarked even we communists are 
changing our world view 
recalling the incident later baker surmised that some innate 
resurgence of faith may have been at the roots of the 
revolutionary changes sweeping eastern europe 
the lightninglike reformation that has flashed over the soviet 
colossus and its peripheries is so striking that it marks the 
beginning of a new era something is happening at the churches 
in the land where 15th century reformer martin luther fired his 
protest against romes ecclesiastical domination the churches 
became havens rallying places and an umbrella for political as 
well as religious voices of reform 
no other social force in the country had independence from the 
state and party and could thus supply space for dialogue and 
inspiration said pastor werner widrat of lutheran gethsemane 
church in east berlin 
bolstering their peaceful tactics the predemonstration 
services often included scripture readings from the beatitudes 
blessed are the peacemakers blessed are those who are 
presecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of 
heaven 
the churches had adopted the nonviolent tactics of martin 
luther king jr and mohandas gandhi typical of church messages 
issued in the crisis was this from thuringias lutheran bishop 
werner leich 
i beg you no matter what happens do not deviate from the 
principle of nonviolence do not let yourselves be intimidated 
any longer no renewal in the truth can come about unless we 
are willing to be bold and make sacrifices god has given us 
the spirit of strength our present way will not be easy but 
we shall succeed let us stand together 
crowds in bitterfeld and elsewhere sang the american civil 
rights anthem we shall overcome 
communist ruler erich honecker whose ironfisted rule lasted 18 
years was deposed oct 18 the berlin wall was opened nov 9 on 
jan 14 church mediators stopped the storming of east berlins 
secret police headquarters 
church leaders were credited for a pivotal role in the whole 
affair by world leaders including secretary of state james a 
baker iii and former west german chancellor willy brandt 
in ensuing sessions of the caretaker government new forum 
church figures led the transition prior to last months elections 
east berlin lutheran pastor rainer epplemann an early leader in 
church opposition to the regime served as minister without 
portfolio in the interim government he also headed the democratic 
reawakening party allied with the march 18 winning coalition 
favoring reunion with west germany 
at the same time lutheran pastor christian fuehrer of leipzigs 
st nicholas church warned against resurgent nationalism and 
obsession with western riches saying 
the cocacola culture is taking over and people are rushing 
blindly to change one set of chains for another 
and in a gesture of basic christian compassion lutheran bishop 
gottfried forck of berlinbrandenburg temporarily sheltered the 
fallen honecker he and his wife margot were declared 
homeless after a court ruled that the 77yearold dictators 
illness prevented jailing him on charges of high treason 
forck arranged for them to stay in two spare rooms at the home 
of lutheran pastor uwe homer noting that the shelter was offered 
in the spirit of christian mercy to sinners 
the broad turn to democracy started earlier and proceeded more 
gradually in poland and hungary 
in poland visited three times by the pope stubborn strikes and 
demonstrations in 1980 gave birth to the solidarity labor union 
the first in eastern europe the union backed by the church was 
outlawed in 1982 under martial law 
its leader lech walesa was arrested and other union leaders 
were driven underground but the union maintained pressure on the 
government the pressure coupled with a disastrous economy forced 
negotiations last year that led to the june 4 elections when 
solidarity swept into control of parliament 
in may 1988 hungary ousted its puppet party boss janos kadar 
who had ruled for 32 years ever since soviet tanks crushed a 
hungarian uprising in 1956 
a national catharsis came june 16 1989 when bodies of executed 
leaders of the revolt including that of prime minister imre nagy 
were exhumed from unmarked graves and reburied with honors 
in january 1989 hungary cut the electrified barbed wire along 
its border with austria opening it to vacationing east germans and 
others fleeing communist oppression 
all soviet troops are to be withdrawn from hungary by june 30 
1991 and last months multiparty elections were seen as the advent 
of working democracy 
god gives power to the faint wrote the biblical prophet 
isaiah they shall renew their strength they shall mount up with 
wings like eagles

the rout of communism spread swiftly but 
peaceably to czechoslovakia the fourth story in a fivepart easter

freedom and the rise of a wenceslas heritage as well as 
bulgarias repudiation of communism 
</TEXT>

he was a beloved king wenceslas sainted and celebrated in song 
and story elevated to czechoslovakias throne in 922 in a popular 
uprising against an antireligious tyrant who had seized power by 
force and murder 
a statue of the good king presides over pragues historic 
gathering place wenceslas square where 10 days of huge protest 
marches culminated nov l7 in the overthrow of another dictatorship 
and the choice of another leader named wenceslas 
that is the latinized form of the czech name vaclav which 
is the first name of vaclav havel the repeatedly imprisoned 
playwright and straighttalking dissenter against authoritarianism 
now the countrys president 
plainly surprised even awestruck at the spontaneous rise of the 
populace against 40 years of sovietarmed communist rule havel 
called it one of those strangely true contradictions the power 
of the powerless 
this is the sort of paradox manifested in the easter events the 
crucifixion of jesus his disciples scattered in hiding but then 
his resurrection in glory 
he was crucified in weakness but lives by the power of god 
scripture says 
on a temporal level the sweeping overturn of communism across 
eastern europe has brought another kind of rebirth also astounding 
its a spiritual resurrection said olga hruby czechborn 
editor of the us documentary journal religion in communist 
dominated areas freedom had been buried for a long time now 
its alive 
people underwent terrible agonies and suffering now they 
have been restored to citizenship and given back their spiritual 
freedom theyve been resurrected 
in cobblestoned wenceslas square a halfmile long and 200 feet 
wide in the golden city of medieval towers and baroque domes 
havels dec 29 elevation to the presidency was greeted by 
firecracker salutes streamers and an embracing singing throng 
your government my people has been returned to you he 
said in his first televised address to the nation jan l 
paraphrasing a 17th century moravian religious reformer john amos 
comenius 
everywhere in the world people were surprised at how these 
malleable humiliated cynical citizens of czechoslovakia found 
the tremendous strength to cast off a totalitarian system in an 
entirely peaceful and dignified manner within a few weeks havel 
said 
we ourselves were surprised at it 
proclaiming amnesty for political prisoners and those convicted 
of nonviolent crimes he urged people to help them in a 
christian spirit to find in themselves what our prisons could 
not instill repentance and a desire to lead a good life 
havel 53 who served five years in prison for criticizing 
repressive rule ascribed the new freedom to the suffering of 
others who had struggled courageously in the soviet union east 
germany hungary poland and elsewhere 
referring to the years of persecutions with many dying in 
prisons many executed and thousands of lives destroyed he said 
it was these great sacrifices which wove the backdrop of our 
newly charged freedom 
all human suffering concerns each human being he said 
this is a biblical principle that humanity is interlinked and 
that abuse of anyone anywhere imperils everyone everywhere 
christianity holds that those who share the cross of christ in 
bearing their own cross for others share ultimately in his triumph 
of resurrection 
upon him was the chastisement that made us whole scripture 
says 
czechoslovakias aging once imprisoned catholic bishop 
frantisek tomacek helped lay the groundwork for upheaval in 1985 
gathering 600000 signatures on petitions demanding religious 
freedom 
when the november demonstrations prompted beatings and arrests 
tomacek risked new arrest by recalling the previously ignored plea 
and commending this huge protest against injustices committed 
against us for decades 
all around he said countries have broken out of the prison 
of totalitarian systems we must not wait any longer it is 
necessary to act 
such encouragement helped push crowds in wenceslas square to a 
half million despite 20degree weather for the first time we 
arent scared anymore exclaimed martin jestrik a cinema student 
and demonstration organizer 
the undaunted marchers forced out the communist autocrat milos 
jakes and the entire party resigned dec 3 it was replaced by a 
provisional noncommunist coalition civic forum whose initial 
moderator and chief spokesman was he once imprisoned catholic

margaret thatcher is not the only grocers 
daughter to disturb the old order lady shirley porter is trying to 
dust the cobwebs off westminster which includes buckingham palace 
and westminster abbey 
as leader of westminster city council since 1983 lady porter 
has struggled to make one of britains richest municipalities run 
as efficiently as her fathers supermarket chain 
the sprawling metropolis of london has no citywide government or 
mayor each of the 32 boroughs elects its own council which in 
turn picks a leader westminsters 60 councilors are up for 
election in may 
lady porter wholeheartedly embracing prime minister thatchers 
free market revolution has sold the boroughs garbage collection 
and recreation facilities to private contractors 
since she became head of the council more than 9000 
councilowned apartments have been sold to their occupants as part 
of a national effort to turn tenants of public housing into 
property owners 
she is an international expert on litter and often is seen 
walking around her bailiwick picking it up lady porter entered 
politics in 1974 specifically to tackle trash and lists her 
recreations in whos who as cleaning up london and 
wastehunting 
her animated brand of radical conservatism invites frequent 
comparisons with mrs thatcher who grew up above her fathers 
grocery store 
sir jack cohen lady porters father parlayed an east london 
vegetable stall into the tesco supermarket chain and imbued his 
younger daughter with his motto you cant do business sitting on 
your armchair 
lady porter became head of westminster council as a freemarket 
conservative determined to eradicate the socialist structures that 
had long dominated local government in britain 
her strongwilled sometimes autocratic style has inspired 
allegations of financial mismanagement most notably after 
westminster sold three old cemeteries for the equivalent of 8 cents 
each critics claimed it was a case of desecrating the dead to cut 
costs 
in addition to councils some boroughs have ceremonial lord 
mayors westminsters handles the extensive ritual associated with 
a 400yearold district in the heart of a pageantryloving country 
an americanstyle mayor is more to lady porters taste and she 
would like to be one she said its the best way to cut through

people 
she sees her goal as saving westminster from becoming home to 
only the very rich and very poor lady porter says she wants to 
give westminster back to the middle classes to encourage them to 
stay so that we dont finish up like new york 
a recent survey by the magazine harpers and queen said lady 
porter was the 20th richest woman in europe with an estimated 
personal fortune of 50 million pounds 845 million her title 
derives from the knighthood of her husband sir leslie porter 
lady porters family background was reflected in her comment 
recently to a meeting of foreign journalists we believe in 
services to the customer we are a serviceoriented council its 
in my blood that people should be treated as customers 
her 170000 customers are westminsters permanent residents 
they include the members of the royal family who live at and 
around buckingham palace and the prime minister currently mrs 
thatcher who lives down the road at 10 downing street 
every day the population is swollen to more than 1 million by 
tourists shoppers and workers who throng the oxford street 
shopping district west end theaters hyde park victoria station 
the houses of parliament the government offices of whitehall and 
the local church westminster abbey 
they leave enough litter to fill trafalgar square to the height 
of admiral nelsons column five times a year 
westminster claims no council has done more than lady porters 
to fight rubbish prince philip who once accompanied her on 
garbage inspection detail has taken to greeting her at social 
functions by calling across the room how are the litter bins 
businesses pay for the upkeep of 500 garbage cans and 31

onestop services mean the availability at one counter of 
everything from election registration to parking permits 
westminster is among the first british boroughs to introduce 
glass recycling bins 
the national and local government officers association said 70 
ranking officials had quit the westminster government since lady 
porter took over one was chief executive rodney brooke who left 
last year with a retirement package said to be worth 1 million 
pounds 17 million 
brookes retirement deal enhanced a controversy already swirling 
around the sale in 1987 of the three rundown and unused cemeteries 
the council said it wanted to save 450000 pounds 760000 in 
annual maintenance the cemeteries on prime development land have 
been resold several times 
scotland yards fraud squad found no criminal wrongdoing after a 
year of investigation but the district auditors report concluded 
the council had no authority to dispose of the cemeteries 
westminster council is suing the lawyers who advised it on the sale 
opposition labor party councilors also have attacked the council 
for building britains most expensive parking lot 100 spaces in 
soho that cost 4 million pounds 676 million and for giving 
grants to private landlords to repair luxury apartments

when david grossman got married a distant aunt 
turned up at the ceremony with a bandaid hiding the number 
tattooed on her arm 
it was as though being a concentration camp survivor was 
something she should hide something that brought shame and should 
not surface at a happy celebration it was awful the israeli 
novelist recalls 
memories such as that permeate see under love the 
36yearold authors hugely ambitious attempt to portray the 
holocaust as it has filtered through to israels postholocaust 
generation the sons and daughters who had no direct experience of 
the horror yet are profoundly influenced by its legacy 
published in the original hebrew in 1986 the novel has just 
appeared in english to rare acclaim from british critics 
see under love is a sprawling book innovatively 
constructed bursting with literary magic and in the end strangely 
upbeat the opening 86page section alone is what george steiner in 
the sunday times called one of the great feats in modern 
fiction 
it tells of momik a lonely precocious 9yearold growing up in 
the israel of 1959 among parents and neighbors who survived the 
holocaust an ordinary kid would hunger to know the facts of life 
momik searches for the facts of death why will nobody tell him 
what exactly happened over there what is this thing they call 
the nazi beast what are those tattooed numbers secret codes 
momik tried everything to wash grandfathers arm but the 
number stayed fixed which gave momik an idea that maybe the number 
wasnt written from the outside but from the inside and that 
convinced him more than ever that there was somebody there inside 
grandfather and the others too maybe which is how they call out 
for help 
someone tells him that the nazi beast could come out of any 
kind of animal if it got the right care and nourishment so he 
keeps caged rodents in the cellar trying to make the beast spring 
from one of them and be tamed 
in the second section momik is a young author trying to write 
about the holocaust he is convinced that he has finally grasped 
its meaning that he must be tough unloving and pessimistic to 
be ready when it happens again 
if i ever had a child momik tells his wife the first 
thing i would do in the morning would be to slap his face just 
like that so hell know theres no justice in this world only 
strife 
part 3 is about momiks grandfather anshel wasserman once a 
famous writer of childrens stories who is now in a concentration 
camp neigel the nazi commandant who grew up on wassermans books 
makes him tell him a story every night wassermans cunningly woven 
stories coax a spark of humanity out of neigel that drives the nazi 
to suicide 
this sequence leads into the final section in which grossman 
attempts to tie the threads together in an inventive encyclopedic 
format and deliver the books ultimate message of love and hope 
the book is full of allusions doublemeanings and magical 
fantasies of the wandering jew as a salmon forever swimming toward 
its beginnings of a messiah whose gift is to relieve people of 
their past of the baby kazik who lives an entire human life from 
birth to death in 24 hours of anshel wasserman himself blessed 
or cursed with a strange inability to be killed by gas or bullets 
comparisons to guenther grass salman rushdie and gabriel garcia 
marquez are inevitable and have been made by some critics 
writing about the holocaust is not easy one of the finest 
survivorauthors the israeli novelist aharon appelfeld has made 
his mark in holocaust literature by writing not about the 
atrocities but around them believing that the holocaust is a 
flame too hot to be touched 
thats perhaps because he went through the fire grossman 
said in an interview during a visit to london my feeling was 
that my own life would go up in flames if i didnt put my hand in 
the fire because there was a fire there all the time and i knew i 
wouldnt understand it until i put my hand in it 
grossman and his parents did not go through the holocaust but 
like momik he grew up with these silences always around me 
the israel of his youth was not yet ready to delve into the horror 
it was too busy absorbing immigrants building an army making the 
desert bloom its role model was the fighting israeli not the jew 
being led to the gas chamber 
incidents such as the one involving the aunt and the bandaid 
were typical he says of how the survivors themselves 
collaborated with this denial they felt themselves to be the 
symbol of the weak jew in this new advanced slightly 
arrogant militaristic israel 
at school he says i learned more about the french revolution 
than i did about the holocaust but the complexes rubbed off all 
the same 
i know how much i have to fight against things in myself 
says the bespectacled slightly built israeli i also feel the 
footprints of this fear of annihilation this suspicion toward 
everyone i have to invest so much energy to not distrust people 
to take them on faith to enjoy life just to live 
clearly he succeeded his other wellknown book the yellow 
wind was an agonizing account of palestinian life under israeli 
occupation and he has campaigned hard for israel to talk to the 
palestinians he was sacked from his job at israel radio over an 
order forbidding the broadcast of plo voices and reinstated after 
a public outcry government censors briefly barred schoolage 
audiences from viewing a play based on the yellow wind 
we survived the holocaust in order to live and now we live 
in order to survive he says to live you have to be flexible 
to accept changes and turn them to your advantage the survivor 
cant accept changes to open up to take a risk these are 
abilities that have atrophied among us

residents alarmed by pollution are 
demanding the government change policies that helped create an 
economic miracle but also led to environmental disaster 
taipei residents inhale so much dirty air they have almost 
become vacuum cleaners said lin piyao a chemistry professor at 
tunghai university 
blockades of factories protest rallies and marches have become 
ordinary events in taiwan 
demonstrations have forced some businesses to close and others 
to consider moving overseas the government has promised billions 
of dollars will be spent to clean up the mess 
we shall no longer allow certain people to make a fortune by 
having others sacrifice their right to a better environment said 
eugene chien head of the governments environmental protection 
administration 
most of our factories have begun to enforce better pollution 
control but people want to see the results quickly they dont 
trust any commitments 
such comments are new from a government that has gone all out to 
build a prosperous exportoriented economy while doing little to 
force pollution control on industries 
policies that helped take this densely populated island of 20 
million to the rank of 13th in trading volume also made taiwan 
arguably one of the worlds filthiest places 
official reports say 34 percent of the rivers are polluted and 
little clean water is found outside the remote highlands of central 
taiwan 
most villagers have virtually given up protecting the 
rivers which have become drainage ditches for factories said 
shih hsinmin professor of chemical engineering at national taiwan 
university 
a perpetual haze envelops taipei the capital caused by 
pollutants that include exhaust from 1 million cars and motorcycles 
used by the citys 3 million people 
cases of pollution by individual factories have attracted wide 
attention 
chinese petroleum corp a stateowned concern hooked 20000 
nearby residents to a piped water system because their well water 
was so polluted by oil that it became flammable 
a survey by a doctor at national taiwan university hospital 
found symptoms of lead poisoning in half the 64 workers at a 
battery recovery factory in keelung port on the north coast 
thirteen of 32 children at a nearby kindergarten suffered mental 
retardation the doctor attributed to pollution from the plant 
a chorus of protest began in 1987 when the lifting of martial 
law after 38 years made demonstrations legal and allowed greater 
freedom of expression 
many of the 7500 demonstrations held since martial law ended 
have had antipollution themes protesters have conducted hunger 
strikes and dumped dead fish at the doors of government offices 
villagers have held lengthy sitin blockades of several 
factories accused of polluting the environment forcing some plants 
to close and others to pay compensation construction projects have 
been delayed or halted because of the outcry including important 
petrochemical plants and power stations 
taiwans largest conglomerate formosa plastics group responded 
to protests at the proposed site of an ethylene plant by saying it 
might move some manufacturing facilties to mainland china 
officials say they fear hundreds of textile and plastic firms 
that rely on the conglomerates products might follow the 
government has announced plans to clean up staterun factories but 
there is concern that modernizing equipment at the aging plants may 
not help much 
the 10 major staterun companies involved in oil refining 
power generation and steel and fertilizer production have 
announced plans to spened the equivalent of 34 billion on 
pollutioncontrol equipment in the next four years nearly double 
the figure for the previous four 
some private companies have other solutions the china gulf 
plastic corp in miaoli a northern city has provided residents 
with gas masks in case of a large chlorine emission 
environmentalists are not impressed with official efforts to 
clean up 
the government still gives top priority to economic 
development said lin the chemistry professor who also heads 
the taiwan environmental protection union 
critics of the government claim factories rarely are closed for 
violating antipollution laws and are allowed to pay fines instead 
which are much cheaper than buying equipment to reduce pollution 
some environmentalists want the government to phase out 
industries that cause the worst pollution they say it might cause 
a brief economic slowdown but would boost the cleaner 
hightechnology ventures officials view as a key to future 
development 
environmental protection can go hand in hand with economic 
development said shih the national taiwan university professor 
they dont have to contradict each other

in the nine o authorial voice theres no narrator in the 
musical sondheims lyrics and music are a narrative voice 
particularly the title song which echoes throughout the evening 
wager says what sondheims score really did was to internalize 
the experience the ironic pathetic dramatic experience of the 
kaufman and hart play he gave an emotional response to it 
two full drafts were written before the arena production went 
into rehearsals they were complicated by the fact that wager 
severely tore ligaments in his leg just before rehearsals started 
in new york he did much of the rehearsals from a wheelchair or 
using crutches 
what the trio tried for was a much cleaner and simpler story 
making the reasons franklin sold out much clearer and more 
believable and they pretty much succeeded according to the 
critics while the reviews were mixed the version done at arenas 
kreeger theater is likely to be the one that will be done in the 
future by colleges other regional theaters community theaters and 
amateur groups 
steve and george have decided that this is the version they 
would like to see published that the musical has finally found its 
right shape and form wager says and to me that could be no 
greater reward

arnold schwarzenegger has the muscle so to 
speak to direct one of his own movies but he didnt want to make 
his debut on such a major project 
instead he directed a 30minute episode of tales from the 
crypt for home box office which will be seen saturday as part of 
a trilogy of the ghoulishly witty series taken from the 1950s comic 
book 
although you have a chance to walk into a top spot of 
directing because of where you are in your career i didnt feel 
comfortable with that schwarzenegger said 
i wanted to start at the bottom as i did in body building and 
in acting he said i wanted to learn i didnt want to start 
out with a big movie and fall on my face 
schwarzeneggers episode the switch stars william hickey 
as a very rich very old man who keeps swapping body parts with a 
younger man to get a beautiful young woman to marry him it also 
stars rick rossovich and kelly preston 
richard tuggle and michael taav wrote the script from a story 
originally published in the tales from the crypt comic book 
hbos tales from the crypt has made it a practice to attract 
hot directors or highprofile people looking for a chance to direct 
its directors have included walter hill 48 hrs johnny 
handsome robert zemeckis back to the future romancing 
the stone richard donner the omen superman howie 
deutch pretty in pink christopher walas the fly ii 
richard greenberg little monsters and peter seaman and 
jeffrey price writers of who framed roger rabbit 
hill zemeckis and donner are among the series executive 
producers 
the people at tales from the crypt were all friends of mine 
and people i had worked with before schwarzenegger said they 
knew i was interested in directing id been mentioning it for the 
last two years 
next he said hed like to try his hand at directing a 
television movie 
his only previous experience with a tv movie and only dramatic 
appearance on television was a role as mickey hargitay in the 
1980 movie the jayne mansfield story 
as for directing himself in a movie schwarzenegger smiled and 
said i dont know if i could handle directing myself id have 
to have some serious educational talks first with people whove 
done it like clint eastwood and warren beatty and sylvester 
stallone 
the opportunity to direct came after he had completed total 
recall a 40 millionplus futuristic thriller filmed in mexico 
city due out this summer 
schwarzenegger spoke in his office in a converted warehouse near 
the beach in venice behind his desk is one of seven identical 
paintings of his wife nbc newscaster maria shriver done by andy 
warhol pictures and mementos from such movies as conan the 
barbarian red heat the terminator commando 
predator and twins are everywhere 
there also are pictures of president bush with schwarzenegger 
an active republican supporter despite his marriage into the 
kennedy family he also is chairman of the presidents council on 
physical fitness and sports 
did directing have any surprises for him 
the biggest surprise was how tired i was at the end of the 
day schwarzenegger said my feet were almost falling off i 
was on my feet 15 hours a day directing and choreographing scenes 
running to wardrobe checking with special effects and working on 
every aspect of the picture 
after i saw it all put together i was surprised at how 
important casting was each actor pulled off his part so well 
because he was perfect for the role he said 
schwarzenegger directed the episode in eight days with no 
problems but he had to call in help for the editing 
i got it down to 31 minutes but it had to be 26 minutes he 
said you work so hard on those scenes you cant brutally cut 
them you have to step back and let someone who isnt as 
emotionally involved come in and cut it it made it a better show 
his next project is another comedy kindergarten cop with 
ivan reitman who directed twins at the helm 
ive been wanting to do something with kids im very good 
with kids said schwarzenegger who recently became a father with 
the birth of katherine eunice i play a tough cop who goes 
undercover as a kindergarten teacher and finds that his iron 
discipline doesnt work on the kids 
despite the fact that hell do terminator ii in the fall 
schwarzenegger said his film roles have changed in recent years 
its a reflection of where my career started and where its 
going he said when youre struggling to get started there 
are only certain things the studios think youre capable of doing 
and only certain directors are willing to work with you 
but when you successfully pull off certain roles it gets more 
interesting you get offered better scripts and more creative 
directors want to work with you i dont have to pull off my shirt 
and flex my muscles

now that everybody has played out the 
preliminary roles the wellrehearsed political furor over flag 
burning is headed into reruns the first reprise is in the supreme 
court to be followed depending on the script there by another in 
congress 
everybody includes the flag burners themselves a handful of 
showoffs without whom the whole production would have closed by 
now but that would have been at the cost of a safe showy 
republican campaign issue 
neither side in the political flag parade wavers or burners 
could operate without the other 
the next question to be settled is the constitutionality of a 
law congress passed last fall making it a federal crime to burn 
the american flag the supreme court is going to hear arguments on 
the issue on may 14 in time to make its decision by july 
if that decision matches the ruling that started the whole 
business last june overturning a texas law against flag burning 
congress will make the next move and there is little doubt that it 
will be to approve an amendment to the constitution to ban 
desecration of the flag 
that will take twothirds votes in the house and senate then 
threequarters of the states to ratify the amendment those steps 
would be a foregone conclusion even in the judgment of opponents 
who argue that the first amendment should protect expressions of 
dissent no matter how offensive 
the issue is too incendiary politically for many elected 
officeholders in either party to vote in favor of leaving it 
alone so it has become an argument over how to ban flag burning 
president bush wanted a constitutional amendment in the first 
place saying he doubted there was any other way to ban flag 
burning democratic congressional leaders said it could be done by 
law without constitutional tinkering and they passed one 
including a provision for swift review by the supreme court bush 
let it become law without his signature 
on cue the flag burning types reappeared there being a reason 
for somebody to pay attention to them again they courted arrest by 
burning flags at a federal building in seattle and on the capitol 
steps in washington that provided the test cases they sought and 
federal judges in both cities held the law unconstitutional 
that in turn led straight to the situation bush and the 
republicans had forecast last summer and revived the issue in time 
for the 1990 election campaign 
the interdependence of burners and banners is not the only irony 
in the flag situation the justice department is now making the 
case for a law the administration argued against on grounds that 
it would not pass constitutional muster when it got back to the 
supreme court lawyers for the democratdominated congress are on 
the same side urging the court to uphold the statute 
each side suspects the other of ulterior motives the 
administration sought and got speedy court review some democrats 
suspect that what the republicans are looking for is a decision 
that will overturn the law reviving the issue for another fourth 
of july republicans accused the democrats of trying to get the 
whole thing delayed until fall so that there wouldnt be a 
decision before the november elections 
those suspicions boiled into debate late last month when lawyers 
for the house told the court it should give the case priority in 
the fall term beginning next october republicans protested 
bitterly noting that the law passed last year and asked the court 
to expedite the review to the greatest extent possible 
the democrats insisted that their lawyers had not tried to 
shelve the issue but wanted ample time for full argument and 
consideration because according to rep richard a gephardt the 
majority leader we want the best possible chance of getting the 
court to uphold this statute 
republicans said it was a political dodge you will not 
deceive the american public said rep thomas j bliley jr 
rva they know better and they will remember in november 
the court made those arguments moot when it decided to hear the 
flag cases next month but the house dispute and the three roll 
call votes that ended it show the political power of the flag 
issue 
republicans hoisted a resolution to withdraw the house brief 
that suggested the court case wait until fall and democrats 
deserted their own leaders on what became another series of flag 
votes the final vote was 309 to 101 to order withdrawal of the 
legal brief the democratic leadership had endorsed

think small think fast and think agile when you think about the 
1990 volkswagen corrado 
this is a car thats small on the outside surprisingly quick 
and an eyecatcher to boot 
the corrado marks something of a departure for volkswagen the 
no 1 carmaker in europe the car is designed as bill young vice 
president in charge of vwunited states put it to change the way 
you think about volkswagen 
forget about the nofrills vws of old the corrado is the first 
to offer at its initial debut in the market a host of standard 
features that would normally be optional on vws power windows 
air conditioning and heated outside mirrors its also the first vw 
to have a tilt steering wheel 
thats not all the corrado has a body by the same master 
european coachbuilders who brought us the cute little karmann ghia 
years ago plus a dashboard readout that details average fuel 
economy distance traveled and average speed just like the one you 
would find in many luxury cars 
most impressively the corrado also is the quickest volkswagen 
ever thanks to a special supercharger under the hood that spurs 
the little fourcylinder engine up to 158 horsepower 
helping the performance both in speed and fuel economy is a 
unique rear spoiler that rises automatically at 45 mph to help 
ensure the cars speedy movement through air with a minimum of 
rearend lift the spoiler begins to retract when speeds decline to 
12 mph 
the corrados sporty performance and wellpackaged amenities 
come at a base price of 17900 competitors include the ford probe 
gt which has a base price of 14726 the mitsubishi eclipse gs 
turbo at 14169 and the toyota celica gts at 16268 
one difference between the corrado and many other competitors in 
this segment however is the rearseat room vw says the corrados 
rear seating area is a bit larger than most other similar cars 
indeed despite the test cars compact size a bit over 13 feet 
long seating in back wasnt as bad as i feared though my view 
was wellblocked by the front bucket seats and headrests and my 
head brushed the ceiling i found the sculpted seats to be very 
comfortable and legroom was ok with the front seat moved up a 
ways legroom was at a minimum when the front seat was pushed all 
the way back although my knees still werent touching the rear of 
the front seats perhaps because the backs of the front bucket 
seats were designed to slant inward 
the rear seats are split onethird and twothirds so they can be 
folded down for more cargo space but first the rear center 
armrest must be raised and set between the two front seats watch 
when you replace the armrest in back so that you dont cover the 
seat belt connectors 
the corrado also has a nice storage shelf that covers the hatch 
area if needed 
the test car was fun to zip around in and the power is 
surprising the car is rated at a quick 75 seconds for its 060 
mph performance top speed is 140 mph 
yet the corrado got good mileage more than 24 mpg in mixed city 
and highway driving during the test the gearshift for the 
fivespeed manual transmission felt notchy but the transmission 
worked well with the fourcylinder engine 
the hatchback requires lifting items up and over the high rear 
body of the car and the storage space is raised slightly in the 
middle above the hidden spare tire compartment 
the corrado does not have airbags but frontseat passengers do 
get lap belts that automatically come across the body when the 
ignition is activated 
my complaints were minor having to use a large knob to recline 
the bucket seats a highpitched squeak that seemed to come from 
the lap belt connector on the driver side as i drove no light in 
the glovebox and brake lights that stayed on for nearly a block as 
i drove with a cold engine 
vw has sold more than 2000 of the cars since last falls 
introduction and hopes to sell 10000 a year 
volkswagen looks to attract both younger and older single men 
with this car one target group has median age of 30 and median 
household income of 40000 a year spokesman val brown said the 
second group has median age of 45 and household income of 75000 a 
year 
in both groups men are expected to predominate with 75 percent 
of buyers likely to be male brown said thirtyfive percent will 
be married 70 percent will be college graduates and 65 percent 
will be in upper white collar jobs 
because the corrado is a new model consumer reports magazine 
does not list owner reports of trouble

the chinese market for american farm products 
has been huge at times and doubtful at others right now it may be 
both 
the agriculture department says china has been an erratic 
customer in the 198788 marketing year for example china bought 
39 million metric tons of us wheat the following years sales 
jumped to a record 81 million tons making china the biggest 
foreign market for us wheat 
but sales dropped back to 57 million tons so far in 198990 
the wheat marketing year will end on may 31 
analyst frederick crook of the departments economic research 
service says agricultural reform for 10 years was the force behind 
chinas expanding economy now its stalled 
the student demonstrations in tiananmen square and the 
governments bloody crackdown last june 4 prompted leadership 
changes and political turmoil that have commanded beijings full 
attention 
until the leadership question is resolved very few further 
changes will be made in chinas rural policies crook said those 
policies could have much to do with future us commodity sales to 
china and its 11 billion people 
last week communist party chief jiang zemin was named as new 
chairman of the state central military commission replacing senior 
leader deng xiaoping earlier chinas parliament the national 
peoples congress accepted dengs resignation from his last 
official government post 
jiang 63 is dengs handpicked successor and in november 
succeeded him as head of the partys central military commission a 
key policymaking body with nearly the same membership as the state 
group 
deng 85 is still regarded as chinas most powerful man and has 
declared that jiang is the core of nextgeneration leaders 
crook said in a recent issue of farmline magazine that right 
now the country seems to be preoccupied with problems of the 
transfer of power 
chinas economic reform began about 10 years ago under deng 
with agriculture as its first phase crook said agricultural reform 
was less complicated than in the urban sector because land 
ownership was collective the communist party constituency was not 
as strong and there were fewer opposing interests 
the first phase of the reform shattered the commune system 
crook said there was little change in party organization but 
township governments village committees elected by the people and 
economic cooperatives were organized 
as the old communes were broken up farmers were free to make 
investments in new rural enterprises including orchards livestock 
production mining milling and transportation 
crook said that as a result tens of millions of farmers found 
work off the land since 1978 he said an average of more than 1 
million acres of cultivated land in china has been taken from 
production each year and used for factories housing fish farms 
roads and railroads 
the boom in rural housing has been immense crook said on a 
recent trip to china he saw roads clogged with wagons full of 
sand lime and bricks 
estimates show that between 1980 and 1988 rural people built 
more than 500 million square yards of floor space annually crook 
said rural housing space per capita doubled from 87 square feet in 
1978 to 179 in 1988 
at present chinas economy is stuck in neutral he said 
the partially reformed rural sector cant be developed further 
until the urban economy is reformed 
but crook added that since the communist partys main power base 
is in the cities urban reforms could threaten powerful economic 
and political interests 
part of the urban reform agenda includes the decontrol of 
marketing and when this was undertaken with pork eggs vegetable 
and fruit consumer prices rose 
staples such as grain vegetable oil and sugar remain under 
beijings purchaseandsupply system and retail prices have not 
changed since the mid1960s he said however the government is 
paying much more to buy these commodities with costs rising to 7 
billion in 1986 from 33 billion in 1978 
crook said government leaders are unhappy about the large food 
subsidies for city people but are reluctant to make changes 
another major problem is price reform he said often farmers 
receive low prices for their products but must pay relatively high 
prices for fertilizer diesel fuel and consumer goods 
crook said he thinks future growth in china will be industrial 
and that rural areas will see increases in processing and packaging 
of farm products 
china harvested a record 4079 million tons of grain last year 
according to beijings estimates that eclipsed the old high of 
4073 million tons in 1984 which was followed by four 
disappointing harvests 
but even with growth chinas grain production cannot keep up 
with increases in population and per capita income as families 
prosper consumer demand for meat increases and china doesnt have 
enough cropland for corn to feed expanded hog production 
the government in turn is reluctant to spend scarce foreign 
exchange to buy corn crook said the united states is the worlds 
leading supplier of corn 
it is difficult to foresee who will emerge as the powerful 
leaders in this decade and it is also difficult to forecast what 
attitudes the new leadership will have regarding reforms he said

more than 4200 years ago pharaoh 
pepy i heard one of his queens was plotting against him he sent 
weni the scribe to find out 
weni did history didnt 
guilty or innocent cunning or faithful 
pepys hapless queens have been suspects ever since 
now a frenchegyptian archaeological team digging and recording 
a queenly pyramid field 20 miles south of cairo is on its way to 
unraveling one of ancient egypts most tantalizing intrigues 
we have mention of three pepy queens in ancient texts and 
now we have three burials said vassil dobrev a bulgarianborn 
egyptologist on the team led by french historian jean leclant as 
we search on well find the answers 
which was the queen in question and did she do it 
weni went to his grave with the secret leaving a record of his 
investigation that ended i know the truth 
the scribes silence did not enhance the pharaohs reputation 
pepy i who died in 2255 bc after a 34year reign is remembered 
for two things an ability to keep egypts farflung troublesome 
colonies in line and an inability to do the same with his queens 
early grave robbers peasants revolting against the pharaohs and 
generations of stone thieves left few clues to the alleged 
conspiracy intact the pyramids of pepys queens were so completely 
ransacked that restorers work alongside archaeologists to minimize 
the danger of falling walls 
generations of sycophantic tomb artists depicted ancient 
egyptian queens as perfect mates beautiful submissive adoring 
egyptologist zahi hawass said the story of pepy and his queen 
shows that some ancient royal marriages were less than ideal 
especially since pharaohs had to deal with multiple wives and had 
both major and minor queens 
a pharaohs chief queen as consort of a god received special 
privileges including the title great royal wife because of 
the numerous other royal offspring a young pharaohtobe often 
married his sister to enhance his right to the throne 
a few queens even managed to rule egypt 
we can understand the queens importance by their tombs 
said hawass who directs the pharaonic cemeteries of giza and 
sakkara to the south the largest was the pharaohs tomb after 
all he ruled egypt his tomb had to show that power 
but directly after his tomb in size came the queens then the 
princes then the nobles and officials a cemetery easily shows 
their ranks in life 
allegations of a palace plot by a main queen was taken so 
seriously that weni was allowed inside the forbidden harem to 
investigate the rumors hawass said weni left no record of the 
queens name referring to her only as a main consort of the 
pharaoh 
until this dig the only pepy wives whose names were known were 
ankhnesmeryre i and anknnesmeryre ii both were recorded by an 
official named khui who said the king married two of his family 
members it is unlikely either sister would have been the main 
queen because their blood wasnt royal enough 
so who was the alleged plotter dobrev and his colleagues who 
are at the end of the dig for the season hope the answer lies in 
the third pyramid 
the frenchegyptian expedition first came to south sakkara site 
of the pyramids of pepy i and his pharaoh sons merenre and pepy ii 
in 1965 
its task was to record the last of the old kingdoms great 
pyramid complexes on the edge of a 3squaremile stretch of desert 
graves spanning 3000 years 
pepy is pyramid proved particularly important because of 
intricately carved texts of spells rituals and myths designed to 
help propel the soul of the dead pharaoh into the afterlife 
for two decades archaeologists were too busy to look for his 
queens but by 1988 high technology was available to help experts 
combed 50 acres of rubblestrewn dunes adjacent to pepys pyramid 
with ultrasound equipment developed in france 
soundings monitored by french technicians pinpointed two good 
possibilities the team started digging and found two queens 
pyramids 
a portion of a third pyramid was discovered last year wedged 
between the first two and roughly the same size about 66 feet tall 
three pyramids three queens 
diggers began excavating the new pyramid early this year 
uncovering pottery shards a chapel a passageway and a burial 
chamber 
by the time digging ended march 28 there were two important 
clues that could help solve the mystery of the accused queen 
one was the name nubunet on wall reliefs the queen was unknown 
to egyptologists and may have been the royal wife weni described 
she was buried in the eastern pyramid 
the second clue was an empty basalt sarcophagus its lid buried 
beneath two massive boulders that once closed the burial chamber of 
the middle pyramid 
dobrev hopes the lid when uncovered will bear the name of the 
queen and something about her but that is next seasons work 
hawass thinks he knows what weni the scribe left unsaid about 
pepys queen 
weni bragged that he alone investigated and he alone knew the 
truth the cemetery director said he had solved the problem 
thats where the tale ends 
i think weni told pepy his queen was not guilty because pepy 
would never have allowed her to be buried next to him if she had 
done something so evil

each night shirley dawson went to bed unsure if 
this would be the night the rare disease that had crippled her 
sons immune systems would take their lives 
i was on guard 24 hours a day if they would even cough at 
night i would jump up she says it was fear we were always 
living in fear 
the boys dwayne 15 and leroy jr 12 are victims of severe 
combined immunodeficiency disease better known as boy in the 
bubble disease after a scid child who survived by living in a 
sterile plastic bubble 
only 40 scid children survive around the world 13 of them live 
in the united states two of them live in the south bronx in the 
dawson household 
but thanks to a new drug treatment that essentially replaces a 
missing enzyme needed to fight common infections the dawsons sleep 
easier the years of worry relegated to painful memories 
the boys early years were marked by infections of every kind 
they received weekly blood transfusions and were stuck five six 
seven times with needles the prospect of each hospital visit made 
them sick 
they went to school but were out more than they were in 
every night i went to bed not knowing would i find them 
alive the next morning mrs dawson recalls the emotional toll 
was enormous 
i felt trapped i couldnt go anywhere i couldnt dare think 
of a family vacation which was sorely needed she said 
her husband leroy sr remembers working all day and spending 
all night at the hospital watching his children grow amid iv 
tubes oxygen lines and monitors 
it was rough trying to hold a job worrying about the kids at 
the same time says dawson an electrician 
dwayne was diagnosed as having the disease when he was 18 months 
old he always had fevers infections they would just never go 
away mrs dawson said i knew something was terribly wrong 
dwayne once spent nearly 10 months in isolation at a hospital 
he was released a week before leroy jr was born and lightning 
in the form of scid struck twice 
the dawsons were prepared for that news amniocentesis a 
pernatal genetics test had revealed the worst 
when the results came back in mrs dawsons fifth month of 
pregnancy i thought i was gonna die i could have you know 
terminated it but i didnt want that i felt we would just deal 
with it she said 
for nine years they did but then enzon inc a small south 
plainfield njbased biopharmaceutical company developed what 
its president jokingly refers to as our hairy enzyme 
researchers believe scid is caused by a lack of adenosine 
deaminase or ada an enzyme needed to stave off infection the 
enzyme is killed out of scid patients in about a half hour 
the treatment developed by enzon pegada is basically an 
enzyme with a hairlike protein attached which allows it to stay in 
the bloodstream for up to a week 
pegada used experimentally since 1985 was approved by the 
food and drug administration on march 23 there are no known side 
effects to the treatment which costs about 60000 yearly the 
dawsons long ago exhausted their insurance and medicaid is paying 
for the boys treatments 
pegada was developed with a 160000 grant from the federal 
orphan drug program which encourages companies to research 
diseases afflicting fewer than 200000 patients 
most scid patients dont live in circumstances as extreme as the 
boy in the bubble but their immune systems cannot fight infections 
as common as pneumonia and chicken pox most have died before they 
turned 2 
to date the only cure was bonemarrow transplants those who 
could not find a suitable match had to be isolated 
abbey myers executive director of the national organization for 
rare disorders applauds enzon for researching a disease that 
affects so few 
these children can look forward to happy and healthy lives now 
because enzon took a risk she says 
a teaspoon of the clear enzyme injected weekly into each of the 
dawson boys has transformed their lives and the lives of their 
parents 
i feel like a whole different person says dwayne who began 
getting injections four years ago i play more can go out more 
im happier his brother shyly adds i just feel better 
mrs dawson says she began seeing results almost 
immediately researchers hope that some day gene replacement 
will cure scid 
but mrs dawson says ill settle for this right now the 
torment is over

relax america you can change your oil 
read the sunday paper wash your clothes and eat fast food 
without further endangering planet earth 
but beware a trip to the supermarket may be more challenging 
than ever 
every time you open your wallet youre casting a vote for or 
against the environment said joel makower a washingtonbased 
author who adapted the british edition of the green consumer 
for the us market 
the bad news is that so many things we do have a negative 
effect on the environment he said the good news is that it 
doesnt take a drastic change in lifestyle to help solve the 
problem 
for wouldbe environmentalists there is no shortage of 
selfhelp guides all of which have been released in time for the 
20th anniversary of earth day april 22 one is diane maceacherns 
save our planet 750 everyday ways you can help clean up the 
earth 
this years theme is who says you cant save the world 
i really believe that one person makes a difference said 
maceachern 37 of takoma park i want this book to be a point of 
departure for everyone sitting there saying global warming is 
horrible but where do i start 
makowers brandspecific guide explains how to look for 
green or environmentfriendly groceries gardening 
supplies home appliances and cars 
twenty years ago the idea of green consumerism was a 
contradiction in terms it meant you couldnt buy anything 
makower said but now so many companies have spent millions of 
dollars in an effort to appeal to consumers who are willing to take 
environmental matters into their own hands 
the products are out there he said you just have to know 
what to look for 
for example the green consumer recommends checking boxes of 
cereal cake mix and laundry detergent to see if they are made of 
recycled cardboard 
makower also suggests buying in bulk choosing glass over 
plastic avoiding overpackaged foods and putting fruits and 
vegetables directly in the shopping cart rather than in plastic 
bags 
and at the checkout counter the question paper or plastic 
should be answered neither even paper takes up precious 
landfill space before it biodegrades and most grocery bags are 
made of virgin paper rather than recycled paper for added 
strength 
the green consumer shops for groceries with a reusable cloth bag 
makower predicts that the efactor soon will be as important 
a consideration as price quality and convenience in todays 
environmentally conscious marketplace 
according to a 1989 survey by the michael peters group a new 
yorkbased marketing firm 89 percent of the 1000 adults 
questioned said they are concerned about the environmental effects 
of products they buy seventyeight percent said they would pay 
more for items in recyclable packages and 53 percent said they had 
boycotted products for environmental reasons 
people are starting to realize that we cant wait for industry 
or government or technology to do it for us makower said we 
helped cause these problems and we have to help solve them 
maceachern says novice environmentalists can start just about 
anywhere 
the public sometimes doesnt understand the chain reaction 
the interconnectedness of everything she said but they start 
doing one thing like conserving energy by shutting off their 
lights when they dont need them and when they see that their 
utility bills have gone down then they say why dont i try to 
save water and pretty soon its just automatic 
among maceacherns suggestions 
weatherize your home as much energy leaks through american 
windows every year as flows through the alaskan pipeline 
plant trees the american forestry association says that one or 
two trees shading a central air conditioning unit can increase 
efficiency by 10 percent 
eat at home if you eat at fastfood restaurants refuse the 
styrofoam packaging it is made with chlorofluorocarbons which 
destroy the earths protective ozone layer 
plant an organic garden and avoid pesticides 
refuse to buy products harmful to the environment recycle what 
you do buy and reuse what you cant recycle each year americans 
throw away 18 billion disposable diapers 17 billion pens 2 
billion razors and 220 million tires

fetal hamsters exposed indirectly to a 
carcinogen show a high rate of cancer in middle age according to 
research findings that imply a similar risk for the children of 
mothers who smoke cigarettes 
the findings of dr hildegard m schuller apparently are the 
first to show the development of cancer in hamster offspring whose 
mothers are injected with a carcinogen known by the abbreviation 
nnk 
the hamsters are not born with cancer schuller said 
when born they are completely normal in weight and size and 
their development is normal but when theyre 1 year old a very 
high percentage have developed tumors in various organs said 
schuller professor of pathobiology and chief of the experimental 
oncology lab at the university of tennessees college of veterinary 
medicine 
depending upon the dose of nnk one of a family of chemicals 
known jointly as nitrosamines up to 70 percent of the fetuses 
developed cancerous tumors a hamster a year old is roughly 
equivalent to a person 40 to 45 years old she said 
schuller has spent three years researching the transmission of 
carcinogens through the placenta of hamsters to their fetuses a 
report on her findings has been accepted for publication later this 
year in the journal of the american association for cancer research 
pelayo correa a professor of pathology at louisiana state 
university said previous studies have shown nnk can be transferred 
through the placenta to a fetus 
but if schuller is finding these animals develop more 
cancer than others that is a new finding said correa who has 
done statistical research on the incidence of cancer in children 
based on whether their parents smoke 
there was a suspicion that might happen but nobody had found 
it before he said 
nnk schuller said is formed in the tobacco curing process and 
is found in all cigarettes it is structurally similar to nicotine 
she said 
no tumors were found in a control group of hamsters not 
receiving nnk injections she said hamsters were used in the 
research because their organs and tissues closely resemble those of 
humans 
the tumors occurred in the lungs and upper respiratory tract 
nasal cavity adrenal glands pancreas and liver 
even with one single injection we still have a highly 
significant instance of cancer developing in the offspring 
schuller said but she said its close to impossible to show 
whether nnk specifically causes cancer in humans 
the national institutes of health recently awarded schuller a 
threeyear 371675 grant to continue her research 
she said she now will vary the dosages and delivery of nnk into 
pregnant animals 
were trying to see whether there is such a thing as a safe 
dose she said the lowest dose levels were tested in the last 
three years translate into sombody smoking 10 to 15 packs of 
cigarettes a day that is very high i realize 
she said the doses are large because the gestation period of a 
hamster is just 60 days so researchers use high doses to simulate 
what a human fetus might be exposed to over nine months when the 
mother smoked every day 
schuller said she also is pursuing how cancercausing chemicals 
penetrate the placenta and get into fetal tissue the nature of the 
chemical changes that make the cancercausig chemicals and how the 
process can be prevented and how ethanol the alcohol found in 
wine liquor and beer affects the process

fears of salmonella and cholesterol neednt 
scramble easter egg decorating plans if eggs are handled properly 
and eaten sparingly 
the blue bird circle a texas organization that has sold 
handpainted easter eggs for 66 years is taking no chances it 
canceled this years sale on the advice of its lawyers who worried 
children would eat spoiled eggs and get sick 
the us department of agriculture recommends that eggs hidden 
for an egg hunt be prepared carefully to make sure that there are 
no cracks in the shells and that they are protected from dirt pets 
and other sources of bacteria 
hardcooked eggs eventually will spoil and should not be left 
at room temperature for more than two hours if they are to be 
eaten usda said 
if possible buy eggs a week or so before hard cooking them in 
very fresh hardcooked eggs the white may stick to the membrane 
lining the shell making them all but impossible to peel 
much of the recent worry has concerned raw eggs in such dishes 
as caesar salad or lightly cooked eggs blowing raw eggs for 
decorating could pose a slight risk because of the possibility of 
ingesting bacteria if you dont plan to eat the eggs wash the 
shell 
if a raw egg shell is cracked bacteria on the shell could enter 
the egg 
scientists also suspect that certain salmonella bacteria can be 
transmitted from an infected hen directly to the egg interior 
while the extent of the problem is not known the risk of illness 
remains small according to the usda 
in february the agency announced a 68 million program to help 
curb the spread of salmonella enteritidis by testing and certifying 
breeding flocks that produce tableegg layers and tracing and 
testing flocks if they are implicated in human cases of salmonella 
enteritidis 
the problem in the nations 32 billion egg industry emerged in 
the northeast and midatlantic states but has spread to the 
midwest and northwest 
the bacteria can cause cramps diarrhea fever nausea and 
vomiting the elderly and those with compromised immune systems 
could suffer serious and lifethreatening effects 
last year salmonella poisoning struck more than 1600 people 
and killed 13 the us centers for disease control said 
contaminated food was implicated in 64 percent of the outbreaks 
and 73 percent of those involved eggs 
gourmet and food amp wine magazines have stopped publishing 
recipes using raw or slightly cooked eggs 
we thought it more judicious because so many people entertain 
from our magazines and it would be terrible if someone were to 
become ill said zanne zakroff food editor at gourmet where the 
new policy should be completely in effect by the august issue 
as for cholesterol a large egg has an average of 213 
milligrams the american heart association recommends 300 
milligrams or less per day over several days or about three or 
four egg yolks which contains the cholesterol a week 
from the usda 
buy eggs from a refrigerated display case and only those with 
clean uncracked shells check the expiration date dont use eggs 
with cracked or stained shells 
store eggs in the refrigerator at home temperatures below 40 
degrees help slow the loss of moisture from the eggs and inhibit 
the growth of most bacteria that cause foodborne illness 
dont wash eggs most eggs sold commercially have been washed 
and sprayed with oil washing them can remove the protective oil 
and enable bacteria to penetrate the porous shell 
raw eggs will keep in the refrigerator about three weeks 
without significant loss of quality separated whites and yolks 
should be stored in covered containers and used within four days 
hardcooked eggs should be eaten within a week 
wash hands cooking surfaces and all equipment that come in 
contact with eggs to prevent crosscontamination even if 
contamination in an egg is counteracted in cooking the bacteria 
could be spread by the hands for example 
thoroughly cook eggs and eggrich dishes eggs generally are 
sufficiently cooked if the yolks and whites are not runny or if 
they are used in a baked food most harmful bacteria grow at 
temperatures of 40 to 140 degrees most are destroyed at 160 
degrees or higher the usda said

tests suggest pneumonia may have played 
a part in the recent deaths of hundreds of dolphins in the gulf a 
marine biologist said 
gerald regan a marine biologist at spring hill college in 
mobile ala received test results on the first four bottlenose 
dolphins found dead in alabama and pneumonia was found in three of 
the samples 
the fourth sample was too decomposed regan said recently 
regan said this is the first sign of a cause of death among more 
than 200 dolphins that have washed up on beaches along the gulf of 
mexico 
regan said he noticed irregularities in the dead dolphins 
lungs and sent them off to be tested he said the tests do not 
tell if the pneumonia was viral or bacterial or if it actually 
caused death 
we dont know what all of this means the conclusions are far 
from clear regan said 
because of the high number of deaths the federal government 
ordered a temporary halt to the capture of dolphins in the gulf 
dolphins are often captured for research 
theories on the deaths have ranged from excessive cold in late 
december to the presence of algal bloom or red tides

the oregon board of pharmacy has voted to 
restrict sales of an asthma medication because of concerns it was 
being used as a stimulant and as a methamphetamine ingredient 
the 50 vote means ephedrine tablets and capsules will be 
available in oregon only by prescription beginning as early as this 
month 
the boards action last month also means increased costs for at 
least some of the estimated 130000 to 260000 oregonians who have 
asthma those who buy ephedrine will have to bear the higher costs 
for handling by a pharmacist 
drug investigators told the board the tablets were being used in 
methamphetamine labs 
police detective jim bellah said officers found 19000 ephedrine 
tablets at a methamphetamine lab in vancouver wash 
the state of washington previously restricted ephedrine sales so 
that tablets and capsules are available by prescription only and

the recent turmoil in japans financial markets 
has left its mark on us mutual fund investors 
a tally of the best and worstperforming mutual funds released 
wednesday by lipper analytical services inc said eight of the 10 
biggest losers during the first quarter were invested heavily in 
japanese companies 
the big winners were investments in science and high technology 
several specialty funds also did well 
but overall stock and bond funds posted negative performances 
during the first three months of 1990 according to lipper the 
average total return of general equity funds was a negative 231 
percent following a 121 percent drop the previous quarter 
fixedincome fund performance was a negative 140 percent in the 
first quarter 
by comparison the dow jones industrial average of 30 bluechip 
stocks was down 069 percent and the standard amp poors 500 index 
lost 301 percent in the first quarter assuming reinvestment of 
dividends 
a michael lipper the firms president called the decline 
comforting rather than frightening and said general stock 
funds in particular had far exceeded the typical 10 percent annual 
growth rate of recent years from late 1974 to the end of the first 
quarter these funds grew by an average 165 percent he said 
we take great comfort in that the shortterm declines are 
bringing intermediateterm rates of gain back down to historic 
trends lipper said 
the same may not be true for japanoriented funds which 
historically have produced a number of moneymaking standouts in 
tandem with japans strong economic growth according to the lipper 
tally these funds classified primarily as pacific region funds 
lost an average 1318 percent in the first quarter according to 
lipper 
the nikko japan tilt fund showed the worst performance down 
2990 percent followed by slh investment pacific off 2143 
percent another big loser gt global growth japan which declined 
1367 percent had been the fourth best performer in 1989 gaining 
6073 percent 
the losses in these funds coincide with a nearly 25 percent 
plunge in japans stock market during the first quarter due partly 
to rising japanese interest rates and with a nearly 8 percent 
decline by the yen against the dollar 
the other big mutual fund losers were goldoriented funds which 
fell 693 percent and financial services off 546 percent 
performance figures in lippers rankings of 1747 continuing 
funds for the quarter assume that investors reinvest all dividends 
and capital gains distributions paid by the funds 
funds investing primarily in science and hightechnology 
companies were up 26 percent those funds and european region 
funds up 082 percent were the only categories showing growth in 
the first quarter according to lipper 
lipper said the hightech funds rebounded from a weak 
performance in 1989 when technology companies suffered from 
overcapacity and weak prices for their products 
the top hightech fund was fidelity select electronics which 
gained 1703 percent 
the biggest comeback was the strategic goldminerals fund which 
was the top performing fund in the first quarter with a 1915 
percent gain that fund was the worst performer for all of 1989 
declining 1775 percent 
lipper attributed the turnaround to a sharp rise in the stock 
price of akikolori a canadian gold mineral company in which the 
fund is heavily invested 
at the same time strategic investments the thirdbest 
performer for all of 1989 with a 6125 percent rate of return was 
the third biggest loser in the first quarter down 2110 percent

the bonwit teller name one of the oldest in 
us retailing will survive but most department stores in the 
existing chain are going out of business 
a big northeast shopping mall developer intends to rebuild and 
expand the chain starting with the purchase of bonwit teller stores 
in boston and buffalo ny from the current owner which is in 
bankruptcy proceedings 
under agreements announced in bankruptcy court wednesday bonwit 
tellers parent lj hooker corp will break up the chain and sell 
portions of it piecemeal lj hooker already liquidated its b 
altman amp co retail chain as part of its reorganization 
judge tina brozman who has been overseeing hookers chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings indicated she will endorse the agreements 
lj hooker attorney sheldon hirshon said at a hearing that the 
company would have liked to sell as much of the bonwit chain as 
possible as a going concern but a potential bid for 13 of the 16 
stores failed to materialize in time 
hirshon told the court that hooker accepted a 22 million bid 
from a consortium of investors including an entity controlled by 
real estate developer donald trump for 5 stores in boston 
buffalo new york city manhasset ny and short hills nj 
the group will close bonwits flagship store in manhattans 
trump tower as well as the manhasset and short hills branches 
consortium member pyramid cos a shopping mall developer and 
owner based in syracuse ny will run the boston and buffalo 
stores under the bonwit teller name also pyramid affiliate bontel 
corp will have rights to the bonwit teller name and plans to open 
additional stores in the future 
robert j congel pyramids managing partner said the company 
would open a new flagship store in manhattan as part of a plan to 
rebuild the chain he said pyramid is seeking a prime location on 
fifth avenue 
we look forward with great anticipation to rebuilding and 
revitalizing bonwit teller he said 
over the next three to five years pyramid plans to open bonwit 
tellers in its retail complexes in providence ri rockland 
county ny harrisburg pa and albany ny the first new 
bonwit teller will be opened in october in carousel center a 
complex pyramid is building in syracuse 
other members of the consortium are trump equitable fifth ave 
corp owner of the commercial space in trump tower pilevsky 
group a new york property owner and prutaub a venture that 
operates the mall at short hills 
the other bonwit teller stores that will continue operating are 
in cincinnati and columbia sc hooker intends to keep those 
running because they are located in hookerowned malls and closing 
them could hurt mall business 
hooker accepted four separate bids to buy the leases for the 
bonwit tellers in chicago oak brook ill palm beach fla and 
troy mich all those stores will be closed 
there were no acceptable bids for leases on the stores in bal 
harbour fla kansas city mo philadelphia jenkintown pa and 
scarsdale ny 
at a may 18 hearing hooker will try to dispose of the rest of 
the bonwit teller estate including the remaining store leases the 
corporate offices in new york and the distribution center in 
totowa nj 
hirshon the hooker attorney said the company promised to 
vacate all bonwit premises by june 30 
bonwit tellers roots go back to the 1880s when paul j bonwit 
formed a partnership with edmund d teller the new yorkbased 
retailer they began built a reputation over the years as an upscale 
store specializing in womens fashions 
but in recent years the chain has run into trouble partly 
because of stiff competition from smaller specialty apparel stores 
and a generally sluggish retail environment the company has 
struggled financially since its acquisition by atlantabased lj 
hooker in 1987 
bonwit teller lost 2 million on revenue of 149 million in 1988 
and lost 6 million on revenue of 158 million in 1989 for the 
year ended jan 31 bonwit teller appears to have lost about 21 
million on 168 million in revenue according to preliminary 
figures from lj hooker 
the companys corporate parent hooker corp is based in 
australia this past summer it went into provisional 
liquidation an australian legal proceeding similar to 
bankruptcy lj hooker filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act in august

sales of north americanmade vehicles rose 29 
percent in late march as better sales at general motors corp 
offset declines at ford and chrysler while japanese automakers made 
strong gains 
gms vehicle sales during the period rose 61 percent while 
sales for ford motor co declined 38 percent and chrysler corps 
fell 166 percent 
combined car and truck sales for the nine major us automakers 
rose to a daily average of 43688 in late march compared with an 
average of 42451 during the same period last year the companies 
said wednesday 
car sales were up 27 percent and lighttruck sales rose 32 
percent 
sales in the yearearlier period were relatively soft 
nevertheless gms increase was significant because it followed a 
prolonged period of declining market share said auto analyst scott 
merlis of morgan stanley amp co of new york 
the real story here as we end the first quarter is that a 
new trend has developed and gm is a marketshare gainer he said 
gms share of the domestic car market in late march stood at 
451 percent up from 446 percent during the same period last 
year fords share dropped to 265 percent from 296 percent and 
chrysler tumbled to 97 percent from 13 percent 
gms gains were modest though alongside those made by 
japaneseowned plants in the us the socalled transplants took 
187 percent of the domestic market in late march up from 128 
percent a year earlier 
gms car sales rose 39 percent in late march and much of the 
overall gain came from a 109 percent increase in light truck 
sales including the companys new minivans 
on march 22 gm began offering 1000 rebates on the companys 
trio of new minivans the chevrolet apv pontiac trans sport and 
oldsmobile silhouette gms share of the domestic light truck 
market in late march rose to 405 percent from 377 percent while 
fords and chryslers shares dropped to 338 percent and 203 
percent respectively 
in january chrysler offered a similar rebate on its minivans 
the most popular in the industry and sales soared but since that 
incentive expired jan 31 sales have dropped off 
despite the apparent incentivespurred boost in gms truck 
sales underlying consumer demand appears to be strengthening 
merlis said 
theres some real underlying consumer demand there he said 
if hes right the demand is just beginning to show up car and 
truck sales for all of march and for the first quarter of 1990 are 
lagging behind last years pace 
combined domestic and imported car and truck sales of 1271465 
vehicles last month was 31 percent lower than in march 1989 for 
the first quarter of 1990 sales were 18 percent behind last 
years pace 
drawing firm conclusions about trends in vehicle sales based on 
one 10day reporting period can be misleading since a variety of 
factors including incentives and even weather can affect sales 
but merlis said theres reason to wonder whether the sales 
slump that began in october as the 1990 model year got under way is 
at an end 
if sales can continue at this rate next month that would be 
very encouraging from a consumer standpoint and in terms of a 
general recovery he said 
robert rewey fords vice president for sales took a similar 
view 
we expect the second half of the year to be somewhat 
stronger than the first assuming a pickup in economic growth from 
its present sluggish pace he said

baxter international inc will emerge a stronger 
player in the medical supply business after paring its workforce by 
10 percent and shedding a fifth of its plants according to 
industry analysts 
baxter announced those cuts wednesday as part of a restructuring 
that also includes the sale of several marginal businesses and 
creation of a separate division for diagnostic products part of 
which it may sell to the public 
industry analysts said the costcutting measures were long 
overdue following years of belttightening in the medical industry 
as providers have striven to contain healthcare costs 
hospitals have been pushed up against the wall in terms of the 
cost cuts theyve had to make and thats affecting the suppliers to 
the hospitals as well said jerry fuller of duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago 
analyst joseph francis of smith barney harris upham amp co said 
the austerity measures while unexpectedly severe were very 
positive for baxters future 
what will emerge is a much leaner company in a very 
competitive market francis said this should dramatically 
improve their earnings power 
baxter said that over the next three years it plans to lay off 
about 6400 of its 64300 employees and close or sell 21 of its 
approximately 100 manufacturing plants in 24 countries including 
46 in the united states 
spokesman geoffrey fenton would not identify the plants slated 
for closure but said baxter already has begun to notify those that 
will be affected 
these decisions are in the best longterm interests of all of 
our constituencies chairman vernon r loucks jr said in a 
statement 
baxter must keep evolving to help its customers meet their 
objective of providing highquality health care while controlling 
costs loucks said 
the company also said it planned to raise prices on many 
products and channel more money into research and development 
baxter based in the chicago suburb of deerfield said it would 
post a firstquarter net loss of 375 million to 400 million or 
150 to 160 a share after taking a pretax charge of 566 
million for the restructuring 
the company said the changes will generate annual pretax 
savings of up to 275 million by 1993 and help baxter achieve 
annual growth of 15 to 18 percent in operating income over the next 
several years 
baxter boosted profits by 15 percent last year to 446 million 
on sales of 74 billion 
the companys common stock fell 25 cents wednesday to 2437 a 
share on the new york stock exchange 
fenton said the layoffs included 500 people already cut from the 
corporate headquarters staff 
he declined to identify the manufacturing businesses that baxter 
intends to sell saying arrangements had not been completed he 
said baxter may continue to distribute products of those businesses 
even if it no longer owns them 
baxter said the businesses to be sold had total sales of about 
140 million last year 
the company said it will establish a separate subsidiary for its 
diagnosticsproducts business and is considering selling a minority 
interest in the subsidiary to the public diagnostics accounted for 
14 billion of baxters sales last year 
the company said it was committed to diagnostics products and to 
inhome health care a growing market that baxter latched onto via 
its 1987 acquisition of caremark inc 
caremark was heralded last year for innovation as the sole 
distributor of clozapine a schizophrenia drug that the company 
delivers to patients homes weekly the company also monitors the 
patients for potentially toxic side effects of the drugs 
despite such innovations baxters core business remains the 
manufacture of basic hospital supplies gowns intravenous 
solutions and surgical supplies and the distribution of 
healthcare products manufactured by others said james fenger an 
analyst who follows the company for kemper financial services inc 
baxter said its latest moves were consistent with the strategic 
plan it has been pursuing since it acquired the american hospital 
supply corp in 1985 and caremark

bank of new england corp is cutting 5600 workers 
and slashing 300 million in costs but the troubled company admits 
that even with the cuts its future is in doubt 
the bank operating under government orders for more than a 
month announced the costcutting plan wednesday but the 
institution also filed federal documents this week saying it 
expects to see an increase in troubled loans 
furthermore the bank acknowledged its future may hinge on 
whether the slumping new england economy continues to decline 
continued deterioration in the new england economy and the 
real estate market could adversely impact the corporations 
recovery efforts the bank said 
the job reductions which will lower the workforce by about 
onethird will come through a combination of layoffs attrition 
and asset sales the bank also has frozen hiring eliminated 
financial bonuses and suspended raises for bank officers 
analysts said that although the moves should strengthen the 
bank its footing remains extremely shaky 
the bank gave a similar assessment in documents filed with the 
securities and exchange commission this week 
if the corporation is unsuccessful in addressing the 
corporations current difficulties it is likely that external 
assistance from third parties andor regulatory authorities will be 
required the bank said 
bank of new england lost more than 1 billion last year due 
largely to bad real estate loans 
the bank said that in addition to 22 billion in nonperforming 
assets reported at the end of 1989 it had 1 billion in loans that 
were still performing but where borrowers were experiencing some 
financial difficulty 
the bank said it expects nonperforming assets will increase in 
the first quarter 
that could be a sign that problems could be spreading outside 
the banks real estate portfolio into other business loans said 
gerard cassidy an analyst with tucker anthony inc 
the key is the economy he said the new england economy 
is not cooperating 
the bank said it would lay off about 1700 employees and would 
notify them over the next several days 
these decisions were difficult and they are painful for all of 
us bank chairman lawrence k fish said in a letter to employees 
but difficult as these steps are it is essential that we take 
them now to assure our future viability and our ability to rebuild 
as a stronger though smaller bank of new england he said 
at the same time our primary concern as we rebuild is 
customer service and maintenance of the highest possible credit 
quality fish said 
an earlier staff reduction plan was canceled by fish after he 
was named chairman on march 9 at the time he ordered a thorough 
review of the organizations direction structure and personnel 
needs 
personnel cuts asset sales and other measures are expected to 
reduce annual operating expenses by approximately 300 million the 
bank said 
bank officials said the action was being taken as part of a 
strategic plan outlining new directions for the corporation 
details of the plan are expected next week 
the bank last month announced it had signed federal orders that 
set tight guidelines for lending practices and other operations 
james moynihan senior vice president of advest inc in boston 
predicted the bank eventually will sell off all its subsidiaries in 
connecticut maine and rhode island 
in order to survive they will have to become a 
massachusettsonly bank he said the results if successful 
would be a very competitive bank with assets below 20 billion 
compared with a 32 billion level last year 
the bank said its new strategic plan will try to concentrate on 
primary banking and lending businesses 
other operations will be eliminated including processing 
services large corporate banking outside of new england leasing 
and discount brokerage services 
the bank also disclosed that it was being sued in federal court 
in pennsylvania by the penn mutual life insurance co which has a 
10 million 14 percent bank of new england bank note due in 1996 
penn mutual maintains the banks asset sales breached covenants 
in the note the insurance company asked the court to order the 
bank to speed up its principal payments 
the bank also faces a lawsuit from shareholders who claim 
company executives misrepresented the banks financial status by 
not disclosing the mounting troubles sooner last year

proposed legislation to end the turf battle 
between the federal agencies that oversee stock and futures markets 
would create a single markets and trading commission 
a bill to merge the securities and exchange commission and the 
commodity futures trading commission was introduced wednesday but 
even supporters concede it faces rough going 
meanwhile the chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees 
the sec proposed a bill to curb abuses in the low cost high risk 
penny stock market 
the cftc which regulates the futures exchanges and the sec 
which oversees the securities industry have been squabbling over 
which agency has authority to regulate socalled hybrid 
products such as stock index futures 
the proposed new agency would be phased in over a twoyear 
period and one division would still deal exclusively with physical 
commodities such as metals oil and farm products like wheat pork 
bellies and soybeans 
rep dan glickman dkan who cosponsored the bill with rep 
dennis e eckart dohio said the legislation does not seek to 
create a super sec or a super cftc it is not a takeover of one 
agency by the other 
glickman is a member of the house agriculture committee which 
oversees the cftc and eckart sits on the energy and commerce 
committee that keeps tabs on the sec they said committees in both 
ther senate and house with jurisdiction over each agency would 
retain their oversight authority despite the merger 
congressional oversight has been a stumbling block to previous 
merger efforts and may remain so 
it moves around the furniture and puts them all in one room 
but im not sure if it gets you any benefits said rep glenn 
english dokla chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees 
the cftc 
i think its unnecessary its a kick in the face of the 
commodities industry to suggest that they will lose their identity 
and lose their uniqueness said rep e thomas coleman rmo 
the ranking minority member of the subcommittee 
the cftcsec rivalry heated up after a federal appeals court 
ruled last year that cftc has authority over a financial product 
with any aspect of a futures contract including stock index 
futures 
treasury secretary nicholas brady has proposed stripping the 
cftc of some or all of its authority over financial futures 
and sec chairman richard c breeden has said that at the very 
least the sec should have authority over stock index futures 
glickman and eckart said their bill is a wholesale 
reorganization of how the government oversees these markets 
but a spokesman for the cftc david gary said we see no no 
need to combine the agencies 
the penny stock reform bill proposed by rep edward markey 
dmass would require that all penny stocks be traded through an 
automated quotation system 
penny stocks inexpensive but highly risky securities that 
usually arent listed on stock exchanges are legal but they are 
usually issued by new companies with untested or uneven track 
records 
that makes them risky and often prone to fraud because 
information about their earnings history is hard to come by or 
confirm 
statelevel securities regulators have said penny stock fraud 
costs us investors 2 billion a year 
the proposed legislation would ban blank check stock 
offerings and blind pool penny stocks which offer stock to the 
public in companies that plan to engage in mergers and acquisitions 
but without clearly stating their business goals

trans world airlines owner carl icahn has 
resurfaced as a possible buyer of eastern airlines whose unsecured 
creditors have stepped up pressure for a sale sources said 
icahn and associates held informal discussions recently with 
representatives of goldman sachs amp co financial advisers to the 
committee of easterns unsecured creditors said the sources who 
spoke wednesday on condition they not be identified 
the talks have been preliminary and the notion of an icahn bid 
for eastern has not yet ripened one source said 
eastern spokesman robin matell declined to comment on the 
matter icahn was said by his office to be unavailable for comment 
and aides at goldman sachs didnt return phone calls 
goldman sachs is said to have told the committee recently that 
twa wasnt interested in bidding for eastern but a source close to 
the company said there is some interest 
the creditors committee exasperated by easterns mounting 
losses voted tuesday to reject the airlines latest reorganization 
proposal and seek the appointment of a special trustee to sell 
eastern the creditors have been soliciting possible buyers behind 
the scenes in recent weeks sources say 
icahn a corporate investor who took twa private in october 
1988 appears to have emerged as the leading potential buyer the 
sources said they suggested he might bid for eastern in concert 
with other investors 
icahns interest in miamibased eastern goes back at least to 
september 1988 when members of easterns machinists union met with 
him about a possible bid 
after easterns chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on march 9 1989 
and the subsequent collapse of an attempted buyout led by 
exbaseball commissioner peter v ueberroth icahn was the unions 
favorite to buy the airline 
machinists pilots and flight attendants struck eastern on march 
4 1989 
icahn was twas white knight in 1986 buying the airline in 
a 440 million deal to thwart an attempted takeover by frank 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
industry analysts have noted a potential compatibility between 
eastern and twa easter operates mainly between the northeast and 
florida and atlanta while twa is strongest in transatlantic 
operations 
but icahn backed off from eastern last may twa said then it 
needed more time to discuss with its unions the feasibility of 
integrating the twa and eastern workforces and was not prepared to 
submit a formal bid 
eastern battered by the strike continues to report losses and 
is having difficulty attracting passengers 
the airline has sold more than 800 million in assets with the 
approval of a us bankruptcy court and would now be valued at far 
less than the 464 million offered by the ueberroth group 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has approved easterns 
agreement to sell its valuable latin american routes to american 
airlines for 349 million the transaction still must be approved 
by the transportation department which is expected to decide by 
friday 
twa has problems of its own including a steep rise in operating 
expenses it recently reported a net loss of 2985 million in 
1989 compared with a profit of 2497 million the previous year 
icahn has been pushing in recent months for wage concessions 
seeking 80 million in wage and benefit cuts from pilots for 
example 
some believe icahn wants to leave the airline business 
altogether he is the largest stockholder of usx corp and 
recently asked the shareholders for a nonbinding vote on a 
proposal to spin off the steel division there has been speculation 
that he could move to take over all of usx

trustees of new york city and california pension 
funds who want exxon corp to act now to prevent future 
environmental accidents like the alaskan oil spill didnt hear what 
they wanted from the companys chairman 
we did not get any concrete commitments other than a promise 
of a future meeting said elizabeth holtzman the new york city 
comptroller 
but she called wednesdays session with chairman lawrence g 
rawl useful the beginning of a dialogue 
officials of the funds which are some of exxons biggest 
shareholders requested the meeting because of concern about the 
impact on the companys earnings and ultimately the price of 
their stock holdings from accidents like last years disastrous 
alaska oil spill 
california comptroller gray davis said he was disappointed rawl 
did not agree to follow any of several suggestions made by the 
pension fund officials 
we did not come away with any specific promises said davis 
however i know we got his attention 
the officials said they asked exxon to take several steps 
including annual environmental audits they asked the oil company 
to examine its operations identify highrisk procedures and show 
what actions are being taken to reduce those risks 
they also asked for creation of special response teams to deal 
with environmental accidents and asked rawl to send letters to 
exxon employees urging them to confidentially report any 
environmental problems at company facilities 
davis also asked rawl to go to alaska to inspect the damage 
caused by the exxon valdez spill in prince william sound which 
killed wildlife and fouled miles of coastline 
the meeting also was attended by paul quirk executive director 
of massachusetts pension fund board 
the pension funds of california massachusetts and new york city 
hold a combined 14 million exxon shares or slightly more than 1 
percent of the companys outstanding stock 
pension funds and other institutional investors with big 
stockholdings have become more active shareholders in recent years 
on environmental issues corporate takeovers and other matters 
exxon has to get off the dime has to make a clear commitment 
to environmental safety otherwise our beneficiaries will get the 
short end of the stick davis said 
exxon issued a statement after the meeting saying rawl had 
noted that shareholder returns have been excellent in the recent 
past despite 1989 
holtzman and davis said rawl told them he would respond to their 
suggestions before the companys april 25 annual meeting 
but the pension fund executives said they were concerned about 
the future 
exxon has many different kinds of operations and unless they 
identify other areas of environmental risk and correct them 
beforehand it could cause other disasters and could affect the 
company and our shares holtzman said in a telephone interview 
davis also interviewed by telephone said by setting aside 
revenue every time theres an accident exxon cant compete with 
the rest of the industry 
exxons stock has been largely flat in the year since the alaska 
spill it traded in the 45 range at the time of the accident the 
stock was down 62 cents to 4650 a share in late new york stock 
exchange trading wednesday 
the cleanup of the exxon valdez spill so far has cost the 
company nearly 3 billion exxon set aside 13 billion last year 
but the company still faces more than 170 civil suits brought by 
fishermen and others who claim they suffered losses because of the 
alaska spill 
exxon also has been indicted by the federal government on 
charges related to the spill that likely will increase the 
companys legal bills and could result in fines against exxon 
suits also are pending from the jan 1 heating oil spill in the 
arthur kill waterway between new york city and new jersey

the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged more 
than 1000 points this morning on rumors some small brokerages 
faced bankruptcy then regained most of its losses as large 
securities firms moved to support the market traders said 
the dollar ended sharply lower against the japanese yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average closed at 2824906 down 
19388 points or 068 percent it dropped to 2735400 at the end 
of morning session 108894 points or 383 percent below 
wednesdays close 
the nikkei index fell 31678 points on wednesday 
katsumi nishikido a trader with nippon kangyo kakumaru 
securities co attributed the indexs afternoon rebound to active 
buying by major securities firms to support the falling market 
he said that in early trading a lack of buy orders meant no 
prices could be put on about 100 stocks that have been the target 
of speculation or manipulation 
yasumasa shinagawa a trader with yamaichi securities co 
attributed this mornings plunge to reports of a collapse of 
speculator groups that were said to be in financial trouble 
local news reports confirmed by a broker who refused to be 
named said more than 30 minor brokerages had been left with 
massive losses by speculators who were unable or unwilling to pay 
for their buy orders the broker said his firm had been informed of 
the problem by stock exchange authorities 
some speculative issues inched up in the afternoon as other 
issues were bought back nishikido said but speculative issues 
have not hit bottom yet 
he said about 200 such speculative issues are listed on the 
tokyo stock exchange and about 70 are among the 225 issues in the 
nikkei index 
speculative issues can be easily identified by wild price 
movements unrelated to market trends nishikido added 
those speculative issues started plunging late in february 
and now they are doing terribly he said 
the price of kagoshima bank shares identified as one such 
issue ended at 860 points today down from almost 3000 points in 
early march 
a broker who requested anonymity said kagoshima bank shares 
had been manipulated by a tokyo hotel owner 
generally speculators remain behind the scenes in the market 
and some are generally thought to have close links to organized 
crime 
tokyo stock exchange executive kazuhiro nagakawa told reporters 
in a hastily called news conference after the morning session i 
would like to ask investors not to panic because of a series of 
speculations flying around the market 
an offiicial in the stock exchanges investigative arm said it 
had been watching the price fluctuations of such issues 
we have cautioned our member securities houses about this 
problem among other things he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
but he said the issue is basically a problem between 
securities firms and their customers we are trying not to make a 
big fuss about it if we did it might make the market 
performance even worse 
while major securities firms generally avoid speculators small 
securities firms are more likely to become involved with risky 
investors in order to increase their business 
takaaki okada spokesman for the securities dealers association 
of japan said he had heard of the reports but that the association 
had not confirmed any bankruptcies among securities houses 
we think the situation has not been serious enough to warrant 
any official measures or public announcement he said 
okada ruled out the possibility of bankruptcies of accredited 
japanese financial institutions because the finance ministry will 
offer take some actions by the time a company gets into trouble 
an official at the ministry also denied reports about 
bankruptcies and said it will take preventative measures to 
protect securities firms and banks 
masahiro umemori an analyst with nomura securities said the 
market already in a pessimistic mood overreacted to the news 
reports 
meanwhile on the foreign exchange market the dollar closed at 
15790 yen down 100 yen from wednesdays close of 15890 yen it 
opened at 15832 yen and ranged between 15745 yen and 15835 yen 
dealers attributed the yens recovery to growing sentiment that 
a correction is under way after the dollars surge to the 160yen 
level and to position adjustments before the weekend meeting of 
finance ministers from the group of seven industrialized nations in 
paris 
benchmark no 119 japanese government bonds ended trading at 
8655 points up from wednesdays close of 8645 their yield was 
7240 percent down from the previous days 7260 percent 
analysts said stability in the bond market was a positive sign

a federal judge has approved the sale of the 
beleaguered miniscribe corp to a california computer disk drive 
manufacturer for 46 million despite a higher offer from another 
firm 
us bankruptcy judge charles matheson late wednesday issued a 
court order approving the sale to maxtor corp of san jose calif 
following his receipt of maxtors outline of the financial and 
management details for miniscribe 
richard rifenburgh president of the longmont colobased 
miniscribe said maxtors operations provided the best complement 
to miniscribe of all the companies that expressed interest 
its the best possible situation for miniscribe employees 
he said 
maxtors bid to buy the firm included a commitment to retain 
miniscribes operations in longmont which was one reason its 
proposal was favored over an estimated 51 million bid from wearnes 
technology ltd which is based in singapore 
miniscribe filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us 
bankruptcy code jan 1 after failing to settle numerous lawsuits 
that alleged the companys past management committed fraud its 
debts total about 110 million 
last month company officials told matheson they were running 
out of money to keep plants operating and asked for the steppedup 
courtordered auction 
attorneys worked through the night on negotiations with maxtor 
wearnes and standard chartered bank of hong kong miniscribes lead 
lender 
before a courtroom packed with more than two dozen miniscribe 
employees and numerous lawyers attorney patrick a murphy detailed 
maxtors original 40 million bid consisting of 20 million in 
cash and 20 million in common stock 
the proposal covers substantially all of the assets of 
miniscribe including its subsidiaries in hong kong and singapore 
maxtor also planned to send managers to longmonts miniscribes 
office and put up 30 million in working capital between now and 
the proposed closing date july 1 
but murphy asked for a recess after hearing the terms of 
wearnes bid which included 465 million in cash plus about 45 
million in accounts receivable and cash in the two far east 
subsidiaries wearnes proposed a closing date in may 
maxtor returned with a 415 million offer plus the accounts 
receivables and cash in the far east subsidiaries 
gerald munitz attorney for standard chartered bank said the 
creditor supported maxtors bid because there was a greater 
certainty for employment in the longmont area 
george scalise maxtors president and chief executive officer 
said the proposal was based on the premise that miniscribe would 
remain open for business 
no decision has been made yet on whether there would be layoffs 
at the firm or whether maxtor would change miniscribes name he 
said in the interim miniscribe would be operated as a subsidiary 
for the most part it will remain a standalone operation 
he said this is such a tough task to take on if the doors had 
been closed we would have had to reassess it 
attorney glen keller said miniscribe received at least 111 
inquiries from companies interested in purchasing the disk drive 
manufacturer 
commenting on the unusual courtordered auction process 
matheson said he approved the step because it was clear that 
miniscribe would not have been able to continue operations without 
an infusion of cash 
richard yen president of wearnes operations in the united 
states said he was disappointed with the outcome but wouldnt 
challenge the courts decision

labor lawyer t timothy ryan jr is preparing 
to tackle what many consider the toughest financial job in the 
country regulator of the nations 2500 savings and loans 
with senate confirmation by an unexpectedly lopsided 6237 vote 
wednesday ryan takes over as director of the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervision seventeen democrats joined all 45 
republican senators in voting for him 
his fiveyear term likely will be the critical period in 
determining whether thrift associations survive as a separate 
industry they lost a record 19 billion last year 
after he is sworn in probably on monday ryan will be 
responsible for administering toughened financial standards enacted 
last august as part of president bushs savings and loan bailout 
he will decide which institutions stay in business and which are 
seized by the government 
democrats opposed to his nomination said the 44yearold 
attorney who has specialized in pension and employee benefit law 
is illprepared for the task because he lacks banking experience 
ryan was chief attorney for the labor department early in the 
reagan administration and worked in the presidential campaigns of 
bush and gerald r ford 
hes an outstanding lawyer as far as i know and an outstanding 
person said sen kent conrad dnd thats not the question 
this man has no experience in the financial services industry and 
this job is the biggest financial services job in the world 
ryans admission that he tried marijuana and cocaine 17 years 
ago as a law student figured little in the debate only ryan 
supporters raised the subject during the sixhour debate 
white house lobbyist tom korologos said the vote marked a 
turning point in the political treatment of youthful drug 
experimentation by government appointees 
its going to be difficult to make it an issue from now on 
he said 
after the vote several legislators took to the senate floor to 
condemn the leak of ryans confidential fbi report sen john c 
danforth rmo called on the senate ethics committee to 
investigate 
the administration lobbied hard for ryan with treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady making daily calls the administration 
portrayed him as an experienced manager who had authority over 600 
lawyers at the labor department and helped clean up irregularities 
in the teamsters unions central states pension fund 
i dont think you have to be a thrift insider to take the 
job of overseeing the savings and loan industry said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas lets face it its the 
insiders who got us where we are today drowning in a cesspool 
of unbridled greed and fiscal irresponsibility 
the victory margin was wider than both democrats and republicans 
predicted 
the white house has an awful lot of clout and they certainly 
used it said sen howard m metzenbaum dohio who opposed 
ryan the secretary of the treasury was working the halls of 
congress and working them well 
ryan in a statement released after the vote thanked brady and 
said i look forward to working closely with the congress in 
addressing the problems of the thrift industry 
the appointment removes a constitutional challenge to the 
administrations sampl bailout a federal judge ruled two weeks ago 
that the agencys officials lacked authority to seize failed 
institutions the decision was delayed by an appeals court but 
only until april 11 
in case ryan was defeated riegle had prepared legislation that 
would remove the basis of the legal challenge and allow president 
bush to appoint an acting director without challenge

shadow corporate america is showing off its best environmental 
face in a fiveday technology fair 
some environmentalists were hardly impressed as the fair opened 
wednesday on the national mall several members of greenpeace 
handcuffed themselves to a support pole near the du pont chemical 
co exhibit they were among 19 greenpeace members who were 
arrested for demonstrating without a permit according to the us 
park police 
corporate america has begun a campaign to paint themselves 
green said peter bahouth executive director of greenpeace usa 
a greenpeace banner proclaimed dont be fooled industry 
greenwash 
bahouth complained that while some of the exhibits by more than 
100 companies and trade associations might be environmentally 
beneficial many of the same companies are guilty of pollution and 
environmental neglect in other aspects of their businesses 
but organizers of the fair dubbed earth tech maintained that 
many of the exhibits demonstrate business interest in making 
environmental improvements 
i dont think that you can make anything these days without 
using energy or polluting the environment the question is how 
much said sen john heinz rpa cochairman of the fairs 
organizing committee 
the earth tech program was said by organizers to have cost about 
1 million mostly paid by exhibitors 
the participants included fortune 500 companies such as du pont 
and atampt but also some lesser knowns such as oil stop inc which 
says it has invented a new type of boom to capture oil spills the 
selfenergizing oil containment system 
its so compact said company official richard lazes that a 
5000foot spool could be put on a tanker and unwound within 
minutes that much boom would have surrounded the exxon valdez he 
said 
while several oil companies are excited about it theyve made 
no commitment yet he added 
producers of solar thermal and windgenerated energy were 
prominent as were companies in the rapidly growing industry of 
waste management and disposal and of course recycling 
some exhibits approached the exotic a solarpowered car that 
had traveled across the country a model of a wind plant to 
show that wind power already is generating millions of kilowatts of 
power in parts of california and the 18 electric bulb that lasts 
seven years wont break and uses onefourth of the energy than a 
conventional bulb 
thats equivalent to not burning 400 pounds of coal over the 
life of the bulb said steve waxman of philips lighting co the 
earth light isnt available in hardware stores yet but may soon 
be he said

a federal judge has ordered a union to cancel 
strike plans against conrail saying a walkout would greatly hurt 
the public and other railroads 
in granting a preliminary injunction wednesday to conrail us 
district judge franklin s van antwerpen said a strike by the 
brotherhood of maintenance of way employees would harm the public 
good 
because of the interconnected nature of the railroad 
business any stoppage on conrail inevitably affects other 
carriers including amtrak and the commuter rail operators van 
antwerpen wrote 
conrail provides freight service but its rails are used by the 
other railroad companies in the district of columbia canada and 15 
northeastern states 
in some states the judge wrote conrail is the largest freight 
carrier if the strike were to occur friday as planned he wrote 
the effect on the public good would be so great and so obvious 
that it needs no further elaboration 
he added that conrail will suffer substantial and irreparable 
injury if the strike occurred 
the union represents about 500 employees in eastern 
pennsylvania northern new jersey and new york state it has been 
negotiating with philadelphiabased conrail since 1988 
were disappointed with the decision said jed todd the 
unions general chairman for pennsylvania this has been going on 
since june 1 1988 thats why were a little aggravated 
he added that the union was still evaluating the judges ruling 
to determine the next step 
conrail spokeswoman pat linskey said the railroad company had no 
comment on the decision 
the dispute centers on wages hours benefits safety and job 
security the union represented by attorney john clarke jr 
argued that conrail has been bargaining in bad faith 
but the judge wrote wednesday that both sides appeared to be 
negotiating properly under the existing collective bargaining 
agreement

eastern airlines said it asked a bankruptcy judge 
to impose a new longterm contract on its pilots union because of 
an impasse in negotiations and cost reductions needed to emerge 
from bankruptcy 
the filing wednesday will at least provide a chance to air the 
unions dispute with miamibased eastern in court said ej breen 
spokesman for the air line pilots association 
at least it isnt a slam dunk breen said of the airlines 
contract request we go in and argue our case 
but the pilots union feared its members could end up with no 
contract at all he said the pilots have charged that frank 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp is out to 
break the union 
in announcing the filing eastern said it was frustrated that 
negotiations with the pilots union since the last permanent 
contract expired in july 1988 had not led to a new agreement 
despite federal mediation 
we are reluctantly forced to resort to the established 
bankruptcy process to resolve an otherwise intractable problem 
said thomas j matthews senior vice president of human resources 
and the companys chief labor negotiator 
the request came after the pilots union last weekend approved a 
fourmonth interim contract that included 25 percent pay cuts for 
working union pilots 
the interim contract retroactive to march 1 does not affect 
the salaries of pilots hired after easterns machinists pilots and 
flight attendants began their strike on march 4 1989 the jobs of 
the newly hired pilots are under court challenge from the pilots 
union 
the striking pilots and flight attendants ended their walkout in 
sympathy with the machinists in november eastern currently has 
some 1800 pilots 
matthews said the interim pact falls woefully short and 
claimed the carriers proposed contract is needed to pull eastern 
out of chapter 11 bankruptcy 
its a total package that would offer savings in excess of 50 
million a year said eastern spokesman robin matell it covers 
wages benefits working conditions and an emphasis on increased 
productivity 
the negotiations have been dragging out not going on 
matell said this way by going through the bankrupcty court it 
will be resolved in one way or another 
a sticking point in negotiations is the unions efforts to have 
union pilots hired back by eastern but the airlines has said it 
has no openings 
under the us bankruptcy code the court has up to 21 days to 
schedule a hearing and another 30 days to rule on easterns 
application 
easterns proposed longterm contract calls for 20 percent pay 
reductions for all pilots for the first six months of the 
agreement matell said the company would restore half the cuts in 
the following six months he said 
the pact also includes some temporary pension plan concessions 
and boosts pilots monthly flight hours from 52 to about 60

japan must redouble its efforts to meet the 
objectives of a 1986 agreement on increasing the foreign share of 
japans semiconductor market us trade officials said thursday 
were disappointed we think the progress thus far has been 
unsatisfactory a us trade official told reporters under rules 
of the briefing none of the officials may be identified 
the heat is on said another us official were looking 
for results across the board under the original agreement 
with 16 months left before the 1986 bilateral semiconductor 
agreement expires us officials say they want japan to increase 
efforts to help foreign chip producers boost their current 129 
percent share of the market to 20 percent by 1991 the united 
states contends this was agreed to in the pact 
japanese officials have said the 20 percent figure was merely a 
goal 
foreign chips which are mostly american held 86 percent of 
the japanese market at the time of the agreement 
the two countries completed a regular review of the pact 
wednesday 
the officials said most major japanese semiconductor users have 
adopted plans to increase their foreign share of chips a step they 
found encouraging but foreign manufacturers supply only 3 percent 
of the chips used in japanese consumer electronics products and 3 
percent to 5 percent of those used in japanese cars 
by contrast us producers supply 70 percent of the chips used 
in european autos the officials said 
they added that japans ministry of international trade and 
industry is candidly and sincerely working to put the agreement 
into practice 
under the agreement japan also pledged to stop unfair pricing 
of computer chips overseas called dumping us officials say 
japan has kept that promise 
during a regular review of the agreement which is held two or 
three times a year japan told the united states its efforts to buy 
more foreign semiconductors will suffer if washington charges that 
chips face trade barriers in japan under the super 301 clause 
of the us omnibus trade act 
the clause requires us trade officials to prepare an annual 
hit list of trade barriers faced by us products together 
with a deadline for a negotiated resolution aimed at getting the 
barriers eliminated that priority list is due april 30 if 
negotiations fail the united states can impose penalties 
the us government is considering placing semiconductors on the 
list in response to requests from american chip makers the us 
officials confirmed 
us semiconductor industry groups say their limited sales 
success in japan shows that restrictions exist against foreign 
chips while japanese companies have called for us suppliers to 
make greater sales and qualitycontrol efforts 
a japanese official said japanese companies were making serious 
efforts to buy more us semiconductors particularly for 
automobiles and electronic products

house negotiators worked on details of new 
clean air legislation today as the latest government air quality 
survey showed 121 million americans living in pollution exceeding 
federal health standards 
the environmental protection agency also said in its annual 
assessment of air quality that the urban smog problem became 15 
percent worse in 1988 compared to the year before partly because 
of an exceedingly hot summer that year is the latest for which 
data is available 
the survey showed 121 million people lived in areas in which air 
pollution exceeded the health standards for various pollutants 
including smog 
the agency statistics some of which had been reported 
previously as preliminary data showed emissions of sulfur dioxide 
and nitrogen dioxide both increased slightly while levels of carbon 
dioxide and dust or dirt declined somewhat 
the emissions are largely the product of automobile travel 
industrial releases or the burning of fossil fuels by electric 
power plants 
the report shows that over the past decade pollution levels have 
declined considerably but it also shows the magnitude of the air 
pollution problem still remaining said epa administrator william 
k reilly 
the epa released the annual report two days after the senate 
approved a comprehensive air pollution control bill and as members 
of the house energy and commerce committee continued closeddoor 
negotiations on clean air legislation the house talks lasted late 
into the evening wednesday 
some participants in the bargaining speaking privately said 
the matter was close to being resolved possibly today 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the committee has said 
he wants a final committee vote on the complex expensive and 
controversial clean air bill by the end of the week when congress 
goes on easter recess 
after the senate approved a sweeping air pollution control bill 
on tuesday the focus shifted to the house where the bill 
languished in dingells committee for months 
committee members have worked out compromise agreements on 
several provisions dealing with controls on urban smog but the 
thorny issue of acid rain controls was kept for last 
many midwest congressmen contend that a cost sharing 
arrangement must be worked out to help utilities in the region cut 
sulfur dioxide emissions from some of the countrys dirtiest 
coalfired electric plant 
according to committee sources rep philip sharp dind who 
has led the costsharing fight floated a revised proposal 
wednesday calling for a complex allocation of pollution 
allowances to help the midwest and utilities in other areas where 
there is fear that new pollution controls might inhibit future 
expansion 
both the house and senate bill call for broadranging emission 
controls on automobiles factories and electric power plants in an 
attempt to reduce pollution from acid rain urban smog and toxic 
industrial chemicals utilities would have to cut annual sulfur 
dioxide emissions nearly in half or by about 10 million tons by 
the year 2000 
neither industry nor environmentalists have been happy about the 
senate legislation approved 8911 on tuesday and each side has 
hoped to push for changes in the house bill 
the environmentalists have called for stronger smog controls 
than provided by the senate bill while industry has complained 
that requirements dealing with toxic chemical releases and acid 
rain are too tough

progress is being made in talks aimed at 
crafting an unprecedented deal to reform the basic economies of 
japan and the united states according to negotiators who hope to 
wrap up the four days of discussion today 
a leading congressional trade expert sen max baucus dmont 
told reporters that he understood the delay was caused by the 
complexity and number of details being reviewed and questions over 
the wording of the proposal 
baucus said he understood the discussions were close to ending 
with release of an interim report reviewing the progress so far 
both sides insisted that progress was still being made even 
though the discussions seeking to correct broad based structural 
barriers to trade have lasted two more days than originally planned 
baucus praised the japanese for being willing to make 
concessions but he said the real test of the agreement would be in 
its ability to actually reduce americas huge trade deficit with 
japan 
president bush had words of praise for the japanese as well 
marking a turnabout for the administration which until recently 
had been blasting japan for its intransigence on the trade issue 
us trade representative carla hills said the length of the 
discussions did not indicate any unexpected roadblocks but she did 
sound a warning wednesday about what could happen if the 
discussions did not succeed 
if the japanese do not open their second largest market in the 
world there will be enormous political pressure to restrict those 
trade opportunities that have given them so much she told an 
audience of american manufacturers it will kill the goose that 
laid their golden egg 
the talks are unprecedented in their scope because they aim not 
at boosting sales of specific products but at correcting broad 
barriers to trade in both countries 
the effort has prompted japanese critics to charge that the 
united states was trying to remake their nation and scrap centuries 
of tradition 
however the bush administration which began the discussions 
last july has maintained that its proposals would benefit japanese 
consumers by increasing competition and thus lowering retail 
prices currently among the highest in the industrial world 
bush met wednesday with nubuo matsunaga a special emissary from 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu and afterward the white 
house issued a statement praising kaifus role in bringing about a 
new spirit of cooperation 
in the past 10 days us and japanese negotiators have settled 
disputes involving sales of americanmade telecommunications 
equipment satellites and supercomputers 
baucus chairman of the senate trade subcommittee told 
reporters wednesday he was impressed by japans efforts 
i am willing to bury the hatchet with japan if japan is 
willing to open its markets he said congress is quite hopeful 
about the new attention given in japan to resolving trade issues 
the administration is facing a congressionally imposed deadline 
of april 30 to decide which countries to target under a second 
round of negotiations aimed at removing trade barriers 
the trade committee of the national association of manufacturers 
urged the administration wednesday to put japan on the trade hit 
list again regardless of the outcome of the current talks to 
keep pressure on kaifus government 
the japanese have outnegotiated us in the past by making 
promises where there is no followup said nam president jerry 
jasinowski 
negotiators involved in this weeks discussions were preparing 
an interim progress report outlining reforms each side is willing 
to make with a final report scheduled for early july 
among the changes expected to be offered on the japanese side 
were proposals to increase enforcement of antitrust laws boost 
spending for public works projects and relax restrictions on the 
establishment of large retail stores in japan 
on the us side the administration was not likely to agree to 
japans suggestions to boost us competitiveness by restricting 
americans use of credit cards hiking the gasoline tax and 
eliminating tax deductions for home mortgage payments 
however the administration was expected to point to efforts to 
provide expanded tax credits for personal savings improve the us 
education system and balance the federal budget

the senate agriculture committee voted today 
to substantially change the governments foreign food aid programs 
to better help the worlds hungriest people and encourage emerging 
democracies 
the legislation approved on voice vote would provide food 
grants to the poorest countries reorganize the food aid 
bureaucracy and allow the president more leeway in giving food to 
nations whose governments he wants to bolster 
the bill will be the agricultural trade portion or title of 
the 1990 farm bill that will go the senate floor the house 
agriculture committee has not acted on foreign trade 
this title makes the most dramatic change in american foreign 
food policy in a quarter of a century said committee chairman 
patrick leahy dvt who coauthored the measure with sen richard 
lugar of indiana the panels ranking republican 
ann veneman deputy undersecretary for international affairs and 
commodity programs said the committees staff worked with the bush 
administration to write the bill 
there are areas where we did not agree but nothing so major 
it cant be worked out she said after the committe voted 
the programs provided for in the bill would cost an estimated 
15 billion annually which would be paid directly from the budget 
and by money received from repayment of debts on previous food 
loans the amount is comparable to previous years 
leahy said the bill would make the governments international 
food aid system more reflective of the realities of today 
it also gives the united states powerful new weapons in 
providing critical food aid to emerging democracies in eastern 
europe central america and worldwide he said 
the legislation would establish a food for freedom program 
under which the president could donate food to countries trying to 
set up democracies and spend up to 100 million for agricultural 
necessities such as fertilizers and transportation 
poor countries least able to produce their own food would be 
eligible for food grants and forgiveness of debts incurred through 
previous food loans 
currently food is sold to poor countries at reduced interest 
rates over a 40year term but that only makes a bad debt situation 
worse for those countries leahy and lugar said 
about 12 billion is owed to the united states through 
agricultural programs lugar said we think we have an interest 
in part of that debt and would like in the case of the most 
desperate countries to offer some relief he said 
leahy said the debt forgiveness proposal is aimed at the 
droughtstricken countries of subsaharan africa 
sen chrstopher bond rmo said some parts of latin america 
also should be included in the grant and debt forgiveness plan but 
leahy responded theres only so much debt forgiveness we can do 
countries you are talking about have the ability to raise food 
the legislation makes food grants part of an ongoing policy for 
the first time previously food has been given away on an ad hoc 
basis or in emergencies said an aide to the senate committee 
leahy said the bill also would clean up mismanagement and 
bureaucratic red tape that frustrates the aid programs 
five agencies the agriculture state and treasury departments 
the office of management and budget and the agency for 
international development all now have a say in how food aid is 
distributed 
the bill would put aid in charge of the grant program and make 
usda responsible for the sales program aimed at developing new 
markets 
the agriculture committee accepted an amendment by sen bob 
kerrey dneb requiring the agriculture department to spend at 
least 900 million in fiscal 1991 on the export enhancement program 
and removing the ceiling that has existed on the program 
kerrey said the administration needed the provision to use in 
international trade talks against countries that heavily subsidize 
their own exports to the detriment of the free market 
under the program exporters are given bonuses that bring down 
the cost of us products to foreign countries usda decides which 
countries qualify for those sales

eastman kodak co was fined 1 million 
today after pleading guilty to two misdemeanor violations of state 
environmental laws 
kodak was charged with illegally disposing of contaminated soil 
in 1986 and of failing to report a leak of a toxic solvent for five 
days in 1987 
city judge herman j walz accepted the plea agreement but said 
he questioned the wisdom of granting kodak officials and directors 
immunity from prosecution 
the agreement lets people who have participated in criminal 
acts go unpunished walz said it is the opinion of the court 
that corporate officers and employees should also be prosecuted 
kodak was fined 997500 for its illegal handling of the 
contaminated soil assistant attorney general paul mccarthy said 
kodak hired an unauthorized company to haul away nearly 50000 
pounds of soil contaminated with silver 
the incident was one of a series of violations by kodak 
mccarthy said 
kodak was fined the maximum penalty of 2500 for failing to 
report a spill of 5100 gallons of methylene chloride until five 
days after it had been discoveredthe chemical is considered a 
probable human carcinogen by the environmental protection agency 
state officials were expected to announce later today an 
agreement that will require kodak to pay another 1 million to 
settle civil charges brought by the state department of 
environmental conservation 
the rochester democrat and chronicle reported that state 
officials also will announce a legally binding consent order 
requiring independent experts to conduct an environmental audit of 
kodaks chemical operations 
sources familiar with the terms of the order said kodak will pay 
for the study the newspaper reported the sources said the state 
environmental agency will insist the audit be performed by a 
consultant group with no close ties to kodak or the state 
the attorney generals office has been investigating kodaks 
contamination of ground water at its kodak park manufacturing 
facility for nearly two years 
a special grand jury has been looking into kodaks possible 
environmental violations since january it has subpoenaed more than 
80000 documents from the company

fewer us companies plan to increase their 
capital spending budgets this year compared with 1989 according to 
a national survey released thursday 
dun amp bradstreet corp said 41 percent of the 5000 companies it 
polled plan to spend more on capital projects in 1990 down from 46 
percent that planned bigger budgets last year 
despite the decline dun amp bradstreet economist and chief 
statistician joseph duncan said capital spending remains at 
relatively high levels 
while us firms are less ambitious they continue to increase 
investments to replace plant and equipment he said 
the survey which was conducted in december and january showed 
that 25 percent of the companies planned to cut capital spending 
this year while 35 percent said they would maintain spending at 
1989 levels 
among industries the service sector and the construction 
industry were particularly bullish about increasing spending 
fortyfive percent of the companies in both categories said they 
planned to spend more money this year than last 
larger companies are more likely to increase their capital 
spending annually according to the survey 50 percent of the 
companies with over 10000 employees will spend more while 37 
percent of those with fewer than 500 employees were planning 
increases 
smaller businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the 
business cycle particularly with respect to higher interest 
rates duncan said 
the survey was based on a sample of 5000 companies drawn from 
dun amp bradstreets database which includes information on more 
than 9 million us companies and was statistically representative 
of companies of all sizes in all industries

on wall street suzanne rinfret moore remembers working 12hour 
days and organizing her sons birthday party from a hotel phone 
while out of town on business 
the pressure selling government bonds to institutions was so 
intense that moore felt like i had to write a detailed memo about 
why i needed to leave for three hours to attend a school play 
after years of juggling moore quit her job at jp morgan 
securities co where she rose to vice president to form her own 
business she now works fewer and more flexible hours trying to 
help other wall streeters strike a similar balance between their 
roles as professionals and parents 
moore teamed with college chum karen strauss cook both 37 to 
form alternatrack inc a specialized search firm that matches top 
professionals in the financial services industry with parttime or 
temporary work 
working out of a midtown manhattan office its a kind of 
sophisticated kelly girl service for harvard mbas takeover lawyers 
and corporate accountants nearly 90 percent of alternatracks 
candidates are women 
moore and cook a mother of two who for a sixyear stretch was 
the only woman equity block trader at goldman sachs amp co had 
plenty of contacts to tap 
to confirm their hunch that women are hungry to cut back on 
grueling hours but are afraid to admit it to harddriving 
employers moore and cook sent hundreds of questionnaires to 
highlevel women in financial services companies 
the response was even more resounding than they anticipated 
within a few months they amassed a pool of more than 300 resumes 
mostly from women interested in everything from flexible time to 
jobsharing to contract work 
their research paralleled a wealth of data already available 
for example a poll of 1000 men and women conducted last year 
by the executive search firm robert half international inc showed 
78 percent would sacrifice rapid career advancement if it meant 
spending more time with their families 
the demand for the type of talent alternatrack offers also 
partly reflects the increased role women are playing in the 
american labor pool many employers are finding that to hire and 
retain the most talented they must offer flexibility 
labor department statistics show 576 percent of women age 20 
and older are in the workforce by the year 2000 475 percent of 
the workforce will be female vs 425 percent in 1980 and 381 
percent in 1970 says the hudson institute a research group that 
has studied american labor trends 
moore and cook launched a crusade to get employers to in cooks 
words retain the person during a critical few years when 
childrearing is at its most intensive 
if an intelligent employer could hold their hand theyll be 
back on track again cook said the retention of valued employees 
is worth more than a little inconvenience 
for example moore and cook said it costs about 150 percent of 
an employees annual salary to replace that employee 
besides the cost employees have been groomed they know 
the company vertically moore said and companies should realize 
that knowledge could take years to replace 
in addition to assembling a rich resume pool moore and cook are 
targeting corporations banks and financial firms from the fortune 
500 level on down so far however 60 percent of alternatracks 
business clients have called the firm unsolicited asking for a 
presentation of services and job candidates 
one major company weve talked to said it is losing three 
times as many women as men in the 3035 age category gutting its 
middle management ranks moore said 
but moore and cook arent robbing merrill lynch to pay shearson 
on the contrary most of the women they place come from large firms 
but are teamed up with much smaller firms that need top talent but 
cant pay top salaries on a fulltime basis 
one recent match put cynthia mcclintock a former associate in 
drexel burnham lambert incs corporate finance department at 
ampton bcs investments lp a merchant bank with fewer than a 
dozen employees 
the problem with a small service business like this is that 
you kill yourself by adding expensive staff said partner 
laurence strenger who selected mcclintock from five alternatrack 
candidates 
it would be imprudent if we started adding people at 
multihundredthousanddollar salaries he said here we have 
someone with a harvard mba on a piecework basis its marvelous 
strenger has called mcclintock to work on three more projects 
for mcclintock whose first child is due in june it meant getting 
a head start on parttime work that will make sense later on 
for their efforts moore and cook receive 30 percent of a placed 
applicants annual compensation it may not sound like much but 
the average woman in their pool is earning about 150000 a year 
that average candidate is about 35 years old has been on her 
job for about eight years and has between one and two children 
cook noted that its usually after the second child that women 
just give up on their jobs cook resigned from goldman sachs just 
before the market crash of 1987 when her youngest was 2 with a 
feeling of guilt that i was not giving as much to the firm and 
also not having enough time with my kids 
moore and cook arent sure how the recession at major investment 
houses will affect their business they know however that the 
pressures have multiplied fivefold on wall street moore said 
stressing working mothers even more 
this year they have placed five professionals and expect to 
place another five in the next few weeks three of whom will cover 
for women taking maternity leave from a major consumer products 
company when those women return alternatracks candidates are 
likely to share jobs with them 
by midyear moore said she expects to have placed up to 30 
professionals to keep pace alternatrack has hired a director and 
will open a los angeles office in june other sites under 
consideration are london and chicago but moore said theres no 
reason the company cant go nationwide 
despite the expansion moore says shell still have time to take 
an afternoon off to go play tennis with her 9yearold son and 
cook and can still go ice skating in manhattans central park with 
her boys

soybean futures closed slightly higher thursday 
on the chicago board of trade amid export speculation while grain 
futures finished mixed in a relatively quiet session 
soybean exports from brazil to europe have been slowed by 
confusion over economic reforms launched last month in the south 
american country prompting speculation that importers may turn to 
the united states to meet their needs 
in other export developments analysts said the soviet union is 
rumored to have bought recently as much as 1 million metric tons of 
corn 
they said some of those purchases may have been reflected in 
agriculture department announcements this week of a total of 
220000 metric tons of us corn sold to unknown destinations 
by law the usda must report export sales of at least 100000 
tons of grain 
joel karlin a grainmarket analyst with research department 
inc in chicago said the soviets may have made other purchases in 
amounts smaller than 100000 tons 
wheat futures fell slightly after three days of strong gains 
linked to fears of a weekend freeze in the us winter wheat region 
and concerns about tight deliverable supplies 
at the close of trading wheat futures were cent to 2 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in may at 369 a bushel corn 
was 1 cent lower to cent higher with may at 269 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cent lower with may at 152 a bushel soybeans 
were unchanged to 3 cents higher with may at 594 a bushel

stock speculators long a shadow force in the tokyo 
stock exchange have been hurt badly by the markets recent heavy 
plunges traders said thursday 
rumors that financially strapped speculators have in turn pushed 
small brokerages close to bankruptcy caused a temporary plunge of 
more than 1000 points thursday in the exchanges chief index 
one broker said more than 30 minor brokerages had been left with 
massive losses 190 million according to news reports by stock 
manipulators who were unable or unwilling to pay for their buy 
orders the broker who refused to be named said his firm had been 
informed of the problem by stock exchange authorities 
traders said the rumor sparked thursday mornings selloff in 
which the 225share nikkei stock average plunge more than 383 
percent from wednesdays close 
exchange officials later denied the bankruptcy rumor in an 
unusual quickly called news conference aided by support from large 
securities and investment trust firms the nikkei rebounded to 
finish the day down 19388 points or 068 percent at 2824906 
speculators in the tokyo stock exchange generally remain behind 
the scenes buying up shares of targeted companies to push up the 
price sometimes with the use of false rumors and then dumping 
them to make profits the number of such investors is unknown 
some of these speculators are believed to have close links with 
gangsters the daily yomiuri newspaper said thursday that japanese 
gangster syndicates have raked in huge profits by investing in 
stocks 
traders said many of the speculators were going broke because 
they had bought stocks using borrowed money repayable at high rates 
of interest 
some speculators have begun using a tactic called teppo or 
gun the placement of false buy orders for their own shares in an 
attempt to get rid of plunging stocks that nobody else wants to 
buy the speculators never intend to pay for the shares dealers 
say 
some securities companies have lost money by buying shares for 
imaginary figures without cash payment said hisao yasuda a 
trader with nikko securities co this could be the end of the 
speculators 
yasumasa shinagawa a trader with yamaichi securities co 
called the nikkeis early plunge thursday a sign that speculator 
groups were collapsing because of financial trouble stemming from 
the markets nearly 27 percent drop so far this year 
at the end of thursdays trading about 24 percent of the 
approximately 1160 issues on the stock exchanges first section 
still had no price quotations indicating that no trades had 
occurred during the day said nikkos yasuda 
he said many of the untraded issues had been manipulated by 
speculator groups 
issues that are the focus of speculators can be easily 
identified by wild price movements unrelated to market trends said 
katsumi nishikido a dealer with nippon kangyo kakuaru securities 
co 
traders say speculators have targeted about 200 issues listed on 
the first section of the exchange about 70 of which are among the 
nikkeis 225 issues 
the price of kagoshima bank shares identified as one such 
issue ended at 860 points thursday down from almost 3000 points 
in early march 
under japanese rules payment for stock orders is not due for 
four days as a result brokerages are vulnerable to losses from 
speculative excesses 
everybody remembers the black monday stock crash they all 
expected the market to rebound like it did then said one broker 
as a result the market rapidly became overbought he said 
ordinarily clients are given thorough initial credit checks 
but followups are rare the broker said 
traders said smaller unlicensed securities firms could go broke 
in the current market because they are more likely to be involved 
with risky investors whereas major securities firms generally 
avoid speculators 
a nomura securities official said major brokerage houses dont 
process buy orders from speculator groups unless they receive cash 
payment 
the big four securities companies nomura yamaichi daiwa 
and nikko are believed to control about 60 percent of the shares 
traded on the tokyo stock exchange 
of 272 securities firms with licenses from the finance ministry 
124 including 22 foreign firms are members of the exchange 
an official in the exchanges investigative arm said the 
issue is basically a problem between securities firms and their 
customers we are trying not to make a big fuss about it if we 
did it might make the market performance even worse 
takaaki okada spokesman for the securities dealers association 
of japan ruled out the possibility of bankruptcies of accredited 
japanese financial institutions because the finance ministry will 
offer to take some actions by the time a company gets into 
trouble

many in japans financial markets are not expecting 
much help for the falling yen from saturdays meeting in paris of 
the finance chiefs of seven advanced industrial nations 
in the past japans trading partners have worried about a cheap 
yen which makes japanese goods less expensive and more competitive 
abroad contributing to this nations huge trade surpluses 
now japan is concerned that the weaker yen is raising dangers 
of domestic inflation by making its imported fuel and raw materials 
cost more 
but analysts say japans partners in the group of seven are 
likely to do little more than state a general commitment to stable 
exchange rates 
while a lower dollar tends to make us goods more competitive 
against japanese products they add the united states has been 
concentrating recently on other approaches to narrowing its 49 
billion deficit in trade with japan to help fight its own 
inflation dangers they say the united states is happy with a 
strong dollar 
nobody except japan is worried about the weak yen said 
minori takeuchi of chemical bank 
west germany would prefer a strong mark ahead of currency 
union with east germany she added 
in addition to japan the united states and west germany the 
others in the group are britain france italy and canada 
just in case the meeting does decide on action to shore up the 
yen which has fallen about 10 percent this year tokyo market 
players have been reducing their dollar holdings in the last three 
days 
the dollar closed thursday at 15790 yen down more than two yen 
from its closing of 15995 yen on monday its highest in more than 
three years 
market players began to reduce their dollar holdings just in 
case the g7 meeting comes up with something they had not 
predicted although nothing special is expected at the moment 
mamoru tabata a dealer with mitsui taiyo kobe bank said wednesday 
on the other hand there has been speculation that the united 
states was declining to support the yen as part of attempts to 
pressure japan into making concessions in this weeks trade talks 
in washington 
in those talks ms takeuchi said the united states is pressing 
the japanese government to spend more on public works figuring 
that if the government spends more the united states can export 
more here 
japans central bank has been using interest rate increases to 
try to head off inflation and support the yen higher interest 
rates tend to make a nations currency more attractive although 
they also tend to discourage stock investment a problem for japan 
amid a stock market plunge of more than 25 percent so far this year 
in its latest move on march 20 the central bank raised its 
charge for loans to commercial banks by one percentage point to 
525 percent 
citing a possible reason for the group of seven to support the 
yen yoichi itoh chief corporate service officer at sumitomo trust 
and banking said i think the united states might judge that 
higher japanese interest rates might force us interest rates up 
and that some kind of currency stability will be necessary to stop 
japanese interest rates from rising further 
at the end of march the dollar rose 643 yen in nine trading 
days foreign exchange traders said the tokyo market was 
disappointed that japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimotos 
meeting with us treasury nicholas brady on march 23 had produced 
no tangible new measure to support the yen 
at a news briefing on tuesday hashimoto said the dramatic 
changes in europe rather than exchange rates would be the main 
focus of the group of seven meeting he said the meeting was not 
being held to draft policies to deal with the recent instability in 
japanese markets 
at a news conference last week yasushi mieno governor of the 
bank of japan said it was hard to understand why the yen was 
falling when japanese interest rates adjusted for inflation were 
higher than us interest rates and japan still was running large 
trade surpluses 
he suggested that tensions in the soviet union and developments 
in europe were boosting the dollar considered a safe haven 
currency

the upjohn co has received approval 
from the british government to begin pitching its antibaldness 
drug to women company officials said wednesday 
studies show that regaine sold as rogaine in the united states 
and canada is at least as effective in treating hair loss in women 
as in men upjohn officials said 
the 2 percent minoxidil solution is sold by prescription for men 
in 63 countries about 20 of them also have approved it for women 
upjohn is awaiting approval from the us food and drug 
administration to sell rogaine for women in the united states 
company spokeswoman laura harwin said the solution and 
application are the same for men and women the approval received 
tuesday just allows the company to broaden its marketing 
in the united states an estimated 30 million men and 20 million 
women experience hereditary hair loss the cause of hair thinning 
in men and women is often the same age heredity and the presence 
of the hormone testosterone harwin said 
the results differ however while many men eventually are left 
with a horseshoeshaped fringe of hair women usually see a general 
thinning over the top of the head 
marketing experts at upjohn estimate about 34 percent of women 
between the ages of 20 and 60 experience at least mild hair 
thinning 
though upjohn does not release sales figures for individual 
products analysts say the drug has been slow to catch on among men 
in the united states partly because of its mixed results it has 
been shown in testing to grow hair in about 39 percent of young men 
who are in the early stages of balding

americans often are accused of having lost the 
yankee love of thrift but the international monetary fund says 
people in some other countries are saving even less notably in 
prosperous northern europe 
it predicted that the trend will continue as the worlds 
population ages older people have less to save for 
the negative trend in national saving rates experienced by all 
the major industrial countries since the early to mid1970s has 
raised serious concerns about the prospects for strong and 
sustainable growth in the world economy said the latest issue of 
the imf survey dated march 19 it appears every two weeks 
the warning is based on a report by a team under bijan b 
aghelvi senior advisor in the funds research department at its 
headquarters in washington 
when people put money into their bank accounts the banks relend 
it to industry for building the factories that will produce more 
goods and jobs in the future if savings are too small industry 
has to borrow from other countries 
governments also save or more often dissave by going 
further into debt when a government spends more than it collects 
in taxes it has to borrow from the savings of its citizens or from 
other countries its taxpayers then have to pay interest on the 
debt 
the united states is a prime example on both counts americans 
of the future will have to pay interest to other countries on the 
billions being borrowed by americans today 
the most recent figures come from the organization for economic 
cooperation and development oecd in paris 
in 1988 the average american household saved only 440 out of 
every 100 left after it paid taxes but americans were not the 
greatest spendthrifts the average swedish household did not save 
at all it drew on past savings or went into debt at the rate of 
360 for every 100 it earned dissavings of 120 per 100 
were also reported from average norwegian families and 140 from 
those in finland 
dutch households saved only 2 of every 100 
of the major industrial countries the japanese were the top 
savers 1520 out of 100 even the thrifty japanese have loosened 
up in 1976 their figure was 2320 
the average west german family saved 1510 of every 100 in 
1975 and only 1260 in 1988 
another study sponsored by the fund warns that a countrys 
capital will be consumed unless money is set aside to replace it 
and more must be put aside as the population grows

the publisher of the dallas times herald 
testified wednesday that the paper lost thousands of readers and 
advertising strength when the rival dallas morning news struck a 
deal for 26 syndicated columns and comics that had appeared in the 
times herald for years 
publisher john buzzetta was the first witness in the times 
heralds 33 million antitrust suit against the dallas morning news 
over transfer of the universal press syndicate columns 
after the morning news parent company ah belo corp formed a 
joint venture with the kansas citybased syndicate last year ups 
canceled the times heralds contract for the features 
i was shocked buzzetta testified referring to the 
cancelation notice id never seen something like this happen 
here in one fell swoop i was going to lose some of the best 
features this newspaper had published for years and years i 
thought i was going to have some serious losses 
buzzetta tallied the circulation losses at 9000 to 10000 daily 
readers and more than 15000 on sunday 
the times herald had been posting increases in circulation 
before universal press canceled the features said buzzetta who 
bought the paper in 1988 
but afterward the paper began to lose loyal readers faithful 
to such features as dear abby erma bombeck and doonesbury which 
were moved to the morning news 
if you lose features it means you lose some really loyal 
readers and circulation goes down he said 
if circulation declines advertising follows he said the 
newspaper gets 90 percent of its revenue from advertising sales and 
10 percent from newspaper sales he said 
court documents indicate the morning news attracts 60 percent of 
the circulation and newspaper advertising in dallas 
buzzetta said a newspaper economist hired by the times herald 
quantified the damage of losing the features at 33 million 
the times herald also is seeking unspecified punitive damages 
from belo and the morning news 
in opening statements morning news attorneys maintained the 
times herald has made circulation gains since losing the features 
buzzetta said some of the circulation losses were recouped 
through special promotions particularly a lottery but he said the 
promotions have been expensive costing 15 million so far and 
do not have the same lasting power to attract and keep loyal 
readers that features have 
the times herald attorneys said they will try to prove the 
morning news conspired to lure the features from the times herald 
in hopes of destroying newspaper competition in the dallas market 
morning news lawyers however maintain it was just fair 
competition to purchase rights to the comics and columns 
the joint venture called universalbelo also is developing 
television shows based on syndicate comic characters 
the times herald has challenged that agreement in a pending 
request for the federal communications commission to revoke the 
license of belos wfaatv the toprated station in dallas

federal futures regulators on thursday took 
another step toward regulating groups of traders known as broker 
associations to prevent possible trading abuses like those 
uncovered in chicago last year 
the commodity futures trading commission voted unanimously 50 
to submit for public comment a proposed rule that would provide a 
legal definition of broker associations and require them to 
register with the exchange at which they do business 
broker associations have been loosely defined as formal or 
informal groups of futures traders formed to provide more capital 
to finance trades and more people to handle them 
but the cftcs division of trading and markets concluded in a 
study disclosed last january that broker associations may 
increase the potential for certain types of trading abuses 
the study was an outgrowth of an undercover investigation of 
trading at the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile 
exchange the nations two largest futures exchanges which 
resulted in the indictment of more than 40 traders 
only five of the 13 futures exchanges have rules defining broker 
associations and of those only three the chicago mercantile 
exchange the commodity exchange or comex and the coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange require broker associations to register 
cftc staffers believe and commission members agreed that 
keeping tabs on broker associations will help them deter abuses in 
the trading pits 
i believe very strongly that we identify and register these 
groups and i also agree that it gives a big assist and augmentation 
to our surveillance program to have this information said 
commissioner kalo a hineman 
in other matters the cftc which oversees the futures markets 
voted to seek public comment on a clarified commission 
interpretation of what types of hybrid financial products are 
exempt from cftc regulations 
hybrids contain elements of both futures contracts and 
securities the interpretation issued last year specifies what 
types of institutions and products are exempt from cftc regulation 
as defined in the cftcs proposed rule broker association 
refers to two or more exchange members who share responsibility 
for executing customer orders profits or losses from trading 
activities or access to each others unfilled customer orders 
the rule would bar participation in the trading activities of a 
broker association unless the association is registered with the 
market or exchange 
interested parties would have 60 days to comment on the proposed 
rule before the cftc takes a final vote on implementing it

avon products inc which late last month 
reached a truce with the investor group chartwell associates lp 
said thursday that chartwells recent additional purchases of its 
stock were inappropriate 
the avon board responded to chartwells stock purchases by 
voting thursday to amend the cosmetics companys share rights 
antitakeover plan the change essentially is meant to discourage 
chartwell from buying more avon stock 
the amendment lowers the threshold at which an element of the 
rights plan becomes effective it will apply when anyone acquires 
more than 125 percent of avons outstanding voting stock rather 
than 20 percent 
chartwell had said earlier in a filing to the securities and 
exchange commission that it raised its stake in avons common stock 
to 16 percent its holding of avons voting stock expanded to about 
12 percent 
the group which includes affiliates of mary kay corp oil heir 
gordon getty and the fisher real estate family of new york said it 
bought more than 345 million shares of avon common stock between 
march 27 and april 4 increasing its total holding to 905 million 
the partnership said it has spent more than 312 million from 
working capital to acquire its avon interest 
avon said in a letter to chartwell that the purchases could 
interfere with an agreement under which avon plans to nominate two 
chartwell candidates to its board at its annual meeting may 3 in 
return for the board seats chartwell had agreed to drop its proxy 
fight to win four seats on avons board of directors 
under the settlement the avon directors are establishing a 
committee to consider ways of boosting value for avon stockholders 
members of the special panel will be james e preston avons 
chairman and chief executive officer three incumbent members of 
the avon board and the two chartwell nominees 
the panel will examine alternatives to maximize value such as a 
recapitalization asset sales an outright sale of avon or a 
leveraged buyout 
preston said in the letter that the board is concerned 
chartwells new purchases will prejudice the ability of the 
special committee to consider all the alternatives in carrying 
out its assigned task 
in addition the board believes that such purchases will have 
adverse consequences on our operating businesses and could be 
unfair to other shareholders preston said 
the letter was sent to richard fisher a member of chartwell it 
was released by avons headquarters in new york

digital equipment corp announced thursday 
it has developed a new process to clean computer circuit boards 
that does not use chemicals believed to damage the earths ozone 
layer 
company officials making the announcement at digitals augusta 
plant where the process was developed said digital is making the 
technology available to other companies as a gesture of digitals 
environmental commitment the maynard massbased company the 
nations secondlargest computer maker after international business 
machines corp 
even before thursdays announcement some companies expressed 
interest in the new process augusta plant manager bob jackson told 
reporters and business representatives 
in the past digital like many computer makers used solvents 
containing chlorofluorocarbons to remove dirt and residues left by 
the manufacturing process from printed circuit boards the debris 
was removed through chemical reactions with the solvent but cfcs 
were released into the air when the solvent evaporated 
digital has developed a process in which minute droplets of 
water are sprayed on the circuit boards from rotating arms a key 
to the technology is a nozzle reducing the size of the droplets 
which are able to clean underneath components 
the circuit boards are washed with a light detergent then 
rinsed twice and blown dry 
the process is exceptionally simple said dana duncan an 
engineering supervisor and one of those who developed the 
technology 
equipment for the process has been installed at digital plants 
in augusta and hong kong and plants in singapore and taiwan are 
being retrofitted said mike hasty a process engineering manager 
who also worked on the technique 
digital is providing information on the new technology through 
the industry cooperative for ozone layer protection a joint 
venture between the federal environmental protection agency and 
industry the venture promotes worldwide reduction of 
chlorofluorocarbons 
digital said it has been working on the cfcreducing process for 
two years 
reduction of cfcs which are also used in refrigeration foam 
blowing and aerosols will aid in efforts to counter global 
warming known as the greenhouse effect scientists say cfcs 
are believed to break down the protective ozone layer surrounding 
the earth

b2 bomber builder northrop corp says two 
investment firms have purchased large amounts of its stock which 
has dropped from the 50pershare level in the mid1980s to 15 
the firm sanford c bernstein has acquired 81 percent of 
northrops 47 million common shares and delaware management co 63 
percent according to proxy material mailed to shareholders in 
advance of northrops annual meeting may 16 
it was unclear whether bernstein and delaware management were 
holding shares in trust bernstein has sole voting power over only 
half its 38 million shares and delaware management over only 13 
million shares of its 29 million shares the proxy said 
the aerospace company has been considered vulnerable to takeover 
because of its depressed stock price although analysts said a 
buyout would be complicated because insiders hold large blocks of 
stock 
the holdings would make it very hard for any outsider to mount 
an unfriendly takeover said wolfgang demisch the head of 
research for ubs securities in new york 
northrop finished at 15 a share wednesday on the new york stock 
exchange unchanged from tuesdays close 
at that price the 47 million common shares could be purchased 
for 705 million a bit more than the 530 million pricetag for a

petroleum futures prices fell sharply thursday on the new york 
mercantile exchange dropping for the third straight day amid 
perceptions that gasoline and crude oil supplies are outstripping 
demand 
on other commodity markets soybeans surged while grains were 
mixed copper futures fell precious metals retreated and 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures settled 26 cents to 43 
cents lower with the contract for delivery in may at 1943 a 
barrel heating oil was 71 cent to 116 cents lower with may at 
5331 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 105 cents to 171 
cents lower with may at 6329 cents a gallon 
analysts said there was no change in supplyanddemand factors 
thursday to account for the selloff but traders have turned 
increasingly bearish amid signs of a rising crude oil production 
and steady stockpiling of gasoline 
indications of apparently strong gasoline demand helped support 
the petroleum markets last month but some analysts now believe the 
market misinterpreted the signals 
it appears to me that some of the strong demand of the past 
couple of weeks was simply some inventory building said jim 
ritterbusch energy analyst with painewebber inc in chicago 
with many refineries now gearing up to increase gasoline 
production for the summer driving season he said we could be 
flooding the market with gasoline a month or two down the road 
ritterbusch said opec crude oil production is approaching an 
eightyear high which is one of the factors that caused crude oil 
for nearterm delivery to slip below 20 a barrel wednesday most 
market experts foresee steady or falling crude prices through the 
spring 
soybean futures surged into the close of trading on the chicago 
board of trade amid expectations for new export sales while grain 
futures finished mixed 
soybean exports from brazil to europe have been slowed by 
confusion over economic reforms launched last month in the south 
american country prompting speculation that importers may turn to 
the united states to meet their needs 
in other export developments analysts said the soviet union is 
rumored to have bought as much as 1 million metric tons of corn 
recently they said some of those purchases may have been reflected 
in agriculture department announcements this week of a total of 
221000 metric tons of us corn sold to unknown destinations 
wheat futures settled cent lower to cent higher with may at 
370 a bushel corn was cent lower to 2 cents higher with may at 
270 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with may 
at 152 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with 
may at 596 a bushel 
copper futures extended their losses on new yorks commodity 
exchange despite reports from peru indicating a 25dayold strike 
against the southern peru copper corp had not been settled 
news reports on wednesday said the strike was over but those 
accounts were later denied by the government and the company which 
said it was still in the process of presenting a proposal to 
workers 
copper futures finished 155 cents lower to 05 cent higher with 
april at 12195 a pound 
gold and silver futures fell on the commodity exchange in 
profittaking after two days of gains 
gold settled 220 to 250 lower with april at 37480 a troy 
ounce silver was 19 cents to 22 cents lower with april at 5141 
a troy ounce 
cattle futures rallied strongly late in the session on the 
chicago mercantile exchange on reports of higher prices paid for 
steers in western kansas and light sales of fed cattle pork 
futures finished mixed in lackluster trading 
live cattle were 25 cent to 62 cent higher with april at 7895 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 67 cent higher with 
april at 8280 cents a pound live hogs were 22 cent lower to 20 
cent higher with april at 5485 cents a pound frozen pork bellies

speculation mounted thursday that ual corps 
board of directors was close to accepting an employee buyout offer 
that reportedly had been sweetened to more than 200 a share 
the board met thursday in chicago uals headquarters city amid 
reports that the three united airlines union groups seeking to buy 
the carriers parent company had raised their bid from an estimated 
185 a share or about 4 billion to an offer valued at 200 to 
210 or at least 436 billion 
the board is believed to be seeking at least 200 a share the 
directors have been negotiating with unions representing uniteds 
pilots machinists and flight attendants in the two weeks since it 
rejected their 185ashare offer 
the board was still meeting late thursday night according to a 
source close to the meeting no other details were immediately 
available 
the board met at least twice by telephone earlier this week 
a wall street takeover speculator and a source close to the 
union group cautioned thursday that an agreement by the board to 
accept the employee offer would not necessarily mean a deal would 
be concluded quickly or even concluded at all 
the wall street journal reported on thursday that the union 
group had sweetened its offer by adding a proposed sale of uniteds 
50 percent stake in its coviaapollo computerized reservation 
system valued at 500 million or more 
uals stock fell 1 a share to 16550 thursday on the new york 
stock exchange 
the takeover speculator who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said demand for uals stock has been blunted by concerns about the 
difficulty the union group may face in financing the deal and about 
the time it would take to complete a deal even if the board accepts 
the union offer 
you have to be very concerned with the time frame he said 
the union group which represents about twothirds of uals 
employees proposed on march 19 the 185ashare buyout which 
would give uals entire workforce 75 percent ownership of the 
countrys secondlargest airline 
the bid is supported by uals largest shareholder coniston 
partners which holds an 118 percent stake unless the board sells 
to the union group coniston says it will wage a proxy fight to 
oust uals board at the companys april 26 shareholders meeting 
the bid is reportedly opposed strongly by ual chairman stephen 
wolf who likely would be dumped if the workers gain control of the 
company

the house energy and commerce committee 
overwhelmingly approved a farranging air pollution control bill 
late thursday after resolving a dispute on how to deal with midwest 
concerns over acid rain controls 
the measure now goes to the house floor where it is likely to 
come up for debate early next month 
the committee cleared the legislation by a vote of 421 rep 
william e dannemeyer rcalif was the sole dissenter 
rep john dingell dmich the committee chairman called the 
bill significantly better in protecting the environment than a 
version approved by the senate earlier in the week 
the committee moved swiftly to approve the legislation after 
giving the nod to a compromise agreement aimed at easing concerns 
from midwest congressmen over the high cost of acid rain controls 
the acid rain compromise worked out during three days of 
closeddoor negotiations among committee members and staff was 
approved by a 394 vote erasing the last major roadblock to 
committee passage of the bill 
the process has been rather curious said dingell alluding 
to the lengthy private negotiations that eased the committee 
through several obstacles 
we have negotiated rather than fought and it has worked 
he said 
the lopsided committee vote following senate approval of its own 
clean air bill by an 8911 margin earlier in the week put clean air 
legislation on track for congressional approval this year 
both bills call for sweeping emission controls on factories 
automobiles and electric power plants by the end of the decade the 
bush administration has estimated the senate legislation would cost 
215 billion to the economy yearly when all provisions go into 
effect the house bill has been said to be slightly cheaper 
house speaker tom foley dwash had indicated that he wanted 
to begin floor action on the legislation in early may final 
legislation would have to be worked out in a conference committee 
because of differences between the house and senate bills 
this legislation is long overdue its a real victory for 
our lakes lungs and resources said rep gerry sikorski dminn 
the acid rain issue had dominated the three days of closeddoor 
bargaining among members of dingells committee as members and 
staff worked under a deadline to try to complete action on the 
entire bill before congress departs for its easter recess friday 
earlier the committee had reached a consensus on provisions 
dealing with curbing urban smog and controlling toxic industrial 
releases 
a lot of blood was spilled in these debates said rep jim 
cooper dtenn who vigorously opposed a cost sharing provision to 
help the midwest 
but the compromise received coopers support as well as that of 
all but four of the committee members all from texas reps ralph 
hall and john bryan both democrats and jack fields and joe 
barton both republicans 
as a way to help midwest states pay for cleaning up dirty 
utility plants the measure included a pollution allowance 
system and a 1year extension for initial compliance under some 
circumstances 
it allows us to recoup some costs said rep michael oxley 
rohio 
nevertheless oxley said this is a tough tough bill for my 
part of the country and were going to feel it for a long time 
critics of the measure have said it would cause electric rates to 
jump 
more than 150 lobbyists representing everything from 
environmental groups to the steel industry gathered outside the 
house hearing room were the negotiations were being held awaiting 
word of an agreement 
the clean air legislation is aimed at imposing steep pollution 
controls on a broad range of industry automobiles and coalfired 
electric power plants to curb emissions of acid rain smog and 
toxic chemicals 
earlier in the day the environmental protection agency released 
a new annual report that showed as had previous reports that 
federal air pollution laws are failing to ensure healthy air in 
more than 100 cities across the country 
according to the epa survey which reported results on six 
pollutants during 1988 more than 121 million people lived in areas 
where the air did not meet federal health standards 
the epa assessment said the urban smog problem became 15 percent 
worse in 1988 compared with the year before in part because of an 
exceedingly hot summer and levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
dioxide increased slightly 
levels of carbon dioxide and dust or dirt declined somewhat 
the emissions are largely the product of automobile travel 
industrial releases or the burning of fossil fuels by electric 
power plants 
the report shows the magnitude of the air pollution problem 
still remaining said epa administrator william k reilly adding 
that it reinforces the need for new tougher air pollution controls 
the senates approval of a clean air bill tuesday was the first 
time either the house or senate has passed tighter air pollution 
legislation since 1977 
emotional regional disputes have blocked progress on a bill for 
years usually because of the high cost of reducing sulfur dioxide 
emissions from power plants 
while most members of congress as well as the bush 
administration agree on a required 10 million ton reduction in 
annual sulfur dioxide emissions to curb acid rain the dispute has 
focused on how much of a burden should be carried by the midwest 
where some of the dirtiest plants are located
